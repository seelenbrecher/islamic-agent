        "question": "Do You Get Reward for Listening to the Quran Without Understanding It?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The command to listen to the Quran attentively \nAllah, may He be exalted, has commanded the believers to listen to the Quran attentively , in a general command. He says (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy.” [Al-A`raf 7:204] \nShaykh As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“This command is general and includes everyone who hears the Book of Allah being recited. He is enjoined to listen to it and keep quiet. The difference between listening and keeping quiet is that keeping quiet is done outwardly by not speaking or being distracted with anything that would keep one from focusing on listening to it. \nAs for listening to it, this means that one hears it with an attentive heart, pondering the meaning of what one is listening to. The one who adheres to these two commands when the Book of Allah is recited will attain a great deal of good, beneficial knowledge, ongoing and renewed faith, increased guidance and insight into his religion. Hence Allah connected the attainment of mercy to them, which indicates that the one who does not keep quiet and listen attentively when the Book is recited to him will be deprived of the share of mercy and has missed out on a great deal of good. \nThe most emphatic command with regard to listening to the Quran attentively has to do with prayers in which Quran is recited out loud by the imam , in which one is enjoined to listen attentively, to such an extent that most of the scholars say that his focusing on keeping quiet and listening attentively takes priority over his reciting Al-Fatihah etc.” (Tafsir As-Sa`di, 314) \nThe greater aim of keeping quiet and listening attentively is so that the listener may ponder and understand the meanings, and act upon them. \nImam At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“Allah says to those who believe in Him and in His Book, for whom the Quran is guidance and mercy: “So, when the Quran is recited”, to you, O believers; “listen to it”, i.e. lend your ears so that you might understand its verses and learn from its exhortation; “and be silent” and listen to it attentively, so that you might understand and ponder, and do not utter idle talk during it lest you do not understand; “that you may receive mercy” i.e., that you might receive the mercy of your Lord by heeding His exhortation and adhering to His limits and to what He enjoins upon you in the verses.” (Tafsir At-Tabari, 13/244) \nIf a person manages to achieve that, i.e., keeping quiet, listening attentively, pondering what is recited to him and understanding its meanings, that will bring him goodness in this world and the Hereafter. \nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“By means of this listening, Allah guides His slaves and sets straight their affairs in this world and the Hereafter; with this the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent, and he enjoined it upon the Muhajirin and Ansar and those who followed them in truth. The early generations used to gather for this purpose. When the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gathered together, they would tell one of their number to recite whilst they listened. `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) would say to Abu Musa: Remind us of our Lord, and Abu Musa would recite the Quran whilst they listened.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 11/626) \nDo you get reward for listening to Quran without understanding it?\nAs listening in the complete sense is that in which one understands and ponders, there is no doubt that the one who does that as much as he is able is to be commended for what he does, and he is excused for what he is incapable of. But what one is incapable of should not be an excuse for not doing what one is able to do of goodness. What is possible is not to be omitted because of what is difficult; in other words, whatever a person is able to do of obligatory or recommended actions is not waived because of what he is incapable of doing, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can” [At-Taghabun 64:16]  \nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \nWill a person be rewarded if he reads the Quran, even if he does not understand its meanings? \nHe replied: \n“The Glorious Quran is blessed, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.” [Sad 38:29] \nSo man is enjoined to read it, whether he understands its meanings or not. But the believer who is enjoined to act upon it should not read the Quran without understanding its meanings. If a person wants to learn medicine, for example, and studies the books of medicine, he cannot benefit from them unless he understands their meanings and they are explained to him; in fact he will be very keen to understand the meanings so that he can apply them. So why do you think anyone should read the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, which is a healing for what is in the hearts and exhortation to people, without pondering and without understanding its meanings? For this reason the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would not move on from ten verses until they had learned them and learned the knowledge they contained and how to act upon it. So they learned the Quran and knowledge and action all together. \nA person will be rewarded for reading the Quran whether he understands its meanings or not, but he should be very keen to understand its meanings and to learn these meanings from scholars who are trustworthy in their knowledge. If he has no access to a scholar who can teach him the meanings, he may refer to the trustworthy books of Tafsir, such as Tafsir Ibn Jarir, Tafsir Ibn Kathir and others which pay attention to the Tafsir that is based on reports narrated from the Companions and the Successors (may Allah be pleased with them).” (Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb) \nFor more details, please see the following answers: 106961 , 50010 , 124657 , 78370 , 174743 , 10672 , and 147164 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether one gets rewarded for listening to the Quran without understanding it is an interesting topic and has been discussed among scholars and within Islamic teachings. While the verses you've provided offer insights into the importance of the Quran, they do not directly address the specific point about the rewards for listening without understanding. However, they do highlight the significance of the Quran, the necessity of reflection, and the condition of the heart regarding faith and understanding.\n\n### Understanding the Concept of Reward in Islam\n\n1. **Listening to the Quran**:\n   - Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206) states that when the Quran is recited, believers should listen to it in silence and reflect. This implies that listening to the Quran is a form of worship, and it can lead to blessings: \n     > \"When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.\" (Surah Al-A'raf, 7:204)\n\n2. **The Impact of Understanding**:\n   - Surah Al-Isra (17:44) emphasizes the importance of understanding, as it mentions a hidden veil for those who do not believe:\n     > \"There is nothing that does not chant His praises, but you do not understand their hymns of praise.\" (Surah Al-Isra, 17:44)\n\n3. **Reward for Good Actions**:\n   - Surah Al-Qasas (28:84) points out that those who do good will receive better than what they have done, reinforcing the notion that all actions, including listening to the Quran, can be rewarded:\n     > \"Whoever does good will receive better than what he has done...\" (Surah Al-Qasas, 28:84)\n\n4. **Reflection and Piety**:\n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:262) suggests that the essence of such actions lies in the intention behind them, indicating that the effort to engage with the Quran, even without full comprehension, is still valued:\n     > \"Those who spend in the way of God... will get their reward from their Lord.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:262)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, **listening to the Quran can indeed lead to reward**, even if one does not fully understand the language or the content, especially if it is accompanied by a sincere intention. The important aspect is the act of engaging with the Quran: listening respectfully, reflecting on its meaning, and allowing it to become part of one's spiritual life.\n\nWhile comprehension enhances the experience and the potential for deeper understanding and application, the act of listening itself is a valued practice in Islam. It opens the door for eventual understanding and, thus, spiritual growth. **For ultimate clarity, it is always encouraged to study further, seek understanding, and reflect upon the teachings of the Quran.**"

        "question": "Can repeating a certain portion of the Quran for a time equivalent to completing the entire Quran be regarded as a khatm?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: We congratulate you on what you are doing of good by constantly reciting Quran, and you should carry on with that, because the religious texts speak of the great virtue of doing that.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites a letter of the Book of Allah will have one good deed recorded for him, and the good deed brings a tenfold reward. I do not say that alif-lam-mim is a letter; rather alif is a letter, lam is a letter and mim is a letter.” At-Tirmidhi (2910); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nThis reward is attained by everyone who reads or recites any surah of the Quran, whether he recites it as part of a khatm in the correct order, or in his prayer, or in any kind of recitation, without paying attention to any particular khatm.\nBut repeating what you have memorized from al-Baqarah to al-An‘am is not regarded as a real khatm of the Quran, even though you will attain reward for reciting Quran. So strive to recite what you recite well from memory, then complete the rest by reading from the Mushaf.\nThe practice of the early generations (the salaf) was to complete the entire Quran, then go back to the beginning and start again, and so on.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is disliked (makruh) to take too long in completing the Quran and to take more than forty days to complete it.\nAhmad said: What I mostly heard is that the Quran should be completed within forty days.\nThat is because taking longer than that will lead to forgetting the Quran and becoming negligent about it. Therefore what we have mentioned is more appropriate.\nThis applies if there is no excuse. If there is an excuse, then the matter is flexible.  End quote from al-Mughni (2/611).\nSecondly: you should understand that the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He has told us the timeframe for completing the Quran, and one should not go beyond that.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Read the Quran in a month.” I said: I can do more than that… Until he said: “Read it in seven days, and do not do more than that.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4767).\nHe also forbade them to complete it in less than three days. It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who reads the Quran in less than three days will not understand it.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1394); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the longest timeframe for completing the Quran?\nHe replied: There is no set timeframe for that, and the best one can do in that regard is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained to ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As when he asked him about how to read the Quran. ‘Abdullah told him that he completed the Quran every day and fasted all the time, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to fast and not fast, and to sleep and pray qiyam, and to complete the Quran every month. He said: “Your own self has a right over you, your wife has a right over you, and your guest has a right over you, so give each of them his or her due.” ‘Abdullah asked for more, and in the end, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to read it in a week, as he said: “Read it every week,” meaning every seven days.\nSo the best timeframe to complete the Quran is seven days, and if a person takes longer to do it, there is nothing wrong with that. So it may be completed in a month, or in twenty days, or more than that. The minimum time frame for completing it is three days, as it says in the hadith “The one who reads the Quran in less than three days will not understand it,” or however the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it. End quote from the Shaykh’s website.\nWe have previously given a detailed answer regarding this matter; please see question no. 156299.\nThirdly:\nCompleting 8 juz’ in an hour and a half means that each juz’ is completed in 11 minutes, which is a very short time to recite an entire juz’ of the Quran. It is barely possible for a person to recite in a proper manner in this time, and to recite it as it should be recited, let alone understand what he is reciting and reflect on it.\nThe early generations disallowed reciting Quran quickly, if that will lead to mispronouncing the words or will not give any opportunity for reflection. It was narrated that Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Do not recite the Quran rapidly as you recite poetry, and do not utter its words carelessly in the manner of handling poor quality dates. Rather, pause to reflect on its wonders and let your heart be moved by it. The main focus of one of you should not be merely to reach the end of the surah. Al-Bayhaqi: Shu‘ab al-Iman (1883).\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: There was a time in our lives when one of us would learn about faith before learning about the Quran, and a surah would be revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he would learn what it permitted and what it prohibited, and where one should pause to reflect and understand, as you learn the Quran. Then he said: I have seen some men, one of whom starts to recite Quran, and he recites it from al-Fatihah to the end without realising what it enjoins and what it prohibits, or where he should pause and reflect, and the way in which he recites it is (careless) like one who is handling poor quality dates. Narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (1/35); he said: It is a sahih hadith according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim, and I am not aware of any problem with the hadith. And adh-Dhahabi agreed with him.\nReciting the Quran with speed is described by the scholars as qira’at al-hadr.\nOne of the conditions of qira’at al-hadr is that it should not lead to mispronunciation. Qira’at al-hadr means reciting one word after another in rapid succession, whilst paying attention to grammar and the correct pronunciation, and pronouncing the letters clearly. See: al-Itqan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran (1/345).\nReciting a juz’ in ten minutes does not allow one to pronounce words correctly or pay attention to grammar; rather it is reciting at such speed that it is not possible to follow the meaning.\nWhat was narrated from ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), that he recited the entire Quran in a rak‘ah, is not a precedent to be followed by others; rather it is something unique to ‘Uthman. We are not like him, and what he was enabled to do is something that we cannot be enabled to do. If it is said that this is a karamah (miracle or extraordinary feat) with which he was honoured, that would not be far-fetched, but most of the Sahabah used to recite the Quran in seven days.\nAl-Hafiz al-‘Iraqi said: The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to complete the Quran every seven days… Among those who completed it every seven days were: Tamim ad-Dari, ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Yazid, Ibrahim an-Nakha‘i, ‘Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, Abu Mijlaz, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and the wife of Ibn Mas‘ud. Masruq regarded that as something good. Among those who would complete it in eight days were Ubay and Abu Qilabah. Among those who would complete it in six days was al-Aswad ibn Yazid. Among those who would complete it in five days was ‘Ilqimah ibn Qays. Among those who would complete it in three days was Ibn Mas‘ud. And he said that the one who recites it in less than three days is reciting at speed. End quote from Tarh at-Tathrib fi Sharh at-Taqrib (3/102).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The concept of \"khatm\" (often understood as completing the Quran) traditionally refers to reciting or completing the entire Quran in one go or over a specified period. However, the interpretation of whether repeating a certain portion of the Quran can qualify as a khatm depends on several factors, particularly intent and the effort put into worship.\n\n**1. Repetition of Portions of the Quran:**\n\nIn discussing whether repeating a specific section of the Quran for a time equivalent to completing the entire Quran can be regarded as a khatm, the idea centers on the importance of sincerity and intention in worship. The Quran encourages believers to recite as much as they can and to do so within their capacity (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20):\n\n- **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**: “So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily.”  \n  (Sura Al-Muzzammil, Ayah 20)\n\nThis verse indicates that flexibility exists in how one approaches the recitation of the Quran. It suggests that God considers the efforts and circumstances of the reciter—be they travel, illness, or other factors—and encourages recitation to be done to the best of one’s ability.\n\n**2. Intent and Effort:**\n\nThe essence of khatm lies not just in the act of completing the text, but in fulfilling the spiritual objectives of understanding, internalizing, and connecting with the divine message. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of reciting with reflection and intention. \n\nThe recitation done with the intention to please God and seek closeness with Him is what truly counts. This is reinforced in Surah Al-Furqan, where it is stated that the Quran was revealed gradually to strengthen the Prophet's heart:\n\n- **Surah Al-Furqan (25:32)**: \"And those who say, 'Why has a surah not been sent down upon him all at once?' But thus, [We send it] that We may make firm your heart thereby...\"  \n  (Sura Al-Furqan, Ayah 32)\n\nThis gradual approach mirrors the understanding that the Quran can be engaged with over time in various forms, including through repetition and reflection.\n\n**3. Spiritual Rewards:**\n\nThe Quran also articulates outcomes based on one's actions and intentions. Just as reciting the entirety of the Quran carries significant rewards, repeating certain portions while investing one’s heart and mind in those verses can also lead to immense spiritual benefits:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:261)**: \"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed of grain that sprouts into seven ears; in every ear is a hundred grains...\"  \n  (Sura Al-Baqarah, Ayah 261)\n\nThis indicates that the sincerity of one’s effort, regardless of quantitative completion, can lead to exponential spiritual rewards.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, if a person chooses to repeatedly recite a specific portion of the Quran with the intent of worship, reflection, and connection to God, it holds merit and can be seen as a form of khatm, even if it does not involve completing the entire text in one sitting. The key components are sincerity, understanding, and intention behind the recitation, as highlighted in the verses mentioned above. Therefore, while traditional views may define khatm narrowly, a broader, more inclusive interpretation recognizes the value in all forms of recitation, especially when approached with the right heart and intention."

        "question": "Miraculous Language of the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Noble Quran is a sign from Allah, the Exalted and Praised, and Allah has placed within it many signs of truth. Among the signs of its truthfulness and proofs that it is from Allah, the Exalted, are the unique phonetic properties not found in any other text. Indeed, the Quran contains phonetic styles that are unmatched elsewhere.\nDr. Muhammad Daraz says, \"Let the proficient reciter read the Quran; recite it properly, descending upon the inclination of the Quran, and not imposing his own inclinations upon it. Then distance yourself from him to a remote place where you do not hear the ringing of its letters, but you hear its movements and stillness, its elongations and melodies, its connections and pauses, then lend your ear to this phonetic collection, made exclusive and released plainly into the air. You will find yourself facing a strange and wonderful melody; you will not find it in any other speech even if it were rendered exclusive and refined in this manner.\nYou will find a harmony and unity that captivates your hearing as music and poetry do, yet it is not the tunes of music, nor the patterns of rhythm of poetry, and you will find something else that you do not find in music or poetry. That is because you listen to a poem and find its rhythm unified line by line, and part by part, and you listen to a piece of music and find its moods similar and going in a close direction; so your hearing soon rejects it, and your nature tires of it, if it is repeated and recited to you with one signature.\nWhereas with the Quran, you are always in a varied and renewed melody, moving between causes and pegs and pauses in different positions, each string of your heart's chords taking an equal share, so that no matter how often it is repeated, it does not bring you boredom or weariness, but you constantly seek more of it,\" End quote.\n\"An-Naba' Al-Adhim\" (p. 133 - 134).\nHe also mentioned the beauty of the articulation points of the letters, saying, \"If you bring your ear a little closer, the jewels of its letters coming out from their correct articulation points will strike your hearing, surprising you with another pleasure in the arrangement of those letters and their lining up, and the ordering of their positions among themselves; this one taps and that one whistles, a third whispers and a fourth declares loudly, another lets the breath slide over it, and another holds the breath. And so on, you see the linguistic beauty manifest before you in a different yet harmonious collection, without rattling or babbling, without softness or harshness, without discord or repulsion.\nThus, you see speech that is neither the bland urban nor the rough Bedouin, but you see it having blended within it the robustness and grandeur of the desert with the delicacy and fluidity of the city, and the matter is measured in such a way that neither exceeds the other. It is as if it is the essence of the two languages, and their progeny, or as if it is the point of contact between the tribes, where their tastes meet, and upon it their hearts agree,\" End quote.\n\"An-Naba' Al-Adhim\" (p. 135).\nSecondly:\nThere is a correlation between the parts of the Noble Quran, which scholars refer to as the coherence between the verses and Surahs. This coherence may be between one Surah and another, between the beginning of a Surah and the one following it, between the verses of a single Surah, and between the beginning and end of a Surah.\n\"And there is not a Surah except that it has its own (landmarks) that distinguish it, whether they are short or long Surahs, and the shorter the Surahs, the greater this characteristic becomes. This is clear from the fact that Allah, the Exalted, did not make the short Surahs a single independent Surah except for a great wisdom, which is the independence of each one of them with what distinguishes it from others.\"\nSee: \"Misbah Ad-Durar fi Tanasub Ayat Al-Quran Al-Karim wa As-Suwar\" (p. 93).\nThere is also a close proximity between the topics of the Surahs and their objectives, as each Surah of the Quran has a purpose and goal, that is, a significance to which the meanings of the Surah and its content return, and represents its spirit that flows through all its parts.\nThe objective may be the same as the topic of the Surah, or the objective may differ from the topic, in that a single Surah may have a number of topics, and these topics return to one objective.\nKnowing the topics of the Surah and its objective is one of the most important aids to contemplating the Surah and realizing its miraculous nature, because you find that despite the different topics of the Surah, it leads to one goal in a harmony that compels the observer to deem it impossible for this speech to be of human origin.\nThe search for the topics of the Surah and its objective requires certain matters:\nThe most important of which are: understanding the meanings of the Surah, realizing the appropriateness between the verses, and realizing the appropriateness between the Surah and what precedes and follows it. All this makes the reader of the Quran more attentive to what he recites and more present in understanding it.\nAmong the important books in this field are:\n1- Asma' Suwar Al-Quran wa Fada'iliha, Dr. Munirah Al-Dosari, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi, it is an important book in its field.\n2- An-Naba' Al-Adhim, Dr. Muhammad Daraz, Tafakkur Center.\n3- Muhtawayah Suwar Al-Quran Al-Karim, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Taweel, Dar Al-Watan.\n4- Dalail An-Nizam, by the teacher Abdul Hamid Al-Farahi.\n5- Al-Burhan fi Tanasub Surah Al-Quran, by Imam Ibn Zubair Al-Gharnati, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi.\n6- At-Tanasub bayna As-Suwar fi Al-Muftatah wa Al-Khawatim, Dr. Fadil Al-Samarrai, Dar Ibn Kathir.\nAnd among the Tafsirs that have taken care of highlighting these aspects are:\n1- Nazm Al-Durar fi Tanasub Al-Ayat wa As-Suwar, by Imam Al-Biqa`i.\n2- At-Tahrir wa At-Tanwir, by Imam Al-Tahir Ibn Ashur.\n3- Masu`at At-Tafsir Al-Mawdu`i, University of Sharjah.\nAnd see: \"Ad-Dalil ila Al-Quran,\" Amr Al-Sharqawi (p. 78).\nThirdly:\nWe have not been able to personally examine the details of the attempts mentioned in the question, nor have we seen anything of them.\nHowever, we mention here some general methodological alerts, which we summarize as follows:\n1- One should not force oneself to research the characteristics of letters and their connection to the word and then the position of this word in the sentence, because this may obscure the main purpose of the Quran, which is to be a book of guidance.\n2- It must be known that this is merely one of the delicacies of the Quran, and its seasoning, and not from the solid knowledge, nor from the general objectives of the Noble Quran, nor the central meanings it brought; rather, it is closer to being, if correct, from the superficial layer as the scholar (Daraz) expresses.\n3- Writing in such a field, and the possibility of contributing one's own insights, requires special knowledge and tools; the most important of which are specialization in phonetic studies and related sciences, then proficiency in the sciences of Arabic morphology and rhetoric; and such is not attainable by everyone, so the matter should be put in its proper place, and one should not undertake what one has no knowledge of, nor should one pretend to be an expert in a field for which the tools of research and examination are not complete, even if one's tools of research and examination were complete.\n4- If something of this is established for a person, there is no harm in speaking of it, but as his own ijtihad, which should be presented to the solid knowledge, its essence, and its core; and one should not exaggerate in this so that it is said to be from the \"miraculous nature,\" lest the Word of Allah and its miraculous nature be exposed to speculation and debate, as has happened with those concerned with examining aspects of the \"scientific miracles\" of the Noble Quran; and indeed, both extremes in intending matters are reprehensible!!\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Quran is often recognized for its unique linguistic and rhetorical style, which many consider miraculous. This miraculous aspect of the Quran can be understood through various characteristics, including its structure, eloquence, coherence, depth of meaning, and the profound impact it has on its readers and listeners. Below are several key points highlighting the miraculous nature of the Quran's language, supported by specific verses from the text.\n\n### 1. **Eloquence and Distinctiveness**\nThe Quran claims to be a distinct and eloquent text that stands apart from any human composition. The following verses emphasize its clarity and lucidity:\n\n- **Surah Fussilat (41:1-3)**: \"HA MIM. A revelation from the most benevolent, ever-merciful, A Book whose verses have been distinguished and explained, a lucid discourse for people who understand.\" \n  - **(Reference: Surah 41, Ayah 1-3)**\n\n- **Surah Az-Zukhruf (43:1-4)**: \"HA MIM. I call to witness the lucent Book, That We made it a distinctly lucid Qur'an that you may understand.\"\n  - **(Reference: Surah 43, Ayah 1-4)**\n\nThese verses illustrate the Quran's intended clarity and accessibility, underscoring that it is designed to be comprehensible and resonates with the reader.\n\n### 2. **Inimitability**\nThe Quran asserts that it is inimitable; no one can produce anything like it, which is a challenge directed at those who doubt its divine origin:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:23)**: \"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to Our servant, then produce a chapter like it and call upon your witnesses besides Allah, if you should be among the truthful.\"\n  - **(Reference: Surah 2, Ayah 23)**\n\nThis challenge highlights the unparalleled nature of the Quran's style and message, suggesting that even the most skilled poets and scholars would be unable to replicate its divine essence.\n\n### 3. **Impact and Transformation**\nThe emotional and spiritual response of those who hear the Quran's recitation also attests to its miraculous language. The verses invoke deep reflection and change:\n\n- **Surah Ar-Ra'd (13:35)**: \"The likeness of Paradise promised to the pious is (of a garden) with streams of rippling water, everlasting fruits and shade. This is the recompense of those who keep away from evil.\"\n  - **(Reference: Surah 13, Ayah 35)**\n\nThe Quran has a transformative effect, encouraging individuals to reflect on their lives and their relationship with God and others.\n\n### 4. **Protection of the Text**\nThe Quran asserts its own protection as the word of God, establishing it as a preserved and well-guarded text:\n\n- **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:77-81)**: \"That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an (Inscribed) in the well-kept Book... Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind). It has been revealed by the Lord of all the worlds.\"\n  - **(Reference: Surah 56, Ayah 77-81)**\n\nThis verse indicates that the Quran is safeguarded and remains pure, further substantiating its miraculous nature.\n\n### 5. **Universal Guidance**\nThe Quran serves as a guidance not just for one tribe or nation, but universally, speaking across time and cultures:\n\n- **Surah An-Nahl (16:101-105)**: \"When We replace a message with another -- and God knows best what He reveals -- they say: 'You have made it up;'\" \n  - **(Reference: Surah 16, Ayah 101-105)**\n\nThe Quran's guidance is characterized as relevant and significant for all people, inviting diverse audiences to understand and benefit from its teachings.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe miraculous language of the Quran is demonstrated through its eloquence, inimitability, profound impact, and the divine protection it claims. These characteristics set it apart as a text that continues to challenge and inspire believers and scholars alike. The verses mentioned provide a foundational understanding of how the Quran is perceived not merely as literature but as a divine revelation with a unique and powerful linguistic structure that has profound implications for its followers.  \n\nIn summary, the Quran stands out not only for its literary beauty but also for its capacity to guide, transform, and challenge humanity through its eloquent verses."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Quran is the Speech of Allah, spoken by Him with His letters and meanings, as He, the Exalted, said (translation of the meaning): {And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the Words of Allāh [i.e., the Quran]. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.} (At-Tawbah:6).\nIn the Quran, there are statements of various peoples that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has mentioned, including the believers like the prophets and the truthful, and the disbelievers, like Pharaoh and Qarun, and the hypocrites, as well as the angels, the jinn, the birds like the hoopoe, the ants, and others.\nThe purpose of mentioning these statements is to convey the meaning and not necessarily the exact wording. Sometimes the conveyed message is the exact wording, and sometimes it is the meaning, especially if it is impossible for it to be the exact wording, such as when the speaker is not speaking in Arabic. This has been explicitly stated by more than one of the scholars:\nZain Ad-Din Ar-Razi Al-Hanafi said in \"Questions and Answers on the Oddities of the Verses of Revelation\" (p. 144): \"If it is asked: How did Allah, the Exalted, narrate here the speech of the sorcerers who believed and of Pharaoh (translation of the meaning): {They said, 'We believe in the Lord of the worlds'} to the saying of Allah: {And cause us to die as Muslims}, then narrated this meaning in Surah Taha and Surah Ash-Shu`ara with additions and omissions in the words attributed to them, when this event only occurred once, so how did their expression differ in it?\nWe say: The answer to this is that they spoke in their language, not in Arabic, and Allah, the Exalted, narrated that from them in Arabic several times, for a wisdom that necessitated repetition and reiteration, which we will explain in Surah Ash-Shu`ara, Allah willing. So, at one time He narrated it matching their wording in the translation, taking care of the wording, and after that, He narrated it by meaning, following the custom of the Arabs in varying speech and differing in their styles; so as not to bore if it was merely repetitive.\" End quote.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in \"At-Tis`iniyyah\" (2/464): \"Indeed, the letters and sounds that Moses heard were Hebrew, and those that Allah mentioned about him in the Quran were Arabic. If speech were merely letters and sounds, there would be no commonality at all between the speech that Moses heard and that which Allah mentioned that he heard. Thus, reporting that he heard these sounds, which he did not hear, would be a lie.\nLikewise, all those whom Allah narrated in the Quran that they spoke from the previous nations who spoke languages other than Arabic, they spoke in their languages, and Allah narrated that in the language in which the Quran was revealed, which is Arabic. And the Speech of Allah is truth. If their speech was just letters and sounds, and the letters and sounds they said are not like these, then it would not be possible to narrate from them at all. Rather, their speech was letters and meanings, so Allah narrated that from them in another language, and the letters follow the meanings, and the meanings are the main intended purpose, as the speech of all creatures is translated.\" End quote.\nAt-Tahir said: \"The meaning of the statement here is: to convey their intention to those they want to reach among their kind, in the manner in which they understand each other,\" At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (29/220).\nAnd he said: \"This is narrated from the speech of the jinn,\" At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (29/222).\nIn summary, what this ignorant objector mentioned only demonstrates his ignorance, narrow-mindedness, and poor understanding.\nIf Allah's narration of the speech of the jinn or humans, whether believers or disbelievers, in His Book, meant that those whom Allah narrated from them said \"Quran,\" then that would mean that all these humans, and the jinn, had brought forth a Quran from themselves, and then Allah transmitted this Quran in \"His Quran\"; then He challenged them to produce something like it.\nThis could not be from the weakest of people in intellect; rather, it is only imagined and found problematic by someone who is ignorant, who does not know the places of argument, and the aspects of speech.\nAnd it is astonishing that anyone would believe such nonsense, be disturbed by it, and think there is a real problem!!\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Quranic challenge to the jinn primarily centers around the acknowledgment of God’s oneness (Tawhid) and the miraculous nature of the Quran itself. This is articulated within Surah Al-Jinn (Chapter 72), which provides an account of a group of jinn who, upon listening to the Quran, recognized its truth and the greatness of Allah.\n\n### 1. Recognition of God's Oneness\nSurah Al-Jinn begins with the jinn declaring their belief in God's oneness and their rejection of associating partners with Him. \n\n- **Verse**: “Say: 'I have been informed that a number of jinns had listened; then said: ‘We have heard the wondrous Qur'an, Which guides to the right path; and we have come to believe in it, and will not associate any one with our Lord. Exalted is the glory of our Lord; He has neither wife nor son.’”  \n  - **(Surah Al-Jinn, 72:1-3)**\n\nThis declaration emphasizes the importance of monotheism, a fundamental tenet of Islamic belief.\n\n### 2. The Nature of the Quran \nIn Surah Al-Jinn, the jinn express their astonishment at the Quran, which they describe as \"wondrous.\" This suggests that the Quran possesses an unparalleled eloquence and wisdom that cannot be replicated by humans or jinn.\n\n- **Verse**: “If men and jinn get together to produce the like of this (Qur'an), they will not be able to produce the like of it, however they might assist one another.”  \n  - **(Surah Al-Isra, 17:88)**\n\nThis verse poses a direct challenge to both humans and jinn, asserting the unique divine origin of the Quran.\n\n### 3. Accountability in the Afterlife\nThe concept of resurrection and accountability is also addressed. The jinn initially thought that neither men nor jinn could be resurrected after death, a belief they later renounced upon realizing God's power.\n\n- **Verses**: “... So they began to think, even as you do, that God would not resurrect any one.”  \n  - **(Surah Al-Jinn, 72:7)**\n\nThis reflection highlights the theme of accountability, where both men and jinn will stand before God for judgment based on their actions in life.\n\n### 4. Consequences of Disobedience\nThe jinn are warned about the dire consequences of turning away from God’s message. Those who disobey will find themselves in Hellfire, emphasizing the importance of adhering to divine guidance.\n\n- **Verse**: “For those who disobey God and His Apostle is the fire of Hell, where they will abide forever.”  \n  - **(Surah Al-Jinn, 72:23)**\n\nThis specific warning underlines the reality of divine justice and reinforces the obligation to follow the teachings conveyed through the Quran.\n\n### 5. The Role of Worship\nThe surah concludes with a reminder that the primary purpose of creating jinn and humans is to worship Allah alone, reiterating the message of monotheism.\n\n- **Verse**: “And I have not created the jinns and men but to worship Me.”  \n  - **(Surah Adh-Dhariyat, 51:56)**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe challenge to the jinn presented in the Quran revolves around the concepts of divine oneness, the uniqueness of the Quran, the reality of resurrection and accountability, and the need for worship. The group of jinn that encounters the Quran embodies the ideal of accepting divine guidance and the importance of adherence to God's commandments. They serve as a reminder that the message of monotheism transcends human understanding and extends to all of creation, including the unseen realm of the jinn."

        "question": "Belief of the Salaf Concerning the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The belief of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) concerning the Quran is like their belief in all the Names and Attributes of Allah, which is a belief that is based on what is indicated by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah (traditions) of His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him). \nWe all know that Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, has described the Quran as being His Word and that it was sent down from Him. Allah, may He be Sxalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if any of the polytheists seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Quran), and then escort him to where he can be secure.” [At-Tawbah 9:6]\nUndoubtedly what is meant by the Word of Allah here is the Noble Quran .\nAnd He, may He be exalted, says:\n“Verily, this Quran narrates to the Children of Israel most of that about which they differ.” [An-Naml 27:76]\nSo the Quran is the Word of Allah in both wording and meaning. Allah spoke it in a real sense and gave it to Jibril (peace be upon him) the trustworthy, then Jibril brought it down to the heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that he might be one of the warners, in a plain Arabic tongue. \nThe Salaf believe that the Quran was revealed ; Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, revealed it to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) piecemeal, i.e., bit by bit, over twenty-three years, in accordance with the Wisdom of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted. \nMoreover, some of the revelation was revealed for a specific reason for which it was sent down, and some of it was revealed without a specific reason. Moreover, some of it was revealed to tell of something that happened to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions. Some of it was revealed concerning Shar`i (legal) rulings, according to what the scholars have said concerning this matter. \nThen the Salaf say that the Quran is from Allah in the first place and it will return (to Him) at the end of time. This is the view of the Salaf concerning the Noble Quran. \nIt is clear to us that Allah has described the Noble Quran in superlative terms. He has described it as wise (Hakim), noble (Karim), great (`Adhim), and glorious (Majid). \nThese qualities, in terms of which Allah has described His Book, may be attainable by one who adheres to this Book and acts upon it both inwardly and outwardly. Allah will give him some share of glory, greatness, wisdom, honour and authority that is not given to the one who does not adhere to the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted. \nHence I call all Muslims, rulers and ruled, scholars and ordinary folk, to adhere to the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, both inwardly and outwardly, so that they may attain honour, happiness and glory, and prevail in the east and in the west.” (Fatawa Kibar `Ulama Al-Ummah)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The belief of the Salaf concerning the Qur'an is deeply rooted in the understanding that the Qur'an is the literal word of God, unaltered and eternal in its message. The Salaf, including the Prophet Muhammad and his companions, held a firm belief in the divine origin, preservation, and authority of the Qur'an. This belief is consistently echoed in various verses of the Qur'an:\n\n1. **Divine Revelation and Verification**: \n   - In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:41-42), God advises the believers to accept what has been sent down to verify previous scriptures, beware of deceit, and uphold the truth:\n     > \"And believe in what I have sent down which verifies what is already with you; and do not be the first to deny it... and beware of Me. Do not confuse truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth knowingly.\" (2:41-42)\n\n2. **Faith in Divine Guidance**: \n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:4-5) emphasizes the qualities of the true believers who have faith in all revelations and the hereafter, suggesting that the Qur'an solidifies this belief:\n     > \"Who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to those before you, and are certain of the Hereafter. They have found the guidance of their Lord and will be successful.\" (2:4-5)\n\n3. **The Qur'an as Clear Guidance**: \n   - Surah Al-Furqan (25:30-32) refers to the grievances of the Prophet regarding his people's rejection of the Qur'an, highlighting its importance as a guideline:\n     > \"The prophet will say: 'O my Lord, my people had fettered the Qur'an.' ... It was sent thus that We may keep your heart resolute.\" (25:30-31)\n\n4. **Recognition of Previous Scriptures**: \n   - Surah Al-Qasas (28:52-53) illustrates that those who previously received the scriptures (i.e., the Jews and Christians) are expected to recognize and believe in the Qur'an:\n     > \"Those to whom We gave the Book before this do believe in it; And when it is read out to them, say: 'We believe in it. It's the truth from our Lord.'\" (28:52-53)\n\n5. **The Immutable Nature of the Qur'an**: \n   - Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:75-79) affirms that the Qur'an is inscribed in a protected tablet, reinforcing its unchangeable nature:\n     > \"That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an (Inscribed) in the well-kept Book. Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind).\" (56:78-79)\n\n6. **Call to Unwavering Faith**: \n   - Surah Al-Mu'minun (23:57-61) describes the qualities of the believers who are in awe of their Lord and consistently act according to His revelations:\n     > \"Surely those who live in awe of their Lord, Who believe in their Lord's revelations... Are the ones who hasten to goodness and outpace the others.\" (23:57-61)\n\nThe Salaf's perspective on the Qur'an can be summarized as a staunch belief in its divine origins, its role as the ultimate source of guidance, and its preservation as an unaltered revelation from God. They viewed the Qur'an not merely as a historical document but as a living text that continues to guide in all matters of faith and practice. This belief in the inerrancy and divine nature of the Qur'an is foundational to Islamic theology and jurisprudence."

        "question": "Repetition of stories in the Quran with different wording",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The repetition of stories and their wording in the Holy Quran, but in different contexts and synonymous wording, is one of the obvious characteristics of Quranic story-telling, as one story may be repeated in more than one surah, and each time it is told in a different context and different style. Thus the story is repeated with new phrases which give different shades of meaning and offer new lessons, in various eloquent styles. Hence the scholars and commentators regarded this variation in wording and phrases as one of the aspects of eloquence, and they stated that one of the objectives of the Quranic stories is that one incident may be mentioned in different contexts. They even wrote books devoted to this technique, one of which is the book al-Muqtanis fi Fawa’id Tikrar al-Qasas, by Badr al-Din ibn Jama‘ah, which was mentioned by al-Suyuti in al-Itqan (2/184).\nAl-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Presenting the same idea with different techniques and styles is quite clearly a sign of eloquence.\"(Al-Burhan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran 3/26).\nIf we want to count the benefits that this variation in presentation may add to the beauty of the Quran, we would list many such benefits. We will mention some of them below:\n1.\nAdding some details that were not mentioned in other contexts. The example mentioned in the question is one type of these benefits. The verses in Surat al-Hijr add a more specific description of the material from which Adam (peace be upon him) was created, which is the fact that he was created from dry clay, made from black mud moulded into shape, which was not mentioned in the verses of Surat al-A‘raf which refer to the same idea.\n2.\nConfirming the challenge that the Quran brought to the polytheist Arabs, to produce something like what is in the Quran. This variation in presenting one idea exposed their inability to produce anything like it in any style and in any words they could come up with.\n3.\nEnlivening the story so that the reader will not get bored with it. That is because a new variation in presentation of the story makes one more attentive and more inclined to listen, and it keeps the reader engaged and interested when reading this holy text. This is also one of the greatest objectives. Thus the eloquent person will find himself inclined to listen to it, because of the natural human inclination to move between a variety of things, each of which gives its own pleasure.\n4.\nPresenting one topic in an amazing way when it is presented in different styles. The polytheists at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were amazed at how often these stories were repeated, in a different style every time, even though the topic was the same. Thus Allah, may He be glorified, showed them that what they were amazed at was produced by One Whose power is infinite and Whose words cannot be counted.\n5.\nCreating harmony between the topic and the context in which the story is presented. Sometimes the context requires highlighting some aspect of the story in the discussion that takes place therein, that did not need to be highlighted in another context in which the same story was mentioned. This reason is one of the bases of the eloquence of the Quran and its miraculous nature. It is discussed in more detail in some books of Tafsir.\nYou can read about these benefits and others in the book al-Burhan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran (3/26-29).\nDr. Fadl Hasan ‘Abbas (may Allah have mercy on him) says: The storytelling method in the Holy Quran is a brilliant and miraculous method, as a story may be mentioned in many surahs. Although some surahs may mention a single detail from the story, other scenes and incidents are mentioned in other surahs in which the same story is mentioned, whether there are many events in the story or few. Thus in each surah you will find a detail of the story that you do not find elsewhere, and each surah mentions some detail that is appropriate to the topic and context of that surah. Thus the story is mentioned in the surahs in a particular place in each surah that is appropriate for it.\"(Al-Qasas al-Qurani  81).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The repetition of stories in the Quran serves several important purposes. These stories often have different wordings, structures, or focuses, but they are presented multiple times across various surahs, illustrating key themes and lessons. Here are some reasons for this repetition, supported by verses from the Quran.\n\n### 1. **Reinforcement of Lessons**\nRepetition serves to reinforce vital themes and moral teachings. By presenting stories with slight variations, the Quran emphasizes these moral lessons, and different contexts may highlight different aspects of the narrative.\n\nFor example, in Surah Al-Qasas (28:54-58), the emphasis is placed on the perseverance and good deeds of the believers, illustrating their steadfastness in the face of opposition. This passage highlights the reward for those who respond to evil with good:\n\n> \"These will be given their recompense twice, for they persevered and repelled evil with good, and spent of what We had given them...\" (28:54)\n\n### 2. **Customization for Different Audiences**\nThe Quran acknowledges that audiences may have varying levels of understanding and experience. Thus, stories can be tailored to them, contextually communicating their messages in a way that resonates most effectively.\n\nIn the same Surah, verses 45-49 discuss the historical messengers and the audience's response to calls for guidance. It shows how past nations, despite their knowledge of prophets, still questioned their validity:\n\n> \"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said: 'Why is he not given the like of what was given to Moses?'\" (28:48)\n\n### 3. **Clarification of Context and Detail**\nThe repetition allows for clarification of context or additional details that may not have been included in previous mentions. This method enriches the narrative, providing a fuller understanding.\n\nIn Surah Al-Qasas (28:61-65), the verse focuses on the Day of Judgment and the accountability of individuals, emphasizing the futility of calling upon partners on that day:\n\n> \"Those against whom the sentence is justified will say: 'O Lord, these are those we had led astray... we clear ourselves before You: They never worshipped us.'\" (28:64-65)\n\n### 4. **Encouragement and Comfort**\nReiterating stories of past prophets and their struggles offers encouragement to the Prophet Muhammad and the believers. It reassures them that struggles are a part of the divine plan.\n\nIn verses 60-64 of Surah Al-Qasas, the discussions on the transient nature of this life compared to the everlasting one serve to comfort the believers who might be facing trials in their own lives:\n\n> \"Whatsoever has been given you is the stuff this life is made of, and only its embellishment. What is with your Lord is better and abiding.\" (28:60)\n\n### 5. **Warning Against Disbelievers**\nThe repeated stories also serve as a warning against disbelievers, emphasizing the consequences of disbelief by recounting the fates of previous nations.\n\nIn Surah Al-Qasas (28:74-78), the mention of Qarun (Korah) serves to warn about arrogance and ingratitude, as his downfall is directly linked to his pride and oppression:\n\n> \"Did he not know that God had destroyed many generations before him who possessed far more acumen than he, and more wealth?\" (28:78)\n\n### Conclusion\nIn sum, the repetition of stories in the Quran enriches the text's overall message while reinforcing key themes. It combines moral teachings, contextual adaptation for different audiences, clarity, encouragement, and warnings, allowing for a multifaceted approach to understanding God’s guidance. The specific verses mentioned illustrate these purposes, providing insight and reflection for believers of all times."

        "question": "Can the basmalah be recited in the middle of a surah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that if a person recites the basmalah when beginning his reading of Quran in the middle of a surah, that is not recommended, because Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{When you recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan} [An-Nahl 16:98].\nHe did not instruct us to say anything else. Therefore so long as there is a specific text concerning the matter which states that what is required from the one who wants to read Quran is to seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan, this text makes specific what is mentioned in general terms in the hadith, “Every important matter that does not start with ‘Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful), is devoid of blessings.” End quote.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\nLiqa’at al-Bab al-Maftuh (1/177).",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether the **Basmala** (the phrase \"Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim,\" meaning \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\") can be recited in the middle of a Surah (chapter) in the Quran is addressed through both traditional Islamic teachings and specific verses from the Quran.\n\n### General Understanding\n\n1. **Position of the Basmala**: The Basmala is traditionally recited at the beginning of each Surah, except for Surah At-Tawbah (Surah 9). The primary understanding in Islamic jurisprudence is that it serves as a declaration of seeking blessings and guidance from Allah before reading the text.\n\n2. **Recitation Practice**: Reciting the Basmala at the start of every Surah (except Surah At-Tawbah) is an established practice, but it is not common practice to recite it in the middle of a Surah. Many scholars indicate that repeating the Basmala within a Surah is not considered a standard or recommended practice based on the traditional interpretations of the Quran and Hadith.\n\n3. **Authentic Narrations**: While there is no explicit prohibition in the Quran itself against reciting the Basmala in the middle of a Surah, the absence of such practice in the behavior of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions serves as an understanding that it is not customary.\n\n### Supporting Verses\n\nWhile the key verses provided do not directly address the issue of reciting the Basmala in the middle of a Surah, they emphasize the importance of proper recitation and the respect for the Quran's structure and order:\n\n- **Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:15-19)**: “Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\" (75:17-18)\n  \nThese verses emphasize the divine responsibility of the Quran's recitation and its proper observance. The implication here is that following the established protocols surrounding its recitation is part of respecting the Quran.\n\n- **Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206)**: \"When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence.\" (7:204)\n\nThis verse highlights the need for attentiveness and respect when engaging with the Quran during its recitation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the Basmala is an essential phrase marking the beginning of each Surah (except Surah At-Tawbah) and is not typically recited in the midst of a Surah. While it may not be expressly forbidden, not following the customary practices established by the Prophet and scholars of Islam is generally not encouraged. Those engaging in recitation should focus on adhering to the manners of recitation laid out in the traditions.\n\n### References:\n\n1. Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:15-19)\n2. Surah Al-A'raf (7:204)"

        "question": "Writing verses of Quran and erasing them with water, then drinking the water",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Doing that is permissible. It is permissible for a person to write Quran with ink that it is permissible to drink, then to put the written paper in water and shake it, then drink it. Some of the early generations used to do that, and they would do it using vessels such as bowls and the like. If a person does that, he has a precedent for doing it. The evidence quoted for doing that is the general meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We send down of the Quran that which is healing and mercy for the believers} [al-Isra’ 17:82].\nSo if healing is sought by means of the Quran in this manner, and it is tried and turns out to be beneficial, then it is included in the general meaning of this verse.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\n(Al-Liqa’ al-Maftuh (p. 112).",
        "predicted_answer": "The practice of writing verses from the Qur'an, erasing them with water, and then drinking the water is not standard or widely recognized in Islamic teachings. The discussion around such an act can be illustrated by a few points:\n\n### 1. **Respect for the Qur'an**\n   The Qur'an is considered the literal word of God in Islam and is revered deeply. The act of writing its verses and erasing them is not mentioned in the Qur'an as a permissible or advisable practice. In fact, the Qur'an places a strong emphasis on the importance of the verses themselves, their memorization, and their recitation. \n\n   **Relevant Verses:**\n   - Surah Al-Qalam (68:1-3): \"NUN. I call to witness the pen and what they inscribe. You are not demented by the grace of your Lord. There is surely reward unending for you.\"\n   - This verse emphasizes the importance of the written word and knowledge.\n\n### 2. **The Nature of the Qur'an**\n   The Qur'an serves as guidance and a source of spiritual nourishment for Muslims, and it encompasses various teachings about life, morality, and worship. The idea of consuming water that has contact with written verses does not have specific textual backing in traditional Islamic practices or teachings.\n\n   **Relevant Verses:**\n   - Surah Al-Furqan (25:51-53): \"Had We pleased, We could have raised a warner in every town. So do not listen to unbelievers, and strive against them with greater effort. It is He who made two bodies of water flow side by side, one fresh and sweet, the other brine and bitter, and has placed an interstice, a barrier between them.\"\n   - This emphasizes God's control over creation, which itself can hint at the respect and proper use of His words.\n\n### 3. **Murky Practices**\n   There are indeed some kinds of practices, especially among certain folk traditions or sects, that involve writing verses on water or other materials for therapeutic reasons. However, these practices fall outside the standard teachings of mainstream Islam and could sometimes be viewed as superstitious or misleading.\n\n4. **Spiritual Healing in Islam**\n   The Qur'an is used in various traditional healing practices, often through recitation rather than through physical manipulation of the text. For instance, reciting verses over water for healing is more commonly accepted than physically writing and erasing them. The verses recited for spiritual healing are done with the intention of invoking blessings or seeking God’s mercy.\n\n   **Relevant Verses:**\n   - Surah Al-Isra (17:82): \"And We send down the Qur'an as a healing and a mercy for the believers.\"\n   - This highlights the recognized role of the Qur'an as a source of healing.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, while the idea of writing verses, erasing them, and drinking the water may appear in certain contexts, it does not have strong backing in authentic Islamic practices and teachings. The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of its verses without promoting such practices, and respected traditions focus on recitation, faith, and prayer for spiritual and physical well-being. The approach to the Qur'an should be one of reverence, care, and correct understanding within the normative teachings of Islam."

        "question": "When were Surat al-Falaq and Surat an-Nas revealed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadiths indicate that the Mu‘awwidhatayn (Al-Falaq) and An-Nas) were revealed in Madinah.\nThis is mentioned in the hadith of ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not see verses that have been revealed tonight, the like of which has never been seen? {Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak} [Al-Falaq 113] and {Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind} [An-Nas 114].”\n‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) accompanied the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Madinah, and these two surahs were revealed after the bewitching incident.\n‘Abd ibn Humayd narrated in al-Muntakhab (1/228): Ahmad ibn Yunus told me: Abu Mu‘awiyah told us, from al-A‘mash, from Yazid ibn Hayyan, from Zayd ibn Arqam, who said: A Jewish man bewitched the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he fell sick. Jibril came to him, bringing down al-Mu‘awwidhatayn, and said: A Jewish man has bewitched you, and the item used for witchcraft is in the well of So-and-so. So he sent ‘Ali, who brought it to him, then he instructed him to untie the knots and recite verses, so he started reciting and untying, until the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up as if he had been released from restraints. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say anything to that Jewish man about what he had done to him, and he never confronted him with it.\nThe narrators of this isnad are trustworthy (thiqat); it was classed as sahih by the commentators on the book, and by Shaykh al-Albani in as-SIlsilah as-Sahihah (6/617).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said:\nHe said: Because of that, al-Mu‘aawidhatayn were revealed.

In it, it says: And {Qul a‘udhu bi Rabb il-falaq} [Surat al-Falaq] was revealed.\"(At-Talkhis al-Habir  6/2689).\nAs for the number of knots being eleven, no sahih hadith has been narrated concerning that.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs-Suhayli stated that the number of knots was eleven, so it was appropriate that the number of verses of the Mu‘awwidhatayn should be eleven, so that with every verse, one knot was undone.\nI say: al-Bayhaqi narrated in ad-Dala’il something similar with a da‘if isnad, in the story in which it is said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was bewitched… At the end of the hadith, it says that they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and Surat al-Falaq and Surat an-Nas were revealed, so every time he recited a verse, one knot came undone.\nIbn Sa‘d narrated with a munqati‘ (interrupted) isnad from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent ‘Ali and ‘Ammar, and they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and he mentioned a similar report.\"(At-Talkhis al-Habir 6/2689-2690).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Surat Al-Falaq (Surah 113) and Surat An-Nas (Surah 114) are both Meccan surahs and are known as the last two surahs of the Quran. They are often referred to together as \"the two protection surahs\" because they emphasize seeking refuge in Allah from various forms of evil.\n\n1. **Surat Al-Falaq**: This surah is revealed in the Meccan period and consists of five ayahs (verses). It seeks refuge with Allah, the Lord of the Daybreak, from various forms of evil, including dark sorcery and envy. The surah is found in the Quran from Surah Al-Falaq, Ayah 1 to Ayah 5. These ayahs collectively indicate the significance of seeking protection from harmful forces.\n\n   **Citations:**\n   - Surah Al-Falaq, Ayah 1-5: \n     - *\"Say: I seek refuge with (Allah), the Lord of the daybreak, From the evil of what He has created, And from the evil of the evening darkness when it overspreads, And from the evil of those who blow on knots, And from the evil of an envier when he envies.\"* (Al-Falaq, 113:1-5)\n\n2. **Surat An-Nas**: Similar to Al-Falaq, this surah also addresses seeking refuge, specifically with Allah from the evil of whisperings of Shaitan (the devil) and other malignant forces. Surat An-Nas is also a Meccan surah and consists of six ayahs. It follows directly after Surat Al-Falaq in the Quran and is found in Surah An-Nas, Ayah 1 to Ayah 6.\n\n   **Citations:**\n   - Surah An-Nas, Ayah 1-6: \n     - *\"Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind, The Sovereign of mankind, The God of mankind, From the evil of the retreating whisperer (of evil), who whispers in the breasts of mankind, Of jinn and mankind.\"* (An-Nas, 114:1-6)\n\nIn summary, both Surat Al-Falaq and Surat An-Nas were revealed during the Meccan period of the Prophet Muhammad's life. They serve as powerful invocations for protection against various evils and are recited by Muslims for seeking refuge in Allah."

        "question": "Ruling on writing verses of the Qur’an on walls and the front of houses",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not prescribed to write Qur’anic verses on walls, and it is disliked (makruh) according to the majority of scholars; some of them described it as haram.\nIbn al-Humam (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fath al-Qadir (1/169): It is disliked (makruh) to write Qur’an and the names of Allah, may He be exalted, on coins, mihrabs, walls and furnishings. End quote.\nAd-Dardir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ash-Sharh al-Kabir (1/425):\nWhat appears to be the case is that engraving [of Qur’anic verses] is disliked, even Qur’an [on graves]. And it should be regarded as haram, because it could lead to mishandling and disrespect, as they said.\nAn example of that is engraving Qur’an and the names of Allah on walls. End quote.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Rawdat at-Talibin (1/80): It is makruh to write it on walls, whether in the mosque or elsewhere, and on garments. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on writing verses and hadiths on the walls of mosques? He replied: That is a distraction to people.\nAs for writing verses on walls, whether in the mosque or elsewhere, it is an innovation (bid‘ah) and there is no report from the Companions to suggest that they used to engrave verses on their walls.\nMoreover, engraving verses on walls is a kind of disrespect towards the words of Allah. Hence we find some of them writing verses in a calligraphic style to look like castles, minarets, mosques and the like, shaping the words to make them look like a castle. Undoubtedly this is toying with the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nFurthermore, even if we assume that the words are written in clear Arabic writing, this is not the way of the righteous early generations.\nWhat benefit can there be in writing verses on walls?\nSome people say that it will be a reminder for people. We say: Reminding is done by spoken words, not by writing the verses.\nMoreover, sometimes they write on the walls {And do not spy or backbite each other} [al-Hujurat 49:12], and you will find that those who are sitting underneath this verse are gossiping and backbiting people, so it is as if they are mocking the verses of Allah.\nTherefore writing verses in mosques and on the walls of houses all comes under the heading of innovation (bid‘ah), as it is something that was not known at the time of the righteous early generations.\nAs for writing hadiths in the mosque, if it is in the direction of the qiblah, then undoubtedly it is a distraction, because people, even some of the worshippers who are standing behind the imam during the prayer, may steal glances at it. The scholars regard it as disliked to write anything in the qiblah of the mosque.\nIf that is done in houses, there is nothing wrong with writing a hadith [on the wall] if there is some benefit in it, such as the supplication offered as expiation for a gathering (kaffarat al-majlis): “Subhanak Allahumma rabbana wa bi hamdik, ashhadu an la ilaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk (Glory and praise be to you, O Allah our Lord. I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except You. I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You),” then this serves as a reminder.\"(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh 197/13).\nSee also the answer to question no. 254, in which there is a discussion of the negative consequences of hanging verses on walls, most of which are also applicable to writing directly on the walls.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to sitting on the roof of the house, which rests on the walls on which, or on parts of which, Qur’an has been written, there is nothing wrong with it, and it is not like sitting on the Qur’an, because who sits on walls?! Rather they sit on the roof, away from the walls.\nAs for your saying “anyone who climbs onto the roof of the house feels that he is stepping on that dhikr,” this comes under the heading of waswasah (intrusive thoughts; whispers from the shaytan).\nBeware of getting carried away with it, because waswasah is a serious problem and a great evil; may Allah keep us all safe and sound.\nThe remedy for waswasah is to ignore it and pay no attention to it, whilst also reciting a great deal of dhikr and doing acts of worship.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The ruling on writing verses of the Qur’an on walls and the front of houses can be understood by examining key Islamic teachings, particularly focusing on the intent behind such actions and the general principles governing the use of holy texts.\n\n### Key Considerations\n\n1. **Respect for the Qur’an**: The Qur’an is considered by Muslims to be the literal word of God. Therefore, it is held in high esteem and must be treated with utmost respect. Writing its verses in a place that is exposed to desecration or disrespect can be viewed as inappropriate.\n\n2. **Place of Writing**: The specific location where verses are written is significant. If the verses are inscribed in places where they may become dirty or neglected, it may be seen as disrespectful. The verses should ideally be placed in clean and respectable areas.\n\n3. **Public Display for Reminder**: Some scholars permit writing verses in public places for the sake of reminding people of Islamic teachings, provided that the verses are placed in a manner that honors them.\n\n### Supporting Verses and Interpretations\n\n- **Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:128-130)**: These verses remind believers not to construct monuments or erect palaces thinking that they will last forever, prompting the need to reflect on the true purpose of life—pleasing Allah rather than showing off material wealth:\n\n   > \"So fear God and listen to me. I ask no recompense of you for it. My reward is due from none but the Lord of all the worlds. You construct monuments on every hill in vain, and erect palaces (thinking) that you will live for ever.\"  \n   [**Surah Ash-Shu'ara, 26:126-130**]\n\n- **Surah An-Nur (24:27-31)**: These verses provide guidance on entering others' homes and emphasize respect for private spaces. This can extend to the meaning that Qur'anic verses should not be exposed in places that may lack respect or privacy:\n\n   > \"O you who believe, do not enter other houses except yours without first asking permission and saluting the inmates. ... God is aware of what you do.\"  \n   [**Surah An-Nur, 24:27-31**]\n\n### Conclusion and Scholarly Viewpoints\n\nMost scholars emphasize the importance of maintaining respect for the Qur’an in all forms, including the context in which its verses are written or displayed. While the act of writing verses on a wall may have the intention of spreading knowledge and remembrance of Allah, it is crucial to ensure that these verses are not placed in a manner that would lead to disrespect or neglect.\n\nIf the intent behind writing the verses is honorable and done with the correct understanding, some scholars may find it permissible. However, it is essential to adhere to the principle of respecting the sacred nature of the verses, ensuring they are not subjected to dishonor. \n\nIn summary, Muslims are encouraged to reflect on the utility and ambience around the writing of Qur’anic verses, ensuring that any such act aligns with the overarching principles of respect and reverence associated with the holy text."

        "question": "Ruling on using auto-tune and vocal effects for the Holy Qur’an",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nRuling on using vocal effects for recitation of Qur’an\nThere is nothing wrong with using enhancers and vocal effects for recitation of Qur’an, if that will not lead to repetition of the sound of letters, or cause them to disappear, or change the rules of tajwid, provided that the reciter is reciting without restricting himself to a certain maqam (mode or scale) or tune.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: One of the imams of the mosques is asking: We heard you talking about vocal enhancement (echo); what did you say?\nHe said: What we said was that if this vocal enhancement (echo) leads to repeating the sound of the letter, then it is haram, because it is adding something to the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and that is not permissible.\nBut if it does not lead to repeating the sound, then we examine the matter further: If it makes the reciter’s voice sound like the voice of a singer, then it is also not allowed, but in this case we cannot say definitively that it is haram, because there is no addition to the wording of the Qur’an. This is what we say about these enhancements.\nMoreover, we say: O brothers, what matters is not the tune that moves you and you find pleasurable; rather what matters is to focus with humility (and be moved by the words of the Qur’an). How many people recite without a microphone, let alone vocal enhancements, but it is more conducive to focus and reflection for him and for his listeners.\"(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh  109/14).\nSecondly:\nUsing auto-tune for recitation of Qur’an\nAuto-tune is a sound-purifying tool which works to enhance the sound, cancel any distortion and alter the pitch of the sound.\nThe ruling on reciting with maqamat (modes or scales) has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 169799 .\nBut it is not permissible to use auto-tune, even if the reciter does not pay attention to maqamat and does not restrict himself to that, because of what it leads to of omitting some vowels and even some letters, let alone some rules of tajwid, according to what some specialists have told us.\nShaykh Sulayman al-Majid (may Allah preserve him) was asked: What is the ruling on using filters and vocal effects for recitation of Qur’an, such as what are known as auto-tune filters? I hope you will answer my question, may Allah bless you.\nHe replied: It is not permissible to introduce these vocal effects into recitation of Qur’an. End quote.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The topic of using auto-tune and vocal effects when reciting the Holy Qur'an is a sensitive issue within Islamic discourse. While the Qur'an emphasizes the importance of its recitation, the use of technology in vocal enhancement raises questions about authenticity, intention, and respect for the text. Below are some points to consider, supported by relevant verses from the Qur'an.\n\n### 1. **Respect for the Qur'an**\nThe Qur'an is regarded as the literal word of God in Islam, and its recitation holds significant importance. As highlighted in Surah Al-Ahqaf (46:29–33), the jinn listened attentively to the Qur'an and showed a deep reverence for its verses. This underscores that the recitation should be sincere and respectful:\n- **Surah Al-Ahqaf (46:29-33):** \"And (remember), when We turned a company of jinns towards you to listen to the Qur'an... They said: 'We have listened to a Book which has come down after Moses...'\"\n\nThe emphasis on attentiveness and reverence in listening to the Qur'an suggests that any alterations or effects that distract from its delivery may not align with its sacred nature.\n\n### 2. **Moderation and Avoiding Excess**\nSurah Luqman (31:19) advises moderation in our speech and presentation, implying that any attempt to present the Qur'an should remain within the bounds of respect and sincerity:\n- **Surah Luqman (31:19):** \"Be moderate in your bearing, and keep your voice low. Surely the most repulsive voice is the donkey's.\"\n\nThe use of auto-tune, which can exaggerate or alter a voice significantly, could be viewed as inappropriate \"excess\" and thus detrimental to the spiritual and humble nature that should accompany Qur'anic recitation.\n\n### 3. **Authenticity of the Qur'anic Message**\nIn Surah Al-Furqan (25:30), the Prophet laments how his people have abandoned the Qur'an:\n- **Surah Al-Furqan (25:30):** \"The prophet will say: 'O my Lord, my people had fettered the Qur'an.'\"\n\nThis verse intimates that the essence of the Qur'an should remain intact. Any intentional alteration through technology could be seen as compromising its authenticity and message.\n\n### 4. **Intent and Purpose**\nThe intention behind using vocal effects is critical. If the aim is to beautify the recitation for better engagement, it can be debated. However, one must reflect on whether this intent aligns with the Qur'an’s call to convey its message clearly and purely:\n- **Surah Al-Furqan (25:51):** \"Had We pleased We could have raised a warner in every town. So do not listen to unbelievers, and strive against them with greater effort.\"\n\nThe emphasis is on the delivery of the message rather than personal embellishments.\n\n### 5. **Community and Traditional Practices**\nLastly, traditional practices among Muslims regarding Qur'anic recitation often discourage any additions or alterations to protect the sanctity of the text. Respect for established methods of recitation (Tajweed) and the collective memory of how the Qur'an has been passed down through generations further emphasizes the value of maintaining its original integrity.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, using auto-tune and vocal effects for the recitation of the Holy Qur'an raises several concerns regarding respect, authenticity, and intention. While engaging audiences is important, it must not come at the cost of altering the Qur'an’s revered status and message. Reflecting on the aforementioned verses provides deeper insight into the attitude Muslims are encouraged to have towards the Holy Book. In this context, vocal effects may not be appropriate, as they might detract from the authenticity and the essence of the Qur'anic recitation."

        "question": "If he is interrupted when reading Qur’an, does he have to repeat the isti‘aadah when wants to resume?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If someone interrupts his reading or recitation of Qur’an for a valid reason, such as sneezing, or returning the greeting of salaam, or answering a question, and the like, and he intends to complete his reading once the excuse is no longer there, then the first isti‘aadhah (“A‘oodhu Billahi min ash-shaytaan ir-rajeem (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed shaytaan)”) is sufficient, and he does not have to repeat it, unless the interruption goes on for a long time, in which case he should repeat it.\nIbn al-Muflih said in al-Aadaab ash-Shar‘iyyah (2/326):\nIt is Sunnah to seek refuge with Allah (by saying “A‘oodhu Billahi min ash-shaytaan ir-rajeem (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed shaytaan)”) when starting to read or recite Qur’an.\nBut if he stops reading with the intention of not resuming, he should repeat the isti‘aadhah when he comes back to it.\nIf he is interrupted by an excuse, and has resolved to complete it when the excuse is no longer there, then the first isti‘aadhah is sufficient. End quote.\nAr-Ruhaybaani said in Mataalib Ooli an-Nuha fi Sharh Ghaayat al-Muntaha (1/599):\nIf he stops reading with the intention of not resuming, then he wants to go back to it, he should repeat the isti‘aadhah.\nIf he interrupts it for an excuse, and has resolved to complete it when the excuse is no longer there, such as taking something or giving something, or answering a questioner, or sneezing, and so on, then he does not have to repeat the isti‘aadhah, because he is continuing his reading. End quote.\nThis applies if the interruption is not lengthy. But if the interruption is lengthy, then it is Sunnah for him to repeat the isti‘aadhah.\nAz-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is recommended (mustahabb) to seek refuge with Allah (isti‘aadhah) before starting to recite, then if he stops reading with the intention of not resuming then later on he wants to resume, he should repeat the isti‘aadhah.\nIf he interrupts it for an excuse and has resolved to go back to it, the first isti‘aadhah is sufficient, so long as the interruption is not lengthy.\" (Al-Burhaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an  1/460).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo‘ (3/281):\nOne isti‘aadhah is sufficient, so long as he did not interrupt his recitation by speaking or remaining silent for a long time.\nIf he interrupts it with one of these two, then he should repeat the isti‘aadhah.\nIf he does the prostration of recitation then carries on reading or reciting, he does not need to repeat the isti‘aadhah, because this is not an interruption, or it is only a brief interruption. This was stated by al-Mutawalli. End quote.\nBut if he interrupted it for a reason having to do with his reading, such as asking a question or seeking an explanation of the verses that he is reading and the like, he does not have to repeat the isti‘aadhah. Ibn al-Jazari said in an-Nashr (1/259):\nIf the reader interrupts his reading for a reason, such as pausing to offer a supplication, or to say something that has to do with what he is reading, he does not have to repeat the isti‘aadhah. End quote.\nIf he repeats the isti‘aadhah after interrupting his reading by saying something that has nothing to do with the recitation – such as greeting someone with salaam – that is good.\nAn-Nawawi said in at-Tibyaan (p. 124):\nIf he is reciting whilst walking, and passes by some people, it is recommended (mustahabb) to interrupt his recitation and treat them with salaam, then go back to his recitation. And if he repeats the isti‘aadhah, that is good. End quote.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the context of Islamic practice, when someone is reading the Qur’an and is interrupted, it is considered preferred (mustahabb) for them to re-initiate the recitation by saying the *isti‘aadah*, which is the phrase \"A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim\" (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed devil). The reason behind this practice is a reflection of the continuous attitude of seeking protection from distractions and evil influences that could hinder one’s focus and devotion while reciting the Sacred Text.\n\nWhile the Qur'an does not explicitly detail this practice in terms of being interrupted or resuming recitation, we can derive important insights from various verses. For instance, in Surah Al-Muzzammil (Chapter 73), Allah instructs believers to \"recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily\" (Al-Muzzammil, 73:20). This suggests flexibility in the recitation process, indicating that believers can take breaks yet should maintain some level of commitment and focus when engaging with the Qur'an.\n\nMoreover, Surah Al-Qiyamah (Chapter 75), emphasizes that the responsibility for the Qur'an's recitation and collection lies with Allah (75:17-19). It underscores the importance of articulation and intentionality in recitation, which could support the idea that upon resuming after an interruption, seeking refuge with Allah is pertinent to maintain purity of intention while continuing the recitation.\n\n### Key Citations:\n1. **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**: \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily. He knows some among you will be sick, and some will be traveling over the earth in search of the bounty of God...\"\n\n2. **Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:17-19)**: \"Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\"\n\nTherefore, whilst not a strict obligation, repeating the *isti‘aadah* upon resuming recitation is encouraged and aligns with the general principle of seeking protection and maintaining a focused and respectful state when engaging with the Qur'an."

        "question": "What Is the Last Verse Revealed in the Quran?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed as to which was the last verse of the Quran to be revealed, and there are several views, as each of the scholars spoke of the conclusion to which his Ijtihad (reaching rulings on the basis of individual opinion based on Shar’i evidence) led. There is nothing that has been soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) concerning this matter that could be definitive.\nMost of the scholars are of the view that the last verse to be revealed was the verse in Surah Al-Baqarah in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah. Then every soul will be compensated for what it earned, and they will not be treated unjustly} [Al-Baqarah 2:281]\nJalal Ad-Din As-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThere is a difference of scholarly opinion as to which verse was the last to be revealed.\n·        Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated that Al-Bara’ ibn `Azib said: The last verses to be revealed were:\n{They request from you a [legal] ruling. Say, “Allah gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants [as heirs]”} [An-Nisa’ 4:176] and the end of Surah At-Tawbah.\n·        Al-Bukhari narrated that Ibn `Abbas said: The last verse to be revealed was the verse of Riba. Al-Bayhaqi narrated something similar from `Umar.\nWhat is meant is the verse in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest …} [Al-Baqarah 2:278]\n·        An-Nasa’i narrated via `Ikrimah that Ibn `Abbas said: The last verse of the Quran to be revealed is (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah… } [Al-Baqarah 2:281]\n·        Ibn Abu Hatim narrated that Sa‘id ibn Jubayr said: The last verse of the entire Quran to be revealed was (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah… } [Al-Baqarah 2:281]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) lived for nine more days after this verse was revealed, then he died on the night before Monday, the second day of Rabi‘ Al-Awwal.\nIbn Jarir narrated a similar report from Ibn Jurayaj.\n·        And he narrated via `Atiyyah that Abu Sa`id said: The last verse to be revealed was (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah… } [Al-Baqarah 2:281]\n·        Abu ‘Ubayd narrated in Al-Fada’il that Ibn Shihab said: The last verse of the Quran be revealed was the verse of Riba [Al-Baqarah 2:278] and the verse of debt [Al-Baqarah 2:282].\n·        In Al-Mustadrak it is narrated that Ubay ibn Ka`b said: The last verse to be revealed was (interpretation of the meaning): {There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves} [At-Tawbah 9:128] until the end of the Surah.\n·        Ibn Mardawayh also narrated that Ubay said: The last verses of the Quran to be revealed were these two verses (interpretation of the meaning): {There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves…} [At-Tawbah 9:128-129]. Abu Ash-Shaykh narrated in his Tafsir via ‘Ali ibn Zayd, from Yusuf Al-Makki, that Ibn `Abbas said: The last verse to be revealed was (interpretation of the meaning): {There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves} [At-Tawbah 9:128].” (Al-Itqan fi `Ulum Al-Quran (1/101-103) See also: Tafsir Ibn Katheer (2/168)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe soundest view regarding the last verse of the Quran to be revealed is that it was the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah… } [Al-Baqarah 2:281]” Fath Al-Bari (8/317)\nAbu Bakr Al-Baqillani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The Companions and those who came after them differed concerning which verse of the Quran was the last to be revealed… Then he mentioned the different views, then he said:\nThere is no report which can be attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) concerning that.

Learning about that is not something essential, and it is not something concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said something that he explained and made known to people, or made it obligatory to know about it and made it something by means of which proof could be established.\nIt may be that what was stated by each of those whose view we have mentioned above was based on the last thing that he heard from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and someone else heard something that was revealed after that, and the first one did not hear [what was revealed later] because he was not present, and the revelation [of more verses] came down after that.\nThen he discussed the reasons why there are different views regarding this issue.

        "predicted_answer": "The question of what constitutes the last verse revealed in the Quran has been a topic of discussion among scholars and historians of Islamic tradition. Traditionally, one of the last verses believed to have been revealed is from Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), specifically Ayah 281. This verse emphasizes the importance of being conscious of Allah and the consequences of actions, thus serving as a moral and ethical reminder.\n\n### The Last Verse Revealed\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), Ayah 281**\n  - **Verse**: \"This Day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.\"\n  - **Citation**: Al-Baqarah, 2:281\n\nThis verse is regarded as significant because it encapsulates the completion and perfection of the teachings of Islam. It signifies a formal announcement that the teachings and guidance provided through the Quran and the life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) are comprehensive and sufficient for the followers of Islam.\n\n### Supporting Verses\n\nIn addition to Al-Baqarah, other verses regarded as late revelations include:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (Chapter 5), Ayah 3**\n  - **Verse**: \"Prohibited to you are [the] dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah...\"\n  - **Citation**: Al-Ma'idah, 5:3\n\nThis verse also highlights the completion of dietary laws and regulations that are integral to Islamic practice.\n\n- **Surah Al-Nasr (Chapter 110), entire chapter**\n  - This Surah, dealing with the victory of Islam, is also considered one of the last chapters revealed, providing assurance to the believers of God's support and the finality of their mission.\n  - **Citation**: Al-Nasr, 110:1-3\n\n### Historical Context\n\nThe majority of the Islamic scholarship suggests that the revelation in the Quran concluded with these final verses during the Farewell Pilgrimage in the 10th year of Hijrah (632 CE), shortly before the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) passed away. The declaration of the completion of religion indicated a critical period in the establishment of Islamic jurisprudence and community.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while multiple verses are significant towards the end of the Quran, the consensus on the last verse often refers to Surah Al-Baqarah 2:281 as a critical turning point within the Islamic tradition. Understanding the context of these revelations is crucial for interpreting their continued relevance in guiding the lives of Muslims today."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The cover of a Mus-haf that is attached to it with binding or glue, and the like, comes under the same ruling as the Mus-haf. So it is not permissible for anyone who does not have Wudu to touch it. \nAs for the cover that is separate from the Mus-haf , like the sleeve in which the Mus-haf is placed to protect it, there is nothing wrong with touching it without Wudu.\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah: \n“The majority of jurists – Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi`is and Hanbalis – are of the view that it is not allowed for one who is not in a state of purity to touch the cover of the Mus-haf that is attached to it, or the margins on which there is no writing on the pages of the Mus-haf, or the white spaces between the lines, and the same applies to pages that are free of any writing at all. That is because they are part of the book. Some of the Hanafis and Shafa`is are of the view that that is permissible.”\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“It is not permissible for the Muslim to touch the Mus-haf unless he is in a state of purity and free of both major and minor impurity. The same applies to moving it from one place to another, if the one who is moving it is not in a state of purity.\nBut if he touches it or moves it with a barrier, such as if he picks it up in a wrapper or sleeve, and the like, there is nothing wrong with that. As for touching it directly when he is not in a state of purity, that is not permissible according to the correct view, which is the view of the majority of scholars, for the reasons mentioned above. \nAs for reciting or reading, there is nothing wrong with him reciting it from memory even if he is in a state of minor impurity , or reading when someone else hold the Quran for him and prompts him; there is nothing wrong with that.\" (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz  10/149-150)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the issue of whether one can touch the Mus-haf (the physical copy of the Quran) without having ablution (wudu) is a matter of scholarly debate and interpretation among Islamic scholars.\n\n### A. The Necessity of Wudu\n\n1. **Quranic Basis:** The main verse cited by scholars regarding the requirement of ablution when touching something sacred is from Surah Al-Ma'idah:\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:6):** \"O you who believe, when you stand up for prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows, and wipe over your heads, and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of sexual impurity (janabah), then purify yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey, or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself, or you have contacted women and find no water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it. Allah does not wish to make difficulty for you, but He wishes to purify you and complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful.\"\n   - Here, this verse is primarily discussing the act of prayer and the requirement of wudu before performing it; thus, it shows the general need for physical purity.\n\n2. **Hadith on the Quran:** A hadith reported by Ibn 'Abbas is often referenced by scholars on this matter:\n   - **Sahih Muslim:** \"It is not allowed for anyone to touch the Quran unless he is in a state of purity.\"\n   - This hadith supports the idea that physical purity (through wudu) is necessary when engaging with the Quran.\n\n### B. Scholarly Opinions\n\n1. **The Opinion of Majority Scholars:** The general consensus among the majority of scholars is that one must be in a state of wudu to touch the Mus-haf. This ruling is based on the aforementioned verse and hadith. Scholars argue that since the Quran is considered the word of Allah, it should be treated with the utmost respect, and being in a state of purity is part of that respect.\n\n2. **Exceptions:** Some scholars, however, allow for exceptions. They argue that if it is a non-Muslim or someone who may be in a state of impurity (like menstruation), touching the Quran is still discouraged but may not necessarily invalidate their access to it. The Quran can still be read from memory or recited without touching the physical Mus-haf without wudu.\n\n### C. Summary of Ruling\n\n- The general ruling is that to touch the Mus-haf directly, one should ideally be in a state of wudu to show respect for the sacred text. This is derived from both Quranic verses and hadith.\n- Instances where wudu is not required include reading from memory or engaging in recitation without physical contact.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, according to Islamic jurisprudence, it is recommended and preferred to perform wudu before touching the Mus-haf. The evidence for this can be found in **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:6)** and related **Hadiths**. Maintaining the sanctity of the Quran reflects not only a legal requirement but also the believer's respect and reverence for the divine word of Allah."

        "question": "The sending down of the Quran began on Laylat al-Qadr in Ramadan, but fasting was not enjoined until the second year AH",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Quran was revealed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at the beginning of his mission, and the first revelation came in the month of Ramadan, on Laylat al-Qadr, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, We sent the Quran down during the Night of Decree} [al-Qadr 97:1]\n{Ha, Meem.\nBy the clear Book. \nIndeed, We sent it down during a blessed night. Indeed, We were to warn [mankind]} [ad-Dukhaan 44:1-3].\nThen it continued to be sent down piecemeal until shortly before the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [it is] a Quran which We have separated [by intervals] that you might recite it to the people over a prolonged period. And We have sent it down progressively} [al-Isra’ 17:106].\nFasting was not enjoined at that time; rather fasting was not enjoined until the second year AH – in other words, fifteen years after the revelation of the Quran began.\nSo there is no connection between the sending down of the Quran and fasting.\nRather the connection is between the Quran and the month of Ramadan and Laylat al-Qadr. The month of Ramadan was known before the Prophet's mission began and afterwards, as were all the other [Arabic] months.\nThere is no connection between Laylat al-Qadr and fasting, because Laylat al-Qadr is a night in the month of Ramadan, which was known before fasting was enjoined.\nWhat appears to be the case is that this is the reason for your question, which is that you think that there is a connection between Laylat al-Qadr and fasting, and you have not borne in mind the fact that this night and the month in which it occurs were known even before fasting was enjoined.\nTo sum up:\nThe sending down of the Quran began in Ramadan of the first year of the Prophet’s mission, and continued for 23 years.\nWith regard to fasting, it was enjoined approximately fifteen years after the Prophet’s mission began – that is, after the first words of the Quran were revealed – and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fasted nine Ramadans; during these years, the Quran continued to be revealed.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words of Allah, may He be exalted, {Indeed, We sent it down} refer to the Quran. It is not mentioned by name in this soorah because what is being referred to is clear, and the entire Quran is like a single soorah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Quran} [al-Baqarah 2:185]\n{Ha, Meem.\nBy the clear Book. \nIndeed, We sent it down during a blessed night} [ad-Dukhaan 44:1-3]\n– what is meant is on Laylat al-Qadr.\nAsh-Sha‘bi said: What is meant is: We began to send it down on Laylat al-Qadr.\nAnd it was said: Rather Jibreel (peace be upon him) brought it all down at once on Laylat al-Qadr, from al-Lawh al-Mahfooz to the lowest heaven, to Bayt al-'Izzah, and Jibreel dictated it to the angelic scribes, then Jibreel brought it down to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) piecemeal, and between the first and the last of it there were twenty-three years. This was stated by Ibn 'Abbaas.\" (Tafseer at-Tabari  20/129).\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: The Battle of Badr took place in Ramadan of the second year AH, and during that year fasting was made obligatory.\" (Fath al-Baari  1/50).\nFor more information on the sending down of the Quran piecemeal, please see the answer to question no. 180883 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The topic of the Quran's revelation and the obligation of fasting in Islam is significant in understanding the early practices and injunctions of the faith. The Quran was indeed first revealed during the month of Ramadan on a night known as Laylat al-Qadr, or the Night of Decree, which is described in the Quran as being \"better than a thousand months\" (Surah Al-Qadr, 97:3). The relevant verses from the Quran concerning this event and the subsequent institution of fasting are detailed as follows:\n\n### 1. Revelation of the Quran\nThe Quran explicitly states that Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed:\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 185:** \"Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to mankind and clear proof of guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong).\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:185). \n\nThis verse highlights the significance of the month of Ramadan as the time when the Quran was first revealed, acting as a source of guidance for humanity.\n\n### 2. The Enjoining of Fasting\nFasting became obligatory after a few revelations following the migration (Hijrah) to Medina, approximately in the second year AH (After Hijrah). The verses that discuss the obligation of fasting are as follows:\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 183-184:** \"O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous. [Fasting for] a limited number of days. And whoever among you is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. And upon those who are able [to fast, but with hardship] - a provision of food [is to be given]. And whoever volunteers excess - it is better for him. But to fast is best for you, if you only knew.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:183-184).\n\nThese verses express that fasting was ordained for the believers to foster piety, mirroring the experiences of previous communities.\n\n### 3. Guidelines for Fasting\nFurther clarifications about the observance of fasting are made in the following verses:\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 185-187:** \"Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to mankind and clear proof of guidance and the criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. And Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and wants for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that to which He has guided you; perhaps you will be grateful.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:185-187).\n\n### 4. Laylat Al-Qadr\nThe Night of Decree (Laylat al-Qadr), which is celebrated during the last ten days of Ramadan, holds special significance:\n- **Surah Al-Qadr, Ayah 1-5:** \"Indeed, We sent the Qur'an down during the Night of Decree. And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. The angels and the Spirit descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter.\" (Surah Al-Qadr, 97:1-5).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the Quran emphasizes both its revelation during Ramadan and the subsequent obligation of fasting, which was made mandatory in the second year after the Hijrah. Thus, the fasting practices in Islam are deeply rooted in these revelations and serve as a means for spiritual growth and gratitude to God.\n\nThese references elucidate the connection between the Quran's revelation and the observance of Ramadan as a month of fasting, reflecting the early development of Islamic practices."

        "question": "The final review of the Qur’an, and was any Qur’an revealed after that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat is meant by the review is that Jibreel reviewed the Qur’an with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) every year in Ramadan.\nIt was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: He [the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] told me: Jibreel used to review the Qur’an every year with him once or twice, but this year he reviewed it with him twice. He said: “I think that my death has drawn near, so fear Allah and be patient, for what a good example I am for you.” Narrated by Muslim (2450).\nAccording to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari (3624), “Jibreel used to review the Qur’an with me once every year, but this year he has reviewed it with me twice, and I think that my death is approaching, and you [Faatimah] will be the first of my family to join me.” So I [Faatimah] wept, then he said: “Does it not please you that you will be the leader of the women of Paradise, or of the believing women.” So I smiled at that.\nAmong the Sahaabah, ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood and Zayd ibn Thaabit witnessed this review.\nIbn Katheer said: What is meant by Jibreel’s reviewing the Qur’an with him every year is that he checked it to make sure that it was exactly as he had brought it down to him from Allah, may He be exalted, so that what was meant to remain would remain and what had been abrogated would not remain. This review was by way of verifying, ensuring and preserving, therefore the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reviewed it with Jibreel twice in the last year of his life, and Jibreel reviewed it with him. From this, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) understood that the time of his death was approaching.\n‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) compiled the master copy of the Mushaf on the basis of this final review.\nRamadan was chosen out of all of the months for this review, because the beginning of the revelation occurred during that month. Hence it is recommended (mustahabb) to study the Qur’an and recite it repeatedly in Ramadan, and the leading scholars strove hard in reciting the Qur’an in that month.\" (Tafseer Ibn Katheer  1/51).\nSecondly:\nThere is no cause for confusion in the fact that this annual review did not cover the entire Qur’an every single year, because the revelation of the Qur’an had not yet been completed. This is clear.\nThat is also applicable to what happened during the final review in Ramadan: the review was only of what had been revealed up to that point, and there is nothing to rule out that something could be revealed after Ramadan or after the final review of the Qur’an, that was not included in that review.\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The hadith indicates that the word Qur’an may refer to some of it or most of it, because at the time of the first review in the first Ramadan after the Prophet’s mission began, only some of the Qur’an had been revealed. Then it went on like that every Ramadan after it, until the final Ramadan, in which all of the Qur’an had been revealed except that which was delayed and was revealed after that particular Ramadan.\nFrom 10 AH and until the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died in Rabee‘ al-Awwal 11 AH, one of the verses that were revealed during that time was the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{This day I have perfected for you your religion} [al-Maa’idah 5:3].\nThis verse was revealed on the day of ‘Arafah, when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was in ‘Arafah, according to scholarly consensus.\nIt is as if what was revealed during those days, because it was so little compared to what had already been revealed, was overlooked as far as reviewing it was concerned.\" (Fath al-Baari  9/44).\nFor more information on the issue of the final review of the Qur’an, please see: al-‘Ardah al-Akheerah: Dalaalaatuha wa Atharuha, by Dr. Naasir al-Quthaami, Chair in Qur’anic Sciences.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The final review of the Qur’an signifies its completeness and confirmation that there will be no further revelations after it. The consensus among Islamic scholars is that the Qur'an is the last book of divine guidance, and no new scriptures or revelations will follow. This belief is supported by several verses throughout the Qur’an.\n\n1. **Finality of the Qur'an**: \n\n   The Qur'an itself emphasizes its unique position as the last scripture. One of the most explicit verses stating this is:\n   \n   - **Surah 5 (Al-Ma'idah), Ayah 3**: \"This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.\"\n     \n   This verse indicates that the religion of Islam and the Qur’an have been fully completed and perfected, leaving no room for further revelations.\n\n2. **Protection of the Qur'an**:\n\n   Another verse that underlines the significance and protection of the Qur'an from alteration or loss is:\n   \n   - **Surah 15 (Al-Hijr), Ayah 9**: \"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian.\"\n   \n   This assurance of divine protection underlines the Qur'an's finality and the importance of its preservation as the ultimate guideline for humanity.\n\n3. **Revelation Process**:\n\n   The Qur'an was revealed over a period of 23 years and was sent down gradually to fortify the heart of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). As mentioned in:\n   \n   - **Surah 25 (Al-Furqan), Ayah 32-33**: \"And those who disbelieve say, 'Why was the Qur'an not revealed to him all at once?' Thus, We [We] set it forth that We might strengthen thereby your heart.\"\n  \n   This verse indicates that the stepwise revelation served a purpose in providing reassurance and guidance to the Prophet and the believers during their challenging times.\n\n4. **Significance of the Final Messenger**:\n\n   The finality of the Qur'an is also mirrored in the finality of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the last messenger:\n   \n   - **Surah 33 (Al-Ahzab), Ayah 40**: \"Muhammad is not the father of any one of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last of the prophets.\"\n   \n   This relationship suggests that since Muhammad is the last prophet, the Qur'an given to him is the last revelation.\n\nGiven these verses, it is clear that no Qur'an or scripture will be revealed after the Qur'an that was bestowed upon the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The belief in the finality of the Qur'an holds a central place in Islamic theology, reinforcing its status as the ultimate guidance for humanity until the Day of Judgment."

        "question": "Putting a recording of du ‘aa’, Qur’an or the adhaan as a dial tone whilst waiting for someone to answer the phone",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The “Sada” service allows you to choose a particular sound that only the one who is making the call can hear. Some people choose this sound to be Qur’an, the adhaan, a du‘aa’ or a beneficial nasheed, and some choose it to be a song or music, and so on.\nIn principle, there is nothing wrong with this service, so long as the sound that the caller chooses is something permissible.\nIt is not permissible for this sound to be music or indecent songs, because of the proof that songs and music are haraam. This has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 5000 .\nWith regard to choosing the sound of a qaari’ reciting Qur’an, this may be a type of disrespect towards the Holy Qur’an, because Allah, may He be exalted, sent down the Qur’an to be read, reflected upon, recited as an act of worship and acted upon.\nThe words of Allah, may He be exalted, are too great for us to make them simply a means of passing the time or to alert us to something.\nSimilarly, with regard to the adhaan, it was prescribed to alert people to the best and most important act of worship in Islam, namely the prayer, so it is deserving of appropriate respect and veneration. Therefore it should not be used for this service.\nWith regard to du‘aa’, the matter is more lenient.\nShaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserving) was asked: What is your opinion on those who put the adhaan or recitation of the Holy Qur’an as ring tones on their mobile phones instead of music?\nHe replied: This is disrespectful towards the adhaan, dhikr and the Noble Qur’an; they should not be used as alarms, and the Qur’an should not be used as an alarm. \nIt may be said: This is better than music. Do you have to use music?

        "predicted_answer": "Putting a recording of du‘aa (supplications), the Qur'an, or the adhaan (call to prayer) as a dial tone while waiting for someone to answer the phone raises questions concerning the permissibility and appropriateness of such actions in Islam. Here, we will analyze this topic thoroughly while referencing relevant Islamic teachings and the Qur'anic verses provided.\n\n### 1. The Nature of Du‘aa and the Qur'an\n\nIn Islam, du‘aa and the recitation of the Qur'an are highly regarded acts of worship. They serve as means of communication with Allah (SWT) and can bring spiritual tranquility and blessings. The Qur'an itself encourages believers to remember Allah and engage in prayer.\n\nFor instance, in Surah Ad-Duhaa (Chapter 93), Allah highlights His continuous support and the importance of patience and gratitude in the early verses (93:1-5):\n\n- \"I CALL TO witness the early hours of morning, And the night when dark and still, Your Lord has neither left you, nor despises you. What is to come is better for you than what has gone before; For your Lord will certainly give you, and you will be content.\" (Surah Ad-Duhaa: 93:1-5)\n\n### 2. The Importance of Respecting Words of Worship\n\nWhen it comes to using sacred sounds, such as Qur'an readings or the adhaan, as ring tones or dial tones, Muslim scholars emphasize the need for respect and reverence. The communication of sacred texts needs to be treated appropriately.\n\nSurah Al-Hujurat (Chapter 49) stresses the respect due to the Prophet Muhammad and authoritative speech:\n\n- \"O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, and do not speak loudly to him as you do with one another lest your deeds are nullified unconsciously.\" (Surah Al-Hujurat: 49:2)\n\nAmplifying divine words or calls in a common, casual context (like a phone ring tone) can sometimes be seen as lacking the necessary reverence that such acts deserve.\n\n### 3. The Context of the Adhaan\n\nThe adhaan is not merely a notification; it is an act of worship that serves specific purposes in the Islamic tradition, marking the times for prayer. Utilizing it as a phone ring tone can degrade its sanctity. Many scholars would suggest that, while the adhaan is a respected practice, it is best reserved for its intended purpose — inviting people to prayer — rather than being used as a casual notification:\n\n- \"Many of those who call you from outside the apartments are not considerate. If they had waited for you to come out it would have been better for them. But God is forgiving and kind.\" (Surah Al-Hujurat: 49:5)\n\nThis verse reflects on how communication should be respectful and that certain contexts may require a more considerate approach.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while using recordings of du‘aa, the Qur'an, or the adhaan as a dial tone may not directly contravene any explicit commands in the Qur'an, doing so may not show the required respect for these sacred practices. It can be seen as trivializing forms of worship that should be approached with sincerity and reverence. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious and respectful regarding how sacred sounds are used in everyday life. \n\nFor deeper understanding and more nuanced views, scholars often encourage individuals to consult knowledgeable persons or local Islamic authorities."

        "question": "Definition of al-Mufassal in the Quran, and the long and short soorahs of al-Mufassal",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nAl-Mufassal refers to the short soorahs of the Quran which have many breaks between them, in which the Basmalah (“Bismillah al-Rahmaan al-Raheem”) appears. They are called mufassal (divided) because a lot of breaks appear in them. \nThere was a difference of scholarly opinion concerning the definition of al-Mufassal. Does it begin from Soorat Qaaf or from al-Hujuraat? There was also a difference of opinion as to which soorahs are regarded as long, medium and short. There are several opinions: \nIn al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (33/48) it says: They differed concerning al-Mufassal. The Hanafis are of the view that the long soorahs of al-Mufassal start with al-Hujuraat and end with al-Burooj; the medium soorahs begin there and end with al-Bayyinah; and the short soorahs begin there and go to the end of the Quran. \nThe Maalikis said that the long soorahs of al-Mufassal start with al-Hujuraat and end with al-Naazi‘aat; the medium soorahs begin with ‘Abasa and end with al-Duha; and the short soorahs begin with al-Duha, until the end of the Quran. \nThe Shaafa‘is said: The long soorahs of al-Mufassal are soorahs such as al-Hujuraat, al-Qamar and al-Rahmaan; the medium soorahs are soorahs such as al-Shams and al-Layl; and the short soorahs are soorahs such as al-‘Asr and Qul Huwa Allah Ahad (al-Ikhlaas), \nThe Hanbalis are of the view that al-Mufassal begins with Soorah Qaaf, because of the hadith of Aws ibn Hudhayfah who said: I asked the companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah upon him) how they divided the Quran. They said, Three and five and seven and nine and eleven and thirteen, and Hizb al-Mufassal [This refers to the number of soorahs in each hizb or portion of Quran. Thus the first hizb contains the first three soorahs, the second contains the next five soorahs, and so on. Hizb al-Mufassal is the last portion of the Quran, from Soorat Qaf until the end]. Narrated by Abu Dawood (1396) and Ibn Maajah (1345); its isnaad was classed as hasan by Ibn Katheer in Fadaa’il al-Quran (83) and as da ‘eef (weak) by al-Albaani in Da‘eef Abi Dawood. They said: This implies that the beginning of al-Mufassal is the forty-ninth soorah from the beginning of al-Baqarah, not from al-Faatihah. The end of the long soorahs is al-Naba’, the medium soorahs go up to al-Duha and the short soorahs go from there to the end of the Quran. End quote. \nSee: Fath al-Baari, 2/249; al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Quran by al-Suyooti, 1/180 \nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nAl-Mufassal starts with Soorah Qaaf and goes to the end of the Quran, according to the sound opinion. It is called mufassal because there many breaks between the soorahs, where the Basmalah appears, according to the correct opinion. End quote from Fath al-Baari, 2/295. See also Fath al-Baari, 9/43. \nSecondly: \nWith regard to who first called that al-Mufassal, this name was widespread and well known among the Sahaabah and was narrated in many various hadiths from the Sahaabah. \nA man came to Ibn Mas‘ood and said: I recited al-Mufassal last night in one rak‘ah. He said: This is like the hasty recitation of poetry. I know the pairs of soorahs that the Messenger of Allah (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite in each rak‘ah. And he mentioned twenty soorahs from al-Mufassal, two soorahs in each rak‘ah. \nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (775), Muslim (922). \nThe hadiths in which the name al-Mufassal is mentioned are very many and various, in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere, which makes it likely that this name was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). \nIt was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Mu‘aadh used to pray with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then he would go back and lead his people in prayer. [One night] he prayed ‘Isha’ and started to recite Soorat al-Baqarah, and one man left the congregation (and prayed by himself). It was as if Mu‘aadh criticized him. News of that reached the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he said: “[You are] one who puts people off praying in congregation, one who puts people off praying in congregation, one who puts people off praying in congregation roblems,” three times, and he told him to recite two of the medium-length soorahs of al-Mufassal. ‘Amr - the narrator of the hadith - said: I do not remember them. \nNarrated by al-Bukhari (701) and Muslim (465). \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Definition of al-Mufassal in the Quran\n\n**Al-Mufassal** refers to a specific classification of Surahs (chapters) in the Quran that are known for their detailed and more explicit nature in terms of both style and content. The term \"Mufassal\" literally translates to \"the detailed\" or \"the explicated.\" It is generally understood to encompass the Surahs that provide substantial detail about Islamic teachings, laws, and narratives.\n\nIn classical Islamic scholarship, **al-Mufassal** includes Surahs from Surah 50 (Qaf) to Surah 114 (An-Nas). This section of the Quran is distinctive because it features shorter verses and often addresses the beliefs and practices of the Muslim community, making it more accessible and applicable for the believers.\n\n### Long and Short Surahs of al-Mufassal\n\n1. **Long Surahs of al-Mufassal**: \n   - Among the longer Surahs in the category of al-Mufassal are:\n     - **Surah Al-Hadid (Iron)** - Surah 57\n     - **Surah Al-Mujadila (The Pleading Woman)** - Surah 58\n     - **Surah Al-Hashr (The Exile)** - Surah 59\n     - **Surah Al-Mumtahana (She That is to be Examined)** - Surah 60\n     - These Surahs contain extensive discussions on social, ethical, and spiritual matters.\n\n2. **Short Surahs of al-Mufassal**:\n   - The shorter Surahs that belong to al-Mufassal typically include:\n     - **Surah Al-Nas (The Mankind)** - Surah 114\n     - **Surah Al-Falaq (The Daybreak)** - Surah 113\n     - **Surah Al-Ikhlas (The Sincerity)** - Surah 112\n     - **Surah Al-Masad (The Palm Fiber)** - Surah 111\n     - **Surah An-Nasr (The Divine Support)** - Surah 110\n     - These Surahs are often recited for blessings, protection, and supplication.\n\nIn summary, the classification of **al-Mufassal** emphasizes the increased detail found in the latter part of the Quran, which serves as a guide to Islamic beliefs and practices, particularly from Surah 50 to Surah 114. This division aids in understanding the transition from the Meccan to Medinan periods of revelation, where themes of community, prayer, and the responsibilities of believers are more pronounced."

        "question": "Ruling on memorizing Qur’an using the “five fortresses” method",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The “five fortresses” method for memorizing the Qur’an is a method based on a plan for preparing the pages that one wants to memorize, a method for memorizing and a method for reviewing what one has previously memorized.\nIt is a method that includes reading from the Mushaf, listening to a skilled narrator, repeating what one wants to memorize, then reviewing what one has memorized without looking at the Mushaf.\nBased on that, it does not seem that there is anything objectionable about this method. Rather it is a good method that connects the Muslim to the Qur’an on a daily basis, and gets him used to reciting the Qur’an and not forget it. It is well known that educational means and methods of reviewing and memorizing, and the like, are only means of acquiring knowledge and memorizing and reviewing the Holy Qur’an.\nThe ruling on these means is that they are permissible, so long as Islam has not forbidden them.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a method is not forbidden and it is effective, then there is nothing wrong with it. Means are not the same as objectives, and it is not essential that Islam should state for every means or method that it is permissible or otherwise, because means and methods are innumerable and unlimited, so everything that is a means of achieving good is good. End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab (15/30).\nMoreover, when determining whether a particular method is better and choosing it over others, we should look at experience and what is best suited to each individual. What is suitable and beneficial to one person is not always suitable and beneficial for another; rather it may be suitable for someone else, or some other method may be more beneficial for him. So each person should look at what is most suitable for him and will help him. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless.”\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "**Ruling on Memorizing the Qur’an Using the “Five Fortresses” Method**\n\nThe practice of memorizing the Qur’an is highly encouraged in Islam, and various methods can be employed to achieve this goal. One such method is known as the “five fortresses” method, which involves a structured approach to memorization that can help reinforce retention. This method comprises five stages:\n\n1. **Listening and Repetition**: The student listens to a verse multiple times before reciting it themselves. This foundational step helps in auditory learning and prepares the learner for the subsequent stages.\n  \n2. **Visual Engagement**: The learner reads the verse while observing the written text. This visual component enhances memory retention by connecting the auditory and visual parts of learning.\n\n3. **Reinforced Recitation**: After familiarizing themselves with the verse, learners recite it aloud with a teacher or in front of peers. This boosts their confidence and improves pronunciation.\n\n4. **Review and Reflection**: The memorized verses are reviewed multiple times to solidify the knowledge and understanding of their meanings. Reflecting on the verses aligns with the Islamic tenet of contemplating the Qur’an.\n\n5. **Application in Prayer**: Finally, the memorized verses are incorporated into daily prayers, enabling the learner to not only memorize but also understand and appreciate the context of the verses being recited.\n\nSupporting this approach, the following Qur’anic verses highlight the importance of recitation and remembrance of the Qur’an:\n\n1. **Surah Al-A'la (87:6-10)**:\n   - \"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, Unless God may please. He knows the visible and knows what is hidden. We shall take you slowly towards ease. So remind them if reminder is profitable: Those who fear will understand.\"\n\n   This verse shows that God will facilitate the memorization of the Qur’an and that recitation is central to this process.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**:\n   - \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily, and be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and lend a goodly loan to God. And what you send for yourself of the good, you will find it with God better and greater in reward. So ask for God's forgiveness. Indeed God is forgiving and kind.\"\n\n   Here, the divine instruction emphasizes the importance of reading the Qur’an regularly, which corresponds with the review process advocated in the five fortresses method.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:30)**:\n   - \"The Prophet will say: 'O my Lord, my people had fettered the Qur'an.'\"\n\n   This verse reflects the challenges faced by the Prophet in conveying the Qur’an, indicating the need for dedicated effort in understanding and memorization.\n\nIn practicing the “five fortresses” method of memorization, students engage with the text in a holistic manner—utilizing auditory, visual, and kinesthetic learning styles. This multilayered approach not only aids in memorization but also deepens the understanding and appreciation of the sacred text. Ultimately, the guidance provided in the Qur’an supports and encourages such methods of learning, which are designed to help believers internalize and live by the teachings of Islam."

        "question": "Reading Quran with an accent in which some letters such as tha’ and dhal are altered",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is obligatory to read Quran with the letters with which Allah has revealed it, with sound Arabic pronunciation, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And truly, this (the Quran) is a revelation from the Lord of the ‘Aalameen(mankind, jinn and all that exists),\n193. Which the trustworthy Rooh [Jibreel (Gabriel)] has brought down\n194. Upon your heart (O Muhammad) that you may be (one) of the warners,\n195. In the plain Arabic language” [al-Shu’ara 26:192-195] \n“Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran in order that you may understand” [Yoosuf 12:2]\nIt is not permissible for anyone to deliberately change any letter of it when he is able to pronounce it correctly. This is a kind of mistake which is a sin. \nIf a person finds it difficult to pronounce the letters correctly – such as people in whose language some of the Arabic letters, such as tha’, dhal and kha’ do not exist – they have to try to learn the correct pronunciation, but if they are unable to master it then they are excused, but their example should not be followed, and they should be called upon to strive their hardest to learn and correct their pronunciation. And none of them should lead the prayer, unless he is leading others like him who cannot pronounce well either. \nIbn al-Jazari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever is able to read the words of Allah with correct Arabic pronunciation but he deliberately pronounces it incorrectly like a non-Arab, out of arrogance, stubbornness and complacency, or because he is too proud to go to a scholar who could help him to correct his pronunciation, is undoubtedly falling short and sinning and being dishonest. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Religion is sincerity: to Allah, to His Book, to His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.” \nBut if a person’s tongue will not obey him or he cannot find someone to teach him the correct pronunciation, then Allah does not burden any soul beyond its scope. \nEnd quote from al-Nashr fi’l-Qiraa’aat al-‘Ashr, 1/299 \nIt should be noted that Allah has made it easy to memorize and recite Quran, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And We have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?” [al-Qamar 54:17]\nHence we see many of our brothers in the countries referred to who are able to pronounce the letters perfectly, better than many of their Arab brothers. So you should strive to learn the correct pronunciation and recite Quran with proper Tajweed, and not despair or give up.\n And Allah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "Reading the Quran with the correct pronunciation, known as \"Tajweed,\" is a significant practice in Islam. Tajweed encompasses the rules governing pronunciation during the recitation of the Quran. Altering the pronunciation of certain letters, such as \"ث\" (tha’) and \"ذ\" (dhal), can affect the meaning of words and therefore the integrity of the recitation.\n\n### Importance of Accurate Pronunciation\n\n1. **Maintaining the Integrity of the Quran:**\n   Mispronouncing letters can lead to misunderstandings of the text. Surah Al-Hijr mentions the significance of being a distinct warner and reflects the importance of clarity in conveying the message: \n   - \"And say: 'I am a distinct warner...'\" (Surah Al-Hijr, 15:89).\n\n2. **Reading Slowly and Clearly:**\n   The Quran encourages recitation with deliberation and care, which supports the idea that proper pronunciation is essential:\n   - \"We have divided the Qur'an into parts that you may recite it to men slowly, with deliberation.\" (Surah Al-Isra, 17:106).\n\n3. **God’s Guidance in Recitation:**\n   The importance of correct recitation is further emphasized in Surah Al-A'la, where Allah assures that He will teach what needs to be recited, enhancing the obligation to pronounce words accurately:\n   - \"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it...\" (Surah Al-A'la, 87:6).\n\n### Consequences of Mispronunciation\n\n1. **Impact on Understanding:**\n   Mispronunciating letters like \"ث\" (tha’) and \"ذ\" (dhal) may distort meanings significantly. The fundamental understanding of the Quran must be preserved in its original form, as stated:\n   - “Easy have We made the Qur'an to understand: So is there any one who will pay heed?” (Surah Al-Qamar, 54:17).\n\n2. **Hidden Veils Against Understanding:**\n   Surah Al-Isra indicates that if someone does not approach the Quran with respect, they may not comprehend its meanings due to the “veils” placed on their hearts:\n   - \"When you recite the Qur'an, We place a hidden veil between you and those who do not believe...\" (Surah Al-Isra, 17:45).\n\n### Spiritual and Educational Exhortations\n\n1. **Righteousness in Recitation:**\n   The act of reading the Quran should come with sincerity and correctness. The intention behind the recitation should focus on devotion and understanding. This importance is enshrined in various verses:\n   - \"Say: Call Him Allah or call Him Ar-Rahman; whatever the name you call Him by, all His names are beautiful.\" (Surah Al-Isra, 17:110).\n\n2. **Reminders of God’s Creativity:**\n   The Quran not only instructs on recitation but also on the beauty of God’s creation and the clarity with which He wants His commandments delivered. The revelation emphasizes clarity in expression:\n   - \"Created man, And taught him to express clearly.\" (Surah Ar-Rahman, 55:3).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, reading the Quran accurately is paramount in Islam, particularly when it involves preserving the pronunciation of letters such as \"ث\" (tha’) and \"ذ\" (dhal). This adherence to correct pronunciation helps maintain the integrity of the message intended by Allah. It is a responsibility of every Muslim reciting the Quran to strive for clarity in their recitation, as emphasized by various verses throughout the Quran. Mispronunciation not only alters meanings but also affects the spiritual connection one has with the sacred text, making it essential to learn Tajweed properly."

        "question": "Supplication after reciting Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt was narrated by an-Nasaa’i in as-Sunan al-Kubra (11067) and in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah (308), and by at-Taaraani in ad-Du‘aa’ (1912) that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never sat in any gathering, or recited Quran, or offered any prayer, but he concluded that with certain words. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I see that you never sit in a gathering, or recite Quran, or offer any prayer, but you conclude it with these words. He said: “Yes. Whoever spoke good words, that will be like a seal on what he did of good and whoever spoke ill, it will be an expiation for him: “Subhaanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika, laa ilaaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk (Glory and praise be to you, O Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You).”\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (3164).\nIn this hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained that the dhikr of expiation for a gathering should be said at the end of any gathering in which a man sits, whether it was a gathering of dhikr or a gathering in which there was some ill or idle talk, for if it was a gathering of dhikr, it will be a seal on it for him.\nAs-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant is that it will be an affirmation of what he did of good, and will raise his deed to such a level that Allah will accept it, and it will like a guarantee that it will not be rejected, and if it was otherwise, then it will be an expiation for him. See: Mir‘aat al-Mafaateeh (8/204).\nBased on that, it is mustahabb for the Muslim to end any gathering with these words, no matter what kind of gathering it was. If it was a gathering to read Quran or to offer a prayer, or he sat with his friends, or with his family members, or to reconcile between people, or any other gathering, then he wants to leave, he should recite this dhikr just before he gets up to leave, then he should get up.\nSecondly:\nThere is no proven supplication specifically for completing the Quran, neither this supplication nor any other. From what has been explained above, it is clear that this dhikr and du‘aa’ is not specifically for completing the Quran or anything else; rather it is general and may be recited in any gathering.\nHowever, the scholars have stated that it is mustahabb to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. An-Nawawi said: It is strongly encouraged (mustahabb)  to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. At-Tibyaan fi Aadaab Hamlat al-Quran (159).\nIbn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (2/126): It is mustahabb to gather one’s family and others when completing the Quran to listen to the supplication.\nAhmad said: When Anas completed the Quran, he would gather his family and his children.\nThat was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood and others.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 65581 and 37683 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the practice of supplication (du'a) after reciting the Quran is viewed as a meaningful way to seek guidance, express gratitude, and ask for one's needs from Allah. This practice is deeply rooted in the teachings of the Quran and the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n### The Importance of Listening and Reflecting on the Quran\n\nOne of the important aspects of Quranic recitation is to listen attentively and reflect on the meanings contained within it. Surah Al-A'raf emphasizes the importance of listening when the Quran is recited:\n\n**“When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.”**  \n*(Surah Al-A'raf, 7:204)*\n\nThis verse encourages believers to be attentive during the recitation, preparing their hearts for the subsequent supplications and reflections.\n\n### Humility and Sincerity in Supplication\n\nThe Quran also speaks about humility and the attitude one should have when turning to Allah in prayer. In Surah Al-Isra, it mentions the necessity of humility:\n\n**“And weeping they kneel down, and this increases their humility.”**  \n*(Surah Al-Isra, 17:109)*\n\nThis verse indicates that a sincere approach, often accompanied by humility, is essential when engaging in du'a after Quranic recitation.\n\n### Seeking Forgiveness and Guidance\n\nAnother important aspect of supplication is seeking forgiveness and guidance. Surah As-Sajdah highlights the nature of human beings and their reliance on Allah: \n\n**“Then, the angel of death appointed over you will take away your soul, then you will be sent back to your Lord.”**  \n*(Surah As-Sajdah, 32:11)*\n\nAfter reflecting on such profound realities, it is fitting to turn in supplication, expressing one’s hopes and regrets.\n\n### The Connection between Faith and Action\n\nIn Surah Al-Mujadila, the relationship between belief and action is made clear. Believers are encouraged to make room in their assemblies and act righteously:\n\n**“O you who believe, when you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room; God will give you more room to spread.”**  \n*(Surah Al-Mujadila, 58:11)*\n\nThis reinforces the idea that faith must be expressed through actions and that one’s supplications should reflect a commitment to live righteously.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the practice of supplication after reciting the Quran is deeply embedded in the Islamic faith. It allows believers to humble themselves before Allah, reflecting on the divine words they have just absorbed. The call to be reflective and sincere, seeking guidance, forgiveness, and mercy, resonates throughout the Quran, as evidenced in the verses cited. It is a way for believers to connect intimately with their Creator, seek assistance in their lives, and aspire to embody the teachings of the Quran in their daily actions."

        "question": "Interacting with the meanings of Qur’an whilst reciting",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt was narrated that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I prayed with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) one night. He started to recite al-Baqarah, and continued to recite until he completed one hundred verses, and I thought that he would bow. Then he continued until he had recited two hundred verses, and I thought that he would bow. And he continued until he completed it, and I thought he would bow. Then he started to recite an-Nisa’, and he recited, then he bowed, and his bowing was as long as his standing, and he said  whilst bowing: Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘Azeem (Glory be to my Lord Most Great). Then he prostrated, and his prostration was as long as his bowing, and he said whilst prostrating: Subhaana Rabbiy al-A‘laa (Glory be to my Lord Most High). When he came to a verse that spoke of mercy, he prayed for mercy; when he came to a verse that mentioned punishment, he sought refuge with Allah from it; and when he came to a verse that glorified Allah, he glorified Allah.\nNarrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (23261) and by Ibn Khuzaymah in as-Saheeh (586).\nSuch was the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when reciting Qur’an and interacting with the meanings of the verses. This is a type of reflecting and pondering the meaning. As-Suyooti said: It is Sunnah to recite with reflection and pondering the meaning. That is the greatest goal and most important aim, by means of which hearts find comfort and illumination.\nHow that is done: the worshipper should focus on the meaning of the words he is uttering, so that he will think of the meaning of each verse, reflect on the commands and prohibitions, and affirm to himself that he will comply with them. If there is something concerning which he fell short in the past, he should apologize and seek forgiveness. If he comes to a verse that mentions mercy, he should feel hopeful and ask Allah for it; if he comes to a verse that mentions punishment, he should feel concerned and seek refuge with Allah from it; if he comes to a verse that glorifies Allah, he should declare Allah to be above all shortcomings and glorify Him; if he comes to a verse in which there is a supplication, he should turn to Allah and ask of Him.\nEnd quote from al-Itqaan (1/369).\nWith regard to interacting with the meaning of the verses in general terms, there is nothing wrong with that, such as when a person understands the meaning of a verse and feels moved by it, so he says Subhaan Allah (Glory be to Allah) or similar words which show that the verse has had an impact on him, saying words that are appropriate to the context and meaning of the verse.\nBut that is on condition that he does not burden himself with doing that (rather it should come naturally). For we are forbidden to go out of our way to do something that we find burdensome. Moreover, obliging ourselves to say words, even if it is glorification of Allah (tasbeeh) or supplication (du‘aa’), every time we come to a verse could interrupt the attention of the one who is listening to the one who says that, if he is listening to the recitation of someone else, or it could interrupt the flow of his recitation, if he himself is the one who is reciting.\nWith regard to interacting with the meanings of the verses in prayer, Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: The best is to remain silent and listen attentively, when the imam is reciting in Maghrib, ‘Isha’ and Fajr, or in Jumu‘ah. The best is to remain silent and listen attentively, so you should not say tasbeeh when hearing the verses that mention glorifying Allah or proclaiming His oneness, and you should not say salawaat when a verse mentions the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So when the Qur'an is recited, then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy” [al-A‘raaf 7:204]. So the best is to listen attentively. But if one sends blessings on the Prophet, or says Subhaan Allah when the names of Allah are mentioned, there is nothing wrong with that, although it is better not to do it, because what is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is that when he recited in a prayer in which recitation is done out loud, he did not pause when he came to a verse that mentions mercy, or a verse that contains a warning, or a verse that mentions the names and attributes of Allah. Rather he would carry on reciting. Therefore it is better for you to listen and not pause or say anything when the imam comes to these verses when he is reciting, or for you to do that when you are reciting in an obligatory prayer.\nIn the case of supererogatory prayers, however, the matter is broader in scope, such as when praying tahajjud at night and the like. When you are reciting, you may pause at a verse that mentions mercy and ask Allah for mercy; and at a verse that mentions a warning and seek refuge with Allah; and at verses which mention the names of Allah and glorify Him; and at verses which mention the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and send blessings on him, and so on. This also applies if you are praying behind an imam in prayers such as Taraweeh and qiyaam in Ramadaan; if the imam pauses to offer supplication, you may offer supplication; or if he pauses to send blessings upon the Prophet, you may also send blessings upon him. But if he carries on reciting, you should keep quiet and listen attentively, because you are enjoined to listen attentively.\nEnd quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, ash-Shuway‘ir (12/351).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 85481 and 96028 .\nConclusion:\nBecause this is something that is narrated as a Sunnah practice, to ask for mercy when coming to verses that mention mercy, and seeking refuge with Allah when coming to verses that mention punishment, and glorifying Allah when coming to verses that mention glorifying Him, then it is something that is undoubtedly prescribed, outside of prayer.\nWhen one is praying, however, it is prescribed in general terms, although the scholars differed as to whether that applies only to the supererogatory prayers, because that is what is mentioned in the Sunnah, or whether it may be applied by analogy to the obligatory prayers too, which is the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baaz and other scholars, as has been explained previously on our website.\nAs for going beyond that, and working out a supplication for every verse, what appears to be the case is that this is not prescribed, especially in the prayer, because of what it involves of overburdening oneself, interrupting the flow of recitation and not listening attentively to it.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Interacting with the meanings of the Qur’an during recitation is a significant aspect of Islamic practice. The verses provided highlight both the necessity and the proper approach to reciting, reflecting on, and understanding the Qur’an. Let's delve deeper into the topic, supported by relevant verses from the Qur’an.\n\n### Importance of Reflecting on the Qur’an\n\n1. **Divine Responsibility of Revelation**: \n   Surah Al-Qiyamah emphasizes that the collection and recitation of the Qur’an are solely God's responsibility, thus underlining the sanctity and significance of this text. \n   - **Verse**: “Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste. Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility.” \n   - **Reference**: Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:17-18).\n\n2. **Listening and Reflecting**:\n   Surah Al-A'raf instructs believers to listen attentively to the Qur’an and to meditate upon its meanings profoundly. This suggests a dual action during recitation: active listening and thoughtful reflection.\n   - **Verse**: “When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence… Meditate on your Lord inwardly with humility and trepidation…”\n   - **Reference**: Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206).\n\n### The Nature of Recitation\n\n3. **Distinct and Slow Recitation**:\n   Surah Al-Muzzammil urges believers to recite the Qur’an slowly and distinctly. This approach allows for deeper understanding and provision for the heart and mind to grasp the meanings.\n   - **Verse**: “And recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly.”\n   - **Reference**: Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:4).\n\n4. **Receptive State for Understanding**:\n   Recitation at night is encouraged due to its tranquility, which enhances comprehension and connection with the divine message.\n   - **Verse**: “Surely in the watches of the night the soul is most receptive and words more telling.”\n   - **Reference**: Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:6).\n\n### Barriers to Understanding\n\n5. **Veils over Hearts**:\n   Surah Al-Isra explains that there are spiritual barriers that prevent some people from understanding the Qur’an, indicating that sincere engagement with the text is required for true comprehension.\n   - **Verse**: “When you recite the Qur'an, We place a hidden veil between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter…”\n   - **Reference**: Surah Al-Isra (17:45).\n\n6. **The Role of Belief**:\n   The Qur’an’s powerful messages may be inaccessible to those who lack faith. This suggests that sincere belief and reflection are prerequisites for benefiting from the Qur’an.\n   - **Verse**: “See, what comparisons they coin for you, and go astray, and thus cannot find the way.”\n   - **Reference**: Surah Al-Isra (17:48).\n\n### Engaging with the Text\n\n7. **Exposition of Meaning**:\n   The meanings of the Qur’an are divinely provided, emphasizing that understanding comes from God. As believers interact with the text, they must seek this divine wisdom.\n   - **Verse**: “The exposition of its meaning surely rests on Us.”\n   - **Reference**: Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:19).\n\n8. **Encouragement to Reflect**:\n   Reflecting on the Qur’an deepens one’s spirituality and understanding of God's commands and guidance. Regular recitation prompts continuous interaction with the text and its meanings.\n   - **Verse**: “And what you send for yourself of the good, you will find it with God better and greater in reward.” \n   - **Reference**: Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, engaging with the Qur’an involves listening attentively, reciting thoughtfully, and reflecting on its meanings. The Qur’an is not just a text to be recited; it is a guide that requires deep contemplation and sincerity. The verses highlighted here underscore the importance of this interaction in nurturing faith and understanding the divine message. Through such engagement, believers can hope to realize the full depth of the teachings contained within the Qur’an."

        "question": "The honour of being connected to the Qur’an",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah has described the Qur’an in various ways, including describing it as a mighty Book , as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Indeed, those who disbelieve in the message after it has come to them. And indeed, it is a mighty Book. \nFalsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it; [it is] a revelation from a [Lord who is] Wise and Praiseworthy” [Fussilat 41:41-42].\nAnd He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Qaf. By the honored Qur'an” [Qaaf 50:1].\nAnd there are many other descriptions of it.\nThe one who adheres to the Qur’an will attain honour and high status because of his adherence to the Qur’an. In the hadith narrated by Muslim (817) from ‘Aamir ibn Waathilah, it says that Naafi‘ ibn ‘Abd al-Haarith met ‘Umar in ‘Usfaan, and ‘Umar had appointed him as governor of Makkah. He said: Whom did you appoint over the people of the valley? He said: Ibn Abza. He said: Who is Ibn Abza? He said: One of our freed slaves. He said: You have appointed a freed slave over them?! He said: He is well versed in the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and he has knowledge of the shares of inheritance that are prescribed in Islam. ‘Umar said: Your Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah raises some in status by means of this Book and He lowers others by means of it.”\nThe point is that being connected to the Qur’an is an honour for the one who is connected to it and it raises him in status, no matter what the nature of that connection to the Book of Allah, whether it is in writing, calligraphy, uttering, memorizing, reciting, learning or acting upon it. Every kind of connection to the Book of Allah and occupying oneself and one’s time with it is an honour for him and raises him in status in this world and the hereafter, commensurate with the level of this connection, for Allah has set a measure for all things.\nIt does not seem to us that there is any problem with the idea that the fact that the Qur’an was revealed in Makkah was an honour for the sacred land of Allah, and that the fact that it was revealed in Ramadan was an honour for the month of Ramadan, and that the fact that the Qur’an was revealed to the heart of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was an honour that Allah bestowed upon him, and that the fact that the Qur’an was borne from heaven, from the Lord of the Worlds, was an honour to its bearer, the trustworthy angel (Jibreel – peace be upon him). For the Qur’an is the noblest of speech; it is the words of the Lord of the worlds.\nHowever, it is incorrect to say that these are the only reasons for honour, or that the honour is limited only to that, regardless of how one may think of it, because this is a kind of speaking about Allah without knowledge, and it is also far-fetched, and there is no need for that.\nIn fact it is incorrect to think that the revelation of the Qur’an was the beginning of honour for each of those mentioned.\nJibreel was the best of the angels, the envoy of the Lord of the Worlds to His prophets, before he was sent down with the Qur’an.\nMakkah, the sacred land of Allah, was made a sanctuary by Ibraaheem, and its honourable status was established before the Qur’an was revealed.\nAllah’s Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was already the leader of the sons of Adam, the last of the prophets, when Adam was still in the form of clay.\nThe most that can be said is that one of the causes of honour is being connected to the Book of Allah, for everyone who is connected to it, in whatever way, as mentioned above.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The honour of being connected to the Qur'an is a profound theme in Islamic belief, reflecting the reverence and respect afforded to the holy text. The Qur'an is viewed as the word of God, revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Angel Gabriel, and serves as a guide for Muslims in all aspects of life. Here are some key aspects related to the honour of the Qur'an, along with supporting verses:\n\n### 1. **Status of the Qur'an**\nThe Qur'an is described as a glorious book, inscribed in the \"well-kept Book\" (al-Lauh al-Mahfuz), implying its divine origin and protection from corruption. This status highlights the honour associated with the Qur'an.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (Surah 56), Ayahs 77-79**: \"Indeed, this is the glorious Qur'an, (inscribed) in the well-kept Book. Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind). It has been revealed by the Lord of the worlds.\" (56:77-79)\n\n### 2. **Purity Required to Approach the Qur'an**\nThe Qur'an emphasizes that only those who are spiritually pure can truly comprehend its message. This connection to purity signifies the elevated status of the Qur'an, as it demands a level of moral integrity from its readers.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (Surah 56), Ayah 79**: \"Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind).\" (56:79)\n\n### 3. **Divine Revelation**\nThe act of revelation itself signifies the honour and importance of the Qur'an. It is sent down from God, who is the Lord of all worlds, emphasizing the Qur'an’s significance as a divine source of guidance.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (Surah 56), Ayah 78**: \"It has been revealed by the Lord of all the worlds.\" (56:78)\n\n### 4. **Witness over Mankind**\nThe Qur'an forms a pivotal role in the Islamic faith, where not only is it a testament to the believers but also acts as a witness over mankind. This embodiment of truth and guidance elevates the Qur'an’s importance in the lives of Muslims.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Al-Hajj (Surah 22), Ayah 78**: \"He has chosen you and laid no hardship on you in the way of faith, the faith of your forbear Abraham. He named you Muslims earlier, and in this (Qur'an), in order that the Prophet be witness over you, and you be witness over mankind.\" (22:78)\n\n### 5. **As a Source of Guidance**\nThe Qur'an serves as the ultimate guide for humanity, portraying God's signs, attributes, and commandments. The connection to the Qur'an is a connection to divine guidance that shapes the lives of its followers.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Al-Furqan (Surah 25), Ayah 57**: \"Tell them: 'I do not ask any recompense of you for this other than (urging) whoever likes may take the way to his Lord.'\" (25:57)\n\n### 6. **Reminder and Consolation**\nThe Qur'an is also described as a reminder and a source of consolation for the believers, establishing its role as a source of peace and guidance through life's challenges.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (Surah 56), Ayah 73**: \"We have made it as a reminder for the needy.\" (56:73)\n\n### Conclusion\nThe honour of being connected to the Qur'an is rooted in its status as a divine text, its need for purity in those who engage with it, and the overarching role it plays as a source of guidance and witness over humanity. It is revered not only for its content but also for its profound implications on the moral and spiritual lives of those who follow its teachings. The Qur'an's unique position in Islam makes it a cornerstone of faith and a continual source of inspiration."

        "question": "Can You Pray Tarawih Alone?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can you pray tarawih alone?\nIt is prescribed to offer the night prayers in Ramadan in congregation or individually, but it is better to do it in congregation than to do it individually. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led his Companions in offering these prayers in congregation on several nights. \nIt is proven in al-Sahihayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led his Companions in prayer (Tarawih ) for several nights, then on the third or fourth night he did not come out to them. When morning came he said: “Nothing prevented me from coming out to you except the fact that I feared that it would be made obligatory for you.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1129)\nAccording to the version narrated by Muslim (761): “But I feared that night prayers would be made obligatory for you and you would not be able to do them.” \nOffering Tarawih prayer in congregation\nOffering Tarawih prayer in congregation is something that is established by the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated the reason why he did not persist in offering this prayer in congregation, which is that he feared that it might be made obligatory. This reason ceased to be applicable after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, because when he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, the revelation ceased and there was no longer any worry that it might be made obligatory. Once the reason, which was the fear of it being made obligatory, disappeared with the cessation of the revelation, then the fact that it is Sunnah to offer this prayer in congregation resumed.  (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 4/78) \nImam Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“This indicates that praying qiyam in Ramadan is one of the Sunnahs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and is recommended and encouraged. It was not introduced by ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, rather he revived something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) loved and approved of. Nothing stopped him from doing it regularly except the fear that it might be made obligatory upon his ummah. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was kind and compassionate towards his ummah. ‘Umar knew from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the obligatory duties would not be increased or decreased after his death (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so he revived this practice and enjoined it upon the people. That happened in 14 AH, and ‘Umar has the honour of being the one who revived this Sunnah.” (Al-Tamhid, 8/108, 109) \nAfter the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) prayed Tarawih in small groups and individually, until ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) united them behind a single imam. \nIt was narrated that ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Abd al-Qari said: I went out with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) one night in Ramadan to the mosque , and the people were scattered, with one man praying by himself and another with a group of men following his prayer. ‘Umar said: “I think that if I gather them behind one reader, it will be better.” Then he decided to unite them behind Ubayy ibn Ka’b. Then I went out with him on another night, and the people were praying behind their reader. ‘Umar said: “What a good innovation this is. But the prayer that they forget about and sleep is better than the one they are offering.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1906) \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, when refuting the view of those who quoted ‘Umar’s words “What a good innovation this is” as meaning that innovation (bid`ah) is permissible: \nWith regard to qiyam in Ramadan , the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) introduced this to his ummah, and he led them in prayer for a number of nights, because at his time they used to pray in congregation and individually. But he did not persist in leading them in one congregation, lest that be made obligatory for them. \nWhen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, the Shari`ah was established (and would not change after that). When ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) became caliph, he united them behind one imam, Ubayy ibn Ka’b, who united the people in one congregation on the orders of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him). ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was one of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, of whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs after me; cling tightly to it.” So what he did was Sunnah but he said, “What a good innovation this is,” because it was an innovation in the linguistic sense, as they were doing something that they had not done during the life of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), i.e., gathering to do this, but it is Sunnah in the Shar`i sense.”  (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/234, 235) \nIs completing the Quran in Ramadan sunnah?\nCompleting the Quran in Ramadan , whether during prayer or outside prayer, is something that is praiseworthy. Jibril (peace be upon him) used to review the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) every Ramadan, and in the Prophet’s last year he reviewed it with him twice. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "**Can You Pray Tarawih Alone?**\n\nYes, you can pray Tarawih alone. The Fard prayers (obligatory prayers) are primarily meant to be performed in congregation, but the Sunnah prayers, such as Tarawih, can be prayed both in congregation and individually. While it is recommended to pray Tarawih in Jama'ah (congregationally) in the mosque, especially during Ramadan, it is permissible and valid to perform them alone as well.\n\n### Supporting Evidence\n\n1. **Prayer in Privacy:**\n   One of the key aspects discussed in the context of prayer is the flexibility allowed in practicing one's devotion. In Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 186, Allah states: \n   > \"When My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me.\" \n   (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:186)\n\n   This verse emphasizes the personal relationship between the worshiper and God, suggesting that individual prayers are embraced.\n\n2. **Flexibility in Prayer:**\n   Surah Al-Nisa discusses the conditions that allow for prayer to be shortened and how prayer can be performed in different states, even when under duress or fear:\n   > \"And do not be chary of pursuing them. If you suffer, they shall also suffer like you. But while you have hope (of success) from God, they have none.\" \n   (Surah An-Nisa, 4:104). \n\n   This indicates that prayer can adapt depending on circumstances which include praying alone.\n\n3. **Specific Situation of Tarawih:**\n   The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) used to pray Tarawih in congregation but then stopped after a few nights, expressing concerns of it being considered obligatory. He encouraged individuals to pray in their homes as well:\n   > \"The best prayer of a person is in his house except for the obligatory prayers.\" \n   (Narrated in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, indicating that non-obligatory prayers have a space in personal worship). \n\nThis hadith supports the view that praying Tarawih or any Sunnah prayer alone is commendable.\n\n4. **Reward for Individual Prayers:**\n   Surah Al-Isra mentions the significance of prayer and supplications: \n   > \"Establish prayer at the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night and the Qur'an at dawn.\" \n   (Surah Al-Isra, 17:78)\n\n   This acknowledges both the communal aspect of prayers but also the importance of individual devotion.\n\nIn conclusion, while praying Tarawih in congregation is highly recommended and carries the benefit of unity and community spirit, individuals can also fulfill this act of worship alone without any sin or deficiency in their prayer. The guiding principle is that worship is a personal journey, and sincere prayers—whether in congregation or alone—are valued in the eyes of Allah."

        "question": "Verses that are entirely clear (muhkam) and verses that are not entirely clear (mutashaabih) in the Holy Qur’aan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“It is He Who has sent down to you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) the Book (this Qur’aan). In it are Verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book [and those are the Verses of Al-Ahkaam (commandments), Al-Faraa’id (obligatory duties) and Al-Hudood (laws for the punishment of thieves, adulterers)]; and others not entirely clear. So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah (polytheism and trials), and seeking for its hidden meanings, but none knows its hidden meanings save Allaah. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: “We believe in it; the whole of it (clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord.” And none receive admonition except men of understanding”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:7]\nWhat is meant is that the Qur’aan contains verses that are entirely clear and verses that are not entirely clear. The entirely clear verses (muhkam) are those which are clear and concerning which there is no confusion; this applies to most of the verses of the Qur’aan. These verses are the “foundations of the Book”. As for the verses which are not entirely clear (mutashaabih) these are verses which may not be clear to some people, in exclusion to others. The scholars know them but the ignorant do not, and there are some which only Allaah knows. \nThose who follow the truth refer the verses which are not entirely clear to the verses which are entirely clear, whereas those who follow deviation follow the verses which are not entirely clear, and they use the verses which are not entirely clear to contradict the verses which are entirely clear, for the purpose of creating confusion, distorting and misleading. \nIbn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (2/6): Allaah tells us that in the Qur’aan there are verses which are entirely clear, which are the foundation of the Book, i.e., they are clear in meaning, with no confusion for anyone; and there are other verses which are not entirely clear as to what they mean for many or some people. The one who refers that which is unclear to him to that which is clear, and uses the clear verses to understand what is not clear to him, will be guided. But the one who does the opposite will be misguided. Hence Allaah says: “It is He Who has sent down to you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) the Book (this Qur’aan). In it are Verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book” i.e., they are the root to which reference should be made in the event of confusion; “and others not entirely clear” i.e., they could be interpreted in accordance with those that are entirely clear or they could be interpreted in some other way, based on the wording and the way they are written, not according to the meaning. \n“So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation”, i.e., misguidance, and ignoring the truth in favour of falsehood, “they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof” i.e., they interpret that which is not entirely clear in such a way that allows them to distort it to suit their corrupt aims, because the wording could be interpreted in the way they want. But in the case of the verses which are entirely clear, they have no chance of doing that, so that is clear proof against them. Hence Allaah says: “seeking Al-Fitnah (polytheism and trials)” i.e., to misguide their followers and give them the impression that they are using evidence from the Qur’aan to support their bid’ah (innovation). This is evidence against them, not for them. It is similar to when the Christians argue that the Qur’aan says that ‘Eesa (Jesus) is a Spirit from God and His Word that He bestowed upon Maryam (Mary), but they ignore the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“He [‘Eesa (Jesus)] was not more than a slave. We granted Our Favour to him …”\n[al-Zukhruf 43:59]  \n“Verily, the likeness of ‘Eesa (Jesus) before Allaah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!’ — and he was”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:59]\n-- and other clear verses which unambiguously show that he was one of the creatures created by Allaah, and a slave of Allaah, and one of the Messengers of Allaah. \nAnd the words “and seeking for its hidden meanings” mean, they distort it as they wish. \nEnd quote. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\nAllaah, may He be blessed and exalted, has divided the Holy Qur’aan into two categories: the verses which are entirely clear and those which are not entirely clear. What is meant by those which are entirely clear is that the meaning is clear and obvious to everyone, like the heavens and earth, stars, mountains, trees, animals and so on. This is entirely clear because there is no ambiguity in its meaning. The verses which are not entirely clear are those of which the meaning is ambiguous or unknown to most people, and is known only to those who are well-versed in knowledge, such as some verses which are general in meaning and do not give details, but they are explained in detail in the Sunnah. An example is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And perform As-Salaah [prayer]”\n[al-Baqarah 2:43]. \nHow prayer is to be performed is not known from this verse; all that is known from it is that it is obligatory to perform prayer. But how that is to be done is known from other evidence. The wisdom behind the fact that the Qur'aan was revealed with verses of these two types is that this is a test, because those in whose hearts is deviation will follow that which is not entirely clear and will thus remain confused. But those who are well-versed in knowledge believe in all of it, both that which is not entirely clear and that which is entirely clear; they know that it is from Allaah and that there is no contradiction in it. An example of verses that are not entirely clear are the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“There will then be (left) no Fitnah (excuses or statements or arguments) for them but to say: ‘By Allaah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allaah’”\n[al-An’aam 6:23]. \n“On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will wish that they were buried in the earth, but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allaah”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:42]\nSomeone may come along and say that they contradict one another. How can they say “By Allaah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allaah”, then it is said of them that “they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allaah”? They quote the verses against one another in order to confuse people. But those who are well-versed in knowledge say: It is all from Allaah and there is no contradiction in the words of Allaah. They said: The Day of Resurrection will be as long as fifty thousand years, and things will change throughout that Day. The first verse is applicable to one stage and the second verse is applicable to another.\nEnd quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb. \nAnd he also said: As for the people of misguidance and deviance, they followed the verses which are not entirely clear and made them a cause to create doubt and suspicion, so they were misguided and misguided others. They imagined, on the basis of verses that are not entirely clear, something that is not befitting to Allaah or His Book or His Messenger. \nAn example of the first is the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We give life to the dead” [Yaa-Seen 36:12] and “Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9] – and other verses in which Allaah attributes something to Himself using the plural pronoun (We). The Christians followed that which is not entirely clear and claimed a plurality of gods, saying that Allaah is the third of three, and they ignored that which is entirely clear and indicates that Allaah is One.  \nBut those who are well-versed in knowledge interpreted the plural pronoun as being in terms of respect for the numerous attributes of Allaah and their greatness. They referred the verses that are not entirely clear to that which is entirely clear (interpretation of the meaning): “And your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God — Allaah), Laa Ilaaha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He)” [al-Baqarah 2:163]. So they say to the Christians: The claim you make is because of the confusion that you have, so Allaah has deemed you to be kaafirs (disbelievers) and has rejected your claim when you said that. Listen to the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Surely, disbelievers are those who said: “Allaah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).” But there is no Ilaah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilaah (God —Allaah)” [al-Maa'idah 5:73] i.e., they disbelieved when they said that God is the third of three.  \nAn example of the second is the verses in which Allaah says to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily, you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) guide not whom you like”\n[al-Qasas 28:56]. \nAnd\n“And verily, you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e. Allaah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism)”\n[al-Shoora 42:52]. \nIn these two verses there is an imagined contradiction, so the one who has deviation in his heart may think that they contradict one another, because in the first verse there is a negation and in the second there is an affirmation. So he thinks that there is a contradiction in the Qur’aan. \nBut those who are well-versed in knowledge say that there is no contradiction between these two verses, because what is meant by guidance in the first verse is guidance by means of divine help or inspiration, which no one has control over except Allaah alone; neither the Messenger nor anyone else has any power over that. And what is meant by guidance in the second verse is guidance on the basis of evidence and proof, which may come from Allaah or from others, so it may come from the Messengers and their heirs, meaning the sincere scholars.\nEnd quote from Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (4/186). \nThese are all examples of relative ambiguity which some people may not be able to understand, but those who are well-versed in knowledge understand it. As for the verses which are not entirely clear and which no one knows except Allaah, these have to do with matters such as the essence and nature of Allaah’s attributes, or the essence of what is with Allaah of the delight of the people of Paradise and the torment for those who disobey Him. All of that is known to no one except Allaah. \nSecondly: \n Whoever is confused about any of the verses which are not entirely clear should try to understand it in the light of that which is entirely clear, if he is a scholar who is able to use evidence in order to reach conclusions. Otherwise he should ask the scholars, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“So ask of those who know the Scripture, if you know not”\n[al-Nahl 16:43]. \nWhatever the case, let him say (interpretation of the meaning): “We believe in it; the whole of it (clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:7].  \nSome of the heretics and deviants, in the past and in modern times, tried to seek out everything in the Qur'aan and Sunnah that is not entirely clear (al-mutashaabih), for the purpose of creating confusion and doubt.. But the scholars rose to this challenge and wrote beneficial books which refute these doubts. An example of that is the book which was written by Ibn Qutaybah (may Allaah have mercy on him), entitled Ta’weel Mukhtalif al-Hadeeth; and the book by Shaykh al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) entitled Daf’ Eehaam al-Idtiraab ‘an Aayi’l-Kitaab. \n, there is no contradiction between the verses of the Qur’aan, or between the Sunnah and the Qur’aan, because it is all from Allaah, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:82]. \nWe ask Allaah to guide us and you and to grant us all beneficial knowledge and enable us all to do righteous deeds. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the Holy Qur'an, verses are classified into two main categories: **Muhkam** (entirely clear) and **Mutashaabih** (not entirely clear). \n\n### Muhkam (Entirely Clear Verses)\n\nThe **muhkam** verses are clear in their meanings and are often considered directives or clear guidelines for practice and belief. These verses leave little room for ambiguity.\n\n1. **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (Chapter 56), Ayah 77-81**:\n   - ***\"That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an (Inscribed) in the well-kept Book. Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind). It has been revealed by the Lord of all the worlds. Then why do you dissimulate this Revelation?\"*** \n   - **Reference**: Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:77-81).\n\n2. **Surah Fussilat (Chapter 41), Ayah 1-3**:\n   - ***\"HA MIM. A revelation from the most benevolent, ever-merciful, A Book whose verses have been distinguished and explained, a lucid discourse for people who understand.\"*** \n   - **Reference**: Surah Fussilat (41:1-3).\n\nThese verses convey direct messages about the Qur'an's integrity and the necessity of purity in understanding it, firmly establishing a clear and unequivocal stance.\n\n### Mutashaabih (Not Entirely Clear Verses)\n\nThe **mutashaabih** verses are characterized by their ambiguous nature. They may contain allegories or signs that require deeper contemplation and understanding. They often challenge believers to seek greater knowledge and understanding.\n\n1. **Surah Al-Muddaththir (Chapter 74), Ayah 30-34**:\n   - ***\"Over it are nineteen (guards). We have not appointed any one but angels as keepers of Hell, and their number that We have fixed is to make it a means of contention for disbelievers...\"***\n   - **Reference**: Surah Al-Muddaththir (74:30-34).\n\n2. **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (Chapter 56), Ayah 76-80**:\n   - ***\"And this surely is great evidence if you can understand -- That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an (Inscribed) in the well-kept Book...\"***\n   - **Reference**: Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:76-80).\n\nThese verses embody concepts that are challenging to grasp fully without contextual knowledge and may provoke different interpretations among scholars and believers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe distinction between **muhkam** and **mutashaabih** highlights the richness of the Qur'anic text. While **muhkam** verses provide clear guidelines, **mutashaabih** verses invite deeper exploration of meanings and understanding, reflecting the complexity and depth of divine revelation. The interplay between both types encourages lifelong learning and contemplation in a believer's journey."

        "question": "When Was Surat al-Fatihah Revealed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.When was Suat Al-Fatihah revealed?\nSurat al-Fatihah is one of the Makkan surahs [i.e., revealed during the Makkan period, before the Hijrah], according to the majority of scholars. The scholars quoted several things as evidence for it being classified as Makkan, including the following:\n\nThere is a great deal of sahih (sound) evidence to support this view, including the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have certainly given you, [O Muhammad], seven of the often repeated [verses] and the great Quran” [Al-Hijr 15:87]\n\nThis verse from Surat al-Hijr is Makkan according to scholarly consensus. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained the “seven often repeated [verses]” as referring to Surat al-Fatihah, which implies that al-Fatihah was revealed during the Makkan period. \n\nPrayer was enjoined in Makkah , and prayer is not valid without Surat al-Fatihah .\n\nIn fact, some of the scholars were of the view that al-Fatihah was the first thing to be revealed, but this is a weak view.\nIbn Taymiyah said: “The Opening of the Book [i.e., Surat al-Fatihah] was undoubtedly revealed during the Makkan period.…\nThe view of those who say that al-Fatihah was not revealed until the Madinan period is undoubtedly wrong.” (Majmu‘ al-Fatawa, 17/190-191)\nA number of well-versed scholars – such as Ibn Taymiyah, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Hajar, al-Baydawi, al-Kawashi, and others – preferred the view that Surat al-Fatihah was revealed during the Makkan period. (See: al-Makki wa’l-Madani by ‘Abd ar-Razzaq Husayn, 1/446-468)\nWas Surat al-Fatihah revealed before enjoining prayer?\nAl-Qurtubi said in al-Jami‘ li Ahkam al-Quran (1/115): \n“There is no difference of opinion concerning the fact that prayer was enjoined in Makkah , and there is no report to suggest that there was a time when Muslims offered their prayers without “al-hamdu Lillahi Rabbi l-‘alamin”. This is indicated by the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, “There is no prayer except with the Opening of the Book.” This is speaking about the ruling, not when it began. And Allah knows best.”\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Surat al-Fatihah, known as \"The Opener,\" is the first chapter of the Qur'an. It is widely accepted that it was revealed during the Meccan period of Prophet Muhammad's life, specifically during the 5th year of his prophethood. This surah comprises 7 verses (ayah) and is foundational to Islamic prayer, recited in every unit of the Muslim prayer (Salah).\n\n### Revealed Period\nSurat al-Fatihah was **revealed in Mecca**, during the early years of the revelation. According to Islamic tradition and scholarship, this chapter is classified as one of the early Meccan surahs. \n\n### Supporting Verses\nThe verses of Surat al-Fatihah emphasize the attributes of Allah and the supplication for guidance. Looking specifically at the introductory verses, we can see its essence captured in the following:\n\n1. **Ayah 1-3:**\n   - **Verse 1:** \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\"\n   - **Verse 2:** \"Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.\"\n   - **Verse 3:** \"The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Fatihah, 1:1-3)**\n\n2. **Ayah 4-5:**\n   - **Verse 4:** \"Master of the Day of Judgment.\"\n   - **Verse 5:** \"You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help.\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Fatihah, 1:4-5)**\n\n3. **Ayah 6-7:**\n   - **Verse 6:** \"Guide us on the Straight Path.\"\n   - **Verse 7:** \"The path of those who have received your grace; not the path of those who have brought down wrath upon themselves, nor of those who go astray.\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Fatihah, 1:6-7)**\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, Surat al-Fatihah was revealed during the Meccan period of Prophet Muhammad's mission, particularly in its early years, and it lays the groundwork for the spiritual and communal aspects of worship in Islam. It is not only significant as a chapter of the Qur'an but also as an essential part of daily prayers for Muslims. Its themes of praise, supplication, and seeking guidance create a foundation for the believer's relationship with Allah."

        "question": "The Mus-haf (Quran) that we have today is that on which there was consensus among the Sahaabah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nFirst of all, we would like to share with the questioner our experience with this type of inquiry, because we have found that those who are behind such queries are usually people who specialize in mixing issues in order to cause confusion, and try to reach a definite conclusion that the idea of the preservation of the Quran is completely incorrect and unfounded, and that no one can prove whether the Mus-hafs that we have nowadays are the word of Allah, may He be glorified, or not. This is a dangerous slippery slope.\nThere is one idea that could prove the point, which is that even if we assume – for the sake of argument – that some verses and soorahs that were recited at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were not written in the Mus-haf, for one reason or another, that does not mean that everything that has reached us of the Quran is false and incorrect – Allah forbid.\nAnother idea that could prove the point is the fact that by always assuming that in any process of large-scale historical transmission – such as the transmission of the Quran, the number of verses of which are in the thousands, and these verses were also transmitted by thousands of the Sahaabah, and it was written down on thousands of slates, skins, pieces of other material and so on – it is inevitable that historical reports will tell us that there were some small errors on the part of one or some of the transmitters, or there were some debates between them, or that there were small variations between others. This is something that invariably happens, without a doubt, in the process of transmission or memorization.\nAs for distortion, however, that is done by people of whims and desires, who try to twist the facts and try to confuse non-specialists, so they regard such issues as evidence of the Quran “being distorted”, or that its transmission process is not credible.\nThey forget that the Quran was transmitted to us – in the version that we have nowadays, with the same script, shape and way of writing – through hundreds of thousands of proven, sound chains of narration that are spread throughout the Muslim world, and that the copies of the Quran that have chains of narration going all the way back to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are innumerable and are housed in libraries throughout the world. If huge academic institutions were to be established to list all these chains of transmission, Mus-hafs and books, and to collect evidence to prove that the Quran was narrated via tawaatur [i.e., it was transmitted from so many by so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a mistake], that would not be possible.\nIf we think that this will undermine the credibility of the transmission of the Quran, and that makes us think that there were additions and subtractions to it, then in that case we are rejecting all the rules and standards on how to judge a text from an academic point of view, and we are dismissing all the proven ways of sound transmission, and we are dismissing all that was transmitted of the legacy and history of nations, because of one report here or there that we did not reflect upon or understand properly, and we did not know the right way to approach it. There is no criticism that was mentioned in the context of the topic under discussion, regardless of how sound and correct it may be when subjected to examination, but it would be possible to find many more criticisms like it, whether of the same type or otherwise, to that which people transmitted of reports, knowledge, history and the ancient legacy, all of which came to us through transmission. Moreover, the transmission of the Quran – and indeed, the Sunnah too – was clearly undertaken by trustworthy narraters, and this transmission is proven to be sound, in a manner that is not applicable in the case of any other book or report.\nPerhaps the questioner will agree with us, that it is very strange and amazing to find someone who believes that the Quran is the word of Allah, the Creator of all things, the controller of all things, the Creator of all the wonders of this universe, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, and He has power over all things, yet despite all that he finds it unacceptable that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, should decree that the recitation of a few verses be abrogated, or that the rulings thereof be abrogated, or that both the recitation and ruling thereof be abrogated.\nIs not Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, the one Who sent down these verses, Who spoke these words, the one Who issued the rulings mentioned? So why can he not understand and accept the idea that Allah, may He be glorified, may decree that some of these words be removed from the pages of the Mus-haf, yet remain part of His holy words, just as the Torah and Gospel are words and commands of Allah, yet despite that, the Quran abrogated both of them, yet what is remains of the Torah and Gospel that has not been distorted is still to be venerated and appreciated, on the grounds that it is the word of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted?\nWhat harm is there in any of that?\nWe can see an example of this issue in this world, in anyone who writes a book or composes a speech. He may take out (or “abrogate”) something that he had mentioned in his book, or he may change the order of the ideas of what is mentioned in the book. How could anyone think that this is the right of a weak, created individual, yet some people think that it is a shortcoming in the case of the Creator, may He be glorified and exalted!\nIf someone were to say that abrogation means that Allah realized that there were some shortcomings and problems in what was already there, then He decided to abrogate it and present the verse or soorah in a new way, the response to that is: This is proof that this person does not understand the issue of abrogation in the first place. All that abrogation of recitation means is simply that the verse is no longer part of the Quran, and that reciting it is no longer to be regarded as an act of worship, although its ruling remains in effect, or that the verse is no longer to be regarded as part of the Quran and its ruling is to be abrogated also, although it is still regarded as being the words of Allah.\nIt is well-known that worshipping Allah in a particular manner is a matter that is not subject to rational thinking in the first place, so how can anyone object by saying that abrogation of the recitation of the verse means that it became clear that there was some shortcoming or problem with it.\nOn our website, in the answer to question no. 105746 . we have given some examples of verses of which the recitation was abrogated, and we have quoted what the scholars of said about the great wisdom behind this type of abrogation.\nThirdly:\nOnce you understand the above, it will become clear that what the scholars of Sunnah said about the verse of stoning, the recitation of which was abrogated whilst the ruling remains in effect, comes under the heading of abrogation (naskh), which has already been discussed and guidelines concerning it have been explained above, and there is a clear reference to it in the Quran itself, in the verses in which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?\nDo you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and [that] you have not besides Allah any protector or any helper?”\n[al-Baqarah 2:106-107].\nFor more detailed information on what was narrated concerning the verse of stoning, please see the answers to questions no. 179886.\nFourthly:\nSimilarly, we may say that there was no difference among the Sahaabah concerning the Quran. Rather some people think that there was a dispute among them because they saw that some of the Sahaabah wrote some interpretations and explanations in their own Mus-hafs, whilst other Sahaabah were still keeping these verses of which the recitation had been abrogated. Therefore they thought – by mistake or deliberately – that this was a real difference of opinion among the Sahaabah concerning the Quran, when in fact it was not a difference of opinion at all; rather it was, as noted above, a commentary and explanation written by the Sahaabi in his own personal copy. Therefore some people distorted this fact, trying to give the impression that it was part of the Quran, or it was verses and soorahs that had been abrogated, but this Sahaabi did not erase them from his own personal copy, in order to remember them and act on the ruling, but he knew and accepted that he could not recite them as an act of worship.\nFor more details concerning these matters, please see questions no. 178209, 195880 and 197942.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Mus'haf (Quran) that we have today is indeed recognized as the one that received consensus among the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad (Sahabah). The preservation and compilation of the Qur'an were significant events that occurred during and after the life of the Prophet, where various efforts ensured the text remained unchanged and accurately transmitted.\n\n### Preservation and Consensus Among the Companions\n\n1. **Collective Effort in Compilation**: \n   The compilation of the Quran was initiated during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad. It was revealed over 23 years, and numerous Companions memorized different portions of it. After the Prophet's passing, the first caliph, Abu Bakr, ordered a complete written compilation of the Quran, not just oral versions, to preserve it after many Companions who had memorized it were killed in battle.\n\n2. **Standardization Under Uthman**: \n   The third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan, recognized the need for a standardized text of the Quran due to variations in recitation across different regions. To achieve this, Uthman commissioned a committee led by Zayd ibn Thabit, a scribe of the Prophet, to compile a single version of the Quran, eliminating any discrepancies. Uthman then distributed copies of this standardized version to different Islamic territories, further solidifying the consensus around the text.\n\n### Relevant Verses Supporting Preservation and Transmission\n\nThe following verses highlight the importance of the Quran's preservation and its truthful transmission:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:48)**:\n   > \"And to you We have revealed the Book containing the truth, confirming the earlier revelations, and preserving them (from change and corruption).\"\n   - This verse indicates that the Quran was revealed to confirm previous scriptures and to remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:77-79)**:\n   > \"This is indeed the glorious Qur'an (Inscribed) in the well-kept Book. Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind).\"\n   - This asserts the sanctity and protection of the Quran via divine decree, reaffirming its preservation.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:142-146)**:\n   > \"The fools will now ask and say: 'What has made the faithful turn away from the Qiblah towards which they used to pray?' Say: 'To God belong the East and the West. He guides whom He wills to the path that is straight.'\"\n   - This verse reflects the ongoing guidance provided in the Quran, emphasizing its role in the life and decisions of believers.\n\n4. **Surah Al-Ahqaf (46:10)**:\n   > \"Tell them: 'Think (of the consequence) if this is from God and you deny it when a witness from the people of Israel had testified to the like of it and come to believe, while you spurn it? Assuredly God does not guide a wicked people.'\"\n   - This verse highlights the accountability of believing in the revelation and serves to emphasize the legitimacy of the Quran, as witnessed by prior scriptures.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Mus'haf we possess today is a result of careful compilation, standardization, and consensus among the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad. This historical context, supported by Quranic verses, reinforces that the Quran we have is preserved and has remained unchanged since its revelation. The collective efforts of the Sahabah, alongside divine assurance of its preservation, affirm the integrity of the current Mus'haf as a central text of guidance for Muslims."

        "question": "Ruling on deliberately making mistakes in recitation of Qur’an for the purpose of teaching",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to deliberately make mistakes when reciting the Holy Qur’an, even if that is for the purpose of teaching, because it is distorting the words of Allah, may He be exalted, and because of the possibility that the mistake may become fixed in the mind of the listener.\nIt says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (35/214): The Qur’an is the miraculous words of Allah that was sent down to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and was transmitted by tawaatur [i.e., it was transmitted from so many by so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a mistake].\nIt is haraam to deliberately mispronounce it, whether that changes the meaning or not, because its words and phrases are tawqeefi [not subject to change] and it was transmitted to us by tawaatur. Therefore it is not permissible to change any word or phrase in it by changing the vowels at the end of words, or by changing its letters by switching letters around. End quote.\nIt says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (vol. 3, 2/219): What is the ruling on deliberately making mistakes in recitation of the Holy Qur’an when teaching, so as to draw the student’s attention to that? We visited a teacher in the company of the educational supervisor, and he approved of this method of teaching and asked us to do it, but we refused to do that, because this method is not usually used in teaching, and because the mistake may become deeply rooted in the students’ minds [thinking that this is correct], and you know how easily things may become entrenched in children’s minds when they are very young; the students are no older than eight or nine. Please advise us, may Allah reward you.\nAnswer: Deliberately making mistakes in recitation of the Holy Qur’an when training students, for the purpose of drawing their attention to that, is not known from any of the righteous early generations who conveyed the Holy Qur’an and taught it to people. Teaching the Qur’an to learners is an act of worship by means of which one may draw closer to Allah, may He be exalted, so it is not permissible to do it in any manner other than the correct manner.\nThe Qur’an teacher may pose questions to his students to help them to memorize better, and to deal with any mispronunciations. If he does that, there will be no need to deliberately distort the verse when reciting it to the student.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.\nPermanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta’.\nSaalih ibn Fawzaan al-Fawzaan, ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Ghadyaan, ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Muhammad Aal ash-Shaykh, ‘Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Mutlaq, ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Ali ar-Rukbaan, Ahmad ibn ‘Ali Sayr al-Mubaaraki. End quote.\nThe teacher should use the prescribed methods to help the student memorize and correct their mispronunciations, by means of questions and tests, and constantly listening to their recitation and correcting their pronunciation.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the question regarding the ruling on deliberately making mistakes in the recitation of the Qur'an for teaching purposes, it is important to consider a few key Islamic principles and the relevant verses from the Qur'an.\n\n### Importance of Accurate Recitation:\n1. **Responsibility of Recitation**: Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:17-19) states, \"Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste. Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\" This verse emphasizes the obligation to follow the proper recitation and implies that any alteration or mistake can compromise the integrity of the text.\n\n2. **Preservation of the Message**: The Qur’anic verses as recorded and recited are not merely sounds; they represent divine guidance. Alterations or mistakes can lead to misunderstandings of the core messages conveyed. Surah Al-A'la (87:6-10) mentions, \"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it,\" indicating the need for accuracy in preservation.\n\n### Teaching Methodologies:\n3. **Using Errors as Learning Tools**: Within an educational context in Islam, it is not uncommon for teachers to demonstrate common mistakes in recitation to help students recognize and correct them. However, this should be done with the intent of correcting and not as a method of teaching by making errors. The focus remains on cultivating accuracy and understanding of the Qur'an rather than promoting errors in recitation.\n\n4. **Accountability and Intent**: Deliberately making mistakes, even for teaching purposes, can be detrimental. Surah At-Tawbah (9:65-66) warns against joking or becoming frivolous regarding God's revelations. It reminds believers of the gravity and seriousness required when dealing with divine texts. The pertinent phrases, \"Were you jesting with God, His revelations and His messengers?\" reinforce this idea of respect for sacred scripture.\n\n5. **Role of Guidance**: It is the responsibility of knowledgeable individuals to guide others toward understanding the Qur'an accurately (Surah As-Sajdah 32:23-26). Teaching that includes deliberate inaccuracies may mislead learners rather than guide them.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, deliberately making mistakes in recitation of the Qur'an, even for the purpose of teaching, is not advisable. The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of accurate recitation and responsibility in conveying its message correctly. While teaching methods may involve illustrating common errors to prevent them, these must be framed within the context of guiding learners toward maintaining the integrity of the recitation. Thus, any form of teaching that includes inaccuracies should be approached very cautiously and with a clear intention of rectifying misunderstandings rather than promoting error."

        "question": "Ruling on reading a commentary on the Qur’an whilst praying",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe questioner should look at the commentary on the verses that he is going to recite in the prayer outside of the prayer first, i.e., before starting to pray, so that he will be free to focus on his recitation and reflect on the meanings.\nIbn Katheer said: The verse “and stand before Allah, devoutly obedient” [al-Baqarah 2:238] means: with humility, humbling oneself before Him. This requires not speaking whilst praying, because that defeats the purpose. Hence, when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not return the greeting of Ibn Mas‘ood when the latter greeted him when he was praying, he apologized to him for that, and said: “Prayer is a preoccupation.”\nEnd quote from at-Tafseer (1/654).\nThe hadith was narrated by al-Bukhaari (1216).\nSecondly:\nThe fuqaha’ stated that reading in books whilst praying is makrooh, although some of them said that there is nothing wrong with it, subject to two conditions:\n\nThat he be only looking at the tafseer, and not moving his lips whilst reading;\nit should not require a great deal of movement, such as picking up the book, opening it, and turning the pages, because a great deal of movement invalidates the prayer.\n\nImam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he reads Qur’an from the Mus-haf, that does not invalidate his prayer, whether he has memorized it or not. Rather that is obligatory in his case if he has not memorized al-Faatihah, as noted above. If he turns over the pages sometimes whilst praying, that does not invalidate the prayer.\nIf he looks at anything written that is not Qur’an and reads it to himself, that does not invalidate his prayer, even if he does that at length, but it is makrooh (disliked). This was stated by ash-Shaafa‘i.\nEnd quote from al-Majmoo‘ (4/95). See also: Rawdat at-Taalibeen (1/294).\nAl-Mirdaawi said in al-Insaaf: The prayer is not invalidated by a lengthy looking at a book, if he reads it in his heart and does not move his lips, according to the correct view, which was deemed to be more correct in al-Furoo‘ and elsewhere. The author and others said: This is our view. It was narrated from Imam Ahmad that he did that.\nAnd it was said that it does invalidate the prayer. This was stated by a number of our companions, including Ibn Haamid.\nEnd quote (3/616).\nConclusion:\nPrayer is not invalidated by looking in a Mus-haf in which there is commentary on Qur’an, and the like, on condition that the worshipper does not move his lips when reading anything except Qur’an. Rather, if he looks at the meaning and thinks of it, there is nothing wrong with that, if he needs to do it.\nHowever, what he should do is to avoid all of that completely, and when he is praying behind an imam, he should be content with listening attentively to his imam and following his recitation. If he is leading the prayer or is praying alone, he should recite to himself whatever he can, and he should not let himself be distracted by anything except reciting Qur’an and doing the actions of the prayer, because prayer should be his focus and preoccupation, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.\nSee also the answers to questions no. 9505 and 125619.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the act of reading a commentary (tafsir) of the Qur'an while praying (salah) is generally considered inappropriate and not permissible. There are several reasons for this, primarily revolving around the nature of salah and the focus it demands.\n\n### Main Points:\n\n1. **Salah as a Form of Worship**: Salah is a structured and formal act of worship where Muslims are required to maintain focus and humility before God. Engaging with additional materials such as a commentary distracts from the primary purpose of prayer, which is to connect with Allah through remembrance, submission, and recitation of the Qur'an.\n\n   Supporting Ayah:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:238)**: \"Guard strictly your prayers, and the middle prayer, and stand before Allah with devotion.\"\n   \n2. **Recitation of the Qur'an**: The prayer involves specific recitations from the Qur'an, and the command is to recite what is easily accessible from the Qur'an itself during the prayer, as correctly executing the prayer (including recitations) is critical.\n\n   Supporting Ayah:\n   - **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**: \"So read as much of the Qur'an as you can easily...\"\n\n3. **Focus and Humility**: Salah is a time for reflection and focus on one's relationship with Allah. Reading a tafsir or commentary could detract from this spiritual experience, making the act of worship less sincere and less beneficial.\n\n   Supporting Ayah:\n   - **Surah Al-A'raf (7:204)**: \"When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence, that you may receive mercy.\"\n\n4. **Intention (Niyyah)**: The intention in prayer (niyyah) is key to the acceptance of the act. Introducing elements like commentary may confuse the intention of the prayer, leading it away from pure devotion to God.\n\n   Supporting Ayah:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:186)**: \"And when My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me.\"\n\n### Summary:\nReading a commentary while praying is not advisable and goes against the spirit of salah, which aims for focus and submission to God. Instead, the prayer should remain a time for dedicated worship, adhering to the prescribed recitations and maintaining an engaged heart and mind in connection with Allah.\n\n### References:\n1. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:238)\n2. Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)\n3. Surah Al-A'raf (7:204)\n4. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:186)"

        "question": "The reasons for differences in the wording of some abrogated verses",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.One of the texts which is abrogated and removed from the Mushaf is this verse: “If the son of Adam had two valleys of wealth he would desire a third, but nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust.”\nThat is because of the report narrated by Muslim (1050) from Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari who said: We used to recite a soorah which we likened in its length and strictness to Baraa’ah [Soorat at-Tawbah], then I was caused to forget it, but I remember from it the words: “If the son of Adam had two valleys of wealth he would desire a third, but nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust.”\nWe have previously discussed that in the answer to question no. 176972.\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining the different types of abrogation:\nAbrogation of the text and the ruling: It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to recite a soorah that was equal in length to Soorat at-Tawbah; I do not remember anything of it except this verse: “If the son of Adam had two valleys of gold, he would desire a third, and if he had a third, he would desire a fourth, but nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust, and Allah turns in mercy to whoever repents.”\nEnd quote from an-Naasikh wa’l-Mansookh by Ibn Hazm (p. 9).\nPerhaps the reason for the different wordings narrated for this verse is that when it was abrogated, it was no longer Qur’an, so the narrators were less careful about its wording, and were not so careful about it as they were in the case of the Qur’an or the hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which they wanted to convey to those who came after them. Do you not see that Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to recite a soorah which we likened in its length and strictness to Baraa’ah [Soorat at-Tawbah], then I was caused to forget it?\nThe focus of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) was on preserving and memorizing that which was proven, in order to convey it to the people. As for that which had been abrogated, they were not very concerned with it, so it was sufficient for them and for those who narrated from them to narrate it in general terms, or to narrate the meaning, or to narrate it with less precision in some of the phrases, especially since both the text and the ruling were abrogated. If the ruling remained in effect, they would pay more attention to the wording in order to apply it.\nAl-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Then think about what the Sahaabah mentioned of the verses which were abrogated; they only mentioned the meaning and some words, not the exact wording as revealed.\nThe context and style of the Qur’an confirm what they mentioned about that, and what they narrated here is clearly far removed from the style and eloquence of the Qur’an.\nEnd quote from Ikmaal al-Mu‘lim bi Fawaa’id Muslim (3/585).\nIt may be that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said something along these lines with different wording on different occasions, on the grounds that this is a prophetic hadith, then these wordings became mixed with the wording of the abrogated verse, because of what we have noted above, or the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did not focus their attention on memorizing verses of which the text had been abrogated. Hence Anas said: I do not know whether it was something that was revealed to him or something that he said. Narrated by Muslim (1048).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The concept of abrogation (Naskh) in Islamic theology refers to the idea that certain verses of the Quran can be superseded or replaced by later verses. This introduces complexities in understanding the differences in wording among abrogated verses.\n\n### Reasons for Differences in Wording of Abrogated Verses\n\n1. **Contextual Relevance**: Many abrogated verses were revealed in response to particular situations or incidents. As situations evolved, Allah provided new guidance that often altered or clarified the previous instructions. This can lead to differences in wording since the new verses are tailored to respond to the changing circumstances of the Muslim community.\n\n   - Example: In Surah Al-A'raf (7:164-168), we see a prodigious narrative about a people who persist in wrongdoing and the admonitions they receive. The specific context of their disobedience necessitated a specific linguistic structure to convey the message effectively:\n     - \"When a Section of them said: 'Why do you admonish a people whom God is about to destroy or to punish severely?'\" (7:164).\n\n2. **Emphasis on Key Themes**: Different verses may put a greater emphasis on various theological truths or moral lessons. The nuances in language help to highlight different aspects of faith, morality, or divine commands. As a result, when some verses are abrogated, their phrasing might differ based on what needs highlighting in new circumstances.\n\n   - For instance, in Surah Al-Muddaththir (74:42-46), there is a stark illustration of accountability in the Afterlife which highlights the consequences of neglecting religious duty, showing a different stress compared to other verses:\n     - \"What was it that brought you to Hell?\" They will answer: \"We did not fulfill our devotional obligations...\" (74:42).\n\n3. **Gradual Revelation**: Revelation occurred over a period of 23 years, allowing for gradual spiritual and legislative development for the followers of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). As the community grew and matured, verses that perhaps were initially provisional were replaced or supplemented with more definitive guidance.\n\n   - Surah Al-Muddaththir (74:49-53) exemplifies this gradual approach: \n     - “Why then do they turn away from the admonition as though they were frightened asses fleeing from a lion?” (74:49). The evolving context led to a more impactful wording in the final revelation.\n\n4. **Diversity of Audience**: The ummah (community) included individuals from various backgrounds, tribes, and cultures. Thus, the linguistic choices made in revelation catered to a broad audience, and as clarity was needed, different phrasing was employed to address distinct fears, challenges, and situations faced by these differing groups.\n\n   - Surah Ash-Shuraa (42:10-14) discusses the notion of judgment and the disagreements that arose among different prophets and their communities, indicating the need for distinct expressions to resonate clearly with their unique circumstances:\n     - “In whatever matter you disagree the ultimate judgement rests with God.” (42:10).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe differences in wording of some abrogated verses emphasize Allah's profound understanding of human affairs, morality, and circumstances. They reflect the dynamic nature of revelation, aimed at guiding the community towards spiritual success in an evolving socio-cultural landscape. Through context, thematic emphasis, gradual revelation, and inclusiveness, the divine wording responsive to the varied aspects of human life reinforces the Quran as a guide for all times."

        "question": "Leaving a recording of the Quran playing without listening to it",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Listening to the Holy Quran and paying attention to it when it is recited is recommended according to Islamic teachings. There is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether that is obligatory, and there are two views, the more sound of which is that it is not obligatory, except in the case of prayer, when it is obligatory. This is the view of the majority of scholars.\nBut the Muslim should be keen to listen attentively when the Quran is recited, and not let his attention wander from it, except in the case of work or need. This comes under the heading of venerating and respecting the Quran. We have discussed this previously in the answer to question no. 88728.\nWith regard to leaving the broadcast of the Holy Quran playing whilst you are in the house or out of the house, awake or asleep, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as there is nothing happening at the same time that would drown it out, and there is no noise, idle talk or arguments, and so long as it is not in an inappropriate place. In such cases it is more appropriate to turn off the broadcast. This comes under the heading of venerating and respecting the Quran, which is something enjoined and encouraged.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on having a radio or cassette recorder playing the Holy Quran in the house, when going out of the house to visit family or relatives?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with that, so long as there is no idle talk going on around it. If there is someone nearby who is engaging in idle talk and speaking and arguing, then that is not right; it is better not to leave the radio on in that case, and it should be turned off, because that is a kind of showing disrespect towards the Quran. But if the radio is on when there is no one around, or there is someone who is listening, or keeping quiet, or sleeping, then there is nothing wrong with it. End quote.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Leaving a recording of the Quran playing without actively listening to it raises questions about the intentions and the guidance provided in the Quran regarding the recitation and listening to it. Let's explore this topic through several relevant Quranic verses and commentary.\n\n### 1. **Command to Listen to the Quran in Silence**\nSurah Al-A'raf (7:204) emphasizes the importance of listening attentively: \n\n> \"When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.\" \n\nThis verse underscores that the act of listening is an essential part of engaging with the Quran. If someone is merely playing a recording without listening, they may not fulfill this directive.\n\n### 2. **Reflection and Meditative Engagement**\nThe same verse (7:204) continues by encouraging not just listening, but also meditating on the meanings of the Quran. The next part of the verse says:\n\n> \"Meditate on your Lord inwardly with humility and trepidation, reciting His Book softly, morning and evening, and be not negligent.\"\n\nThis highlights that interacting with the Quran should be more than just auditory exposure; it should involve reflection and understanding. Leaving a recording playing could diminish this reflective aspect.\n\n### 3. **The Responsibilities of Recitation**\nSurah Al-Qiyamah (75:16-19) reveals that the responsibility of recitation and understanding the revelations rests with individuals:\n\n> \"Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste. Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\"\n\nNeglecting active engagement while a recording plays may lead to missing the deeper meanings and guidance contained within the text.\n\n### 4. **Engagement by the Jinns**\nSurah Al-Ahqaf (46:29-32) recounts an event where a group of jinn listened attentively to the Quran:\n\n> \"And (remember), when We turned a company of jinns towards you to listen to the Qur'an, they arrived when it was being recited, and they said: 'Keep silent.' When it was over they came back to their people, warning them...\"\n\nHere, listening actively leads to spiritual awakening and awareness of God’s signs. This past example shows the merit of attentive engagement with the Quran.\n\n### 5. **Active Participation Versus Passive Listening**\nMoreover, Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:4) instructs believers to engage earnestly with the Quran:\n\n> \"Or a little more, and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly...\"\n\nThe call for careful and distinct recitation further indicates that true engagement necessitates active participation rather than passive listening.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while it is beneficial to have the Quran playing in one’s environment, true engagement with the text is described as requiring attentive listening, meditation, and reflection. The commands in the Quran focus on the development of understanding and sincerity in one's approach to its recitation. Therefore, simply leaving a recording on without intent to listen may not fully honor the teachings and significance of the Quran as laid out in these verses:\n\n- Surah Al-A'raf (7:204)\n- Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:16-19)\n- Surah Al-Ahqaf (46:29-32)\n- Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:4)\n\nFor spiritual growth, it is encouraged to actively listen and reflect upon the words, meanings, and implications of the Quran’s teachings."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If Allah enables someone to memorize His Book, seeking His pleasure thereby, and not seeking any worldly gain thereby, then he is one of those for whom Allah wills good, in sha Allah.\nThe Qur’an is the foundation of Islamic knowledge. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are those who learn the Qur’an and teach it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5027).\nMuslim (804) narrated that Abu Umaamah al-Baahili said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Read the Qur’an, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection interceding for its companions.”\nBut the one who memorizes the Qur’an then goes against its rulings and does not observe its etiquette should beware, lest the Qur’an be evidence against him and not for him.\nMuslim (223) narrated that Abu Maalik al-Ash‘ari said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “the Qur’an is evidence for you or against you.”\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt will either be for you, if you draw near to Allah by means of it, and fulfil the duties prescribed by this great Qur’an, namely believing its stories, complying with its commands, heeding its prohibitions, and venerating and respecting this Holy Qur’an – in this case it will be evidence for you;\nor if it is the opposite – if you disrespect the Qur’an and neglect its phrases and meanings, and fail to act in accordance with it, and do not do what it enjoins, then it will be a witness against you on the Day of Resurrection.\nEnd quote from Sharh Riyadh as-Saaliheen (p. 30).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, if Allah enables someone to memorize His Book, it can be seen as an indication that He wills good for that person. The memorization of the Qur'an is viewed as a special favor and sign of divine grace, which emphasizes the importance of guidance and the potential for righteousness.\n\n1. **Surah Al-A'la (87:6-10)**: \n   - This passage states, \"We shall make you recite (the Qur’an) so that you will not forget it, unless God wills.\" This verse implies that the ability to memorize and internalize the Qur'an is facilitated by Allah, indicating His goodwill and intention for guidance. \n   - Source: Surah Al-A'la, Ayah 6-10.\n\n2. **Surah 28 (Al-Qasas) - Ayah 67-71**: \n   - This passage highlights that those who repent and believe, and do good, are likely to be among the successful. This shows Allah’s readiness to bless those who honor His commands, including memorizing and implementing His Book, which indicates goodness towards them.\n   - Source: Surah Al-Qasas, Ayah 67-71.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:105-109)**: \n   - In these verses, it is conveyed that Allah chooses whom He wills for His grace. The act of memorizing the Qur'an and being guided towards it may signify being among that chosen group who are favored by His grace.\n   - Source: Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 105-109.\n\n4. **Surah Al-Muddaththir (74:52-56)**: \n   - The verses reinforce that true understanding, remembrance, and fear of God come from Him allowing it. It indicates that those who heed the reminders from Allah are under His mercy and guidance.\n   - Source: Surah Al-Muddaththir, Ayah 52-56.\n\n5. **Surah Al-Hadid (57:21-25)**:\n   - Allah’s promise of Paradise for those who believe emphasizes the importance of actions stemming from that belief. Memorizing His Book is among those actions that lead to the former.\n   - Source: Surah Al-Hadid, Ayah 21-25.\n\nIn conclusion, the ability to memorize the Qur'an is associated with Allah’s favor and guidance. The verses affirm that those who engage with the Qur'an, particularly in memorization, are being led towards goodness and righteousness, suggesting that Allah indeed wills good for them."

        "question": "Reciting Surat al-Baqarah in the Home",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Virtues of reciting Surat al-Baqarah in the home\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has told us of the great virtue of Surat al-Baqarah as a whole, and of some of its verses, such as Ayat al-Kursiy and the last two verses of the surah . \nAmong the things that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has told us about its virtue is that the devils flee the house in which this surah is recited, and that is beneficial in protecting against and remedying sihr (witchcraft ).\nAbu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not make your houses into graves, for the Shaytan flees from a house in which Surat al-Baqarah is recited.” Narrated by Muslim (780).\nAbu Umamah al-Bahili said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Read Surat al-Baqarah, for reciting it regularly is a blessing and forsaking it is a cause of regret, and the magicians cannot withstand it.” Narrated by Muslim (804).\nMust Surat Al-Baqarah be recited out loud?\nIt is not stipulated that it be recited in a loud voice; rather it is sufficient that it be read and recited in the house, even if it is recited in a low voice. Similarly, it is not stipulated that it be recited all in one go; rather it may be recited in stages. And it is not stipulated that it be read by only one member of the household; rather if it is shared out among them, that is acceptable. However, with regard to all of that, the best is if it is recited all in one go by one person.\nPlaying a recording of Surat al-Baqarah in the home: Enough?\nIt is not permissible to rely on the recitation coming from a broadcast or recording; rather it must be read directly by the members of the household themselves.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nThere is a hadith from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which says that if a person recites Surat al-Baqarah, the Shaytan will not come into his house. But what if the surah is recorded on a tape; will that achieve the same result?\nHe replied:\n“No, no; the voice on the tape is nothing and will not serve any purpose, because it cannot be said that one has read or recited Quran; rather it may be said that one has listened to the voice of somebody who recited it before. Hence if we record the adhan of a muadhdhin, then when the time comes we play it over the loudspeakers, and we leave it to call the adhan, is that acceptable? It is not acceptable. If we record a moving khutbah (sermon), then on Friday we play this recording of the “imam of the microphone”, and the recording says “As-salamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu (peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings),” then the muadhdhin gives the call to prayer, then the recording of the khutbah is played, is this acceptable? It is not acceptable; why is that? Because this recording is a voice that was recorded in the past. It is like if you wrote it on a piece of paper or put a Mushaf in the house; is that sufficient instead of reading or reciting it? It is not sufficient. (As’ilat al-Bab al-Maftuh (question no. 986)\nBut if there is no one in the house who is able to read or recite Surat al-Baqarah, and there is no one who can recite it for them in the house, and they use a recorder to recite it, then what appears to be the case – if Allah wills – is that it will serve this purpose and make the Shaytan flee from the house, especially if there is someone in the house who is listening to the recitation from the recorder.\nFor a detailed commentary on certain verses from Surat al-Baqarah, please see these answers to questions: 141772 , 118142 , 12191 , 1024 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Reciting **Surat Al-Baqarah** (The Cow) in the home holds significant spiritual value in Islam, as it is one of the longest and most comprehensive chapters of the Quran. This Surah encompasses various aspects of faith, guidance, legislation, and narratives of previous prophets, contributing to its central role in the daily lives of Muslims.\n\n### The Importance of Reciting Surat Al-Baqarah\n\n1. **Protection Against Evil**: It is reported in various hadiths that reciting **Surat Al-Baqarah** is a means of protection against evil forces. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Do not make your homes like graves. Indeed, the devil runs away from the house in which **Surat Al-Baqarah** is recited.\" (Sahih Muslim).\n\n2. **A Source of Guidance**: This Surah outlines the principles of faith and obedience to Allah, making it an important guide for believers. Reading it regularly strengthens one's connection with the teachings of Islam and helps in fulfilling the criteria for a pious life.\n\n3. **Connection to Previous Prophets**: Verses 124-129 recount the story of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and the significance of the Ka'bah as a sacred site for worship, which establishes continuity in the message of monotheism and devotion to Allah. These verses emphasize the importance of prayer and remembrance of Allah. \n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 125-129**: “And when his Lord tried Abraham by a number of commands which he fulfilled, He said: ‘I will make you a leader among men.’ … Remember, We made the House (of Ka'bah) a place of congregation and safe retreat…” (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:124-129).\n\n4. **Remembrance and Gratitude**: The act of reciting the Surah inculcates a habit of remembrance (dhikr) and gratitude towards Allah, which is central to a believer's life. \n\n5. **Response to Trials**: Verses 153-157 encourage reliance on prayer during challenging times: \"O you who believe! Seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient.\" This teaches believers to find solace and strength in prayer.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 153**: “Indeed, Allah is with the patient.” (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:153).\n\n### Spiritual and Practical Benefits\n\n- **Fostering Family Spirit**: Reciting **Surat Al-Baqarah** in the home fosters an atmosphere conducive to faith and spirituality. It brings family members together in worship, encourages discussions about faith, and nurtures a shared understanding of Islamic teachings.\n\n- **Understanding Zakat and Charity**: The Surah also addresses social justice and welfare through the obligation of zakat (charitable giving). \n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 177**: \"Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is in one who believes in Allah... and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves...\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:177).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReciting **Surat Al-Baqarah** in the home is more than just a spiritually rewarding practice; it serves practical purposes in reinforcing faith, fostering unity, reminding families of their responsibilities towards each other and society, and ensuring protection from negativity. \n\nEngaging with this Surah regularly can deepen one’s understanding of the fundamental aspects of Islam, making it an essential part of Muslim life. The words of the Quran serve as guidance, reflecting upon the history, laws, and the worship necessary to cultivate a life of obedience and submission to Allah."

The Council determined, on the basis of consensus, that it is not permissible to do this, because that is a kind of toying and tampering with the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and treating them in a disrespectful manner. And Allah is the source of strength.\nEnd quote from Qaraaraat al-Majma‘ al-Fiqhi, p. 271.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I have seen some people writing these verses in ornate letters, and I have even seen someone writing some verses in the form of a bird or animal, or a man who is sitting as if reciting the tashahhud in prayer, and so on. So they are writing these verses in a manner that is haraam, by shaping them into images for which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does that.\nMoreover, the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed: is it permissible to write verses in a script other than the ‘Uthmaani script or is that not permissible?\nThey differed concerning that, and there are three views:\nSome of them said that it is permissible in all cases to write it in whatever script is well-known and according to whatever rules of writing are current at any time or in any place, so long as it is written in Arabic letters.\nSome of them said that it is not permissible in any case; rather the verses of the Quran may be written in ‘Uthmaani script only.\nAnd some of them said that it is permissible to write it in whatever script is well-known and according to whatever rules of writing are current at any time or in any place for children, to train them in pronouncing the Quran correctly, in contrast to the script used for adults of sound mind, for whom it should be written in the ‘Uthmaani script.\nWith regard to writing it in ornate scripts or in the form of an animal, undoubtedly this is haraam.\nThe believer should venerate the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and show respect towards it. If he wants to write something in an ornate style, then he may use other phrases, such as famous proverbs or aphorisms and the like. But with regard to doing that in the case of the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and giving the letters and words of the Quran different shapes for the purpose of adornment, or even worse than that, making them into the shape of an animal or human, then this is reprehensible and forbidden, and Allah is the One Whose help we seek.\nEnd quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb (4/2).\nIf these guidelines are followed with regard to this matter, then there is nothing wrong with it.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 254.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of the appropriateness of placing the verses of the Holy Quran as backgrounds on mobile phones, computers, and similar devices can be approached from a few angles rooted in Islamic teachings and interpretations. While the Quran does not explicitly address this modern practice, understanding the essence of the Quran, its sanctity, and how it should be treated according to Islamic principles is crucial.\n\n### Respecting the Quran\n\nThe Quran is viewed in Islam as the literal word of God, a sacred text that demands respect. For instance, Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2) instructs believers to maintain the sanctity of God’s offerings and to fear Him, emphasizing the significance of treating divine instructions with care (Al-Ma'idah 5:2). \n\n**Verse Reference**: \n- \"O you who believe, do not violate the (sanctity of) offerings to God...\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:2)\n\nThis verse underlines the importance of respect regarding divine guidance, suggesting that the treatment of the Quran should also be aligned with this respect. If viewing Quranic verses as a background implies a casual or disrespectful attitude, then it might not be appropriate.\n\n### Contemplation and Reflection\n\nThe Quran emphasizes reflection and understanding. For example, in Surah Al-Furqan (25:50), God encourages believers to ponder and reflect on the verses, which is a principal purpose of the Quran (Al-Furqan 25:50). This contemplation aligns with the necessity to engage with the Quran meaningfully.\n\n**Verse Reference**:\n- \"And We distribute it among them in various ways that they may ponder and reflect...\" (Surah Al-Furqan 25:50)\n\n### Modern Applications\n\nUsing Quranic verses as backgrounds on electronic devices can serve as a reminder of one's faith. However, it is essential that this practice does not lead to trivialization. Quranic verses displayed prominently should encourage mindfulness and serve as prompts for reflection rather than simply a decorative element. \n\nIn Surah Al-Furqan (25:30), the Prophet is depicted expressing concern that his people neglected the Quran, which can symbolize a broader issue of respect and understanding (Al-Furqan 25:30). Hence, the display of verses should ideally inspire remembrance and adherence to God's guidance rather than mere aesthetics.\n\n**Verse Reference**:\n- \"The prophet will say: 'O my Lord, my people had fettered the Qur'an.'\" (Surah Al-Furqan 25:30)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile placing verses of the Quran as backgrounds on mobile devices is not inherently forbidden, it should be approached with sincere intent, ensuring that it promotes a deeper connection to spirituality and reflection. The practice should honor the sacredness of the Quran, avoiding any trivialization or disrespect.\n\n### Summary of Recommendations:\n1. **Ensure Respect**: Always treat the Quran with the highest respect, avoiding casual or disrespectful displays.\n2. **Inspire Reflection**: Use the verses as prompts for contemplation rather than as mere decoration.\n3. **Avoid Trivialization**: Ensure that displaying verses does not lead to neglecting their meanings or significance in daily life.\n\nThis balanced approach allows one to incorporate the Quran into modern life while upholding its sanctity and encouraging thoughtful engagement with its teachings."

        "question": "What happened to the Scripture of Ibraaheem and the Zaboor of Dawood (peace be upon them)?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah, may He be exalted, revealed a Scripture to Ibraaheem, as He, may He be exalted, said (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Indeed, this is in the former scriptures,\nThe scriptures of Abraham and Moses”\n[al-A‘laa 87:18-19].\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, has told us in His holy Book about some of what was in the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Or has he not been informed of what was in the scriptures of Moses\nAnd [of] Abraham, who fulfilled [his obligations] – \nThat no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another\nAnd that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives\nAnd that his effort is going to be seen\nThen he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense… ”\n[an-Najm 53:36-40 … until the end of the soorah].\nSimilar to that is the well-known verses at the end of Soorat al-A‘laa, which are quoted above.\nWhat is required of us is only to believe in general terms in the Scriptures that Allah, may He be exalted, sent down to His Prophet Moosaa (peace be upon him), and to believe in whatever is proven to us to be sound through the revelation sent to the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in which there are lessons and exhortations. As for anything more than that, such as details of what those Scriptures contained, we are not obliged to know it and we have no way of knowing it or finding out about its details. Trying to find out about that is taking on something that cannot be proven, and we have no need of that according to the teachings of our religion, for Allah has perfected our religion for us and is pleased with Islam for us as our religion.\nWe know of no religious text that suggests that the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) is still extant, or that the knowledge contained therein reached any of the people of Islam in such a manner that it can be proven and relied upon.\nWhat appears to be the case is that its knowledge was abrogated a long time ago and was lost to people.\nIn fact, this is applicable to the books of the Children of Israel, namely the Torah and the Gospel; there is no longer anything that can be authenticated in that which is extant among them, except for that which is confirmed by Islamic religious texts. As for everything other than that, the most that can be said is that we neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it.\nIf this is the case with regard to the books of the Children of Israel, despite the large numbers of people who venerate them, pay attention to them and refer to them, then it is even more likely that this is the case with regard to the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him). The most can be said about what is extant among people of that, that is attributed to the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), is that it is like the Scriptures and Books of the Children of Israel: we neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it.\nFor more information, see the answers to questions no. 199116 and 126004.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the Zaboor of Dawood (peace be upon him), it is the Book that Allah revealed to him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And your Lord is most knowing of whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And We have made some of the prophets exceed others [in various ways], and to David We gave the book [of Psalms [Zaboor]]” [al-Israa’ 17:55].\nThe word zaboor refers to something written. Tafseer at-Tabari (6/17).\nAt-Taahir said:\nIt is the name for the collected sayings of Daawood (peace be upon him) – some of which are words that were revealed to him, and some are words with which he was inspired, words of supplication and conversing with Allah. It is the book that is known nowadays as the Book of Psalms in the Old Testament.\nEnd quote from at-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer (15/138).\nThe scholars have stated that the Zaboor of Dawood contained words of praise and glorification of Allah, may He be exalted; it did not contain any rulings on what is lawful and what is prohibited (halaal and haraam), or on shares of inheritance or hudood punishments. See Tafseer at-Tabari (14/625).\nAl-Qurtubi said: The Zaboor is the book of Dawood. It contained one hundred and fifty chapters, in which there were no rulings or statements of what is lawful and what is prohibited; rather it was words of wisdom and exhortation.\nThere are references to the contents of the Zaboor and the Scripture of Ibraaheem in some reports which are not proven.\nIn the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) it says:\nI said: O Messenger of Allah, what was the Scripture of Ibraaheem?\nHe said: “It was all proverbs, such as:\nO powerful and arrogant king, I did not appoint you to pile up worldly gains one on top of another; rather I appointed you to avert from Me the supplication of the one who has been wronged, for I do not reject it even if it comes from a disbeliever.\nEvery rational individual, unless he loses his mind, must have certain times: a time in which he converses with his Lord, a time in which he takes stock of himself, a time in which he reflects upon the creation of Allah, and a time in which he focuses on meeting his need for food and drink.\nEvery rational individual should not focus his mind except on three things: seeking provision for the hereafter [by doing righteous deeds], working to earn a living, and finding pleasure in something that is not prohibited.\nThe intelligent man should have insight into the era in which he lives, focus on his own affairs and guard his tongue.\nWhoever regards his words as being among his deeds will speak little and will only speak about what concerns him.”\nI [Abu Dharr] said: O Messenger of Allah, what was the Scripture of Moosa?\nHe said: “It was all exhortations:\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of death, for how can he rejoice?\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of the Fire, for how can he laugh?\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of the divine decree, for how can he strive too hard?\nI am astounded by the one who sees this world and its vicissitudes, for how can he be at ease with it?\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of the reckoning tomorrow, for how can he not strive?”\nThis hadith was narrated by Ibn Hibbaan (361) and others. Al-Arnaa’oot said in his comments on the book of Ibn Hibbaan: Its isnad is da‘eef jiddan (very weak). The same was stated by Shaykh al-Albaani in ad-Da‘eefah. See Tafseer Ibn Katheer (2/472).\nWhat we have stated above about the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) with regard to how authentic it is and the extent to which we may trust its contents, we may also state with regard to the Zaboor, because we have no report to indicate that it has survived. Whatever has been transmitted of it via the People of the Book comes under the same ruling as the Israa’eeliyyaat (reports narrated from Jewish sources), which are of three categories:\n\nAcceptable: this refers to that which is known to be sound due to its having been soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThat concerning which no verdict is given: this refers to that for which it cannot be known whether it is valid or false. It is permissible to narrate reports of this category for the purpose of exhortation and admonition, but we do not believe that it is either sound or false, in compliance with the command of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nRejected: this refers to that which is known to be false, and it is not appropriate to believe it, accept it or narrate it.\n\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 265035 and 22289.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The scriptures of Ibraaheem (Abraham) and Dawood (David) are significant in the narrative of Islamic tradition, as they represent earlier revelations from Allah (God) to humanity. However, the Qur'an indicates that these scriptures were largely lost or altered over time, leading to the necessity for the final revelation, which is the Qur'an. \n\n### 1. **Scripture of Ibraaheem**\nThe Qur'an mentions the legacy and guidance provided to Ibraaheem, emphasizing his importance in the monotheistic tradition. However, the specific scripture given to him is not detailed extensively in the Qur'an. Rather, it is implied that he was given guidance and scriptures, as mentioned in **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:135)**, where it states: \n\n> \"Say, 'We are Muslims for Allah.'\" This refers to the faith of Ibraaheem, who is known as \"the first Muslim\" for submitting to the will of Allah.\n\nIn **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:130-134)**, it is emphasized that Ibraaheem left a legacy of faith for his sons, indicating that the core messages he conveyed were about worshiping one God (Allah) and following His guidance. \n\n### 2. **Zaboor of Dawood**\nThe Zaboor (Psalms) of Dawood is acknowledged in the Quran as a significant scripture. For instance, in **Surah Al-Isra (17:55)**, it states:\n\n> \"And your Lord knows best those who are in the heavens and the earth. And We have preferred some prophets over others; and We gave Dawood (David) the Zaboor.\"\n\nThe Zaboor is depicted as a divine book that brought guidance and wisdom. Nonetheless, like the scripture of Ibraaheem, over time, the original teachings may have been altered or lost.\n\n### 3. **Loss of Original Scriptures**\nThe Qur'an also addresses how earlier communities received their scriptures but diverged from the original teachings. For instance, in **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:75)**, it questions whether the Israelites would alter the words of God after receiving divine revelation:\n\n> \"Do you covet [the faith of] a people, although they were the first to disbelieve in you? And when the truth came to them, they said, 'This is magic!'\"\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the scripture of Ibraaheem and the Zaboor of Dawood are acknowledged within the Qur'an as parts of the continuum of divine guidance given to humanity. However, their original forms and contents are believed to have been lost or altered over time, leading to the need for the final revelation of the Qur'an, which serves to confirm and complete the earlier messages from Allah. \n\nThe verses mentioned demonstrate the essence of faith in monotheism and the acknowledgment of the diverse prophets and their scriptures, solidifying the importance of adhering to the authentic teachings of Islam as revealed in the Qur'an."

        "question": "The principles of tafseer (Qur’anic exegesis)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe should understand that there are principles and guidelines for interpreting the Qur’an, which must be properly understood by the one who engages in tafseer (exegesis) of the word of Allah, may He be blessed and exalted. The scholars have written about the guidelines and principles of tafseer, and have explained the difference between tafseer on the basis of reports and tafseer on the basis of one’s own understanding; they have explained when it is acceptable for a person to speak on the basis of his own understanding; and have differentiated between good understanding and poor understanding, especially with regard to what is mentioned in the question about a person coming up with his own understanding of a verse and understanding it on the basis of what he thinks to be right. Such personal understanding and thoughts should be measured against what the scholars said about the interpretation of this verse, and so on.\nIf the one who has his own personal understanding and thoughts is a seeker of knowledge, and is able to check what the commentators and scholars said, then he may find out for himself what was narrated concerning the meaning of the verse, and the views of respected commentators about the meaning and how they explained the meaning. Then if what he came up with about the meaning of the verse is in accordance with some of these views of respected scholars, then all well and good.\nBut if it is not in accordance with these scholarly views, then he must correct his understanding of the verse by checking it against the views of the scholars. However, he may not find the meaning that he came up with mentioned in the books (of tafseer) that he checks, or it may not be stated exactly as he had in mind, but the view that he came up with may be in harmony with the wording and context of the verse, and with the way that meanings are expressed in Arabic, and may indicate that meaning or point to it in one way or another, and in a way of expression that is regarded as possible by the scholars.\nThis requires further examination and study of the views of the scholars (concerning the verse), because the understanding that he developed could be implied in the wording of some scholars in their commentary on the verse.\nHe may, if possible, discuss his idea (about the meaning of the verse) with some scholars who have knowledge of the Book of Allah and the meaning of its verses.\nYou can refer to the following books\n\nSharh Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer, by Shaykh Dr. Musaa‘id at-Tayyaar\nAt-Tahreer fi Usool at-Tafseer by Shaykh Dr. Musaa‘id at-Tayyaar\n\nto learn about these issues that you need to learn and understand before you venture into the interpretation of the word of Allah, may He be exalted.\nSecondly:\nThe scholars have stated that the Qur’an may be interpreted:\n\nBy the Qur’an\nBy the Sunnah\nBy the words of the early generations (salaf)\nBy the rules of the Arabic language\nBy referring to some of the reports of the People of the Book, and the reasons for revelation (asbaab an-nuzool), in order to understand the meaning of a particular verse.\n\nFor each of these guidelines there is shar‘i evidence, within the framework of which tafseer is to be done. The Qur’an is the most appropriate means of understanding the Qur’an, because it is the word of Allah, may He be exalted. The Messenger is the one who explains the words of Allah, for that is his role. The Qur’an was revealed in the language of the Arabs, so it [the Arabic language and its rules of grammar and expression] is one of the basic means of understanding the Qur’an. The early generations were the closest of people to the language and the most knowledgeable of what meaning the Messenger intended when he spoke, for they were witnesses to the revelation and were aware of the circumstances of and reasons for revelation; they are also people who were proven to be good and righteous, so their interpretation takes precedence over that of others.\nIf you want detailed proof, we advise you to refer to the book al-Istidlaal ‘ala al-Ma‘aani fi Tafseer at-Tabari, by Dr. Naayif az-Zahraani, in which he mentions the evidence for all of this.\nThirdly:\nThe scholars have ways of differentiating between what is sound (saheeh) and what is weak (da‘eef), namely mustalah al-hadith (the science of hadith). By means of this science, a scholar is able to differentiate between what is sound and what is not, and to differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not acceptable of reports.\nThey have a particular way of dealing with the reports of tafseer; you can find details of that in the books mentioned above.\nFourthly:\nWith regard to the hadith “Whoever gives his personal view about the Book of Allah and it turns out to be correct is still mistaken,” that is, because he spoke about something of which he has no certain knowledge, and he approached the matter in a way other than what is enjoined. So even if he was correct in what he said about the meaning when he gave his view on the matter, he still erred, because he did not have the right approach to the matter. He is like one who judges between people on the basis of ignorance: he will be in the Fire, even if he happened to give the right ruling, but his sin is less grave than that of one who gives a wrong ruling. And Allah knows best. This is similar to the case in which Allah calls those who accuse others of adultery (“slander”) liars, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when they do not produce the witnesses, then it is they, in the sight of Allah, who are the liars” [an-Noor 24:13]. The slanderer is a liar, even if his accusation of adultery is correct in and of itself, because he spoke of something of which it is not permissible to speak, even if he spoke on the basis of what he knows, because he has spoken of something of which he does not have certain knowledge. And Allah knows best.\nSee: Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (13/371); Tafseer Ibn Katheer (1/11).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 205290 and 262476.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The principles of **Tafseer** (Qur’anic exegesis) encompass a systematic approach to understanding the meanings and implications of the verses in the Qur'an. This methodology is fundamental for anyone seeking to derive guidance from the Qur'an. The following principles are notable in the context of Tafseer, supported by various verses from the Qur'an:\n\n### 1. **Contextual Understanding (Asbab al-Nuzul)**\n\nUnderstanding the historical and situational context in which specific verses were revealed is crucial. The Arabic term \"Asbab al-Nuzul\" refers to the circumstances that led to the revelation of certain ayat (verses). For instance, in Surah Fussilat, Allah mentions how if the Qur'an had been revealed in a foreign tongue, people would have questioned its clarity:\n\n> **Surah Fussilat (41:44):** \"If We had made it a discourse in an obscure tongue, they would have said: 'Why were its revelations not expounded distinctly? A foreign tongue and an Arab (audience)?'\" \n\nThis verse illustrates the need to examine contextual backgrounds to appreciate the subtleties and specificities of guidance provided in the Qur'an.\n\n### 2. **Linguistic Analysis**\n\nThe **Arabic language**, in which the Qur'an was revealed, is rich and layered. Tafseer often requires a deep understanding of the semantics and grammar of Arabic to fully comprehend the meaning of texts.\n\n> **Surah Fussilat (41:3):** \"A Book whose verses have been distinguished and explained, a lucid discourse for people who understand.\" \n\nThis emphasizes the necessity of linguistic clarity in understanding the scripture.\n\n### 3. **Gradual Revelation**\n\nThe Qur'an was revealed progressively, allowing for a better understanding of its teachings as circumstances evolved. The gradual nature of this revelation is essential for comprehending how Muslims were intended to apply the teachings in their lives.\n\n> **Surah Al-Furqan (25:32):** \"The unbelievers say: 'Why was the whole Qur'an not sent down all at once to him?' It was sent thus that We may keep your heart resolute. So We enunciated it by steps and distinctly.\"\n\nThis implies that the gradual approach facilitates comprehension and the internalization of teachings.\n\n### 4. **Consistency Across Scriptures**\n\nThe Qur'an aligns and confirms the messages of previous scriptures. This principle helps believers understand the continuity of divine guidance throughout history.\n\n> **Surah Fatir (35:31):** \"What We have revealed to you of the Book is the truth, and proves (what has been sent) before it to be true. Verily God is informed of His creatures and sees everything.\"\n\nThus, Tafseer recognizes that the Qur'an serves as a confirmation of former scriptures, which enriches its interpretive framework.\n\n### 5. **Universal Applicability and Specificity**\n\nSome verses address universal themes, while others refer to specific issues of the time. Tafseer must distinguish between these two types of applicability, allowing for an understanding that is both particular and general.\n\n> **Surah Fussilat (41:6):** \"Say: 'I am a man like you, (but) it is revealed to me that your God is one God, so take the straight path to Him...'\"\n\nThis encourages believers to recognize the universal message within personal and contemporary contexts.\n\n### 6. **Role of Faith and Intention**\n\nThe efficacy of the Qur'an and its interpretations often depends on the reader's faith and intention. Those who are disbelieving may find no benefit in the teachings, as their understanding is clouded.\n\n> **Surah Fussilat (41:44):** \"...but for those who do not believe it is a deafness in the ears, and a blindness.\"\n\nThis highlights the necessity of humility and sincerity in seeking understanding.\n\n### 7. **Encouragement of Reflection and Contemplation**\n\nThe Qur'an frequently encourages believers to reflect upon its verses deeply, to derive meaning and lessons relevant to their lives.\n\n> **Surah Taha (20:114):** \"Exalted then be God, the real King; and do not try to anticipate the Qur'an before the completion of its revelation, but pray: 'O Lord, give me greater knowledge.'\"\n\nThis serves as a reminder that contemplation and knowledge-seeking are integral to the exegesis of the Qur'an.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThese principles collectively outline the foundations upon which Tafseer is built, underscoring the Qur'an as both a spiritual guide and a comprehensive source of knowledge for adherents. Understanding these elements contributes to more profound insights and a meaningful application of Qur'anic teachings in daily life."

        "question": "Does Reading the Quran on Phones Rewardable?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The best with regard to reading or reciting the Quran is that which will increase a person in focus of mind. If he will have more focus of mind when he recites from memory, then that is best. If he will have more focus of mind when reading from the Mus-haf or from his mobile phone, then that is best.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Adhkar (p. 90-91):\n“Reading the Quran from the Mus-haf is better than reciting from memory . This is the view of our companions, and it is the well-known view among the early generations (may Allah be pleased with them). But this is not absolute; rather if a person can reflect, ponder and focus more when he recites from memory than when he reads from the Mus-haf, then in his case reciting from memory is better. If both options are equal in that regard, then reading from the Mus-haf is better. This is what the early generations meant when discussing this issue.”\nSome inauthentic Hadiths were narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which are not sound enough to be taken as evidence, concerning the virtue of looking in the Mus-haf. For more information on that, please see the answer to question no. 32594 .\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is there a difference in reward between reading the Quran from the Mus-haf or reciting from memory ? If I read the Quran from the Mus-haf, is it acceptable to read with my eyes only or must I also move my lips? Is it sufficient to move the lips, or must there also be some sound?\nHe replied: \n“I do not know of any evidence to suggest that there is a difference between reading from the Mus-haf or reciting from memory; rather what is prescribed is to reflect and focus, whether one reads from the Mus-haf or recites from memory. It can only be called recitation if it can be heard; it is not sufficient just to look with the eyes, or to think of the words without uttering them. The Sunnah is for the reader to utter the words and reflect, as Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“[This is] a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded.” [Sad 38:29]\n“Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon [their] hearts?” [Muhammad 47:24]\nIf reciting from memory will help one to focus more and reflect more on the Quran, then that is better; if reading from the Mus-haf will help one to focus more and reflect more, then that is better. And Allah is the source of strength.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 24/352)\nThus it will become clear that if you read the Quran from your mobile phone with focus and reflecting on the meaning, your reward will not be less than that for reading from the Mus-haf, in sha Allah. What matters is focus of mind and benefitting from reading the Quran.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 108242 , 125930 , 108477 , and 131946  \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Reading the Quran is an essential practice in Islam, and the question of whether reading it on phones is rewardable is pertinent in today’s technological context. Here are some considerations based on Islamic teachings and relevant Quranic verses.\n\n### The Nature of Reading the Quran\n\n1. **Intent and Sincerity**: The intention behind reading the Quran is paramount in Islam. As long as the motive is sincere—aiming to seek knowledge, understanding, and connection with God—reading the Quran in any format, including on electronic devices like phones, is rewardable. The Quran emphasizes the importance of intention in all actions:\n\n   - *Surah Al-Baqarah (2:225)*: \"God does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...\"\n   - *Surah Al-Baqarah (2:274)*: \"Those who spend of their wealth in the way of God, day and night, in secret or openly, have their reward with their Lord, and have nothing to fear or regret.\"\n\n2. **Accessibility**: The utilization of technology, such as phones, allows individuals to access the Quran conveniently. This accessibility can encourage more frequent reading, reflection, and recitation, aligning with the Quranic directive to read it regularly. \n\n   - *Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)*: \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily...\" indicates that ease and accessibility in recitation are recognized.\n\n### Quran Verses Supporting Reading the Quran\n\n#### Surah Al-Baqarah\n   - *Surah Al-Baqarah (2:185)*: \"The month of Ramadan is that in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for the people and clear proof of guidance and criterion...\"\n   - This verse emphasizes the Quran as a guidance and implies that engaging with it—regardless of the medium—fosters understanding and spiritual growth.\n\n#### Surah Al-Muzzammil\n   - *Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:19)*: \"Indeed, this is a reminder. So let him who wills, take a reminder.\"\n   - This suggests the importance of actively engaging with the Quran, which can include electronic reading.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, reading the Quran on phones is indeed rewardable in Islam, provided that one approaches it with sincerity and intention. This practice not only aids in accessibility but also promotes more regular interaction with the divine text. It is consistent with Allah's commands to read and reflect upon the Quran, regardless of the medium, and aligns with the spirit of seeking knowledge in the simplest form possible. \n\nTherefore, Muslims are encouraged to embrace the use of technology in their spiritual practices, including reading the Quran on phones, which can facilitate understanding and connection to God."

        "question": "All of the Qur’an is good, but some parts are more special than others",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be glorified, sent down the Qur’an to His Prophet, and made its soorahs 114 in number. Some of these soorahs are more special than others, as there are saheeh hadiths which highlight the special virtue of Soorat al-Faatihah, al-Ikhlaas, Soorat al-Kaafiroon, the Mi‘wadhatayn [al-Falaq and an-Naas], az-Zalzalah, al-A‘laa, Soorat al-Baqarah and Aal ‘Imraan. As for the rest of soorahs of the Qur’an, they have their own special virtues too.\nThe soorahs are given names, because each one discusses a particular topic which makes it stand out from other soorahs, and contains rulings, exhortation and etiquette, and it has a particular significance in that the one who recites it will have a reward according to what the soorah contains of exhortation and rulings that are unique to it.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question regarding whether all parts of the Qur'an are good but some are more special than others can be understood through several verses within the Qur'an. Indeed, while every part of the Qur'an is regarded as divinely revealed and beneficial, there are certain sections that emphasize the importance, grandeur, and distinctiveness of the Qur'an itself.\n\n### 1. **The Glorious Nature of the Qur'an**\n\nSurah Al-Waqi'ah (The Inevitable), verses 77-81 assert the esteemed status of the Qur'an, referring to it as \"the glorious Qur'an\" inscribed in a well-kept Book. This highlights its unparalleled nature and the belief that only those who are pure can access its deeper meanings. \n\n- **Verse Citation**: \n  - \"That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an (Inscribed) in the well-kept Book. Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind). It has been revealed by the Lord of all the worlds.\" \n  - **Surah**: Al-Waqi'ah (56), **Ayah**: 77-81.\n\n### 2. **Guidance and Reflection**\n\nIn Surah Al-Furqan (The Criterion), it is mentioned that Allah distributes knowledge and revelations in various ways for reflection. This indicates that while the Qur'an is a complete guide, individuals might find different parts resonate with them or provide specific guidance in unique situations.\n\n- **Verse Citation**: \n  - \"And We distribute it among them in various ways that they may ponder and reflect; yet most men disdain everything but denial and thanklessness.\"\n  - **Surah**: Al-Furqan (25), **Ayah**: 50.\n\n### 3. **Different Styles and Themes**\n\nDifferent Surahs and verses within the Qur'an address various themes and issues pertinent to mankind. Surahs such as Ar-Rahman (The Beneficent) emphasize the mercy and favors of Allah with poignant language that serves both as a reminder and as a call to heed these blessings.\n\n- **Verse Citation**: \n  - \"Which of the favours of your Lord will then both of you deny?\"\n  - **Surah**: Ar-Rahman (55), **Ayah**: 58.\n\n### 4. **A Reminder with Specific Functions**\n\nSurah Al-Muzzammil (The Enshrouded One) acknowledges the depth of worship and recitation of the Qur'an, suggesting that some portions might require more attentiveness and reflection, particularly during the night, a time identified for deep introspection and connection with God.\n\n- **Verse Citation**: \n  - \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily.\" \n  - **Surah**: Al-Muzzammil (73), **Ayah**: 20.\n\n### 5. **Special Significance in Context**\n\nSurah Az-Zukhruf (The Ornaments of Gold) emphasizes the clarity and guidance found within the Qur'an, suggesting that Allah has made it distinctively lucid for understanding.\n\n- **Verse Citation**: \n  - \"I call to witness the lucent Book, That We made it a distinctly lucid Qur'an that you may understand.\"\n  - **Surah**: Az-Zukhruf (43), **Ayah**: 1-5.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Qur'an as a whole is regarded as a comprehensive guide for life, imbued with wisdom and guidance. However, certain parts, by virtue of their content and context, may stand out in their significance or beauty. The verses pointing to the Qur'an's glorious nature, the reflection it invites, the clarity of its message, and its role as a profound reminder all validate the idea that while all of it is beneficial, certain sections hold a distinct place in terms of thematic importance and divine promise."

        "question": "Is it permissible to complete the Qur’an every day? How are we to understand the proven reports which say that the salaf used to complete it in less than three days?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nReading and reciting the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is one of the greatest acts of worship in Islam. How can that not be the case, when what is read is the words of Allah, may He be exalted? In addition to this honour that is attained by the one who reads the Qur’an, Allah, may He be exalted, has promised the reader great rewards in this world and the hereafter, such as it being guidance and healing for him, that for every letter he will have ten good deeds (hasanaat) to his credit, that the Qur’an will intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection, and other rewards and benefits.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 141700.\nHence we see that the noble Sahaabah and Taabi‘een, and those of the early generations of this ummah who followed them, were keen to read the Book of their Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, and they would allocate for themselves a portion of it to be read every day.\nDespite their eagerness to read the Book of their Lord, they adhered to the guidelines set out by Islamic teachings and did not overstep the bounds, and did not let their eagerness cause them to do anything contrary to prophetic guidance. Hence the majority of scholars are of the view that the Qur’an may be completed every seven days, and whoever has the strength to do more should not complete it in less than three days, except in specific circumstances which we will mention below.\nMost of the early generations adhered to the practice of completing it in seven days, following the advice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Read the Qur’an in a month.” I said: I am able to do better than that… Until he said: “Then read it once every seven days, and do not do any more than that.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (4767) and Muslim (1159).\nSo they did not complete it in less than three days, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) discouraged them to do that. \nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah – that is, ibn ‘Amr – said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one properly understands who reads the Qur’an in less than three days.”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (2949), Abu Dawood (1390) and Ibn Maajah (1347); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.\nThis is what the Sahaabah understood from the Prophet’s teachings, and the leading scholars followed them in that.\n-1-\nIt was narrated that Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Read the Qur’an in seven days and do not read it in less than three days.\nNarrated by Sa‘eed ibn Mansoor in his Sunan with a saheeh isnaad, as was stated by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Fadaa’il al-Qur’an (9/78)\n-2-\nIt was narrated from Mu‘aadh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) that he regarded it as makrooh to read the Qur’an in less than three days.\nNarrated by Abu ‘Ubayd in Fadaa’il al-Qur’an (p. 89)’ classed as saheeh by Ibn Katheer in Fadaa’il al-Qur’an (p. 254).\n-3-\nIbn Katheer said:\nMore than one scholar among the early generations regarded it as makrooh to read the Qur’an in less than three days. This is also the view of Abu ‘Ubayd, Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh and others of the later generations.\nFadaa’il al-Qur’an (p. 254)\nIn addition to the fact that the one who reads it in less than three days does not understand it properly, he also does not benefit from the sublime and subtle meanings that are understood by the one who reads the Qur’an with reflection, at a measured pace.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nReading Qur’an in the manner enjoined instils great faith in the heart, and increases a person in certainty, reassurance and healing.\nMajmoo‘ al-Fataawa (7/283).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to what is mentioned in scholarly books about some people completing the Qur’an four times in one day or four times in one night, such reports should be investigated to find out whether they are soundly narrated from their alleged sources, because it is highly unlikely that that happened, as the time is not long enough for that in the first place. The same may be said concerning the claim that some of them completed the Qur’an between Maghrib and ‘Isha’ (!) and other claims that cannot be believed, even if one is able to read quickly. As for reading the entire Qur’an in a single day, that is possible; in fact some of the leading scholars did that – as was narrated from them – in a single rak‘ah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for those who completed the Qur’an in a single rak‘ah, they are innumerable, because they are so many. They include: ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan, Tameem ad-Daari, and Sa‘eed ibn Jubayr.\nAl-Adhkaar (p. 102)\nBut is the one who does that following the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or is he doing something that is not permissible according to Islamic teachings?\nThe answer is that the one who does that as a habit and way of life is undoubtedly doing something that is contrary to Islamic teachings, and he can only be doing that at the expense of neglecting other shar‘i duties such as prayer, teaching his children, upholding ties of kinship and taking care of his family, or by neglecting working to earn a living.\nAs for the one who does that occasionally with the aim of reviewing what he has memorised, or to make the most of auspicious times – such as the month of Ramadan – or because he is observing i‘tikaaf (retreat for worship) in the mosque, or because he is focusing on worship for a limited time in Makkah, for example – then that is not contrary to Islamic teaching. It is in this manner that we may interpret the reports narrated from some of the imams (leading scholars), that they completed the Qur’an twice in one day or once in a day; it is not to be understood that this was their way of life at all times.\nIbn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nQataadah regularly used to complete the Qur’an every seven days, and in Ramadan he would complete it every three days, and in the last ten nights of Ramadan he would complete it every single night. In Ramadan ash-Shaafa‘i used to complete the Qur’an sixty times [i.e., twice a day], reciting it outside of prayer. Something similar was also narrated from Abu Haneefah.\nThe prohibition on reading the entire Qur’an in less than three days is to be understood as referring to doing that persistently. But at auspicious times, such as the month of Ramadan, and especially on the nights on which Laylat al-Qadr is sought, or in auspicious places, such as Makkah for those who go there and are not residents, then it is mustahabb to read a great deal of Qur’an so as to make the most of that time or that place. This is the view of Ahmad, Ishaaq and other leading scholars, and is indicated by the actions of other scholars, as mentioned above.\nLataa’if al-Ma‘aarif, p. 171\nSee also the answer to question no. 50781\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Completing the Qur'an every day is generally considered permissible in Islam. The Qur'an itself encourages believers to recite it and engage with it as much as possible, reflecting the importance of dedicating time to understanding and incorporating its teachings into daily life. \n\nOne central verse that addresses this aspect is from Surah Al-Muzzammil:\n\n> **\"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily.\"**  \n> (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20)\n\nThis verse emphasizes that God understands human limitations and encourages believers to recite the Qur'an to the extent that they are able, without overwhelming themselves. The context provided in earlier ayat shows that the expectation for the recitation is flexible, acknowledging varying circumstances such as illness or travel. \n\nMoreover, companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), as well as the salaf (the early generations of Muslims), had their various practices when it came to the recitation of the Qur'an. It is recorded that some of them completed the entire Qur'an in less than three days. For instance, reports attributed to Ibn 'Abbas state that the Prophet Muhammad encouraged rapid recitation, and the salaf practiced this as well, completing the Qur'an in shorter time frames for special occasions or great devotion (e.g., during Ramadan).\n\nA well-cited narration mentions the frequency of Qur'anic recitation among the companions, illustrating a culture of rigorous engagement with the text. However, while they did recite quickly at times, they also valued understanding and contemplation of the Qur'an, which is crucial.\n\nIn addition, Surah Al-Furqan presents the point of gradual revelation of the Qur'an, which implies that comprehension and reflection on it matter as much as simply reciting it:\n\n> **\"And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy to remember. So is there any who will remember?\"**  \n> (Surah Al-Furqan, 25:32)\n\nThe salaf's approach to reciting the Qur'an rapidly highlighted their deep respect for the text and their desire to connect with it actively. Yet, the act of recitation should also be coupled with understanding, reflection, and application, reinforcing the importance of balance in one’s spiritual practices.\n\nThe guidance from the Qur'an is thus clear: one can certainly aim to complete the Qur'an every day if done in a manner that is easy and manageable for them, while also prioritizing reflection and understanding. There are no hard rules restricting the frequency of recitation, as long as it aligns with the spirit of sincerity and dedication to Allah’s message. \n\nIn conclusion, it is permissible to seek to complete the Qur'an every day, provided that it is done with the intention of sincere worship and accompanied by efforts to understand and implement its teachings."

        "question": "Some of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) who memorised the Book of Allah, may He be exalted",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were the most eager of people to do good and the swiftest in doing righteous deeds, and the most able to do such deeds.\nOne of the greatest of their concerns was memorising the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, learning it and acting upon it, then teaching it to people. They used to learn it from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and they would teach it to one another. So whoever missed out on learning something from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because they were preoccupied with jihad, would learn it from his companions.\nThe most famous of those who used to teach people the Quran include: ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan, ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, and Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with them). They taught many of the younger Sahaabah and, after that, many of the Taabi‘een.\nAbu ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sulami said: Those who used to teach us the Quran told us that they used to learn it from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). When they learned ten verses, they would not move on until they put into practice what those verses said, so we used to learn the Quran and how to act upon its teachings together.\"(Tafseer al-Qurtubi  1/80).\nSo the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) strove to memorise the Book of Allah and teach it to people and help them to memorise it.\nSuwayd ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez said: When Abu’d-Darda’ had prayed Fajr in the mosque of Damascus, the people would gather to learn Quran from him, so he would put them into groups of ten, with an instructor for each group, and he would stand in the mihrab watching them. If one of them made a mistake, he would refer to his instructor, and if the instructor made a mistake, he would refer to Abu’d-Darda’ and ask him about that.\nIt was narrated that Ibn Mashkam said: Abu’d-Darda’ said to me: Count those who are studying the Quran with me. I counted them, and they were over one thousand and six hundred, and for each group of ten there was a teacher.\"(Ma‘rifat al-Qurra’ al-Kibaar, p. 20)\nSecondly:\nA great number of the Sahaabah memorised the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and they were so great in number that they could not all be listed. A number of the scholars mentioned the most prominent of those among them who memorised the Book of Allah.\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAbu ‘Ubayd mentioned those among the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who memorised the Quran. Among the Muhaajireen he listed the four caliphs, Talhah, Sa‘d, Ibn Mas‘ood, Hudhayfah, Saalim, Abu Hurayrah, ‘Abdullah ibn as-Saa’ib and the ‘Abdullahs. Among the women he listed ‘Aa’ishah, Hafsah and Umm Salamah. But some of these only completed its memorisation after the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had died.\nIn Kitaab ash-Sharee‘ah, Ibn Abi Dawood listed among the Muhaajireen also: Tameem ibn Aws ad-Daari and ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir. Among the Ansaar he listed: ‘Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit, Mu‘aadh who was known by the kunyah Abu Haleemah, Mujammi‘ ibn Haarithah, Fadaalah ibn ‘Ubayd, Maslamah ibn Makhlad, and others. He stated that some of them only memorised it after the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had died. Among others who also memorised it was Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari, who was mentioned by Abu ‘Amr ad-Daani. Some later scholars also listed ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, Sa‘d ibn ‘Abbaad and Umm Waraqah as being among those who memorised the Quran.\"(Fath al-Baari  9/52)\nSee also: al-Itqaan by as-Suyooti (1/248-249)\nAmong the most prominent of these Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) are the following:\n1. Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe died on a Monday in Jumaada al-Oola 13 AH at the age of sixty-three. ‘Umar led the funeral prayer for him, and he was buried with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (5/316)\n2. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab\nHe was killed on a Wednesday 26 Dhu’l-Hijjah 23 AH, at the age of sixty-three; there are other views concerning his age.\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (7/441)\n3. ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe was one of those who memorised the Quran at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died a martyr, unlawfully killed in his house, on 18 Dhu’l-Hijjah 35 AH, at the age of eighty-two, according to the correct view.\n4. ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe was killed in Kufah on the morning of 17 Ramadan 40 AH. He memorised the Quran after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and it was said that he memorised it during his lifetime.\n5. Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe was the most prominent of the Quran-reciters, the one who had best memorised the Book of Allah.

        "predicted_answer": "The question touches upon the Sahaabah who memorized the Book of Allah (the Quran), indicating their significance in the early Islamic community. Several Sahaabah (companions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) are known for being proficient memorizers of the Quran, and this role has played a crucial part in preserving the text of the Quran throughout history. Let's explore this in depth with references from the Quran.\n\n### Importance of Memorization in Islam\n\n1. **Preservation of the Quran**: The act of memorizing the Quran is highly regarded in Islam, as it helps in preserving the text. Allah has promised to safeguard the Quran from corruption. As mentioned in the following verse:\n   - **Surah Al-Hijr (15:9)**: \"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian.\" (15:9)\n\n2. **Spiritual Status of Memorization**: Those who memorize the Quran receive elevated status both in this world and the hereafter. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has highlighted this in various hadiths. One such narration states that a memorizer of the Quran will be told on the Day of Resurrection:\n   - \"Recite and ascend, and keep on reciting as you used to recite in the world, for your rank will be at the last verse you recite.\" (Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 3786)\n\n3. **Biblical Examples of Memorization**: The Quran often refers to past prophets who were favored by Allah. These prophets were also given divine scriptures that they memorized and conveyed to their people. In the verses drawn from Surah Sad, we find Allah highlighting the honored positions of the prophets:\n   - **Surah Sad (38:45-49)**: \"And remember Our votaries Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, men of power and insight. We distinguished them for the distinct remembrance of the abode (of the Hereafter).\" (38:45-46)\n\n4. **Excellence of Memorized Knowledge**: The Quran indicates the special status of those who possess knowledge and remember their Lord. It emphasizes the importance of a clear and structured way of conveying this knowledge, which includes memorization:\n   - **Surah Al-A'la (87:6-8)**: \"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, unless Allah wills. He knows what is manifest and what is hidden.\" (87:6-7)\n\n5. **Role of Early Companions**: The companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) played a key role in the initial preservation of the Quran. They were known as \"Huffaz\" or \"Hafiz,\" meaning those who have memorized the Quran. The Quranic reference in Surah Al-Muddaththir indicates the obligation to convey this message:\n   - **Surah Al-Muddaththir (74:52-56)**: \"In fact, every one of them wants to be given open books (like the prophets). By no means. In fact, they do not fear the Hereafter... But they will not remember except as Allah wills.\" (74:52-55)\n\n### Examples of Notable Sahaabah Who Memorized the Quran\n\n1. **Abdullah ibn Umar**: Known for his exceptional memory and understanding of the Quran.\n2. **Ubayy ibn Ka'b**: One of the foremost memorizers and reciters of the Quran, praised by the Prophet himself.\n3. **Zayd ibn Thabit**: Played a critical role in compiling the Quran during the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Uthman.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe memorization of the Quran is a revered practice in Islam, seen as a means of spiritual elevation and a tool for preserving divine guidance for future generations. The Sahaabah who memorized the Book of Allah hold a significant place in Islamic history, laying the foundation for the preservation and transmission of the Quran to later generations.\n\nThese verses and references demonstrate the importance of memorizing the Quran and the elevated status given to those who engage in this noble pursuit. The Quran itself asserts its lasting preservation, and the honored status it grants to those who memorize and reflect upon it remains a core tenet of the faith."

        "question": "False reports than attribute some linguistic errors to the Holy Qur’an",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tWhen answering \n\tthis question, we cannot hide our extreme astonishment that this specious \n\targument was accepted by some researchers and educated people. In fact we \n\tcannot hide our astonishment at how anyone could let this specious argument \n\tconfuse him in the first place, not only because the Muslims should accept \n\tthe infallibility of the Qur’an because Allah promised to preserve it, but \n\talso because we see that this specious argument has no sound rational or \n\tlogical basis.\n\n\tWe may sum up \n\tour refutation of this argument in the following points:\n\n\tI.\n\n\tWe should \n\trealise that the rules of grammar are only based on the styles of expression \n\tthat have been transmitted to us from the eras that are regarded as \n\tauthoritative, and there is no difference of opinion among linguists \n\tconcerning the fact that the era of Prophethood is one of the authoritative \n\teras. Any word narrated soundly to us (from that era) constitutes a valid \n\tlinguistic proof; rather it is valid to be accepted as forming a foundation \n\tfor some rule of Arabic grammar.\n\n\tII.\n\n\tTo clarify that \n\tfurther, we may say: is it valid for a researcher to quote some lines of \n\tverse from Imru’ul-Qays that the scholars narrated from him, and there is no \n\tdoubt concerning its narration, then think that there is some grammatical or \n\tlinguistic error in his view, and thus conclude that Imru’ul-Qays made some \n\tgrammatical errors in his poetry?!\n\n\tIs that not \n\tundermining the foundation on which the rules of grammar are based, and \n\tdemolishing this entire branch of knowledge itself? So how about if some \n\tignorant person concluded that there is a linguistic or grammatical mistake \n\tin the Holy Qur’an, when the noble Sahaabah and Taabi‘een transmitted the \n\tQur’an during the authoritative era and during the time when everyone spoke \n\tcorrect Arabic (fus-ha), and in fact the scholars, grammarians and people of \n\teloquence recited the Qur’an and transmitted it, without anyone among them \n\traising any objection, with a few exceptions with regard to some modes of \n\trecitation that did not reach some grammarians via chains of transmission \n\tthat reached the level of tawaatur.\n\n\tIs it not the \n\tcase that this ignorant person is more deserving of criticism and being \n\tdescribed as mistaken than the pure Arabs, on whose speech the rules of the \n\tlanguage are based?\n\n\tIII.\n\n\tIf we reflect \n\tupon the verses in which they think there was a mistake, we will realise \n\tthat they are in fact in harmony with some known grammatical rules, and that \n\this thinking that there is a mistake in those verses is very far-fetched.\n\n\tAs-Suyooti (may \n\tAllah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tThe scholars of \n\tArabic language spoke about these verses, and they found an explanation for \n\ttheir grammatical structure.\n\n\tAs for the verse \n\t(interpretation of the meaning), “Verily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]” \n\t[Taa-Haa 20:56], there are several explanations:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tIt is in \n\taccordance with a dialect in which the dual form always appears with the \n\talif [i.e., -aani rather than –ayni] in all three cases [nominative \n\t(subject), accusative (object) and genitive (possessive)]. This is the \n\twell-known dialect of Kinaanah and, it was said, of Banu’l-Haarith.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tThe subject of\n\tinna (translated here as Verily), which is omitted, is in the \n\taccusative [in accordance with grammatical rules], so the sentence is \n\tsubject and predicate, the predicate of inna.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tWhat is meant by\n\tinna is kadhaalika (moreover). The word saahiraan (two \n\tmagicians) is the predicate of a hidden [or omitted] subject [and therefore \n\tappears in the nominative form, in accordance with the rules of Arabic \n\tgrammar]. The implied meaning is: they are indeed two magicians.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tWhat is meant by\n\tinna in this instance is “Yes”.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tThe first \n\tsyllable of the word haadhaani [these two] is a pronoun, and the \n\twords “dhaani la saahiraan” are the subject and predicate of inna. \n\tBut we have explained above that this is not possible, because inna \n\tis written on its own and the syllable haa- is connected to the rest of its \n\tword, therefore the way it is written in the Mus-haf does not allow this \n\tinterpretation.\n\n\tI – that is, \n\tas-Suyooti – say: It seems to me that there is another possible explanation, \n\twhich is that the reason why the alif is used here is so as to make the word\n\tsaahiraan rhyme with the word yureedaan (they [dual form] \n\twant). A \n\tsimilar example is seen in the words “and \n\tI have come to you from Saba' (Sheba) with true news [min sabaa’in bi \n\tnabaa’in]” \n\t[an-Naml 27:22].\n\t\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe words “and \n\tthose who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) wa’l-muqeemeena as-salaata” \n\t[an-Nisa’ 4:162], there are also several explanations for it:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tIt is \n\tdisconnected from the context, as if it is saying: And I praise… – because \n\tthat is more eloquent.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the phrase “believe \n\tin what has been sent down to you” \n\tthat is, and they believe in those who perform as-Salaah [the prayer], \n\tnamely the Prophets or, it was said, the angels. It was said that what is \n\tmeant is that they believe in the religion of those who perform the prayer, \n\tso what is meant thereby is the Muslims.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the word “before”, that is, before you and before those who perform the \n\tprayer.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the pronoun “you” in the phrase “before \n\tyou”.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the pronoun “you” in the phrase “to \n\tyou”.\n\n\t6.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the pronoun “them” in the phrase “among \n\tthem”.\n\n\tThese \n\tpossibilities were narrated by Abu’l-Baqa’.\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe words “and \n\tthe Sabians [wa’s-saabi’oona]” [al-Maa’idah 5:69], \n\tthere are also several interpretations:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tIt is a subject \n\tof which the predicate is omitted; in other words, and the Sabians are also \n\tlike that.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the particle inna and the word which follows it (alladheena \n\t– those who), which together form the subject, and it is the predicate, \n\ttherefore it appears in the nominative [in accordance with the rules of \n\tArabic grammar]. \n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the subject of the verb haadu, which means to be Jewish (“those \n\twho are the Jews”).\n\t\n\n\t4.\n\tInna \n\there means Yes. So the words “those who believe” and what comes after that \n\tare nominative, and the words “and \n\tthe Sabians [wa’s-saabi’oona]” \n\tare connected to that.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tIt is like using \n\tthe plural form when referring to the singular.\n\n\tThese \n\texplanations were narrated from Abu’l-Baqa’.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tal-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (1247-1249), ed by Markaz ad-Diraasaat \n\tal-Qur’aniyyah.\n\n\tWe realise that \n\texplaining these grammatical possibilities may take a long time, and many \n\treaders may not understand them because of their subtlety, but we have \n\tquoted them here so that the ignorant ones who try to undermine the Holy \n\tQur’an will realise the extent of their ignorance of Arabic grammar and \n\tlanguage, and thus they may know their limits and not go beyond the dictates \n\tof sound reasoning.\n\n\tIV.\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe reports narrated from some of the Sahaabah and Taabi‘een about this \n\ttopic, there are many such reports, which were compiled by al-Haafiz \n\tas-Suyooti in his book al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (p. 1236-1257), \n\twhere he discuss them in detail. We will limit it here to discussing the \n\thadiths mentioned in the question, which were narrated from ‘Aa’ishah and \n\t‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with them) concerning this matter.\n\n\tThe first report \n\twas narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her).\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah from his father, who said:\n\n\tI asked \n\t‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) about the grammatical mistakes in \n\tthe Qur’an: “Surely, \n\tthose who believe, those who are the Jews and the Sabians [wa’s-saabi’oona]”\n\t\n\t[al-Maa’idah 5:69]; \n\t“and those \n\twho perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) wa muqeemeena as-salaata \n\twa’l-mu’toona az-zakaata” [an-Nisa’ 4:162]; \n\tand “Verily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]” [Taa-Haa 20:63]. \n\tShe said: O son of my sister, these are the mistakes of the scribes; they \n\tmade a mistake when writing.\n\n\tThis report was \n\tnarrated from Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah by two of the Kufi narrators:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tAbu Mu‘aawiyah \n\tad-Dareer\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Sa‘eed ibn Mansoor in as-Sunan (4/1507, no. 769) with this \n\twording. It was also narrated by Abu ‘Ubayd in Fadaa’il al-Qur’an (p. \n\t229, no. 556) and via him by Abu ‘Amr ad-Daani in al-Muqni‘ (p. 119). \n\tIt was narrated by Ibn Jareer at-Tabari in Jaami‘ al-Bayaan (9/359) \n\tand Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif (p. 43).\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\t‘Ali ibn Mas-har \n\tal-Kufi\n\n\tAs was narrated \n\tby ‘Umar ibn Shubbah with his isnaad in Tareekh al-Madinah \n\t(3/1013-1014).\n\n\tSuch a report \n\tthat has such an isnaad is not sound. The problem with it is that the \n\tcritics spoke ill of the reports narrated by Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah himself when \n\the was in Iraq. Even though he was a trustworthy scholar, and in principle \n\twhat he narrated is to be taken as sound and acceptable, he made a few \n\tmistakes that the scholars could notice by examining the text of the hadith \n\tand researching other corroborating reports and similar reports. Because in \n\tthe text of this report there is something that is clearly odd, and there is \n\tno corroborating report narrated via any other chain of narrators, we can \n\tsay that there is a mistake in it.\n\n\tImam adh-Dhahabi \n\t(may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tWhen he – i.e., \n\tHishaam ibn ‘Urwah – came to Iraq at the end of his life, he taught a great \n\tdeal of knowledge, but there were a few hadiths that he reported (during \n\tthat teaching) that were not sound. Such a thing could happen to Maalik, \n\tShu‘bah, Wakee‘ and other trustworthy and prominent scholars.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tMizaan al-I‘tidaal (4/301). See the annotation of Sunan Sa‘eed ibn \n\tMansoor by Dr. Sa‘d al-Humayd (2/659). See also the commentary by Dr \n\tSa‘d al-Humayd (may Allah preserve him) on this report in his annotation of\n\tSunan Sa‘eed ibn Mansoor (4/507-514).\n\n\tIf someone were \n\tto ask: How could al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) and Muslim, in \n\ttheir Saheehs, narrate hadiths from Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah from the \n\tIraqis, and narrate from Abu Mu‘aawiyah, yet here you are rejecting them, \n\teven though as-Suyooti classed this report as saheeh in al-Itqaan (p. \n\t1236) and said that it meets the conditions of the two shaykhs (al-Bukhaari \n\tand Muslim)? The answer to that is that we are rejecting this report here \n\tbecause the text is obviously odd. It is unlikely that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with her) had not heard these verses with this grammatical \n\tstructure from the lips of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n\thim), and thought that the mistakes had occurred at the hands of the scribes \n\tof the Holy Qur’an.\n\n\tIf the critics \n\tfind something definitely odd in a text, they examine the isnaad, looking \n\tfor some subtle problem with it because of which this problem occurred in \n\tthe text. Here the problem is that it is a hadith from Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah \n\twhen he was in Iraq.\n\n\tThe second \n\treport is narrated from ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allah be pleased with \n\thim).\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tfrom him by a number of narrators:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\t‘Ikrimah the \n\tfreed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas.\n\n\tHe said: When \n\tthe Mus-hafs had been written, they were shown to ‘Uthmaan and he found in \n\tthem some grammatical mistakes, but he said: Do not change them, for the \n\tArabs will change them – or will read them correctly. If the scribe had been \n\tfrom Thaqeef and the one who dictated it had been from Hudhayl, these \n\tmistakes would not have occurred.\n\n\tNarrated by Abu \n\t‘Ubayd in Fadaa’il al-Qur’an (2/103, no. 562); Ibn Abi Dawood in \n\tal-Masaahif (1/235, no. 110). They attributed it to as-Suyooti in \n\tal-Itqaan (p. 1239); to Ibn al-Anbaari in ar-Radd ‘ala man khaalafa \n\tMus-haf ‘Uthmaan; and to Ibn Ashtah in al-Masaahif – the latter \n\tare two lost books. This is a da‘eef (weak) report, because the narration of \n\t‘Ikrimah from ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan is mursal, as is his narration from Abu \n\tBakr, ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib and the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace \n\tof Allah be upon him). See: Jaami‘ at-Tahseel (p. 239). Abu ‘Amr \n\tad-Daani clearly stated in al-Muqni‘ (p. 115) that there is an \n\tinterruption of the chain of narration between ‘Ikrimah and ‘Uthmaan. \n\tMoreover, ‘Ikrimah is referred to by Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif as \n\tat-Taa’i and not as the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas, and we have not come \n\tacross his biography.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tYahya ibn Ya‘mur\n\n\tHe said: It was \n\tnarrated by Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif (1/233) and Ibn Ashtah in\n\tal-Masaahif, as as-Suyooti mentioned in al-Itqaan (p. 1240). \n\tThis is also a mursal report, because it does not seem from the biography of \n\tYahya ibn Ya‘mur that he was a contemporary of ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may \n\tAllah be pleased with him). See his biography in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb \n\t(11/305). al-Bukhaari deemed it to be munqati‘ in at-Tareekh al-Kabeer \n\t(5/170). Moreover, there is some confusion about the isnaad, as sometimes it \n\tis narrated from Yahya ibn Ya‘mur from ‘Abdullah ibn Futaybah or ibn Abi \n\tFutaymah, and sometimes it is the other way round, so it is narrated from \n\tIbn Futaymah from Yahya ibn Ya‘mur, as in Tareekh al-Madinah \n\t(3/1013). Qataadah sometimes narrates from Nasr ibn ‘Aasim from Yahya, and \n\tsometimes he narrates from Yahya directly, without mentioning Nasr; or there \n\tmay be two other narrators between him and Yahya, as in the place referred \n\tto above in Tareekh al-Madinah. Al-Baaqillaani pointed out these \n\tdifferences in al-Intisaar li’l-Qur’an (2/136-137).\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\t‘Abd al-A‘la ibn \n\t‘Abdullah ibn ‘Aamir\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Ibn al-Anbaari in ar-Radd ‘ala man khaalafa Mus-haf ‘Uthmaan, as \n\twas mentioned by as-Suyooti in al-Itqaan (p. 1240). The biography of \n\t‘Abd al-A‘la is in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (87/6). In the book there is \n\tnothing to suggest that any of the scholars regarded him as a sound \n\tnarrator.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tQataadah\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif. This version says: When ‘Uthmaan \n\t(may Allah be pleased with him) was given the Mus-haf to check it, he said: \n\tThere are mistakes in it, but the Arabs will recite it correctly. There is \n\tsome ambiguity in its chain of narration about one of the narrators, because \n\tit says: our companions told us.\n\n\tFrom the above \n\tit may be understood that the isnaads of this report are not sound, and \n\tweakness of the isnaad leads to doubt concerning the texts of the report and \n\tregarding the source of those texts.\n\n\tV.\n\n\tThe scholars \n\tdiscussed the way these reports should be understood, as we will highlight \n\there in brief, then follow that with lengthy quotations from the scholars \n\tfor anyone who wants this benefit.\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tThe fact that \n\tall the Mus-hafs that the Sahaabah had agreed on the way these verses were \n\twritten, and that all the Muslims agreed on their recitation, generation \n\tafter generation, proves that there was no grammatical mistake on the part \n\tof the scribe. Rather this is how it was heard from the Prophet (blessings \n\tand peace of Allah be upon him).\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tThe fact that \n\tthe Sahaabah and Taabi‘een were very keen and devoted a great deal of effort \n\tto transmitting the Holy Qur’an, and indeed to transmitting details of the \n\tProphet’s Sunnah and serving this religion, offering their souls and their \n\twealth, means that it is not possible for mistakes to have been made by the \n\tscribes who wrote down the Holy Qur’an, then for no one after them to have \n\tcorrected them until the present day.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt is not \n\tpossible that ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) could issue orders \n\tthat copies of the Qur’an be made and distributed to many regions, so as to \n\tput an end to disputes between reciters, then leave these mistakes caused \n\tthe scribes in the Mus-hafs, and not issue orders that they be corrected. \n\tBelieving that is contrary to sound reasoning.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tIt is possible \n\tto interpret ‘Uthmaan’s words, when he referred to mistakes, as referring to \n\tmistakes in recitation because the way some words are written may be unclear \n\tto some people, at some times. Therefore he reassured the people by saying \n\tthat the Arabs’ understanding of the language would make them correct anyone \n\twho made a mistake in reciting the words of the Qur’an. This is how Abu ‘Amr \n\tad-Daani interpreted this report.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tIt is also \n\tpossible to interpret the words of ‘Aa’ishah as meaning that she thought \n\tthat if other modes of recitation had been chosen (to write the Mus-haf in \n\taccordance therewith), that were in accordance with the rules of the Arabic \n\tlanguage with which ordinary people were familiar, that would have been \n\tbetter. So her regarding what is written as wrong means that it was \n\tdifferent from the recitation that is known and common among the Arabs.\n\n\tIbn Jareer \n\tat-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tIn the \n\trecitation of Ubayy ibn Ka‘b it says: “wa’l-muqeemeena \n\tas-salaata (and those who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah))”\n\t[an-Nisa’ 4:162]. That is how it was written in his Mus-haf, as some \n\thave narrated. If that was a mistake by the scribes, then what must have \n\tbeen the case is that this should have meant that all the other Mus-hafs, \n\tapart from our Mus-haf, must have the same mistake, in a manner contrary to \n\twhat is in our Mus-haf. The fact that our Mus-haf is the same as the Mus-haf \n\tof Ubayy proves that what is in our Mus-haf in that regard is correct and is \n\tnot wrong. Moreover, if that was a mistake in writing, the Companions of the \n\tMessenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), from whom it \n\twas learned, would not have taught the Muslims to recite in an incorrect \n\tmanner, and they would have recited it correctly and would have taught the \n\tummah the correct way of reciting it. The fact that the Muslims transmitted \n\tthe recitation of these verses in the way they are written is the strongest \n\tevidence that what is written is sound and correct, and that there is no \n\tmistake on the part of the scribe.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tJaami‘ al-Bayaan (9/397). See also: al-Kashshaaf by \n\taz-Zamakhshari (1/590).\n\n\tAbu ‘Amr \n\tad-Daani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tIf someone were \n\tto ask: What do you say about the report that they narrated from Yahya ibn \n\tYa‘mur and ‘Ikrimah the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas from ‘Uthmaan (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with him), that when copies were made of the Qur’an, they were \n\tshown to him and he found some grammatical mistakes in them, but he said: \n\tLeave it, for the Arabs will be able to recite it correctly – and this \n\tindicates that there were some mistakes in the writing?\n\n\tI say: This \n\treport, in our view, cannot be raised to the level of constituting proof, \n\tand it is not valid to quote it as evidence, on two counts:\n\n\tFirstly: in \n\taddition to the flaws in its isnaad and the problems with its wording, it is \n\talso mursal, because Ibn Ya‘mur and ‘Ikrimah did not hear anything from \n\t‘Uthmaan and did not see him.\n\n\tAlso, the \n\tapparent meaning of the wording cannot have been said by ‘Uthmaan (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with him), because this report implies criticism of him, and how \n\tcould that criticism be valid when he is known to have attained a high level \n\tof religious leadership, a high status of service to Islam, great sincerity \n\ttowards the ummah and great efforts to do that which is in the best \n\tinterests of the Muslims? It is not possible that he could have compiled the \n\tMus-haf with the help of other righteous Sahaabah, so as to put an end to \n\tdifferences concerning the Qur’an among them, then despite that leave in it \n\tgrammatical mistakes so that someone else (after he was gone) would have to \n\ttake on the task of changing it, who would no doubt not be able to reach his \n\tcalibre or level of knowledge. This is something that no one could accept \n\t(because it does not make sense), and it is not permissible for anyone to \n\tbelieve it.\n\n\tIf he were to \n\task: \n\n\tHow can you \n\tunderstand the report if it was soundly narrated from ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be \n\tpleased with him)?\n\n\tI say:\n\n\tThe way we may \n\tunderstand it is that what ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) meant by \n\tthe grammatical mistakes mentioned is mistakes in recitation, not in the way \n\tit was written, because in many places in the Qur’an, if the words were to \n\tbe recited as they were written, that would give the opposite meaning and \n\twould change the wording. Do you not see the verses in which it says: \n\t“la adhbahannahu (I \n\twill surely …slaughter him)” [an-Naml 27:21], “min naba’ il-mursaleen (the \n\tinformation (news) about the Messengers)” [al-An‘aam 6:34], \n\tand other examples in which an additional alif, yaa or waw appears in the \n\tway it is written. Anyone who recites these words who is not familiar with \n\thow they are usually written will add to the pronunciation something that is \n\tnot part of it, so he will have made a mistake that is clear to anyone who \n\thears him, even though the way it is written is valid and was common. So \n\twhen he realised that, ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said that \n\twhoever is not familiar with the way of writing (some particular words) and \n\tdoes not have knowledge of that among those who come after him, will learn \n\tthat from the Arabs, because the Qur’an was revealed in their language, so \n\tthey will teach him the correct recitation, and will explain to him the \n\tvalidity of the way in which it is written. This is how it is to be \n\tunderstood in my view. And Allah knows best.\n\n\tIf it is said: \n\twhat is meant by the words of ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) at \n\tthe end of this report, “If the scribe had been from Thaqeef and the one who \n\tdictated it had been from Hudhayl, these mistakes would not have occurred”?\n\n\tI say: What it \n\tmeans is that it would not be written in that way, because Quraysh and \n\tothers who took charge of writing the Mus-hafs from people other than \n\tQuraysh used to write these words in this manner, and this way of writing \n\tthese words was common among them, but Thaqeef and Hudhayl, despite their \n\tgood command of Arabic, did not use this way of writing these words. \n\tTherefore if they – and not the Muhaajiroon and Ansaar – had been in charge \n\tof writing the Mus-hafs, they would have written all these words as they are \n\tpronounced, not on the basis of their meaning, because that was the usual \n\tpractice among them and was common. This is how we may understand the \n\tcomment of ‘Uthmaan in my view, if it is proven and anyone can prove it. And \n\tAllah is the source of strength.\n\n\tIf it is said: \n\tThen what is the meaning of the report that you also narrated from Hishaam \n\tibn ‘Urwah, from his father, that he asked ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased \n\twith her) about grammatical mistakes in the Qur’an, about the verses, “Verily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]” [Taa-Haa 20:63], “and \n\tthose who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) wa’l muqeemeena as-salaata \n\twa’l-mu’toona az-zakaata wa’l-mu’minoona Billaah…], and give Zakaah” \n\t[an-Nisa’ 4:162] \n\tand “Surely, those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah, in His Messenger \n\tMuhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and all that was \n\trevealed to him from Allah), those who are the Jews and the Sabians \n\t[wa’s-saabi’oona]” [al-Maa’idah 5:69], \n\tand she said: O \n\tson of my brother, this is the work of the scribes; they made mistakes in \n\twriting?\n\n\tI say:\n\n\tIts meaning is \n\tclear: ‘Urwah did not ask ‘Aa’ishah about the written letters that may be \n\tadded for a reason or taken away for a reason, so as to make things clear \n\t(when adding) or to make writing easier (when taking away). Rather he was \n\tasking her about the modes of recitation in which words may differ, which \n\tmay lead to different meanings, according to the dialects in which Allah \n\tpermitted His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his \n\tummah to recite the Qur’an, and to adhere to whichever mode of recitation \n\tthey wanted, so as to make things easy for them. If this is the case, then \n\tthere is no room for mistakes, error, confusion and slips, for these \n\tdialects are widely known and clear in the Arabic language. If this is the \n\tcase, then she was not referring to the meaning of what is written and it \n\thas nothing to do with that at all. Rather ‘Urwah called that a mistake, and \n\t‘Aa’ishah called the way it is written a mistake, but they did not literally \n\tmean it was a mistake; rather it was by way of exaggeration, because that \n\twas contrary to their way and was not something that they would have chosen \n\tthemselves. That was more appropriate in their view and was what was more \n\tcommon in their view, although not in a definitive way, because of what we \n\texplained above about that being valid and common in the language, and it \n\tbeing common usage in the Arabic language. Furthermore there was consensus \n\tthat these words were to be recited as such and not as they (‘Aa’ishah and \n\t‘Urwah) thought they should be, except for the odd view of Abu ‘Amr ibn \n\tal-‘Ala’, who thought that it was to be recited inna haadhayni in \n\tthis particular instances. [This refers to “Verily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]” [Taa-Haa 20:63]]. \n\tThis is how we should understand this report. But we cannot be certain that \n\tthe Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), despite her \n\thigh status and prominence, and her vast knowledge of Islam and the language \n\tof her people, would accuse the Companions of making grammatical mistakes \n\tand accuse the scribes of making errors, when she was of such a high level \n\tof eloquence and knowledge of Arabic, as was well known and no one would \n\tignore or deny it. That is not appropriate and cannot be true. Some of our \n\tscholars interpreted the words of the Mother of the Believers, They made a \n\tmistake in writing, as meaning that they made a mistake by not choosing what \n\tis more proper of the seven modes of recitation with which the people were \n\tfamiliar, not that what they wrote was a mistake and was not valid, because \n\twhat is not valid is to be rejected by all. no matter how long a time has \n\telapsed since the error was made and no matter how widespread it has become. \n\tSome interpreted the word lahn,  translated here as grammatical \n\terror, as referring to recitation and dialect, such as when ‘Umar (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with him) said: Ubayy is the best reciter among you, even though \n\twe overlook some of his lahn – i.e., his way of recitation and \n\tdialect. This is clear. And Allah is the source of strength. End quote from\n\tal-Muqni‘ (118-119).\n\n\tAs-Suyooti (may \n\tAllah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tThese reports \n\tare very problematic.\n\n\tHow can it be \n\tthought of the Companions, first of all, that they made grammatical mistakes \n\twhen speaking, let alone when reciting Qur’an, when they were the most \n\teloquent of people in Arabic!\n\n\tSecondly, how \n\tcan it be thought that they made grammatical mistakes in the Qur’an which \n\tthey learned from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as \n\tit was revealed, and they memorised it and were very precise with regard to \n\tit?\n\n\tThirdly, how \n\tcould it be thought of them that they would all make the same mistake and \n\twrite it in a mistaken way?\n\n\tMoreover, how \n\tcan it be thought that they would not notice that and correct it?\n\n\tThen how can it \n\tbe thought that ‘Uthmaan would forbid them to correct the mistake?\n\n\tThen how could \n\tit be thought that the recitation of the Qur’an would continue on the basis \n\tof that mistake, when the Qur’an was transmitted via tawaatur, one \n\tgeneration after another?\n\n\tThis is \n\timpossible on the basis of rational thinking and Islamic teachings and on \n\tthe basis of how things are.\n\n\tThe scholars \n\tresponded to that on three counts:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tThat was not \n\tsoundly narrated from ‘Uthmaan. Its isnaad is weak (da‘eef), flawed \n\t(mudtarib) and interrupted (munqati‘). Moreover, ‘Uthmaan intended to make \n\tthe Mus-haf the reference point to be followed, so how could he see in it \n\tgrammatical mistakes and leave them for the Arabs to correct them when they \n\trecited it. If those who were charged with collecting the Mus-haf and \n\tputting it together in one book, who were the best of people, did not \n\tcorrect it, then how could others do that?!\n\n\tMoreover, \n\t‘Uthmaan did not only make one copy of the Qur’an; rather he made many \n\tcopies. So if it is said that there were grammatical mistakes in all of \n\tthem, it is very far-fetched to suggest that the same mistake would be \n\trepeated in all of them, or if the mistake happened in some of them, then \n\tthis is an acknowledgement that some were correct. But none of the reports \n\tsaid that this mistake was in one Mus-haf and not another. The Mus-hafs \n\tnever differed, except in cases where there is an alternative mode of \n\trecitation, and that is not a grammatical error.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tIf we assume \n\tthat the report is sound, then it is to be interpreted as referring to the \n\tsigns or symbols showing where something is omitted, such as the long alif \n\tin words such as al-kitaab (the book), as-saabiroon (the \n\tpatient ones) and so on.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt may be interpreted as referring to words where the way in \n\twhich they are pronounced is different from the way in which they are \n\twritten. For example, they wrote “la adhbahannahu (I \n\twill surely …slaughter him)” \n\t[an-Naml 27:21], \n\twith an alif after the laam, and “bi aydin (With power)” [adh-Dhaariyaat \n\t51:47] with two yaas. If these words to be recited as they are written, \n\tthat would be a grammatical mistake. \n\n\tThis response \n\tand the previous one were given by Ibn Ashtah in Kitaab al-Masaahif.\n\n\tIbn al-Anbaari \n\tsaid in ar-Radd ‘ala man khaalafa Mus-haf ‘Uthmaan, concerning the \n\thadiths narrated from ‘Uthmaan about that:\n\n\tThey do not \n\tconstitute proof, because their isnaads are interrupted and are not intact. \n\tNo man of common sense and reasoning could accept that ‘Uthmaan – who was \n\tthe caliph of the ummah and the leader of the people of his time – could \n\tunite them in accepting the Mus-haf which was the main reference, then \n\trealise that there were mistakes in it and mistakes in the way in which it \n\twas written, then not correct them. No, by Allah, no one who is fair minded \n\tand possesses understanding could think such a thing. He could not believe \n\tthat he would leave the mistake in the books of the people after him to \n\tcorrect it, when the people who would come after him would have no choice \n\tbut to refer to it and go by it. Whoever claims that when ‘Uthmaan said, “I \n\tsee mistakes in it,” he mean, I see mistakes in the way it is written, then \n\tif we recite it correctly the mistake in writing will not matter in the \n\tsense of distorting the words and going against grammatical rules, is \n\tmistaken, because the way it is written is the way it is to be recited and \n\tpronounced. So whoever makes a mistake in writing will make a mistake in \n\twhat he utters. ‘Uthmaan would never have delayed correcting a mistake \n\tconcerning the words of the Qur’an, whether in the way they are written or \n\tthe way they are pronounced. It is well-known that ‘Uthmaan was constantly \n\tin contact with the Qur’an, and was skilled in reciting it in accordance \n\twith the way it was written in the copies of the Qur’an that were sent to \n\tthe various regions. He (as-Suyooti) supported that with what Abu ‘Ubayd \n\tnarrated. He said: ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Mahdi told us, from ‘Abdullah ibn \n\tMubaarak: Abu Waa’il, an old man from Yemen, told us, from Haani’ \n\tal-Barbari, the freed slave of ‘Uthmaan, who said: I was with ‘Uthmaan when \n\tthey were presenting the Mus-hafs to him. He sent me to Ubayy ibn Ka‘b with \n\tthe shoulder blade of a sheep, on which was written, “lam yatasanna” and \n\t“laa tabdeelah lil-khalq” and “fa amhil al-kaafireen”. He called for an ink \n\tpot and erased one of the two laams (in the word “lil khalq”) and wrote “li \n\tkhalq-illah (“in the creation of Allah” – referring to the verse \n\t“No \n\tchange let there be in Khalq¬illâh (i.e. the religion of Allâh)” \n\t[ar-Room 30:30]). \n\tHe erased the word fa amhil and wrote “fa mahhil” (“so give respite” \n\treferring to the verse“So \n\tgive respite to the disbelievers” \n\t[at-Taariq 86:17]). \n\tAnd he wrote lam yatasannah (“they show no change”, referring to the verse\n\t“they \n\tshow no change” \n\t[al-Baqarah 2:259]); \n\the added the letter haa’ to it. \n\n\tIbn al-Anbaari \n\tsaid: How can it be claimed that he saw some mistakes and let them pass, \n\twhen he was checking what was written and disputes between scribes were \n\treferred to him so that he could judge on the basis of truth, and he would \n\tcompel them to write what is correct and make it final?\n\n\tThis is also \n\tsupported by what Ibn Ashtah narrated in al-Masaahif. He said: \n\tal-Hasan ibn ‘Uthmaan told us: ar-Rabee‘ ibn Badr informed us, from Siwaar \n\tibn Shubayb, who said: I asked Ibn az-Zubayr about the Mus-hafs and he \n\tsaid:  A man went to ‘Umar and said: O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, the people are \n\targuing about the Qur’an. ‘Umar thought of collecting the Qur’an and making \n\tit according to one recitation, but then he was fatally stabbed. During the \n\tcaliphate of ‘Uthmaan, that man stood up and spoke to him about the issue, \n\tand ‘Uthmaan collected and made copies of the Mus-hafs. Then he sent me to \n\t‘Aa’ishah, and I brought the pages and showed them to her so that she could \n\tcorrect them, then he ordered that all other copies be destroyed. This \n\tindicates that they checked it and verified it, and they did not leave \n\tanything that needed to be corrected but they corrected it.\n\n\tThen Ibn Ashtah \n\tsaid: Muhammad ibn Ya‘qoob informed us: Abu Dawood Sulaymaan ibn al-Ash‘ath \n\tinformed us: Ahmad ibn Mas‘adah informed us: Ismaa‘eel informed us: \n\tal-Haarith ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahman told me, from ‘Abd al-A‘la ibn ‘Abdullah ibn \n\t‘Aamir who said: When the writing of the Mus-haf was finished, it was \n\tbrought to ‘Uthmaan and he looked at it, then he said: You have done well. I \n\tsee something but we will be able to correct it according to our dialect.\n\n\tThere is no \n\tproblem with this report, and it explains the meaning of what appears above. \n\tIt is as if it was shown to him immediately after the writing of it was \n\tfinished, and he saw something in it that was written differently from the \n\tway Quraysh would pronounce it, as happened with the word taaboot \n\t[which may be written with taa’ marbootah or taa’ maftoohah], so he promised \n\tto correct it according to the dialect of Quraysh. Then he fulfilled that \n\tpromise when he examined it and verified it, and he did not leave anything \n\t(that needed to be corrected but he corrected it). Perhaps the one who \n\tnarrated those reports quoted above distorted what he heard and did not \n\tremember it precisely as ‘Uthmaan had said it, which resulted in this \n\tconfusion. This is the best answer that could be given for this problem, to \n\tAllah be praise.\n\n\tSo none of these \n\tresponses is sound with regard to the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah.\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe response that classes it as da‘eef (weak), that is to be rejected \n\tbecause its isnaad is saheeh (sound) as you see. \n\n\tAs for the \n\tresponse which speaks of signs or symbols showing where something is \n\tomitted, ‘Urwah’s question about the words mentioned does not fit that \n\tdiscussion.\n\n\tIbn Ashtah said \n\t– and Ibn Jabbaarah followed him in Sharh ar-Raa’iyyah, that what is meant \n\tby her saying, They made a mistake means: in choosing that which was more \n\tappropriate of the seven modes of recitation, according to which all people \n\tcould recite. It does not mean that the way they wrote it is wrong and is \n\tnot permissible. He said: The evidence for that is that whatever is not \n\tpermissible is to be rejected by all, regardless of the passage of time \n\tsince that mistake was made.\n\n\tHe said: With \n\tregard to the view of Sa‘eed ibn Jubayr about it being a lahn on the part of \n\tthe scribe, perhaps what he meant by lahn is recitation and dialect, meaning \n\tthat this is the dialect of the one who wrote it and the way he recited it, \n\tand there is another way to recite it .\n\n\tThen he narrated \n\tfrom Ibraaheem an-Nakha‘i that he said: “inna hadhaani la saahiraan” \n\t[Taa-Haa 20:63] and “inna hadhayni la saahiraan” are the same. \n\tPerhaps they wrote alif instead of yaa, and in “wa’s-saabi’oona” [al-Maa’idah \n\t5:69] they wrote waw instead of yaa’.\n\n\tIbn Ashtah said:\n\n\tThat is, it is \n\takin to replacing a letter when writing it with another letter, as in the \n\twords salaah, zakaah and hayaat [which in the Qur’an are written with a waw \n\talthough they are pronounced as if they are written with a long alif].\n\n\tAnd I say: This \n\tanswer could be fine if it was recited with a yaa’, but the way it is \n\twritten is different. As recitation is done according to the way it is \n\twritten, there is no comparison between the two.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tal-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (p. 1241-1247).\n\n\tSee also: \n\tMajmoo‘ al-Fataawa by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (15/252-255)\n\n\tAnd Allah knows \n\tbest.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Holy Qur'an has faced criticism and skepticism throughout history, with some claims asserting linguistic errors within its verses. However, these claims are contested by the Qur'an itself, which defends its integrity and authenticity. The Qur'an asserts its divine origin and challenges anyone to find errors within it.\n\n### 1. Divine Protection Against Fabrication\n\nSurah 69, Al-Haqqah (The Reality), addresses the authenticity of the Qur'an and warns against the consequences of attributing falsehoods to it. \n\n- **Verses 40-44**: *\"This is indeed the word of the noble Messenger, and not the word of a poet. How little is it that you believe! Nor is it the word of a soothsayer. Little is it that you reflect! It has been sent down by the Lord of all the worlds.\"*  \n*Surah Al-Haqqah (69:40-44)*\n\nThese verses clearly state that the Qur'an is not merely poetic or prophetic speech, but it is a revelation from God. The subsequent verses underscore that if the Messenger had freely invented false verses, he would have faced severe consequences. \n\n- **Verses 44-48**: *\"Had he attributed falsely any words to Us, We would have seized him by his right hand, then cut off his aorta.\"*  \n*Surah Al-Haqqah (69:44-48)* \n\nThis illustrates the serious implications of misrepresentation, emphasizing the divine safeguard over the Qur'an.\n\n### 2. Response to Accusations of Fabrication\n\nIn Surah 46, Al-Ahqaf (The Wind-Curved Sandhills), the accusations against the Prophet Muhammad as a fabricator are explicitly contested. \n\n- **Verses 8-11**: *\"Do they say: 'He has fabricated it?' Tell them: 'If I have fabricated it, you have no power to save me from God... My duty is only to warn you clearly.'\"*  \n*Surah Al-Ahqaf (46:8-11)* \n\nThe Prophet asserts that his role is to convey the message as revealed to him. He challenges those who accuse him of fabrication to consider the evidence of his truthfulness.\n\n### 3. The Nature of Revelation\n\nThe Qur'an emphasizes that it is a divine revelation without any contradictions or errors. \n\n- **Surah 41, Fussilat (Explained in Detail), Verse 42**: *\"Falsehood cannot enter it from any side; it's a revelation from the All-Wise and Praiseworthy.\"*  \n*Surah Fussilat (41:42)* \n\nThis verse asserts that the Qur'an stands apart from human writings, which can contain errors and contradictions.\n\n### 4. Knowledge and Wisdom\n\nSurah 16, An-Nahl (The Bee), discusses the nature of divine communication and the reception of divine truths.\n\n- **Verses 101-105**: *\"When We replace a message with another...they say: 'You have made it up;' yet most of them do not know.\"*  \n*Surah An-Nahl (16:101-105)* \n\nThese verses indicate that the critics often do not understand the wisdom behind the revelations and question the Qur'an’s authenticity out of ignorance.\n\n### 5. The Consequences of Disbelief\n\nThe Qur'an warns about the consequences faced by those who reject its truths. \n\n- **Surah 63, Al-Munafiqun (The Hypocrites), Verse 1**: *\"When the hypocrites come to you, they say: 'We affirm that you are the Apostle of God.' God indeed knows you are His Apostle. God bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars.\"*  \n*Surah Al-Munafiqun (63:1)* \n\nThis highlights the distinction between true believers and those who only outwardly affirm faith while internally they harbor doubts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claims of linguistic errors in the Holy Qur'an are met with strong assertions within the text itself that defend against such accusations. The Qur'an emphasizes its divine origin, asserts its integrity, and challenges believers and skeptics alike to reflect on its messages. The emphasis on its linguistic consistency and the severe warnings against fabricating or misrepresenting its verses further underpin its claims to truthfulness and authenticity.\n\n**Citations:**\n\n- **Surah Al-Haqqah (69:40-48)**\n- **Surah Al-Ahqaf (46:8-11)**\n- **Surah Fussilat (41:42)**\n- **Surah An-Nahl (16:101-105)**\n- **Surah Al-Munafiqun (63:1)**"

        "question": "Ruling on writing the Qur’an or part of it in an alphabet other than Arabic then pronouncing it in Arabic – will one have the reward of reciting it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly: \n\n\tIn the answer to question no. 97741 we \n\tstated that it is not permissible to write the Holy Qur’an in anything other \n\tthan ‘Uthmaani script. \n\n\tSecondly: \n\n\tIf it is not permissible to write the Holy Qur’an in anything \n\tother than ‘Uthmaani script, then it is more appropriate to note that it is \n\tnot permissible to write it in anything other than Arabic letters. \n\n\tThe Islamic texts indicate, and the scholars of Islam are \n\tunanimously agreed, that it is obligatory to protect the word of Allah, may \n\tHe be exalted, from distortion and alteration, and undoubtedly writing it in \n\tanything other than Arabic letters is one of the most likely ways that lead \n\tto distortion of its pronunciation and meanings, because of the clear \n\tdifference between the nature of the Arabic language – with its letters, \n\twords, style, ways of writing, ways of pronouncing, and the usage of its \n\tnative speakers – and other languages. \n\n\tIt says in the book Tahreem Kitaabat al-Qur’an al-Kareem \n\tbi Huroof ghayr ‘Arabiyyah (Prohibition on writing the Holy Qur’an in \n\tnon-Arabic letters – 1/36): \n\n\tAfter studying the topic, discussing it and exchanging \n\topinions concerning it, the Committee unanimously agreed that it is \n\tprohibited to write the Qur’an in Latin script or the letters of any other \n\tlanguage, for the following reasons: \n\n\t1.\n\n\tThe Quran was revealed in a clear Arabic tongue, both letters \n\tand meanings. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n\tmeaning):\n\n\t“And truly, \n\tthis (the Quran) is a revelation from the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, \n\tjinns and all that exists),\n\n\tWhich the trustworthy Rooh (Jibrael (Gabriel)) has brought \n\tdown\n\n\tUpon your heart (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be \n\tupon him)) that you may be (one) of the warners,\n\n\tIn the plain Arabic language”\n\n\t[ash-Shu‘ara’ 26:192-195]. \n\n\tWhat is written in Latin letters cannot be called Quran, \n\tbecause Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t“And thus We have sent it down as a Quran in Arabic”\n\n\t[Ta-Ha 20:113]\n\n\t“And indeed We know that they (polytheists and pagans) say: \n\t\"It is only a human being who teaches him (Muhammad (blessings and peace of \n\tAllah be upon him)).\" The tongue of the man they refer to is foreign, while \n\tthis (the Quran) is a clear Arabic tongue”\n\n\t[an-Nahl 16:103]. \n\n\t2.\n\n\tThe Quran was written down when it was revealed, and when it \n\twas compiled by Abu Bakr and ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with them), in \n\tArabic letters. All the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) agreed to \n\tthat, as did all the Taabi‘een, and those who came after them, until the \n\tpresent day, despite the fact that there were those who did not speak \n\tArabic. And it is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n\tupon him) that he said: “You must adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the \n\tRightly-Guided Caliphs after me…” \n\n\tSo it is obligatory to adhere to that, following what was \n\tdone at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n\tand the Rightly-Guided Caliphs who succeeded him, and acting in accordance \n\twith the consensus of the ummah. \n\n\t3.\n\n\tThe letters of different languages are something that people \n\tagree upon and are subject to being changed and replaced with other letters. \n\tTherefore there is the fear, if this door is opened, that it may lead to \n\tchange every time people decide to pronounce a certain letter in a different \n\tmanner, and there is the fear that the recitation may change accordingly, \n\twhich would lead to confusion with the passage of time, so that the enemies \n\tof Islam could find a way to criticise the Qur’an, as happened with the \n\tprevious Scriptures. So it is essential to prevent that, in order to \n\tpreserve the source of Islam and block the means that may lead to evil and \n\tcorruption. \n\n\t4.\n\n\tIf a concession is granted allowing that or it is approved, \n\tthere is the fear that the Quran may become a toy in people’s hands, so each \n\tone may suggest writing it in his alphabet or in any other alphabet, and \n\tundoubtedly that will lead to differences and confusion. It is essential to \n\tprotect the Quran from that, so as to protect Islam and preserve the Book of \n\tAllah from tampering and variations. \n\n\t5.\n\n\tWriting the Quran in letters other than Arabic will \n\tdiscourage the Muslims from learning the Arabic language, in which they \n\tworship their Lord and learn and understand their religion. \n\n\tAnd Allah is the source of strength; may Allah send blessings \n\tand peace upon Muhammad and his family and companions. \n\n\tCouncil of Senior Scholars \n\n\tWe put this question to His Excellency Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez \n\tibn Baaz, Secretary-General of the Academic Research Council, and he \n\tgraciously sent us this fatwa that was issued by the Council in its \n\tfourteenth session held in at-Taa’if in Shawwaal 1399 AH. \n\n\tFrom the above it is clear that the writing and recitation \n\tthat brings reward for the one who recites a letter of the Book of Allah \n\tonly refers to the one who writes it and reads it in Arabic, as Allah \n\trevealed it. As for the one who writes it in anything other than Arabic – \n\tand more so the one who pronounces it – he has done something that is not \n\tprescribed in Islam. \n\n\tBut for the one who is unable to write it in Arabic, or wants \n\tto quote from it in a book that he has written in a language other than \n\tArabic, he may write a translation of the meanings of what he wants to \n\tquote, but he should not write that for the purpose of recitation and \n\tworship, as appears to be referred to in the question. \n\n\tAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question regarding the ruling on writing the Qur'an or parts of it in an alphabet other than Arabic and then pronouncing it in Arabic pertains to the nature of recitation (tilawah) in Islam. To address this question, we need to consider the importance of the original Arabic text, the concept of preserving the Qur'an, and the intentions behind recitation.\n\n### The Importance of the Original Arabic Text\n\n1. **Preservation of the Qur'an**: The Qur'an is believed to be the literal word of God, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in Arabic. This emphasis on Arabic is underscored by the sacred nature of the original text. The Qur'an states, “Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an that you might understand” (Surah Al-Yusuf, 12:2). This highlights the significance of the Arabic language as a medium for the Qur'an.\n\n2. **Reward for Recitation**: The act of reciting the Qur'an in Arabic is accompanied by immense rewards. In this context, Surah Al-Qalam states, \"Indeed, you will find recitation that is unending for you\" (Surah Al-Qalam, 68:3). This reinforces the merit associated with recitation, particularly when performed in Arabic.\n\n### The Ruling on Writing and Pronouncing in Non-Arabic Alphabet\n\n1. **Recitation and Intention**: The intention behind reciting the Qur'an is paramount. While pronouncing the Qur'an in Arabic from a written form in a different alphabet may allow a person to recite the words, the question arises whether this fulfills the same spiritual reward as reciting the original Arabic text. Scholars have differing opinions on this matter, but it is generally emphasized that the recitation should be done in the original Arabic text to attain the full spiritual benefits.\n\n2. **Understanding and Accessibility**: One can argue that writing the Qur'an in different alphabets may help non-Arabic speakers to learn and recite the text. However, the authenticity and the recommended practice remain rooted in reciting the Qur'an in its original Arabic form. The Qur’an emphasizes the importance of following its commands and properly engaging with its teachings (Surah Al-Jathiyah, 45:28-30). \n\n3. **Potential for Misinterpretation**: Transliteration could lead to misunderstandings or mispronunciations, which detracts from the original message. As highlighted, \"each community will be summoned to its ledger of good and evil deeds,\" referring to the accountability of our actions (Surah Al-Jathiyah, 45:28). Consequently, adhering strictly to the original Arabic text is seen as crucial for retaining the divine message.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while attempting to write the Qur'an in a different alphabet and reciting it in Arabic might be a step towards honoring the text, it does not replace the original Arabic recitation, which is a deliberate act of worship and devotion. The general ruling among scholars is that the full reward for reciting the Qur'an is attained by reciting it in the original Arabic.\n\nFor further understanding, the following verses help illustrate this point:\n\n- **Surah Al-Yusuf (12:2)**: \"Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an that you might understand.\"\n- **Surah Al-Jathiyah (45:28-30)**: \"You will see each community kneeling down; and each community will be summoned to its ledger (of good and evil deeds). You will receive upon that day your recompense for what you had done.\"\n\nThese verses emphasize the importance of the Arabic text for comprehension and accountability, supporting the conclusion that writing the Qur'an in a different alphabet may not yield the same spiritual reward as reciting it in Arabic."

        "question": "Pausing at the ends of verses is Sunnah, even if they are connected to what follows",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly: \n\n\tIt is Sunnah to pause at the ends of verses, even if they are \n\tconnected to what comes after them, according to the more correct of the two \n\tscholarly opinions. \n\n\tIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used \n\tto interrupt his recitation, pausing at the end of every verse, so he would \n\tsay: “Al-hamdu Lillahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen (All \n\tthe praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, jinns \n\tand all that exists)),” \n\tand pause; “ar-Rahmaan ir-Raheem (The Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful)”, \n\tand pause; ‘Maaliki yawm id-deen (The Only Owner (and the Only Ruling \n\tJudge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of Resurrection))”… \n\n\tAz-Zuhri stated that the recitation of the Messenger of Allah \n\t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was verse by verse, and this is \n\twhat is best, to pause at the ends of verses, even if they are connected to \n\twhat comes after them. \n\n\tSome reciters are of the view that one should pay attention \n\tto the meaning and context of the verses, and pause at the end of each \n\tmeaning, but following the practice and Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and \n\tpeace of Allah be upon him) is preferable. \n\n\tThis was mentioned by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan \n\tand others, and he regarded it is more correct to pause at the ends of \n\tverses, even if they are connected to what comes after them. End quote. \n\n\tZaad al-Ma‘aad \n\t(1/326) \n\n\tIbn al-Jazari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tSome of them regarded pausing at the end of the verses as \n\tSunnah. Abu ‘Amr said: That is dearer to me. This view was also favoured by \n\tal-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan and by other scholars. They said: What \n\tis best is to pause at the ends of verses, even if they are connected to \n\twhat comes after them. They said: Following the practice and Sunnah of the \n\tMessenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is preferable. \n\tEnd quote. \n\n\tAn-Nashr fi’l-Qiraa’aat al-‘Ashr \n\t(1/226) \n\n\tSecondly: \n\n\tThis is also indicated by what is proven in the Sunnah, that \n\tthe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pause at the \n\tends of verses. \n\n\tAbu Dawood (4001) and at-Tirmidhi (2927) narrated that Umm \n\tSalamah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n\thim) used to interrupt his recitation, so he would recite, “Al-hamdu \n\tLillahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen (All \n\tthe praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, jinns \n\tand all that exists)),” \n\tthen pause; “ar-Rahmaan ir-Raheem (The Most Beneficent, the Most \n\tMerciful)”, then pause. \n\n\tIbn al-Jazari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tThis is a hasan hadith; its isnaad is saheeh. \n\n\tAn-Nashr fi’l-Qiraa’aat al-‘Ashr \n\t(1/226) \n\n\tIt was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi \n\tDawood. \n\n\tAl-Qaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\t“He would interrupt his recitation” means that he would \n\trecite with pauses at the ends of verses. End quote. \n\n\tMirqaat al-Mafaateeh \n\t(4/1503) \n\n\tAhmad (26470) narrated from Naafi‘ ibn ‘Umar, from Ibn Abi \n\tMulaykah, from one of the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \n\tbe upon him) – Naafi‘ said: I think it was Hafsah – that she was asked about \n\tthe recitation of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be \n\tupon him), and she said: You cannot do that. He said: I said to her: Tell us \n\tabout it. He said: So she recited with a slow and deliberate pace. Naafi ‘ \n\tsaid: Ibn Abi Mulaykah demonstrated to us: “Al-hamdu \n\tLillahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen (All \n\tthe praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, jinns \n\tand all that exists)),” \n\tthen he stopped; “ar-Rahmaan ir-Raheem (The Most Beneficent, the Most \n\tMerciful)”, then he stopped; ‘Maaliki yawm id-deen (The Only Owner \n\t(and the Only Ruling Judge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of \n\tResurrection))”… \n\n\tThe commentators on al-Musnad said: Its men are \n\tthiqaat (trustworthy), the men of the two shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim]. \n\n\tIt was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Sifat as-Salaah \n\t(1/295). \n\n\tAt-Tirmidhi (2923), an-Nasaa’i (1022) and al-Haakim (1165) \n\tnarrated from Ya‘la ibn Mamlak that he asked Umm Salamah about the Messenger \n\tof Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his prayer. She \n\tsaid: His prayer is different from yours. Then she described his recitation, \n\tand she described a recitation in which every single letter was very clearly \n\tpronounced. \n\n\tClassed as saheeh by at-Tirmidhi and al-Haakim; classed as \n\thasan by al-Baghawi in Sharh as-Sunnah (4/482); classed as da‘eef by \n\tal-Albaani in Da‘eef at-Tirmidhi\n\n\tAs-Sakhkhaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tHer words “in which every single letter was very clearly \n\tpronounced” refer to what we have seen above in the first hadith about \n\tpausing at the end of every verse. End quote. \n\n\tJamaal al-Qurra’ \n\t(p. 668) \n\n\tThirdly:\n\n\t Some of the scholars are of the view that pauses should not \n\tbe made at the ends of verses if there is a strong connection to what \n\tfollows, as in the passage in which Allah, may He be exalted, says \n\t(interpretation of the meaning): “So \n\twoe unto those performers of Salat (prayers) (hypocrites), Who delay their \n\tSalat (prayer) from their stated fixed times” \n\t[al-Maa‘oon 107:4-5]. \n\n\tZakariyya al-Ansaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in \n\tal-Maqsid (p. 5): \n\n\tIt is Sunnah for the reciter to learn the pauses, and to \n\tpause at the ends of verses, except in cases where there is a strong \n\tconnection to what follows, as in the verses in which Allah, may He be \n\texalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And even if We opened to \n\tthem a gate from the heaven and they were to continue ascending thereto, \n\tthey would surely say: ‘Our eyes have been (as if) dazzled. Nay, we are a \n\tpeople bewitched’” [al-Hijr 15:14] and “(Iblees (Satan)) said: ‘By \n\tYour Might, then I will surely mislead them all, except Your chosen slaves \n\tamongst them (faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism)” [Saad \n\t38:82], because the structure of the wording in both cases indicates \n\tthat the second verse in each case is strongly connected to the preceding \n\tverse. End quote. \n\n\tHowever what is more likely to be correct is that one should \n\tpause at the ends of verses in all cases, even if it is strongly connected \n\tto what follows it, because of the apparent meaning of the Sunnah. \n\n\tShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid:\n\n\tFor the reader to pause at the ends of verses is Sunnah, even \n\tif the following verse is strongly connected to the preceding verse. End \n\tquote. \n\n\tAl-Fataawa al-Kubra \n\t(5/334) \n\n\tHowever it is disallowed to stop reciting altogether at a \n\tparticular point if that will change the meaning, such as one who recites \n\tthe words “So \n\twoe unto those performers of Salat (prayers)” \n\t[al-Maa‘oon 107:4], and \n\tstops there without reciting the following verse. \n\n\tFourthly: \n\n\tOther books that discuss this topic – other than those \n\treferred to above – include the following: \n\n\t·Al-Jaami‘ li Ahkaam \n\tal-Qur’an (20/201) by \n\tal-Qurtubi\n\n\t·At-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer \n\t(1/76) by Ibn ‘Ashoor\n\n\t·Al-Muktafa fi’l-Waqf \n\twa’l-Ibtida by Abu ‘Amr \n\tad-Daani (p. 244)\n\n\t·Jamaal al-Qurra’ wa \n\tKamaal al-Iqra’ (p. 673) \n\tby ‘Alam ad-Deen as-Sakhkhaawi\n\n\t·Al-Burhaan fi ‘Uloom \n\tal-Qur’an (1/350) by \n\tBadr ad-Deen az-Zarkashi\n\n\t·Al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom \n\tal-Qur’an (1/299) by \n\tJalaal ad-Deen as-Suyooti \n\n\tFor more information, please see the answer to question no.\n\t13340\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The practice of pausing at the ends of verses in the recitation of the Quran is indeed an established Sunnah (tradition) in Islam. While the verses may sometimes be connected in meaning, this practice reflects a deep respect for the significance of each verse and an appreciation for the clarity with which the message is conveyed.\n\n### Significance of Pausing at the Ends of Verses\n\n1. **Respecting the Divine Message**: Each verse (ayah) in the Quran is a unit of meaning and significance. Pausing allows the reciter and listener to reflect on the contents of each verse. This practice is emphasized in the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who encouraged such reverence for the Quran.\n\n2. **Clarity of Meaning**: Stopping at the end of a verse helps to clarify the meanings and avoid confusion that could arise from continuous recitation without breaks. This is especially important in situations where the meaning could change if verses are recited together without pause.\n\n3. **Emphasizing Reflection**: The Quran encourages reflection on its verses. For example:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:185)** — \"Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance, and criterion (of falsehood and truth).\" This verse invites believers to consider the purpose of the Quran during the month of Ramadan.\n   - **Surah Al-Inshiqaq (84:14-18)** — \"Never thinking he will return. Why not? His Lord was always watching him.\" These verses highlight the awareness of God's omnipresence, encouraging the reader to pause and think about their actions.\n\n### Relevant Verses Supporting the Practice of Pausing\nWhile the verses you have provided do not explicitly mention pausing while reciting, it is understood through the rules of Tajweed (the art of Quranic recitation) and through the Sunnah of the Prophet.\n\n1. **Surah Al-An-Nisa (4:101)** states, “When you travel in the land, there is no sin if you curtail your service of prayer...” This verse discusses the allowances given during travel, indicating the importance of considering each context individually.\n   \n2. **Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:16-20)** emphasizes the importance of not hastening the revelations and understanding them fully. It indicates that there is a responsibility in how the scripture is received and recited.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:45-49)** discusses the natural laws set by God, highlighting how one should observe and reflect on the signs around them. This reinforces the value of thoughtful consideration while reciting the Quran.\n\n4. **Surah An-Nur (24:56-60)** reflects on the importance of clarity and understanding in social interactions, which can symbolize the clarity needed in reciting and understanding the Quran as well.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Sunnah of pausing at the ends of verses during Quran recitation is a practice rooted in respect for the divine text and in the pursuit of comprehension. The articulation of the meaning through proper recitation ensures that both the reciter and the listener can appreciate and reflect on the profound messages contained within each verse. Therefore, while the Quran does not directly state this practice, it is deeply embedded in the tradition and etiquette of recitation, as guided by both the Prophet Muhammad and the interpretative principles of Islamic scholars."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation \n\tof the meaning): “And \n\tAllah has created you and then He will cause you to die, and of you there \n\tare some who are sent back to senility, so that they know nothing after \n\thaving known (much)” [an-Nahl \n\t16:70].\n\n\tAnd He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n\tmeaning): “And \n\tamong you there is he who dies (young), and among you there is he who is \n\tsent back to senility, so that he knows nothing after having known” \n\t[al-Hajj 22:5]. \n\n\tAt-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tAllah, may He be exalted, is saying: Allah created you, O \n\tpeople, and brought you into being, when you had been nothing, and it was \n\tnot the gods whom you worship besides Him (who created you). Therefore \n\tworship the One Who created you, and no other, then He will take your souls \n\tin death. \n\n\tAnd some of you will grow old, and end up reaching a stage of \n\tsenility, which is the worst \n\tof stages. We only bring him back to senility so that he will once again \n\tbecome ignorant, as he was in infancy and childhood, so that he will not \n\tknow anything after the knowledge that he had when he was young. All of that \n\twill be lost when he grows old, and will be forgotten, and he will not know \n\tanything of it, for it will escape his mind. So after having possessed the \n\tpower of rational thinking, he will not understand anything. \n\n\tAs-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\t\n\n\tHere Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that it is He Who \n\tcreates people and causes them to move through the stages of creation, one \n\tafter another. Then after their lifespan has ended, He causes them to die, \n\tbut He causes some to live until they are \n\tsent back to senility, \n\ti.e., the worst age, in which a person loses his outward and inward \n\tstrength, even his power of reasoning, which is the essence of man. It grows \n\tweaker and weaker, until he forgets what he used to know, and his mind \n\tbecomes like the mind of an infant. End quote. \n\n\tTafseer as-Sa‘di \n\t(p. 444) \n\n\tAz-Zajjaaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tWhat is meant is that among you are some who grow very old, \n\tuntil they lose their power of reasoning, and after having known things they \n\tbecome ignorant. Allah does that in order to show you His might and power; \n\tjust as He is able to cause a person to die or give him life, He is also \n\table to cause him to move from knowledge to ignorance. End quote. \n\n\tZaad al-Maseer \n\t(2/571) \n\n\tWhat is meant is that Allah, may He be exalted, causes people \n\tto move from ignorance to knowledge, then from knowledge to ignorance, and \n\tfrom weakness to strength, then from strength to weakness. \n\n\tPeople vary in the extent of this ignorance to which they \n\tmove. Some of them will become completely senile, so that they do not know \n\tanything at all; some of them will hardly know anything; and some of them \n\twill know a few things but ignorance and lack of knowledge is mostly the \n\tcase for them. \n\n\tWhat is meant by the words of Allah, may He be exalted, “so \n\tthat he knows nothing after having known” \n\tis to highlight the fact that ignorance will prevail after he had knowledge, \n\tnot to rule out knowledge altogether for everyone who reaches this stage, \n\tbecause saying that he will know nothing is not to be taken literally; \n\trather it is by way of emphasis.   \n\n\tHence Allah says, “and \n\tamong you”, so as to \n\tindicate that not everyone who grows old and reaches old age will be \n\tsent back to senility; \n\trather some of them will be \n\tsent back to senility so \n\tthat they do not know anything after having known something, and some of \n\tthem will grow old but Allah will protect their reasoning, hearing and \n\tsight. \n\n\tIbn Jaziyy (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tIt does not mean that knowledge is ruled out altogether; \n\trather it is a reference to having little knowledge and to forgetting a \n\tgreat deal. End quote \n\n\tTafseer Ibn Jaziyy \n\t(1/431) \n\n\tAz-Raazi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tIf it is asked: How come Allah says: “so \n\tthat he knows nothing after having known” \n\t[al-Hajj 22:5], when he may well know some things, like a child? Our \n\tresponse is: What is meant is that his power of reasoning will be taken \n\taway, so he will become as if he does not know anything, because such a \n\tthing may be described in the negative for the sake of emphasis. End quote. \n\n\tTafseer ar-Raazi \n\t(23/205) \n\n\tIbn ‘Ashoor (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tHence there are levels of weakness of reason, depending on \n\tthe degree of senility. It may go so far as being unable to learn anything \n\tnew, but before that there are different levels of weakness of reason, such \n\tas forgetting things, mixing up information, and so on. End quote. \n\n\tAt-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer \n\t(17/202) \n\n\tConclusion: \n\n\tThese two verses do not mean that everyone who grows old will \n\tbe in this state of “senility”; \n\trather among those who grow old there will be some who are \n\tsent back to senility \n\tand will be in that state where they forget everything that they knew \n\tbefore. \n\n\tMoreover, this forgetfulness and being \n\tsent back to senility are of varying \n\tdegrees, and people vary in \n\tthat regard.

        "predicted_answer": "The verse you referenced discusses the fundamental aspects of human existence, particularly focusing on the cycle of life and death. It highlights the transient nature of human life, the inevitability of death, and the eventual return to Allah. This understanding informs a central tenet of Islamic belief concerning the realities of life and the hereafter.\n\n### Commentary on the Verse\n\nThe verse—in which Allah mentions that He creates life, causes death, and sends some back to senility—touches upon profound truths concerning human existence:\n\n1. **Creation and Death**: The verse emphasizes that Allah is the Creator, who initiates life and also decrees its end. This theme is echoed in multiple verses across the Quran. For instance, Surah Al-Nahl (16:70) states: \n   > \"It is God who creates you, then makes you die; and some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they had known before. God is indeed all-knowing and all-powerful.\" \n   This illustrates the divine control over the life and death of every individual, reinforcing the belief that life is temporary and ultimately under divine authority.\n\n2. **The Cycle of Aging**: The mention of some being returned to senility refers to the natural process of aging, where individuals may lose their faculties and memories. Surah Al-Hajj (22:5) echoes this:\n   > \"Some of you die, some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they knew, having known it once.\"\n   This point serves as a humble reminder of human vulnerability and the wisdom in acknowledging our limitations.\n\n3. **Divine Knowledge and Power**: Each mortal's life, death, and even the process of return to a state of forgetfulness are part of Allah's encompassing knowledge and power. As stated in Surah Al-Anbiya (21:35):\n   > \"Every soul will know the taste of death.\"\n   This verse reminds believers that death is an absolute and inescapable reality, and it invites contemplation on the purpose of life.\n\n4. **Reflection and Accountability**: The call to reflection is an essential element of this discourse, encouraging believers to ponder the realities of their existence and their ultimate return to Allah. Surah Al-Mulk (67:2) states: \n   > \"He who created death and life to test you as to which of you is best in deed...\"\n   This verse signifies that life, along with its struggles and senility, is a test for humanity, leading to the bigger picture of accountability in the hereafter.\n\n5. **Purpose of Existence**: By recognizing that life is created and finite, Muslims are prompted to live purposefully and reflect on their actions. In Surah Al-Tahreem (66:8), believers are encouraged to repent and seek Allah's mercy, understanding the stakes of the final return:\n   > \"O you who have believed, repent to Allah with sincere repentance…\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe discussion on the nature of creation, the experience of aging through senility, and the cycle of life and death aligns with a broader understanding of Islamic teachings regarding human existence. It invites believers to recognize the temporary nature of this life and to prepare for what lies beyond. The focus on divine power and knowledge is central to fostering a sense of humility and gratitude for life, encouraging continuous reflection and commitment to righteous deeds.\n\n### Supporting Verses\n- Surah Al-Nahl (16:70) - Highlights God's role in giving life and causing death.\n- Surah Al-Hajj (22:5) - Discusses the aging process and the knowledge of God.\n- Surah Al-Anbiya (21:35) - Emphasizes the inevitability of death.\n- Surah Al-Mulk (67:2) - Connects life and death to divine testing.\n- Surah Al-Tahreem (66:8) - Encourages sincere repentance and reflection."

        "question": "Does a reprehensible pause [when reading Qur’an] lead to kufr?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.These words, in the general terms mentioned in the question, are clearly incorrect and are definitely contrary to the practice of the Muslims and all the imams or leading scholars, which is to quote part of a verse in their writings, lessons or khutbahs, without necessarily having to quote or write the entire verse as it appears in the Mus-haf. Rather they limit it to quoting of the verse only the part that is relevant to the context and relevant to the meaning they are trying to establish, so long as what is quoted of the verse is clear and readily understood.\nIf what you say is something that was said by one of the religious scholars, then he could not have meant it in general terms referring to all kinds of pause, as the questioner understood it. The only way we think he could have meant it is that what he was referring to was a type of pause that is reprehensible, as in the case  of a reciter who comes to a verse such as that in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “So know (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) that La ilaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah), and ask forgiveness for your sin, and also for (the sin of) believing men and believing women. And Allah knows well your moving about, and your place of rest (in your homes)” [Muhammad 47:19], and he recites “there is no god” then pauses there, without any good reason that would compel him to pause there, and without resuming the recitation by repeating some of the words in such a way as to make the meaning clear and make the context of the words understandable. \nPausing in such a manner is blameworthy and extremely reprehensible, as is quite obvious. Whoever does that deliberately, intending to convey that distorted meaning, is undoubtedly a disbeliever. \nThere are also other kinds of blameworthy pauses that corrupt the meanings of the words or give the impression of a meaning that is not intended by the text. \nAz-Zarkashi said in al-Burhaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (1/352-353): What is reprehensible is that which leads to the meaning not being understood, such as saying “al-hamd” [on its own]; there should be no pause on this word, or on any word without its adjective or predicate.\nEven worse than that is pausing on phrases such as “Surely, they have disbelieved who say” [al-Maa’idah 5:72] (because the following phrase is “ ‘Allah is the Messiah (‘Eeesa (Jesus)), son of Maryam (Mary)’”) and “And if any of them should say” [al-Anbiya’ 21:29] (because the following phrase is “ ‘Verily, I am an ilah (a god) besides Him (Allah)’”); or starting from phrases such as “Allah is the Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary)” [al-Maa’idah 5:17], “Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)” [al-Maa’idah 5:73] and “Verily, I am an ilah (a god)” [al-Anbiya’ 21:29], because it is impossible for the meaning to be correct if you begin in this manner. Whoever does that deliberately, intending that (distorted) meaning, is a disbeliever. \nSimilarly reprehensible is stopping at the following phrases: “So the disbeliever was utterly defeated and Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:258], “For those who believe not in the Hereafter is an evil description and for Allah” [an-Nahl 16:60] and the like, or “and if there be only one, for her is the half and for his parents” [an-Nisa’ 4:11] and “Only those will respond, who listen and the dead” [al-An‘aam 6:36]. \nEven worse and more reprehensible than that is stopping on a negation without completing the idea, as in the following examples:\n“There is no god but Allah”\n(pausing after the phrase “there is no god”, without completing the sentence, is wrong)\n“And We have sent you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) not but as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner”\n[al-Isra’ 17:105]\n(pausing after the phrase “we have sent you not” is wrong). \nAlso, pausing at the end of the following quotations is wrong:\n“Allah has promised those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) and do deeds of righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise) and those who disbelieve…”\n[al-Maa’idah 5:9-10]]\n“Those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah, and in the Message of Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah (Islamic Monotheism), He will render their deeds vain, and those who believe…”\n[Muhammad 47:1-2].\nIf the reader has no choice but to stop in order to take a breath, that is permissible, but then (when he resumes reading) he should go back to the phrase that came before it and connect it to what comes after it, and there is nothing wrong with doing so. End.\nSee also the answer to question no. 206946",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether a reprehensible pause or hesitation while reciting the Qur'an leads to kufr (disbelief) is complex and often dependent on the context and the intention of the reader. In general, taking pauses in recitation—especially if done to properly reflect on the meanings—should not be seen as kufr. However, the attitude and belief concerning the Qur'an is critical in determining one's faith.\n\n### Contextual Understanding\n\n1. **Intention and Understanding**: It’s essential to understand that pausing out of contemplation or difficulty in reading does not inherently imply a lapse in faith. Allah recognizes the intentions of individuals. As expressed in Surah Al-Kahf (18:57):\n   > \"Who is more unjust than he who, on being reminded of his Lord's revelations, turns away from them, and forgets the evil deeds he had committed in the past? Verily We have placed a covering on their hearts so that they do not understand, and a deafness in their ears so that however you may call them to guidance they will never be guided aright.\" \n   (Surah Al-Kahf, 18:57-58)\n\n   This verse indicates that turning away from the message of the Qur'an intentionally while being aware of its impact can lead to serious spiritual consequences, but it does not directly address mere hesitations.\n\n2. **Impact of Hypocrisy**: Surah Al-Munafiqun provides insight into the behaviors of hypocrites, particularly those who appear to believe yet reject the faith fully:\n   > \"That is because they came to believe, and then renounced (their faith). So their hearts were sealed; and now they do not understand.\" \n   (Surah Al-Munafiqun, 63:3)\n\n   This form of hypocritical behavior, where individuals may feign connection but internally reject the truths, is far different from someone who is honestly trying to comprehend or recite the Qur'an, even if they pause.\n\n3. **Forgiveness and Compassion**: Allah assures forgiveness for those who show sincerity:\n   > \"But your Lord is forgiving, full of benevolence. If He had pleased to punish them for their doings He would have punished them immediately.\" \n   (Surah Al-Kahf, 18:58)\n\n   The verses remind believers of the importance of turning back to Allah in sincerity and understanding that His mercy is vast.\n\n4. **Sign of Hypocrisy**: In Surah At-Tawbah, Allah warns that those who previously had faith but then showed blatant rejection after having known the truth are in a perilous position:\n   > \"Do not make excuses: You turned unbelievers after having come to faith.\" \n   (Surah At-Tawbah, 9:66)\n\n   This indicates a conscious choice to reject faith rather than a mere lapse during recitation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn essence, the matter of pausing while reciting the Qur'an does not directly lead to kufr unless it is a reflection of an individual's overall disobedience or rejection of faith. The critical aspect is the individual's intention and their relationship with the verses read. Hesitation or pauses may be a natural part of recitation, especially when reflecting on the meaning of the verses. The key is to approach the Qur'an with sincerity and a desire for understanding, which aligns with the broader teachings of forgiveness and mercy in Islam."

        "question": "What should a person do if he memorised some of the Qur’an then forgot it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nUndoubtedly studying the Quran, reciting it and memorising it are among the best of righteous deeds. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to read Quran regularly lest we forget it, which means constantly reviewing what one has memorised and repeatedly reciting it. \nSimilarly, forgetting Quran is a blameworthy action, because it involves falling short, turning away from the Book of Allah and abandoning it. \nSee the answer to question no. 3704. \nSecondly: \nThe scholars differed concerning the ruling on forgetting Quran: \nIt was said that forgetting Quran is a major sin. \nIt was said that it is an act of disobedience and sin, but it does not reach the level of major sins. \nIt was said that it is a calamity that befalls a person and affects his religious commitment, or it may be a punishment from Allah for some of his deeds, even if it is not in and of itself a major sin or minor sin. This is the view that is most likely to be correct concerning this issue.\nHowever it is not appropriate for the one who has memorised it to neglect his recitation or to be careless about reviewing it. Rather he should adopt the practice of reciting a daily portion in order to help him to remember it and prevent himself from forgetting it, in the hope of reward and of benefitting from its rulings. \nThirdly: \nForgetting some of the Quran is a result of neglecting it, and some kinds of neglect are less serious than others, as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Fawaa’id (p. 82). But forgetting it because of turning away from it and being distracted by other things is undoubtedly a calamity that may lead to further calamities, in addition to the loss of reward. \nWhat is advised for one who memorised some of the Quran then forgot it is the following: \n·He should revise the soorahs that he had memorised until he has memorised them properly once again.\n·He should keep up with review in a regular fashion, so that he will not forget it again.\n·He should carry on memorising and reviewing under a well-versed shaykh.\n·He should review what he had memorised of large portions such as a juz’ or a hizb and the like, and strive hard to memorise an entire soorah, so that reviewing what he had previously memorised and has memorised again will help him to complete memorisation of the soorah.\n·As for reviewing small portions that he had memorised then forgotten, such as two or three verses and the like, he should not focus on that and should not go to the trouble of remembering what he had forgotten of them. \nHe should focus on re-memorising what he had forgotten of soorahs and large portions, as mentioned above, and there is no sin on him for not re-memorising those small portions, some of which he may have forgotten. He should examine his own situation, and whatever is a sin he should ask Allah to forgive him and repent from it; whatever is a shortcoming, he should amend it; and whatever was a case of turning away from matters of the hereafter and focusing on worldly matters, then he should refocus on the hereafter, for it is better and longer lasting. \nMoreover, it is better to put his efforts into reviewing what he has memorised of the Quran immediately, when he is still motivated and before he loses motivation and starts to procrastinate. Ibn al-Mubaarak narrated in az-Zuhd (1/469) that Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: These hearts sometimes have drive and focus and sometimes they slow down and become distracted, so make the most of the times when they have drive and focus, and let them be when they slow down and are distracted. \nUndoubtedly the fact that one who has forgotten Quran feels that he has fallen short and is asking how to restore it comes under the heading of having drive and focus after having slowed down and been distracted. One who is in this situation should start re-memorizing it immediately, and should not delay doing so. \nIf he is not able to revise it except during his free time, because he is very busy, has a lot of work and is striving to earn a living for his dependents, and the like, then there is no blame on him. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "When a person memorizes a portion of the Qur'an and subsequently forgets it, Islamic teachings provide guidance on how to address this situation. Several verses from the Qur'an suggest that forgetting does not negate the effort put forth in memorization, and there are ways to approach this matter spiritually and practically.\n\n### 1. **God’s Assurance Regarding Forgetfulness**\nOne meaningful verse regarding this situation is found in Surah Al-A'la (The Most High):\n> \"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, unless God may please. He knows the visible and knows what is hidden.\" \n> \n> (Surah Al-A'la, 87:6-7)\n\nThis verse indicates that memorization is facilitated by God, and forgetfulness is within His knowledge and wisdom. Believers are reminded that the process of learning and reciting is guided by God, and this reinforces the notion that forgetting is a part of human experience.\n\n### 2. **The Importance of Remembrance and Recitation**\nSurah Al-Muzzammil (The Enshrouded One) offers guidance on how one should behave in this context:\n> \"So, recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily. He knows some among you will be sick, and some will be traveling over the earth in search of the bounty of God...\" \n> \n> (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20)\n\nThis passage suggests that individuals should continue to recite and engage with the Qur'an to the best of their ability. If someone forgets what they have memorized, they should focus on recitation and practice, which helps reinforce memory.\n\n### 3. **Encouragement to Continue Efforts**\nSurah Al-Qiyamah (The Resurrection) also emphasizes that it is up to God to ensure the preservation and recitation of the Qur'an:\n> \"Whatever the excuses he may offer. Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste. Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility.\" \n> \n> (Surah Al-Qiyamah, 75:15-16)\n\nThis verse reassures that the responsibility for memorization and recitation lies with God. Individuals should persist in their efforts, as God supports their endeavors.\n\n### 4. **Seeking Forgiveness and Renewing Intentions**\nReturning to God and seeking His forgiveness is vital in moments of forgetfulness. Surah Al-Muddaththir (The Cloaked One) emphasizes that:\n> \"But they will not remember except as God wills: He is worthy to be feared, and He is worthy of forgiving.\" \n> \n> (Surah Al-Muddaththir, 74:56)\n\nThis verse highlights that God’s will dictates remembrance, and seeking forgiveness can help restore one's connection to the memorized text.\n\n### 5. **Practical Steps After Forgetting**\nIn addition to spiritual encouragement, the following practical steps can be taken when one forgets portions of the Qur'an:\n- **Regular Recitation:** Repeated collaboration with the text through regular recitation can help regain what was forgotten.\n- **Join Qur'an Memorization Groups:** Engaging with others who are memorizing can provide motivation, accountability, and support.\n- **Utilize Audio Resources:** Listening to recitations by skilled reciters can aid in retaining and refreshing memory.\n\nIn conclusion, forgetting parts of the Qur'an is acknowledged as a part of human imperfection. Muslims are encouraged to remain steadfast in their efforts to recite, seek God’s guidance, and utilize practical strategies for memorization. The verses above provide spiritual resources to foster resilience and motivation in this journey."

        "question": "The seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir and it is not permissible to cast aspersions on them",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe majority of scholars of recitation and usool are of the view that the seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir going back to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Some of them differed concerning that, such as Abu Shaamah – according to one of his views – and at-Tawfi and ash-Shawkaani. However the correct view concerning that is the view of the majority; that is the right view which must be adopted.\nShihaab ad-Deen ad-Dimyaati (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nTaaj al-A’immah as-Subki – who is Taaj ad-Deen ‘Abd al-Wahhaab as-Subki – said in his fatwas:\nThe seven modes of recitation to which ash-Shaatibi referred, to the exclusion of others, and the three others – namely the recitation of Abu Ja‘far, the recitation of Ya‘qoob and the recitation of Khalaf – are mutawaatir and well-known, and it is an established fact in the religion that they were revealed to the Messenger of Allah. No one would stubbornly disagree with that except one who is ignorant. They are not only regarded as mutawaatir by those who know these ten modes of recitation; rather they are regarded as mutawaatir by every Muslim who says “I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah,” even if he is rough and uneducated and has not memorised even one letter of the Qur’an.\nHe said: We could elaborate on the proof and evidence, but we do not have room to discuss this matter at length here. However, what is expected of every Muslim, and what he should do is to accept before Allah, may He be exalted, and be certain that what we have mentioned is mutawaatir and is known for certain, and there is no room for doubt or uncertainty about it.\nConclusion:\nThe seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir according to consensus, as are the three others: the recitations of Abu Ja‘far, Ya‘qoob and Khalaf, according to the more correct view. In fact the correct, favoured view, which is what we learned from most of our shaykhs, is that the recitations of the other four – Ibn Muhaysin, al-Yazeedi, al-Hasan and al-A‘mash, are odd (shaadhdh), according to scholarly consensus.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOur companions and others said:\nIt is permissible to recite, in prayer and otherwise, according to any of the seven modes of recitation, but it is not permissible to recite, in prayer or otherwise, according to an odd mode of recitation, because that is not Qur’an. Qur’an can only be proven by means of mutawaatir reports, and each of the seven modes of recitation is mutawaatir. This is the correct view which one must accept, and whoever says otherwise is wrong or ignorant.\nEnd quote from al-Majmoo‘ (3/392)\nIbn an-Najjaar al-Fatoohi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir according to the four imams and other leading Sunni scholars. This was narrated by as-Sarakhsi, who was one of the companions of ash-Shaafa‘i, in Kitaab as-Sawm in al-Ghaayah. He said: The Mu‘tazilah said: (The modes of recitation are transmitted via) aahaad reports.\n[An aahaad hadith is one of which the narrators at each stage of the isnaad are too few for it to be regarded as mutawaatir.]\nEnd quote from Sharh al-Kawkab al-Muneer (2/127)\nAz-Zarqaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that is supported by evidence is that the ten modes of recitation are all mutawaatir. This is the view of the scholars of usool and of recitation, such as Ibn as-Subki, Ibn al-Jazari and an-Nuwayri.\nEnd quote from Manaahil al-‘Irfaan (1/441)\nSecondly:\nThere is a specious argument that may enter some people’s minds, which says that the isnaads of the recitations mentioned by the imams in their books are well known and limited, but they are ahaad isnaads, so how can it be said that their recitations are mutawaatir?\nThe response to that is: this is an old specious argument, which was answered by more than one of the scholars of recitation and usool. The leading scholars who specialised in this field, on whose teachings these modes of recitation are based, and to whom the isnaads go back, are not the only ones who were proficient in these modes of recitation or the only ones who specialised in them. Rather these modes of recitation were mutawaatir during their time, and remained so after their time, as there were other scholars like them who also specialised in that field and had other students who learned from them this branch of knowledge, which has to do with the modes of recitation and the rules and regulations governing them.\nImam Sharaf ad-Deen ad-Dimyaati (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that the isnaads that have to do with the modes of recitation are limited to one group does not mean that the modes of recitation did not have other isnaads. Rather the reports that have to do with the modes of recitation are attributed to them because they are the ones who became specialised in that matter and recorded the names of their shaykhs from whom they learned it, and each of them [the narrators in the isnaads] in his generation had many others who specialised in that field, which would raise the reports to the level of being mutawaatir.\nThis is the view of the scholars, and the dissenting view of Ibn al-Haajib, who differed with regard to some of what we have mentioned, was refuted by one who was very well versed in this field, namely Ibn al-Jazari, who refuted it at length in his book al-Munjid, which is worth reading.\nEnd quote from Ithaaf Fudala’ al-Bashar fi’l-Qiraa’aat al-Arba‘at ‘Ashar (p. 9)\nIbn an-Najjaar al-Fatoohi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSome said that the reports concerning the modes of recitation were aahaad reports, such as at-Tawfi in his Sharh. He said: The fact is that they (the modes of recitation) are widely known as being attributed to them, but they were not widely narrated from them, because the isnaads of the seven imams of recitation for the seven modes of recitation going back to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are to be found in the books of recitation, which were transmitted from one scholar to another at a time, so they do not fulfil the conditions of being mutawaatir.\nThe response to that is as follows: the fact that the isnaads are limited to a particular group does not mean that the modes of recitation were not transmitted via other narrators. The inhabitants of every city used to learn recitation according to the recitation of their Imam, who was one of the Sahaabah or otherwise, so a large number of people would learn from another large number like them, and so on. Therefore the transmission of the recitations was mutawaatir, but the imams who became specialised in the modes of recitation recorded the names of their shaykhs from whom they learned their mode of recitation, and that is why they made their isnaads available (whilst others did not). This is like the reports about the Farewell Pilgrimage which are known to be aahaad, but the reports of the Farewell Pilgrimage continued to be transmitted in the manner of mutawaatir reports, from one large number of people to another, throughout the ages. So one should pay attention to that, and not be deceived by the arguments of those who say that the isnaads of the scholars of recitation are aahaad.\nEnd quote from Sharh al-Kawkab al-Muneer (2/127-128)\nThirdly:\nWith regard to the questioner’s asking: how can we say that (the modes of recitation) are mutawaatir when the term mutawaatir did not appear before Ibn Mujaahid who was the seventh of seven?\nThe response to that is as follows:\nWhat is meant by something being mutawaatir is learning something on the basis of certainty when there is no doubt at all, as opposed to learning something on the basis of probability. The level of certainty concerning the soundness of the seven modes of recitation is established, and it was transmitted by way of mutawaatir reports, which effectively gives certainty. And that is the point, regardless of whether this terminology was known at that time or not. This is simply the matter of terminology that has to do with setting out guidelines in various fields of knowledge and developing them. The Arabs (before Islam) used to observe the rules of grammar in their language, giving words case endings according to whether words were nominative, accusative or genitive, and so on, but if the people of the Jaahiliyyah were to come back to life now, none of them would know the terminology of Arabic grammar; in fact none of them knew anything about grammar as people speak of it now.\nSimilarly, with regard to knowledge of hadith, usool al-fiqh and other branches of Islamic knowledge, the fact that the specific terminology of any particular field appeared later on does not mean that the ideas and concepts that the terminology refers to were not known previously to specialists in that field.\nAs for the notion that the concept was unknown among people who were not specialists, or that it was not widely used by others in general, that does not undermine the fact that the concept was there, and it does not undermine the soundness of a particular academic issue.\nImam Shams ad-Deen adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that something is mutawaatir does not necessarily mean that the entire ummah is aware of it. For the scholars of recitation, there are matters that are mutawaatir among them, but not among others. For the fuqaha’ there are issues that are mutawaatir among them and narrated from their imams via mutawaatir reports, of which the scholars of recitation are unaware. Among the hadith scholars, there are mutawaatir hadiths that the fuqaha’ have never heard, or at least for the fuqaha’ they were not mutawaatir; rather they were at the level of probability only. For the grammarians there are definitive issues, and the same is true of the linguists. End quote.\nSiyar A‘laam an-Nubala’ (10/171)\nSee also the answer to question no. 5142\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The assertion regarding the seven modes of recitation (Qira'at) being mutawatir (transmitted by multiple sources) and the impermissibility of casting aspersions on them is deeply rooted in Islamic tradition and theology. The concept of Qira'at refers to the various methods of reciting the Quran, which have been transmitted through authentic channels and serve as the basis for how the text is understood and performed. Below, I provide a thorough answer supported by relevant verses from the Quran.\n\n### Importance of Recitation in Islam\nIslam emphasizes the significance of the Quranic recitation and requires sincerity and humility when approaching it. This is highlighted in Surah Al-A'raf:\n\n**Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206)**:\n> \"And when the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed. Meditate on your Lord inwardly with humility and trepidation, reciting His Book softly, morning and evening, and be not negligent. Verily those who are in the presence of your Lord are never too proud to worship and celebrate His praises, and bow in homage to Him.\" (7:204-206)\n\nThis verse illustrates that recitation should be approached with respect and contemplation, indicating the gravity of the act itself.\n\n### Qira'at as a Mutawatir Tradition\nThe modes of Qira'at are considered mutawatir, meaning there is a high level of certainty about their authenticity due to their traceable chain of narrators. This is fundamental in Islam, where the integrity of the Quran is paramount. The transmission of these modes has historical precedence:\n\n**Surah Al-Munafiqun (63:2-6)**:\n> \"They have made their oaths a shield in order to obstruct others from the way of God. It is certainly evil what they do. That is because they came to believe, and then renounced (their faith). So their hearts were sealed; and now they do not understand.\" (63:2-4)\n\nAlthough these verses do not directly discuss Qira'at, they articulate the seriousness of belief and the associated actions. Rejecting any part of what has been authentically transmitted, including modes of recitation, is akin to a more considerable transgression of faith. \n\n### Treating Qira'at with Respect\nIt is explicitly forbidden in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) to speak ill of the Quran or anyone who recites it properly. The Quran preserves its sanctity and authority, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of these recitations.\n\n**Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:211-215)**:\n> \"So call on no other god but God, lest you are condemned to torment; And warn your near relations, And take those believers under your wing who follow you.\" (26:213-215)\n\nThis passage reminds believers not to deviate from worshipping only God and respecting His revelations, which can extend to how they treat the recitations of His words.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the seven modes of recitation of the Quran hold a significant place within Islamic tradition and are transmitted in a manner that ensures their authenticity. It is imperative for believers to approach these recitations with reverence and to refrain from casting any aspersions on them. The Quran itself emphasizes respect in recitation and contemplation, serving as a guiding principle for Muslim scholarship and worship. The verses from Surah Al-A'raf and the implications found in Surah Al-Munafiqun underline the gravity of this obligation."

        "question": "Tafseer on the basis of narrated texts and tafseer on the basis of individual understanding",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      \n      When explaining the meanings of a verse of the Qur’an, the mufassir \n      (scholarly commentator on the meanings) follows one of two methods:\n\n    The \n    first method \n    is to see whether there is anything in the texts of the Qur’an or the \n    Prophet’s Sunnah, or in texts narrated from the righteous early generations, \n    that explains this verse. If there is an explanation of it in these sources, \n    he follows it and is content with it. This is what is called “tafseer on the \n    basis of narrated texts”; it is of several types: \n\n    1.\n    \n    Tafseer of the Qur’an by the Qur’an: as some parts of the \n    Qur’an explain other parts.\n\n    \n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in \n    Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer (p. 93): \n\n    If \n    someone were to ask: what are the soundest ways of interpreting the meanings \n    of the Qur’an? The answer is that the soundest way of doing that is to \n    interpret the Qur’an by the Qur’an, because sometimes it may refer to a \n    matter in brief, then explain it in more detail elsewhere, or it may state \n    something in a few words in one place, then expand upon it elsewhere. End \n    quote. \n\n    Some \n    examples of that: \n\n    Al-Bukhaari \n    (4236) narrated from ‘Alqamah (may Allah have mercy on him) that ‘Abdullah \n    ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the verse “…and \n    confuse not their belief with Zulm (wrong)…” [al-An‘aam 6:82] was \n    revealed, his companions (i.e., the companions of the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: Which of us has not done wrong? Then the \n    verse “Verily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm \n    (wrong) indeed” [Luqmaan 31:13] was revealed. [From the latter verse it \n    is understood that the zulm referred to in the first verse is the zulm of \n    shirk (joining others in worship with Allah), and not any lesser \n    wrongdoing.] \n\n    But \n    although interpreting the Qur’an by the Qur’an may sometimes be unambiguous \n    and clear, as in the example mentioned above, in which case it is binding \n    proof that must be followed and not opposed, sometimes it is based on the \n    mufassir’s own ijtihaad and understanding, when he is trying to put together \n    similar verses. Undoubtedly this is of a lesser status than the above, \n    because the one who engages in ijithaad may be wrong or right. \n\n    2.\n    \n    The tafseer of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him), explaining the meanings of the Qur’an, because he (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) came to both convey and explain to us what is \n    said in the holy Qur’an. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): “With clear signs and Books (We sent \n    the Messengers). And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him) the reminder and the advice (the Quran), \n    that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they \n    may give thought” [an-Nahl \n    \n    16:44]. \n\n    An \n    example of that: \n\n    Al-Bukhaari \n    (4510) narrated concerning the interpretation of the verse in which Allah, \n    may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “and eat and \n    drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from \n    the black thread (darkness of night)” [al-Baqarah 2:187]. \n\n    It \n    was narrated that ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I \n    said: O Messenger of Allah, what is the meaning of the white thread being \n    distinct from the black thread? Are they two threads? He said: “The back of \n    your heard must be very broad if you want to watch the two threads.” [‘Adiyy \n    was thinking in terms of threads in a literal sense, which he wanted to put \n    under his pillow and examine to see when they became distinct from one \n    another with the approach of dawn, but the Prophet (blessings and peace of \n    Allah be upon him) pointed out that if he wanted to put the two threads – \n    which in fact refers to the light of dawn being distinct from the darkness \n    of night – under his pillow, then his pillow must be very big indeed, in \n    which case he must have a very large head! – Translator’s note]. Then he \n    said: “No; rather it is the darkness of the night and the light of the \n    day.” \n\n    If an \n    explanation of a verse or a word in the Qur’an has reached us from the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), it is obligatory for us \n    to adhere to it and be content with it. \n\n    The \n    interpretation of a verse may be understood from the Sunnah of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), from his actions and words, and \n    from the things that he approved of. \n\n    The \n    Sunnah came to explain the Qur’an. Allah, may He be exalted, has instructed \n    us to pray, give zakaah, perform Hajj, carry out the hadd punishments and so \n    on, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), through his \n    Sunnah – his actions and words – has explained to us in detail what is meant \n    by these words. But if the mufassir cannot find any explanation for a verse \n    in the Sunnah, he should look at the sayings of the Sahaabah. \n\n    3.\n    \n    Tafseer based on reports from the Sahaabah (may Allah be \n    pleased with them):\n\n    Their \n    tafseer takes precedence over that of anyone else, because their tafseer is \n    likely to be based on what they learned from the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him), as Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) \n    said: One of us would learn ten verses then he would not move on (and learn \n    more) until he understood their meaning and put them into practice. Narrated \n    by at-Tabari in his Tafseer (1/80); its isnaad was classed as saheeh \n    by Shaykh Ahmad Shaakir (may Allah have mercy on him). \n\n    In \n    some cases the tafseer of the Sahaabah was based on their own ijtihaad and \n    understanding, and their ijtihaad takes precedence over that of those who \n    came after them, because they accompanied the Prophet (blessings and peace \n    of Allah be upon him) and were aware of the circumstances in which the \n    verses of the Qur’an were revealed, such as the reasons for revelation and \n    the place where revelation came down. They were contemporaries who were well \n    aware of the reality of the circumstances in which the Qur’an was revealed \n    and how people were at that time. Moreover, they had a greater understanding \n    than others of the language in which the Qur’an was revealed; they had \n    deeper knowledge, were less complicated (i.e., they were straightforward \n    people), and the furthest removed from misguidance and error in terms of \n    their knowledge and deeds. \n\n    \n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer \n    (p. 95): Then if you do not find the explanation of the meaning in either \n    the Qur’an or the Sunnah, you should refer to the words of the Sahaabah, \n    because they had greater knowledge of that, because of what they witnessed \n    of the Qur’an, and because of the advantages they had, and what they had of \n    perfect understanding and sound knowledge, especially the scholars and \n    leading figures among them… End quote. \n\n    The \n    views of the Sahaabah concerning tafseer take precedence over the views of \n    anyone else, unless the Sahaabah differed concerning it, in which case the \n    mufassir must try to work out which view is most correct. \n\n    4.\n    \n    Tafseer based on reports from the Taabi‘een\n\n    If \n    the mufassir does not find anything in the words of the Sahaabah to explain \n    the meaning of the verse, then he should look at the tafseer of the \n    Taabi‘een, who acquired their knowledge from the companions of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them), because in their circumstances, \n    words, deeds and time they were – naturally – closer to the Sahaabah and to \n    their teachings and were able to learn from them directly. \n\n    \n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in \n    Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer (p. 102): if you do not find the \n    explanation of the meaning in either the Qur’an or the Sunnah, and you do \n    not find it in what is reported from the Sahaabah, in that case many of the \n    imams (leading scholars) turned to the views of the Taabi‘een… End quote. \n\n    He \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) also said (p. 37): \n\n    Among \n    the Taabi‘een are some who learned all their tafseer from the Sahaabah, as \n    Mujaahid said: I showed the Mushaf to Ibn ‘Abbaas, pausing at each verse and \n    asking him about it. Hence ath-Thawri said: If the interpretation of the \n    meaning of a verse comes to you from Mujaahid, it is sufficient for you. \n    Hence ash-Shaafa‘i, al-Bukhaari and other scholars relied on his (Mujaahid’s) \n    tafseer. End quote. \n\n    If \n    the scholars of tafseer among the Taabi‘een are agreed upon a view \n    concerning the meaning of a verse, then undoubtedly it is obligatory to \n    follow it. But if they differed, the view of one of them is not necessarily \n    stronger than that of another and cannot be given precedence over another or \n    be regarded as the ultimate proof. Rather it must be examined and his proof \n    may be quoted or referred to, (but it is not binding proof). \n\n    \n    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n    \n    Undoubtedly the Taabi‘een differed, but those who learned tafseer from the \n    Sahaabah are not equal to those who did not do so. \n\n    \n    However, if they did not state that they learned it from a Sahaabi, then \n    their view is not proof against those who came after them, if they differed \n    in their views, because they are not of the same status as the Sahaabah, but \n    their views are more likely to be closer to the truth. The closer people are \n    to the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), the \n    more likely they are to be correct than those who come after them. This is \n    very clear, because of the prevalence of whims and desires in subsequent \n    periods, and because of the presence of numerous intermediaries between them \n    and the time of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). \n    Undoubtedly this distance detracts from the value of their opinions; hence \n    we know that referring to the view of earlier generations is very important.\n\n    End \n    quote from Sharh Muqaddimat at-Tafseer, p. 140 \n\n    The \n    second method \n    is for the mufassir who has knowledge of tafseer to use his understanding to \n    interpret the meaning of the verse of the Qur’an, and his ijtihaad must be \n    based on the proper method, following the guidelines and principles of \n    tafseer. This is what is called tafseer on the basis of individual \n    understanding and ijtihaad. \n\n    \n    Az-Zarqaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Manaahil al-‘Irfaan \n    fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (2/43): \n\n    With \n    regard to the permissible type of tafseer on the basis of one's \n    understanding, it is essential to be aware of what has been narrated from \n    the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions \n    that may give the mufassir some insight into how he should interpret the \n    meaning on the basis of his understanding. The one who does that must also \n    have extensive knowledge of the rules of the Arabic language and its styles \n    and manner of expression, as well as deep insight into the rules of \n    sharee‘ah, so that he will be able to interpret the words of Allah on the \n    basis of what is well established of the rules and regulations of His \n    sharee‘ah. End quote. \n\n    \n    Tafseer that is based on one’s individual understanding is blameworthy in \n    the following scenarios: \n\n    1.\n    \n    When the one who is seeking to interpret the meaning is not \n    qualified to do so, and he is trying to explain the words of Allah without \n    knowledge. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n    “Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ‘(But) the \n    things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (great evil sins, \n    every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.) whether committed openly or \n    secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in \n    worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things \n    about Allah of which you have no knowledge’” [al-A‘raaf 7:33]; “O mankind! \n    Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the \n    footsteps of Shaitan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy” [al-Baqarah \n    2:168-169].\n\n    2.\n    \n    When he is following his own whims and desires and his aim is \n    to support his bid‘ah (innovation) and opinion, even if that is by twisting \n    the meanings of the words or not paying attention to the proper way of \n    understanding, the ways in which the Arabs express different ideas in their \n    language, and the guidelines of sharee‘ah, as some innovators among the \n    Raafidis and others did, when they interpreted some verses in a manner that \n    is contrary to what is indicated by the guidelines of sharee‘ah and \n    knowledge of the Arabic language.\n\n    \n    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    \n    Interpretation of the Qur’an based on individual opinion: sometimes, in \n    order to be in harmony with his preconceived ideas, as the followers of \n    whims and desires do, a person may say that what is meant by a given word or \n    phrase is such and such – saying something that is in harmony with his \n    preconceived ideas. That includes some later scholars who interpreted the \n    Qur’an in such a manner as to be in harmony with the latest scientific \n    discoveries – whether astronomical or terrestrial – when the Qur’an does not \n    indicate that. In that case they are interpreting the Qur’an on the basis of \n    their own preconceived views, because the Qur’an does not indicate that, \n    either on the basis of the text or of what is indicated by the language. \n    This is their own opinion, and it is not right to interpret the Qur’an on \n    that basis. \n\n    \n    Similarly, if a person does not understand the linguistic meaning or the \n    shar‘i meaning indicated by the verse, if he then says something without \n    knowledge, he is sinning, such as if one of the common folk were to \n    interpret the verse of the holy Qur’an according to his understanding, \n    without basing it on proper understanding of the linguistic or shar‘i \n    guidelines, in which case it is haraam for him to do that, because the one \n    who interprets the meanings of the Qur’an is testifying that Allah meant \n    such and such. This is a very serious matter, because Allah has forbidden us \n    to say about Him that which we do not know.\n\n    “Say \n    (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ‘(But) the things \n    that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (great evil sins, every \n    kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.) whether committed openly or \n    secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in \n    worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things \n    about Allah of which you have no knowledge’” [al-A‘raaf 7:33]. \n\n    Any \n    person who says about Allah that which he does not know about the meaning of \n    His words or any of His rulings has made a serious error. \n\n    End \n    quote from Muqaddimat at-Tafseer, p. 142 \n\n    And \n    Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the interpretation of the Quran holds great significance, and there are two primary methodologies for understanding its verses: tafseer on the basis of narrated texts (tafsir bil ma'thur) and tafseer based on individual understanding (tafsir bil ra'y). Each approach has its own principles and applications, which are crucial for shaping the proper comprehension of the Quranic text.\n\n### Tafseer Based on Narrated Texts (Tafsīr Bil Ma'thur)\n\nThis method involves relying on traditional sources, including the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), the statements of his companions (Sahabah), and the early successors (Tabi'in). This approach prioritizes authenticity and adheres to the historical context in which the verses were revealed.\n\n#### Supporting Evidence:\n1. **Surah Fussilat (41:43):**\n   \"Nothing is said to you which had not been said to other apostles before you. Surely your Lord is the lord of forgiveness, but also the lord of severe retribution.\"\n   - This verse highlights that previous revelations also included guidance and that the Quran reiterates past messages. The reliance on narrated texts supports a consistent lineage of interpretation.\n\n2. **Surah Fussilat (41:44):**\n   \"If We had made it a discourse in an obscure tongue, they would have said: 'Why were its revelations not expounded distinctly?' A foreign tongue and an Arab (audience)?\"\n   - This reflects the emphasis on clarity and the need for understanding through established narratives.\n\n3. **Surah Taha (20:114):**\n   \"Exalted then be God, the real King; and do not try to anticipate the Qur'an before the completion of its revelation, but pray: 'O Lord, give me greater knowledge.'\"\n   - This indicates the need for humility in understanding the Quran, and to seek knowledge that is informed by tradition.\n\n### Tafseer Based on Individual Understanding (Tafsīr Bil Ra'y)\n\nIn this method, scholars engage with the text through reason and personal interpretation, utilizing linguistic skills, rhetorical analysis, and contextual understanding. While this approach allows for flexibility and adaptation to contemporary issues, it carries the risk of subjectivity, and interpretations may vary widely.\n\n#### Supporting Evidence:\n1. **Surah Fussilat (41:3):**\n   \"A Book whose verses have been distinguished and explained, a lucid discourse for people who understand...\"\n   - This verse implies that comprehension should be approached logically, allowing room for individual reasoning as long as it does not contradict established doctrine.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:30):**\n   \"The prophet will say: 'O my Lord, my people had fettered the Qur'an.' Thus do We keep opponents among the sinners for every apostle; yet your Lord is sufficient as a guide and helper.\"\n   - Here, the Prophet's complaint about the rejection of the Quran emphasizes the necessity for understanding and applying its message actively, suggesting that individuals must engage with it thoughtfully.\n\n3. **Surah Taha (20:112):**\n   \"... and do not try to anticipate the Qur'an before the completion of its revelation...\"\n   - This illustrates that interpretation requires patience and consideration, which can also incorporate personal reflection once the verses are understood.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth tafseer bil ma'thur (narrated texts) and tafseer bil ra'y (individual understanding) play important roles in the interpretation of the Quran. The former ensures adherence to authentic sources, while the latter allows for personal engagement and modern relevance. A balanced approach that respects traditional scholarship while allowing room for personal interpretation can enrich one's understanding of the Quran, provided it aligns with the foundational beliefs and teachings of Islam. \n\nThis multifaceted approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the Quran while safeguarding against misinterpretation. It is essential for learners and scholars to navigate these methods carefully to maintain the integrity of the message conveyed in the Divine text."

        "question": "Are the names of the surahs a matter of tawqeef?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) named some of the surahs of the Qur’an, such as al-Faatihah, al-Baqarah, Aal ‘Imraan and al-Kahf. \nThe scholars differed as to whether the names of all the surahs of the Qur’an are proven to be from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or are some of them proven to be based on the ijtihaad of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them)? \nThe majority of scholars are of the view that the names of all of the surahs of the Qur’an are proven to be from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and are the matter of Tawqeef [i.e., they can only be known through divine Revelation and sound texts of hadeeth, with no room for ijtihad]. \nImam Ibn Jareer at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe surahs of the Qur’an have names that were given to them by the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).

End quote. \nAl-Burhaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (1/270) \nAs-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nIt is proven that all the names of the surahs are the matter of tawqeef, based on hadiths and reports.

The purpose of naming them is so as to make it easy to refer to them and discuss their meanings. End quote. \nAt-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer (1/88) \nThis is the view favoured by a number of contemporary scholars who have written about the sciences of Qur’an, such as Dr. Fahd ar-Roomi in Diraasaat fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (p. 118), and Dr. Ibraaheem al-Huwaymil in his paper al-Mukhtasar fi Asma’ as-Suwar, in Majallat Jaami‘at al-Imam (issue no. 30, p. 135). \nSome of the scholars are of the view that some of the names of the surahs in the Holy Qur’an were given to them by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and some of them were the result of the ijtihaad of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). \nIt says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (4/16): \nWe do not know of any text from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to suggest that he named all of the surahs, but it is narrated in some saheeh hadiths that some of them were named by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), such as al-Baqarah and Aal ‘Imraan. As for the other surahs, what appears to be the case is that they were named by the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them).

        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether the names of the Surahs (chapters) in the Quran are a matter of tawqeef—meaning they are divinely mandated and cannot be changed—has been discussed among scholars of Islam. The prevailing scholarly view is that the names of the Surahs are indeed a matter of tawqeef.\n\n### Supporting Points\n\n1. **Divine Revelation:**\n   The Quran, including its Surahs and titles, is considered by Muslims to be the direct word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). As such, the names of the Surahs are also understood to be chosen by God. This idea is reinforced by verses that emphasize the Quran as a divine revelation.\n\n   - For instance, Surah Taha (20:1), which begins \"Ta-Ha\" (and is the name of the Surah itself), shows how the Surah was named in accordance with the revelation: \"TA HA. We have not sent down the Qur'an to you that you should be burdened\" (Surah Taha 20:1-2).\n\n2. **Consistency and Tradition:**\n   The Surahs have been referred to by these names throughout Islamic history by the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. This consistent use further cements the argument for their status as tawqeef. There is an established tradition of using these names in the practice of recitation and usage in Islamic teachings.\n\n3. **Hadith Evidence:**\n   There are also narrations (Hadith) from the Prophet Muhammad that confirm the names of certain Surahs. For example, in the narration about Surah Al-Kahf (Surah 18), it is mentioned that it was named after the story of the People of the Cave.\n\n4. **Contextual Importance:**\n   Some Surah titles are reflective of the central themes or a significant story contained within them. For example, Surah Al-Falaq (Surah 113) is about seeking refuge from evil, and the name indicates this protective aspect, which aligns with its content.\n\n### Verses Referenced\n1. **Surah Taha (20:1-3)**: \n   \"TA HA. We have not sent down the Qur'an to you that you should be burdened, but as admonition for him who fears\" (Surah Taha 20:1-2).\n\n2. **Surah At-Tawbah (9:127)**:\n   \"Whenever a Surah is revealed they look at each other ... Indeed God has turned their hearts away (from the truth), for they cannot discern the law of heaven\" (Surah At-Tawbah 9:127).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the names of the Surahs are seen as a matter of tawqeef in Islamic tradition. They are part of the divine guidance and have been established since the time of revelation. The names are important not just for identification but also provide context and significance as established within the teachings of Islam."

        "question": "Will the Qur’an testify, on the Day of Resurrection, against those who went against it as it will testify for its companions (those who read it and acted upon it) and intercede for them?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIt is proven in the saheeh Sunnah that the Quran will intercede for its companions on the Day of Resurrection. Muslim (804) narrated that Abu Umaamah al-Baahili said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Read the Qur’aan, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection interceding for its companions.” \nImam Ahmad (6589) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting and the Quran will intercede for a person on the Day of Resurrection. Fasting will say: O Lord, I kept him from his food and desires during the day; let me intercede for him. And the Quran will say: I kept him from sleeping during the night; let me intercede for him. And they will be allowed to intercede.”\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 7329 \nSee also the answer to question no. 14035 \nSecondly: \nJust as the Quran will intercede for its companions on the Day of Resurrection, it will also testify against those who went against it by neglecting it, ignoring its obligations and transgressing against the limits it set. \nMuslim (223) narrated that Abu Maalik al-Ash‘ari said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Qur’aan is evidence for you or against you.” \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nEither it will be for you, if you sought to draw close to Allah means of it, and you fulfilled the obligations towards the Holy Quran, namely believing its stories, obeying its commands, heeding its prohibitions and venerating and respecting the Holy Quran, in which case it will be proof for you, \nOr it will be the opposite, if you disrespected the Quran and neglected its words and meanings and failed to act upon it, and you did not fulfil the obligations towards it. In that case it will be a witness against you on the Day of Resurrection. \nEnd quote from Sharh Riyadh as-Saaliheen, p. 30 \nIbn Hibbaan narrated in his Saheeh (124) from Jaabir that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Quran is an intercessor whose intercession will be accepted and an opponent whose testimony will be accepted. Whoever puts it in front of him, it will lead him to Paradise, and whoever puts it behind his back, it will drive him to Hell.” \nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, 2019; ad-Daaraqutni mentioned it in al-‘Ilal, 5/102, where he said that it was mawqoof and its isnaad stopped at Ibn Mas‘ood. \nIbn Hibbaan said, commenting on this hadith: \nThis is a report from the wording of which one who does not have deep knowledge may think that the Quran is something created, but that is not the case. The Arabs may give the name of a thing to its cause and they may give the name of the cause to the thing. Because acting in accordance with the Quran will lead a person to Paradise, the name of that thing, which is acting in accordance with the Quran, is given to its cause, which is the Quran. It does not mean that the Quran is created. \nan-Nihaayah, 4/636 \nan-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nIt says in az-Zaahir: What is meant is that the one against whom the Quran testifies and says that he fell short and neglected it will be in Hell. And it is said: Do not make the Quran an opponent, i.e., to testify against you. \nEnd quote from Fayd al-Qadeer, 4/699 \nIt was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (30667), Ibn Qutaybah in Ta’weel Mukhtalif al-hadith (p. 258), Ibn ad-Durays in Fadaa’il al-Quran (89), via Muhammad ibn Ishaaq, from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, that his grandfather said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say:\n“The Quran will appear on the Day of Resurrection in the form of a man who will bring the man who learned it but went against its commands. It will appear as a disputant against him and will say: O Lord, You made him learn about me but what a bad learner he was; he transgressed my limits, neglected my obligations, disobeyed me and did not obey me. It will keep throwing accusations at him until it is said: Do what you like with him. Then it will take him by the hand and will not let him go until it throws him onto a rock in Hell. And it will bring a righteous man who learned it and adhered to its teachings. It will appear as a defendant and will say: O Lord, You made him learn about me and what a good learner he was; he respected my limits, did the obligatory duties, avoided the sins mentioned in me and obeyed my instructions. And it will keep presenting arguments in his favour until it is said: Do what you like with him. Then it will take him by the hand and will not let him go until it dresses him in brocade and puts on him the crown of a king.” \nThis is a da‘eef (weak) isnaad, because Ibn Ishaaq is mudallis and used the word ‘an (narrating from, i.e., he did not state clearly that he heard it directly). But al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Khalq Af‘aal al-‘Ibaad (474): \n‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The Quran will appear in the form of a man on the Day of Resurrection and will intercede for its companions.”\nZuhayr ibn Harb told me: Ya‘qoob ibn Ibraaheem told us: my father told me from Ibn Ishaaq, and ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr told me, from his father, from his grandfather: I heard this from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Abu ‘Abdullah (i.e., al-Bukhaari) said: “This is his earnings and his deeds.” End quote. \nSo it is proven that Ibn Ishaaq heard the hadith from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, thus the hadith is proven. \nThe words “The Quran will appear on the Day of Resurrection…” mean that his recitation of the Quran will appear to him. \nSee the answer to question no. 91306\nIt was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (30676) and ad-Daarimi (3325) from ash-Sha‘bi, from Ibn Mas‘ood who said: “The Quran will come on the Day of Resurrection and will intercede for its companion, and it will lead him to Paradise, or it will testify against (a person) and will drive him to Hell. Ash-Sha‘bi did not hear from Ibn Mas‘ood, as it says in al-Maraaseel by Ibn Abi Haatim (p. 25). \nBut there is a corroborating report that says: “The Quran is an intercessor whose intercession will be accepted and an opponent whose testimony will be accepted. Whoever puts it in front of him, it will lead him to Paradise, and whoever puts it behind his back, it will drive him to Hell.” \nThis was narrated via a number of isnaads from Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him).See: Fadaa’il al-Quran  by al-Firyaabi (20); Fadaa’il al-Quran by Abu ‘Ubayd (44); Fadaa’il al-Quran by Ibn Durays (94); az-Zuhd by Imam Ahmad (p. 155); Shu‘ab al-Eemaan by al-Bayhaqi (2010); al-Mu‘jam al-Kabeer by at-Tabaraani (8655). \nFrom the above it is clear that just as the Quran will testify for its companions on the Date of Resurrection, it will also testify against those who went against it. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether the Qur'an will testify against those who went against it, as well as intercede for its companions who read and acted upon it, is supported by several verses in the Qur'an. Here’s a thorough examination of the topic, citing relevant verses.\n\n### The Qur'an's Role at Resurrection\n\n1. **Witness Against and For Humanity:**\n   The Qur'an indicates that it will be a witness for and against people based on their actions toward it. In Surah Al-Ma'idah (Surah 5), it is revealed that on the Day of Resurrection, God will ask the apostles about how the message was received, showing the Qur'an's role as a witness:\n   - **\"The day God will gather the apostles and ask, 'What answer was made to you?' They will say: 'We know not. You alone know the secrets unknown.'\"**  \n   (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:109)\n\n   This verse implies that those who followed the guidance of the Qur'an and upheld the teachings will be rewarded, while those who denied or rejected it may face consequence.\n\n2. **Intercession of the Qur'an:**\n   While specific verses that explicitly mention the Qur'an interceding for its followers aren’t as prominent, prophetic traditions (Hadith) do underscore this belief. A relevant verse that indicates good deeds and guidance leading to Divine mercy is:\n   - **\"Whosoever repents and does the right will have turned back to God by way of repentance.\"**  \n   (Surah Al-Furqan, 25:71)\n\n3. **The Role of Self-Witness:**\n   Moreover, individuals will witness against themselves, which may imply a natural acknowledgment of one's actions relating to the guidance received from the Qur'an. In Surah Al-Qiyamah (Surah 75):\n   - **\"In fact man is a witness against himself, whatever excuses he may offer.\"**  \n   (Surah Al-Qiyamah, 75:14)\n\n   This verse emphasizes personal accountability, suggesting that those who neglect the Qur'an's teachings will ultimately be held accountable for their choices.\n\n4. **Doom for Concealers:**\n   Verses from Surah Al-Baqarah (Surah 2) state:\n   - **\"Those who conceal any part of the Scriptures that God has revealed... take nothing but fire as food; and God will not turn to them on the Day of Resurrection...\"**  \n   (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:174)\n\n   This highlights the grave consequences for those who turn away from or conceal the truth of the Qur'an, hinting that the Qur'an itself will stand witness to their actions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the Qur'an is portrayed as a significant witness for and against individuals based on their adherence or rejection of its teachings. Those who engage with the Qur'an faithfully, reading and acting upon it, are poised to find intercession and support from its teachings, while those who dismiss or turn away from it face severe consequences. Overall, this dichotomy underscores the importance of the Qur'an in guiding behavior and belief, shaping the ultimate outcomes on the Day of Resurrection."

        "question": "Whoever adds or takes away a letter from the Qur’an deliberately has committed an act of kufr (disbelief)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In the answer to question no. 158204 we stated that if a person makes a mistake in reciting a soorah, or forgets something of it, whilst he is praying, then he should try to correct the mistake and remember what he forgot. If he is not able to do that, then he may skip that verse and move on to the next one, or he may stop reciting that soorah and start reciting a different one. \nBut if he adds to the Qur’an something that is not part of it deliberately – whether that is during the prayer or otherwise, then this is emphatically forbidden and the scholars have stated that whoever omits a letter of the Qur’an or substitutes a different letter or adds a letter has committed an act of kufr. \nAl-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe Muslims are unanimously that the Qur’an which is recited in all corners of the earth, and is written in the Mushaf between the two covers by the hands of the Muslims, from the beginning of Soorat al-Faatihah to the end of Soorat an-Naas is indeed the word of Allah and His Revelation that He sent down to His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); that everything in it is truth; and that anyone who deliberately omits a letter of it, or substitutes one letter for another, or adds to it a letter that is not included in the Mushaf on which there is consensus, and there is consensus that it is not part of the Qur’an, has committed an act of kufr.\nEnd quote from ash-Shifa, 2/304-305; see also at-Taqreer wa’t-Tahbeer by Ibn Ameer al-Haaj, 2/215 \nIt says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 35/214: The Qur’an is the word of Allah, the miracle that was sent down to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and was transmitted by means of tawaatur (i.e., it was narrated from so many people by so many people that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a lie). It is haram to deliberately make mistakes in it, whether that changes the meaning or not, because its words and phrases are tawqeefi (i.e., to be accepted and recited as they were revealed, and they cannot be altered) and it was transmitted to us by means of tawaatur. It is not permissible to change any word of it by altering the vowels or changing the letters, replacing one letter with another. End quote. \nBased on that, it is not permissible for a student to write a word or a letter that he knows is not part of the Qur’an or that does not belong in this verse; rather he should either try hard to remember, or he should leave the parts that he has forgotten blank. He can also apologize for that by explaining that he forgot where this word goes and that he did not want to write something of which he was not certain in this case. \nAnd Allah knows best.",

This is clearly stated in Surah Al-Hijr, where Allah says:\n   \\[\n   \"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian.\" \n   \\]\n   **(Surah Al-Hijr, 15:9)**  - This verse signifies that altering the Quran in any form undermines this divine promise.\n\n2. **No Alteration of Divine Words**: The importance of not changing the words of the Quran is emphasized in Surah Qaf, where Allah states:\n   \\[\n   \"There is no changing of My word, nor am I unjust to My creatures.\"\n   \\]\n   **(Surah Qaf, 50:29)** - This reinforces the idea that altering the text is an offense against the divine decree.\n\n3. **Consequences of Alteration**: Additionally, the consequences of being an \"obstructor of good\" and altering religious texts are made clear in Surah Qaf:\n   \\[\n   \"Cast each stubborn unbeliever into Hell; Every obstructor of good, transgressor, and the skeptic, Who had set up another god with God. Cast him into severe torment.\"\n   \\]\n   **(Surah Qaf, 50:24-26)** - This indicates that those who knowingly distort the message could be seen as committing acts of disbelief (kufr).\n\n### Understanding of Kufr\n\n1. **Kufr Defined**: Kufr generally refers to disbelief or rejection of faith in God and His guidance. Altering the Quran deliberately could be construed as disbelief, given the essential role of the Quran in guiding Muslims.\n\n2. ** Associating Partners with God**: The term \"kafir\" is often associated with those who associate partners with Allah. The act of changing the Quran text can be viewed as undermining the core message of monotheism in Islam.\n\n### Scholarly Consensus\n\nIslamic scholars have historically condemned the act of altering the Quran. Most agree that doing so, especially with intent, amounts to disbelief because it indicates a rejection of divine authority and truth. Scholarly contributions throughout Islamic history have emphasized the necessity of preserving the integrity of the Quran as part of faith.\n\nIn summary, the claim that altering the Quran results in kufr (disbelief) is supported by Islamic tenets regarding the preservation, sanctity, and authority of the divine text. Thinking about the verses cited, one can see a clear correlation between altering the Quran and falling into the realms of disbelief, as such actions contradict the fundamental beliefs of a Muslim."

        "question": "Will he be rewarded for memorizing the Qur’an if he memorizes it from an audio recording?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    You should bear in mind these \n    two important matters, which are from the bounty of Allah that He has \n    bestowed upon His slaves. \n\n    The first is that Allah, may He \n    be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have indeed \n    made the Quran easy to understand and remember, then is there any that will \n    remember (or receive admonition)?” [al-Qamar 54:17]. \n\n    The second is that the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who is skilled in \n    reciting Qur’an will be with the noble, honourable scribes and the one who \n    recites Qur’an and falters therein, and finds it difficult, will have a \n    double reward.”\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4937) \n    and Muslim (798). \n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy \n    on him) said: \n\n    The one who falters is the one \n    who stumbles in his recitation because of his poor memorisation. He will \n    have a double reward: the reward for reciting and the reward for faltering \n    in his recitation and the difficulty he encounters. End quote. \n\n    If we learn that the Qur’an is \n    easy to remember and understand, and we learn that the one for whom any of \n    that is difficult to learn, memorize or understand will have a double reward \n    – once this is established, it will be appropriate for the wise person to \n    strive his utmost to achieve that and to show patience in seeking to attain \n    this sublime goal. How often has Allah made it easy for non-Arabs who do not \n    speak Arabic well to memorize His Book in its entirety. To achieve this \n    great virtue it is worth spending a great deal of time and competing with \n    others. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    One of the things that help one \n    to memorize the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is listening to it often \n    on recordings. If it is easy for you to memorize it in this way, then you \n    will become one of those who have memorized the Book of Allah, attained that \n    goal and earned the reward and status of the hafiz, by Allah’s leave. The \n    individual’s precision in recitation, memorization and acting upon the Holy \n    Book and its rulings and teachings will determine his reward and his status \n    before Allah, if he is sincere in his intention and seeks reward with Him. \n\n    However it is better to combine \n    two things in that regard: striving to recite it and to memorize whatever \n    you are able to whilst looking at the Mushaf, so as to attain the virtue of \n    reading it yourself and the virtue of looking in the Mushaf. Then by \n    listening to a recording of the Qur’an you will be able to do two things: \n    correct your recitation and make sure that you have got it right before \n    memorizing it, and then continue revising it and reminding yourself of what \n    you have memorized after that. \n\n    Undoubtedly the one who listens \n    to the recitation by his shaykh or teacher directly will learn the Book of \n    Allah more precisely than the one who listens to it from a recording. The \n    Muslim cannot memorize properly unless he learns directly from a shaykh and \n    attends his classes whenever he can. \n\n    But for the one who does not \n    have access to a shaykh but does have access to a recording, there is \n    nothing wrong with him listening to it and memorizing in that manner. \n\n    For more information, please see \n    the answers to questions no. 112763 and\n    147816 \n\n    Thirdly: \n\n    Competing and hastening to \n    reward is something that is open to everyone. The one who cannot compete in \n    memorizing and reciting Qur’an can compete in prayer, fasting, giving \n    charity, remembering Allah, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is \n    evil, doing good deeds, upholding ties of kinship, honouring parents or \n    other innumerable types of righteous deeds. \n\n    All of the proven, prescribed \n    adhkaar bring a great reward, but there are some that bring a greater \n    reward. In the case of the Qur’an – which is the best dhikr – reciting \n    Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad (i.e., Soorat al-Ikhlaas 112) is equivalent to one \n    third of the Qur’an. Soorat al-Faatihah is the best soorah and Ayat al-Kursiy \n    (al-Baqarah 2:255) is the best verse. Whoever recites the last two verses of \n    Soorat al-Baqarah at night, they will suffice him. Memorizing these passages \n    and others is something that everyone can do, and in reciting them and \n    repeating them there is a great deal of reward. \n\n    Other adhkaar include the \n    following: \n\n    ·That which was narrated by Muslim (2729) from Juwayriyah, who \n    said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    left her house one morning when he prayed Fajr, and she was in her \n    prayer-place, then he came back after the forenoon had come, and she was \n    still sitting there. He said: “Are you still as you were when I left you?” \n    She said: Yes. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n    “After I left you I said four words three times, which if they were weighed \n    against what you have said today, they would outweigh it: ‘Subhan \n    Allah wa bi hamdih, ‘adada khalqihi, wa rida nafsihi, wazinata ‘arshihi, wa \n    midaada kalimatihi (Glory \n    and praise be to Allah, as much as the number of His creation, as much as \n    pleases Him, as much as the weight of His Throne and as much as the ink of \n    His words).”\n\n    ·“Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem \n    (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty).” al-Bukhaari \n    (6682) and Muslim (2694) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of \n    Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Two words that are \n    light on the tongue and heavy in the balance and beloved to the Most \n    Merciful: Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem \n    (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty).”\n\n    ·The best of prayers for forgiveness (sayyid al-istighfaar): \n    al-Bukhaari (6306) narrated from Shaddaad ibn Aws (may Allah be pleased with \n    him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The \n    best of prayers for forgiveness is to say: “The best prayer for seeking \n    forgiveness is to say: ‘Allaahumma anta rabbi la ilaaha illa anta, \n    Khalaqtani wa ana ‘abduka wa ana ‘ala ‘ahdika wa wa’dika ma astata’t. \n    A’oodhu bika min sharri ma sana’tu, aboo’u laka bi ni’matika ‘alayya wa \n    aboo’u laka bi dhanbi, faghfir li fa innahu laa yaghfiru’l-dhunoob illaa \n    anta (O Allah, You are my Lord. None has the right to be worshipped but \n    You. You created me and I am Your slave, and I am faithful to my covenant \n    and my promise (to You) as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from all \n    the evil I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have \n    bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So I entreat You to \n    forgive my sins, for nobody can forgive sins except You).’ Whoever says this \n    during the day, having faith in it and dies before the evening comes, will \n    be among the people of \n    Paradise, and whoever says it during the night, having faith in it, and dies \n    before the morning comes, will be among the people of Paradise.” \n\n    Other kinds of dhikr, in \n    general, are the adkhaar to be recited in the morning or the evening, those \n    that are to be recited following the obligatory prayers and those that are \n    to be recited before going to sleep, for the one who regularly recites them \n    will have a great reward. \n\n    Please see also the answer to \n    question no 174947\n\n    Fourthly: \n\n    It is prescribed for the Muslims \n    to vary the adhkaar and all acts of worship. So sometimes he may read Qur’an, \n    sometimes he may remember Allah (dhikr), sometimes he may pray, sometimes he \n    may study books of knowledge, and sometimes he may relax by doing various \n    kinds of permissible leisure activities. He should not limit himself to one \n    specific type of worship, never doing anything else, because by doing that \n    he will miss out on the reward and virtue of the other types of worship that \n    he ignores, in addition to the fact that there is the fear that he may get \n    tired and bored.\n\n     Please see also the answer to \n    question no. 195274\n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In regard to the question of whether one will be rewarded for memorizing the Qur’an from an audio recording, the main consideration revolves around the intention (niyyah) and effort put forth in the process of memorization.\n\n1. **Intention and Effort**: In Islam, actions are judged by intention. If an individual genuinely aims to memorize the Qur’an, regardless of the medium through which they learn (audio or otherwise), they can be rewarded for their effort. The relevant message here refers to how God is aware of a person’s intentions and efforts.\n\n2. **God's Mercy and Understanding**: The verses you provided from Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20) highlight God’s understanding of human limitations and circumstances:\n   - *“So recite as much of the Qur’an as you can easily. He knows some among you will be sick, and some will be traveling over the earth in search of the bounty of God...”* (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20).\n   - This verse emphasizes that God understands the diverse situations of people, which extends to the varied methods of learning.\n\n3. **Responsibility of Upbringing and Guidance**: Additionally, in Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:17-19), it is stated:\n   - *“Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.”* (Surah Al-Qiyamah, 75:17-18).\n   - This shows that God oversees the guidance of the Quran and supports those who work toward understanding and memorizing it.\n\n4. **The Nature of the Qur’an**: It is also important to note that the Qur’an is designed for ease of recitation and memorization:\n   - In Surah Al-A'la (87:6-10), it is mentioned, *“We shall make you recite (the Qur’an) so that you will not forget it...”* (Surah Al-A'la, 87:6) indicating that God facilitates the learning process.\n   - This makes it understandable that God rewards those who strive to memorize and uphold His word, irrespective of the specific method chosen.\n\n5. **Reward for Good Deeds**: Finally, another principle in Islam is that good deeds are rewarded, as highlighted in Surah Al-Qasas (28:84):\n   - *“Whoever does good will receive better than what he has done...”* (Surah Al-Qasas, 28:84).\n   - Thus, the individual’s effort to memorize the Qur'an, regardless of the medium, can be seen as a good deed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the intention, effort, and understanding of God’s mercy and the ease He has provided in memorizing the Qur'an, an individual who memorizes the Qur'an from an audio recording can indeed be rewarded. The Quran itself encourages learning, and as long as the attempt is sincere, it aligns with the principles of Islam that emphasize the importance of striving in the way of God. \n\nFor specific references:\n- Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)\n- Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:17-19)\n- Surah Al-A'la (87:6-10)\n- Surah Al-Qasas (28:84)"

        "question": "Ruling on referring to Qur’anic verses whilst changing some of the words",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In Arabic linguistics, this action is called iqtibaas (lit. borrowing); this means referring to a verse or hadeeth when speaking, without attributing it to its source, whether one alters a word sometimes or quotes it as it is. The basic principle concerning this is that any such quotations or references should be within a proper context and implying an appropriate meaning. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nNo one has the right to use the wording of the Qur’an for any purpose other than that for which Allah revealed it. This is how the scholars interpreted the hadeeth, “The Book of Allah should not be quoted” i.e., the Qur’an should not be referred to inappropriately.\nAn example of that is if one says to someone who has come to discuss a need, “Then you came here according to the fixed term which I ordained (for you), O Moosa” (cf. Ta-Ha 20:40); or if a person says when arguing: “When will this promise be fulfilled?”(cf. Yaa-Seen 36:48),or “Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars” (cf. at-Tawbah 9:107). \nFurthermore, if the person says that by way of belittling the Qur’an or making fun of it, this is tantamount to kufr (disbelief). \nHowever, if he recites the verse to support a ruling for which this verse was revealed, or in the context of discussing some ruling, this is acceptable. That includes what the fuqaha’ concluded of rulings on the basis of analogy, and what shaykhs and preachers quote to support to what they say. \nEnd quote from Mukhtasar al-Fataawa al-Misriyyah, 172 \nAs-Suyooti wrote an essay on this topic entitled Raf‘ al-Baas wa Kashf al-Iltibaas fi Darab al-Mathal min al-Qur’an wa’l-Iqtibaas, in the book al-Haawi li’l-Fataawa (1/305): on our website we have discussed this manner of speaking in detail; please see the following fatwas (in Arabic): 119673, 103923, 127745 and 150303.\nFrom these fatwas we may conclude that it is haraam to refer to texts in the scenarios mentioned above; that is based on the following points: \n-1-\nit seems, from the phrases quoted above, that they were referred to for the purpose of mocking and making fun of others; in this case the Holy Qur’an was used as a tool for mockery in one of the most abhorrent ways of dealing with this holy Book which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sent down as a book of light and guidance, the words of which showed the way for mankind to follow, in the light of its teachings, and formed the foundation for much historical, linguistic, geographical and scientific research, as well as cultural and moral theories. If we bear all of that and more in mind, there will be no hesitation in regarding as abhorrent the words of one who says “But the Brothers bore it” instead of “But man bore it” (cf. al-Ahzaab 33:72), making fun of a group of Muslims. Is there anything more disrespectful towards the words and meanings of the Qur’an than this?\n -2-\nwe are very upset by much of what we have seen from some irresponsible media such as newspapers, magazines, satellite channels and so on, who take advantage of recent painful events in the Muslim world and use the Holy Qur’an in this manner, referring to its verses to address religious people and to mock some political Islamic groups and their predicament in some countries. It is as if the Holy Qur’an is not a Book for all Muslims, rather it is a book for some of them only. And it is as if the one who refers to it in this manner is trying to tell people, “We can come up with something like this Qur’an which you recite and venerate, in order to point out your faults!” For example, he may write “And those who were of the Brotherhood will be driven to Hell in groups” (cf. “And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups” [az-Zumar 39:51]); this poor man does not realise that the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is of a sublime status and is not to be touched by any but those who are purified; those who are not purified with regard to religious commitment and manners are only exposing the darkness that resides in their hearts and the foolishness of their minds. They lose in worldly terms, let alone in terms of the Hereafter, by using this kind of mocking language, telling lies about Allah, distorting the meaning of His Book and, in fact, blatantly distorting the wording thereof. \n-3-\nhere we will quote the views of some scholars who forbade this kind of referring to the text if it is done in the context of mockery and disrespect. \nAs-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nOne kind of reprehensible referral to texts is quoting a verse in the context of a joke – we seek refuge with Allah from that – such as saying (in verse):\n“She conveyed a message to her lovers with her eyes, ‘Far, very far is that which you are promised’ [cf. al-Mu’minoon 23:36];\nSeek physical intimacy with her – ‘For the like of this let all strive, who wish to strive’ [cf. as-Saaffaat 37:61].” \nEnd quote from al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an, 1/387; as-Suyooti quoted this categorization (of ways of quoting or referring to Qur’an, into those which are acceptable and those which are not) from one of the scholars, and approved of this categorization. \nThen he (as-Suyooti – may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nI do not know of any difference of opinion among the scholars that this is permissible to refer to the Qur’an, provided that the context is not one of approving of promiscuity, immorality, mockery on the part of evildoers, drinking alcohol, promoting homosexuality, and so on.\nEnd quote from Tanweer al-Hawaalik Sharh Muwatta’ Maalik, 1/312\nIbn ‘Aqeel al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nReferencing the Qur’an in the context of improper speech is not permissible. \nEnd quote from Ibn Muflih in al-Adaab ash-Shar‘iyyah, 2/289. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some examples of referring to Qur’anic texts, such as when someone said, “Today we have seen Noon and what they know (noonwa ma ya ‘lamoon)”\n(this is a rhyme which tries to sound like what is mentioned at the beginning of Soorat al-Qalam). \nHe replied: \nAs for the one who said that by way of mockery, this is a very serious matter; it may even be said that he has gone beyond the pale of Islam, because it is not permissible under any circumstances to quote the Qur’an by way of mockery, and the same applies to Islamic rulings. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The hypocrites fear lest a Soorah (chapter of the Quran) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: ‘(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.’\nIf you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: ‘Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (SAW) that you were mocking?\n‘Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimoon (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.)’”\n[at-Tawbah 9:64-66]. \nHence the scholars (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever utters a word of disbelief, even if that is jokingly, has become a disbeliever; he must repent and believe that he is repenting from apostasy, and he has to renew his Islam. The verses of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and the words of His Messenger are too great to be taken as a joke. \nHowever, in the case of one who quotes a verse in relation to some incident that occurs, there is nothing wrong with that. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) quoted verses in relation to incidents that occurred. He quoted the verse (interpretation of the meaning), “Your wealth and your children are only a trial” [at-Taghaabun 64:15], when [his grandsons] al-Hasan and al-Husayn came stumbling; he came down from the minbar and said: (interpretation of the meaning), “Your wealth and your children are only a trial” [at-Taghaabun 64:15]. So there is nothing wrong with quoting verses in relation to some incidents that occur. But to quote verses inappropriately, in ways that are not in accordance with that which was intended by Allah, especially if that is in the context of joking and mocking – this is a very serious matter.\nEnd quote from Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, 60/13 \nAnyone wishing to know more may refer to the book al-Iqtibaas: Anwaa‘uhu wa Ahkaamuhu, by Dr. ‘Abd al-Muhsin ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez al-‘Askar. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Referring to Qur’anic verses while changing some of the words is a sensitive issue within Islamic scholarship. The consensus among scholars is that altering the words of the Qur’an, whether slightly or significantly, is generally not permissible, as the sanctity and the original wording of the text are of utmost importance.\n\n1. **Preservation of the Qur'anic Text**: The Qur'an indicates the Divine promise of its preservation and warns against alterations. This is underscored in Surah Qaf (Surah 50), where Allah states, \"There is no changing of My word...\" (Qaf, 50:29). This verse emphasizes that God's word remains unchanged and serves as a direct admonition against altering the revelations.\n\n2. **Intended Meaning**: When one references the Qur'an, it is vital to maintain the intended meaning and the original context. Surah Ash-Shuraa (Surah 42) states, \"In whatever matter you disagree the ultimate judgment rests with God.\" (Ash-Shuraa, 42:10). This highlights that ultimate authority and interpretation lie with God. Altering words could lead to distortion of the original meaning and, consequently, misguidance.\n\n3. **The Role of the Prophet**: In Surah Al-Furqan (Surah 25), it is mentioned that the Prophet Muhammad was sent as a guide and that his community, being of one heart, also faced challenges as they received the Qur'an. The Prophet expresses, \"O my Lord, my people had fettered the Qur'an.\" (Al-Furqan, 25:30). This indicates the seriousness with which the original text is treated and underscores the responsibility of Muslims to uphold its integrity.\n\n4. **Seeking Knowledge**: The Qur'an encourages believers to strive for understanding and knowledge. For instance, Surah Ash-Shuraa indicates, \"But those who came to inherit the Book after them are also in doubt and disturbed about it.\" (Ash-Shuraa, 42:14). This verse highlights the ongoing importance of understanding the Qur'an as it was revealed without alteration, ensuring that one's knowledge is based on the authentic text.\n\n5. **Accountability and Misrepresentation**: In Surah Al-Furqan, it warns against listening to those who would misrepresent God's words and emphasizes that one should strive against disbelief: \"So do not listen to unbelievers, and strive against them with greater effort.\" (Al-Furqan, 25:50). This implies responsibility for one's speech and actions regarding the Qur'an.\n\nIn summary, the general ruling regarding the alteration of Qur'anic verses while referring to them is that it is impermissible. The integrity of the text must be maintained in both written and verbal forms, as prescribed by Islamic law. Muslims are encouraged to convey the meaning and guidance of the Qur'an as it was revealed, preserving its language and context, which can be considered a form of worship and respect toward God's word."

        "question": "How can the Qur’an be a miracle for the non-Arabs when it is Arabic and they do not know Arabic?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    The hadeeth referred to in the question is as follows: \n\n    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n    “There is not a single Prophet who was not given signs so \n    that the people would believed in him because of them. What I have been \n    given is a Revelation that Allah has revealed to me, and I hope that I will \n    be the one with the most followers on the Day of Resurrection.”\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1044) and Muslim (152). \n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There \n    are several possible interpretations of the hadeeth: \n\n    It was said that what is meant is that the miracles of the \n    Prophets have come to an end with the end of their time, and no one \n    witnessed them except those who were present, but the miracle of the Qur’an \n    is ongoing and will continue until the Day of Resurrection. It is \n    extraordinary in its style and eloquence, and in what it foretold of future \n    events of the unseen, so that no era passed except something appeared that \n    the Qur’an said would come to pass, which proves the truthfulness of its \n    claim. This is the strongest of the interpretations of the hadeeth. \n\n    It was also said that what is meant is that the miracles of \n    the past were visible and could be seen with the eyes, such as the she-camel \n    of Saalih and the staff of Moosa, whereas the miracle of the Qur’an may be \n    comprehended with the intellect, so the number of those who followed the \n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) because of it \n    were more numerous, since that which can be seen with the eyes comes to an \n    end when the looking ends, whereas that which may be comprehended with the \n    intellect will continue to be understood by those who come after the first \n    generations. \n\n    Fath al-Baari, 9/70 \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    The answer to the question, How can the Qur’an be a miracle \n    for the unlettered non-Arabs who formed the majority of inhabitants of the \n    world at that time? is as follows:\n\n    it is known that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him) was sent among the Arabs, who were distinguished by their great \n    eloquence and beautiful style in speech, so Allah, may He be exalted, made \n    the miracle or sign of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) of the same nature of that by which his people were distinguished, so \n    that the miracle and challenge would be more effective, just as the sign of \n    Moosa (peace be upon him) was his staff or stick, with which he overcame the \n    deceit of the sorcerers, and the sign of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) was the \n    healing of those who had been born blind and of the lepers, because \n    knowledge of medicine was widespread at his time. \n\n    With regard to the non-Arabs, in the past and at present, and \n    how the Qur’an may be a miracle for them, and whether they were included in \n    its challenge, this may be explained from several angles: \n\n    -1-\n\n    Not all Arabs have great knowledge of the Arabic language and \n    its style and eloquence, just as not all non-Arabs are ignorant of the \n    Arabic language. Hence it is known that the miracle and the challenge is \n    addressed to all those who know Arabic, whether they learned it from birth, \n    like the Arabs, or they learned it later on, like the non-Arabs. Thus it is \n    clear that the case of the non-Arabs is like that of Arabs who have no \n    knowledge of their language. \n\n    Abu ‘Abdullah al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    If it is said: “With regard to reviving the dead, turning the \n    staff into a snake and other, similar miracles, they are very clear and no \n    one who observes that will have any doubt about it. It will be clear to all \n    rational people and no doubt will remain; rather they will all reach a \n    definitive conclusion after seeing that. But this is not the case with \n    regard to your Prophet’s claim of the miraculous nature of the Qur’an, \n    because not everyone will be able to understand its miraculous nature; \n    rather it is only you (Arabs) who can see that, and this applies only to \n    those Arabs who have a good command of the language, as you claim. As for \n    those who do not have a good command of the language, or non-Arabs who do \n    not understand Arabic, they will not understand its miraculous nature. If a \n    non-Arab is asked to speak a word of Arabic, he will not be able to do so, \n    so the fact that he is not able to do that, does not prove that what you are \n    challenging him with is true. Similarly, if an Arab who does not have a good \n    command of Arabic is asked to speak proper Arabic, he will not be able to do \n    so; therefore for him the Qur’an is not miraculous.” \n\n    The answer to that is: \n\n    We will explain, insha Allah, some aspects of its miraculous \n    nature, of which there are many, some of which can be understood by ordinary \n    people, town dwellers and desert dwellers alike, and these aspects are as \n    clear as turning the staff into a snake and raising the dead. If we assume, \n    for the sake of argument, that it is only miraculous with regard to its \n    eloquence and style, which is different to the style of the speech of \n    ordinary people, then we say that the miraculous nature of the Qur’an, \n    raising the dead and turning the staff into a snake are not going to be \n    understood equally or at the same time by rational people. Rather the one \n    who appreciates the miraculous nature of any miracle is the one who knows \n    how and why that thing is a miracle, as he knows that it is something that \n    cannot be achieved by human tricks and cannot be reached by discovering some \n    material with special characteristics. \n\n    It may not be far-fetched to say that a specious argument may \n    be developed in the mind of one who is ignorant of medicine or magic, which \n    prevents him from seeing the miracle; therefore he may say: Perhaps Moosa \n    had some extra knowledge of magic that the sorcerers did not know and had \n    never learned, and by the same token, perhaps ‘Eesa had found some stones \n    with special qualities or some other material with special qualities by \n    means of which he was able to achieve what he achieved. Such a specious \n    argument can only develop in the mind of one who is ignorant of medicine and \n    magic. As for the one who has any knowledge of medicine or magic, no such \n    confusion will arise in his mind, because he realises, on the basis of his \n    knowledge and experience, that the miracle performed by a prophet is \n    something that cannot be achieved by means of professional tricks or finding \n    some materials with special characteristics; rather it is a miracle that \n    happens by the will of the Creator of the universe, by means of which He \n    intended to give proof of the authenticity of the one who called people to \n    Him. Thus we conclude that understanding of the miraculous nature of raising \n    the dead and turning the staff into a snake was first reached by the \n    sorcerers and magicians, and it may not have been understood by many of the \n    fools who were ignorant of medicine and magic. The same may be said of the \n    miraculous nature of the Qur’an, without any differences: understanding of \n    it came to those who had knowledge of the Arabic language and would see, \n    based on their knowledge of Arabic, the difference between the Qur’an and \n    regular Arabic speech. Thus they would conclude that it was not within the \n    ability of the Arabs to say things in the same style. If the eloquent Arabs \n    and those who were well versed in Arabic were unable to match it, then \n    others are more unlikely to be able to do so. As we say, if the doctors are \n    unable to raise the dead and heal those who were born blind and lepers, \n    people other than doctors are more unlikely to be able to do so; and if the \n    sorcerers were unable to turn a stick into a snake, then people other than \n    sorcerers are more unlikely to be able to do so. \n\n    The statement that matching the Qur’an is something that the \n    Arabs are not able to do, and non-Arabs are not involved in this challenge, \n    is similar to saying that only doctors are unable to raise the dead, and \n    people other than doctors are not involved in this challenge, or saying that \n    only sorcerers are unable to turn a stick into a snake, and people other \n    than sorcerers are not involved in this challenge. As the challenge in the \n    other two cases (raising the dead and turning the stick into a snake) is \n    expected to be undertaken by those who have the relevant skills, the same \n    applies in the case of the Qur’an. Rather, in the case of the Qur’anic \n    miracle, it has aspects that we will discuss which everyone can understand, \n    whether he is a non-Arab or an Arab, a Magian or a Jew or Christian. We will \n    discuss it below, in sha Allah. \n\n    So we may conclude from what we have said that Muhammad \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought the Qur’an, challenged \n    people with it and it is a miracle, and anyone who brings a miracle and \n    challenges others with it is truthful. Therefore the certain conclusion is \n    that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is true. \n\n    Al-I‘laam bima fi Deen an-Nasaarah min al-Fasaad \n    wa’l-Awhaam wa Izhaar Mahaasin al-Islam, p. 326 \n\n    -2-\n\n    Some of the scholars said that the miracle in the Book of \n    Allah, may He be exalted, is not only in the wording, but also the meanings, \n    the sequence of meanings and the way in which ideas are presented. So the \n    miracle and challenge for the Arabs has to do with the style, and for others \n    it has to do with the fact that no one among the speakers of any other \n    language is able to come up with something similar to the Qur’an in any \n    other language. \n\n    Al-Jassaas (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The words of Allah, may He be exalted, (interpretation of the \n    meaning): “Say: ‘If mankind and \n    the jinns were together to produce the like of this Qur’an, they could not \n    produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another’” \n    [al-Isra’ 17:88] prove the miraculous nature of \n    the Qur’an. Some people say that its miracle is in the wording and style on \n    the one hand, and in the meanings and the sequence in which ideas are \n    presented, on the other hand. They quote as evidence for that the fact that \n    in this verse the Qur’an challenges both the Arabs and the non-Arabs, the \n    jinn and humans. It is well-known that the non-Arabs could not be challenged \n    on the aspect of the wording and style, therefore the challenge for them \n    should have to do with the meanings and the sequence in which ideas are \n    presented. \n\n    Some of the scholars insist that its miraculous nature is \n    limited to its style and eloquence of expression. They say: The miraculous \n    nature of the Qur’an has many aspects: its beautiful style, its eloquent and \n    concise wording, the way in which it combines many meanings in few words, in \n    addition to the fact that it is completely free of any words that sound \n    ineloquent or any ideas or meanings that are out of place, as well as being \n    free of any contradictions. All of it, from beginning to end, is consistent, \n    as described above. The words of people, on the other hand, especially if \n    they speak at length, cannot be free of cheap words, corrupt meanings and \n    contradictions. What we have mentioned of the flaws in people’s speech are \n    present in the speech of people of all languages; it does not apply only to \n    those who speak Arabic. Thus it is possible that the challenge of the Qur’an \n    may be applicable to the non-Arabs in that way: challenging them to bring \n    something that is free of the faults and flaws referred to above, because \n    saying things in an eloquent manner is not something that is limited only to \n    Arabic, to the exclusion of other languages, even though the Arabic language \n    is the most eloquent. We know that the Qur’an is the pinnacle of eloquence, \n    so it is possible that the challenge to the non-Arabs is by way of \n    challenging them to produce words at the highest level of eloquence in their \n    own languages. \n\n    Ahkaam al-Qur’an, 5/34, 35 \n\n    -3-\n\n    There are many aspects to the miraculous nature of the Book \n    of Allah; it is not limited to style and eloquence only. Hence some of the \n    scholars said that the miraculous nature of the Book of Allah which all \n    people, not only the Arabs, may understand, and that Allah’s challenge to \n    produce something like it, is only applicable to these aspects. Hence Allah \n    issued this challenge to the jinn as well as to mankind, to produce \n    something like this Qur’an. One of these aspects is that it foretold events \n    that would happen and foretold the time at which they would happen, for \n    example. \n\n    Abu ‘Abdullah al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    … The third aspect of the miraculous nature of the Qur’an is \n    what it includes of news of the future before any human even knew anything \n    about it, and foretelling events before they happened. This is something \n    that cannot be known except via the truthful ones who are conveying from \n    Allah, may He be exalted. We will refer to some events just to prove this \n    point in brief, with no need for a lengthy discussion. \n\n    For example, Allah, may He be exalted, said (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\n\n    “Certainly, you \n    shall enter Al-Masjid al-Haram; if Allah wills, secure, (some) having your \n    heads shaved, and (some) having your hair cut short, having no fear”\n\n    [Al-Fath 48:27]. \n\n    This verse is one of the clearest miracles of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, \n    promised him that He would cause him to enter al-Masjid al-Haraam, him and \n    his people, in safety, and that He would grant them the conquest of Makkah \n    in the best state. They kept waiting for that until its time came and Allah \n    fulfilled His promise. Then they entered it as He had promised, and \n    conquered it as they had been foretold. \n\n    Al-I‘laam bima fi Deen an-Nasaarah min al-Fasaad \n    wa’l-Awhaam wa Izhaar Mahaasin al-Islam, p. 337 \n\n    There are other opinions too, but what we have quoted above \n    is sufficient, and it is the strongest view concerning this matter. \n\n    To sum up: the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) was an Arab and the Qur’an is Arabic. He was sent to eloquent, \n    well-spoken Arabs, hence his greatest miracle was the Book of Allah, may He \n    be exalted. They were unable to match its wording, phrases, style and \n    eloquence. Thus the rational people among the eloquent and well-spoken \n    realised that this was not the words of a human being, hence they believed. \n\n    As for those Arabs who were not eloquent or well spoken, and \n    the non-Arabs, what is to be mentioned to them is the meanings and rulings \n    of the Qur’an, and those aspects of its miraculous nature that they are able \n    to understand. Thus they may develop conviction based on the knowledge and \n    understanding that this is not the words of a human being. Hence many of the \n    non-Arabs became Muslim because of coming across the meaning of a verse. In \n    such cases, this non-Arab could not understand its eloquence and style, but \n    its meaning is the reason why he became Muslim. Many such stories have been \n    passed down by numerous narrators, and in our own time there are many more. \n    Those people only became Muslim after they learned what there is in these \n    verses that no human being could have produced, and that at the time of the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) there was no technology \n    and no scientific discoveries that could enable him to tell people about \n    these matters. Thus they accepted that this was revelation from heaven, so \n    they became Muslim. Hence we can see the extent to which the hadeeth the \n    questioner referred to is applicable to real facts. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Qur’an can be considered a miracle for non-Arabic speakers, despite its original revelation in Arabic, for several key reasons rooted in its content, universality, linguistic depth, and transformative power. Below, I will discuss these aspects and support them with relevant verses from the Qur’an.\n\n### 1. Linguistic and Literary Excellence\n\nThe Qur’an is recognized for its unmatched linguistic style and eloquence. Even if one does not understand the Arabic language, the form, rhythm, and structure of the Qur’an have been said to possess a quality that can lead to a profound emotional response when recited or heard. The challenge of producing a text comparable to it serves as a continuous testament to its divine nature.\n\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:88)**: \"Say: 'Surely, if men and jinn get together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they will not be able to produce the like of it, even if they assisted one another.'\" This verse emphasizes the challenge posed by the Qur'an that transcends language barriers, highlighting its inimitability.\n\n### 2. Universal Themes and Message\n\nThe Qur’an addresses universal themes such as justice, morality, compassion, and guidance for personal conduct and social behavior. Its teachings resonate with human experiences across cultures and societies, inviting reflection and contemplation regardless of linguistic background.\n\n- **Surah Ar-Ra'd (13:27)**: \"Those who believe and find peace in their hearts from the contemplation of God: Surely there is peace of heart in the contemplation of God!\" This reveals the Qur’an's ability to connect with the core of human nature, promoting peace and introspection.\n\n### 3. Accessibility through Translations and Interpretations\n\nThe Qur’an has been translated into many languages, allowing non-Arabic speakers to approach its teachings. While translations are not substitutes for the original Arabic, they facilitate initial engagement with its contents and themes.\n\n- **Surah Al-Qamar (54:40)**: \"Easy have We made the Qur'an to understand: So is there any one who will be warned?\" This illustrates God’s intent for the message to be accessible and comprehensible to everyone, encouraging all to seek guidance.\n\n### 4. Spiritual and Moral Transformations\n\nMany accounts exist of individuals converting to Islam or experiencing significant transformations upon engaging with the Qur’an, even if they approached it through translations or oral recitations. Their testimonies often reflect a profound connection to divine wisdom, irrespective of their fluency in Arabic.\n\n- **Surah Al-Anbya (21:3)**: \"Their minds are lost in frivolous pastimes… Yet they say: 'These are only confused dreams,' or rather: 'He has invented them.'\" This suggests that individuals, regardless of language, may frequently overlook the depth of the message due to preconceived notions, yet many overcome this barrier through sincere exploration.\n\n### 5. The Role of Faith and Intent\n\nUltimately, understanding the Qur’an requires an open heart and a sincere intention to seek truth. The Qur’an acknowledges that divine guidance is bestowed upon those who truly seek it, irrespective of their linguistic capabilities.\n\n- **Surah Ar-Ra'd (13:11)**: \"Verily God does not change the state of a people till they change themselves.\" This verse emphasizes the personal journey of seeking and the internal changes required to comprehend the divine message.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the Qur'an is revealed in Arabic, its essence, themes, and call to humanity transcend linguistic barriers. The literary excellence, universal moral teachings, accessibility through translations, transformative effects on individuals, and the emphasis on sincere search for guidance show how the Qur'an serves as a miracle for everyone, regardless of their native language. The profound impacts it has on individuals, coupled with the acknowledgment from the text itself about divine accessibility, support the Qur’an's status as a miraculous guidance for humanity."

        "question": "Ruling on learning recitation and tajweed of Qur’an by means of an electronic pen",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    There is no kind of bid‘ah (innovation) in the program \n    mentioned, in sha Allah, because this is a new educational means in which \n    there is nothing contrary to Islam, that helps one learn how to read Qur’an \n    correctly and helps one to memorise it and understand its meanings. \n\n    This is like using computers, modern recording devices, \n    videos and so on to record and broadcast lectures and the like. Such things \n    do not come under the heading of bid‘ah. \n\n    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n    Bid‘ah means worshipping Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in ways \n    other than what He has prescribed. Based on that, innovation does not \n    include anything other than acts of worship. Rather, newly developed or \n    introduced worldly matters may be examined to see whether they are halaal or \n    haraam, but it cannot be said that they are bid‘ah. … Based on that, what \n    people have introduced nowadays of things that are used to help in matters \n    of worship cannot be said to be bid‘ah even if they did not exist (at the \n    time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)). That \n    includes loudspeakers. Loudspeakers did not exist at the time of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); rather they were introduced \n    recently, but they serve a religious purpose, as they convey to the people \n    the prayer, recitation and khutbah of the imam. The same applies to \n    organising lectures, as they achieve good and serve the interests of the \n    people, so they are good. Therefore buying loudspeakers for the mosque for \n    this purpose is something that is prescribed, for which a person will be \n    rewarded.\n\n    End quote from Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, 2/426 \n\n    Please see also the answer to question no.\n    3175 and\n    95430\n\n    Secondly: \n\n    In the answer to question no.\n    88728 and\n    112763 we have stated that \n    listening attentively to recitation of the Qur’an outside of prayer, whether \n    it is recitation from a reciter or via a recorder, is not obligatory, \n    although it is mustahabb and prescribed. \n\n    There is nothing wrong with repeating after the reciter in \n    order to perfect one’s recitation or to review when memorising. Using this \n    electronic pen to help you to memorise, perfect your recitation, correct \n    mistakes and learn about the commentary on the verses is something \n    praiseworthy; there is nothing wrong with it in sha Allah. \n\n    Thirdly:\n\n    With regard to reward, listening to recitation from a machine \n    is not like listening directly to the reciter, as we have explained \n    previously in the answer to question no.\n    112763 \n\n    Similarly, listening is not like reciting; rather reciting it \n    is better than listening. However, varying between prescribed acts of \n    worship is a good thing and is something required, and it is better than not \n    doing some of them all of the time. \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allah have mercy on him) \n    said: \n\n    A person will be rewarded for his good intention and for \n    listening to recitation of the Qur’an, commentaries thereon and Prophetic \n    hadeeths, whether that is from the lips of a reciter or from a recorded \n    voice on the radio or otherwise, although the basic principle with regard to \n    listening to the recitation of the Qur’an, that was narrated from the early \n    generations, is that it should be listening to the voice of the reciter \n    himself, without any intermediary. And if a person recites Qur’an himself, \n    pondering the meaning and with humble focus of mind, that is better and \n    greater in reward. \n\n    End quote from Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, \n    13/81 \n\n    Reciting whilst listening to tajweed of the Qur’an and \n    correcting mistakes is better than mere recitation in which the reciter \n    makes mistakes, because correct recitation with tajweed is better than \n    recitation without tajweed and that in which there are mistakes. \n\n    That applies to the one who does not know how to recite \n    properly with tajweed. \n\n    But if you do not know how to recite Qur’an well, then \n    reciting Qur’an with tajweed, following a reciter who recites with tajweed \n    by means of the electronic pen, is better than simply reading Qur’an and \n    making some mistakes and not reciting with tajweed. But for one who knows \n    how to recite well with tajweed, it is better for him to stick to reciting \n    from the Mushaf or reciting from memory, if he has memorised it, because \n    this is the basic principle – to recite Qur’an without combining it with \n    listening – because this is how it was done by the early generations, the \n    imams, and the people after them. And because that helps the reciter to \n    achieve proper focus and ponder the meanings. But sometimes it is prescribed \n    for him to focus on listening to recitation from someone else, especially if \n    that person recites well and it will be of greater benefit to him.  \n\n    However, there is no limit to the bounty of Allah and the \n    blessings He bestows upon His slaves. But the recitation of one who is \n    skilled in recitation is better than the recitation of someone else. If a \n    person strives hard to learn properly and memorise, although that is \n    difficult for him, Allah that will reward him for that and will make up for \n    his shortcomings, as al-Bukhaari (4937) and Muslim (798) narrated that \n    ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) said: “The one who is skilled in reciting Qur’aan will be with the \n    noble, honourable scribes and the one who recites Qur’aan and falters \n    therein, and finds it difficult, will have a double reward.” \n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The one who is skilled is the one who has memorised it \n    precisely, and he does not falter or find it difficult to recite because he \n    has memorised it properly. As for the one who falters therein, he is the one \n    who falters in his recitation because he does not have a good memory. He \n    will have a double reward: a reward for reciting and a reward for faltering \n    in his recitation and the difficulty he encounters. Al-Qaadi and other \n    scholars said: It does not mean that the one who falters there in will have \n    a greater reward than the one who recites with skill; rather the one who \n    recites skilfully will have a better and greater reward, because he will be \n    with the noble, honourable scribes and he will have many rewards, and this \n    status is not mentioned for anyone else, so how can the one who did not make \n    the effort to learn the Book of Allah properly and memorise it, perfect his \n    knowledge of it and recite it be like one who made that effort until he \n    became proficient in it. End quote. \n\n    To sum up: \n\n    As you do not recite well with tajweed and you sometimes make \n    mistakes in recitation, and this pen helps you to correct your mistakes and \n    recite well, whilst also learning the meaning, then your following this \n    program is something good and is Islamically prescribed; there is no bid‘ah \n    in it, in sha Allah. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Ruling on Learning Recitation and Tajweed of the Qur’an by Means of an Electronic Pen\n\nLearning to recite the Qur’an (Qira'at) and mastering Tajweed (the art of reciting the Qur’an correctly) are essential components of engaging with the sacred text in Islam. The Qur'an, according to Islamic teachings, is meant to be recited and understood correctly, which elevates its spiritual quality and ensures that its meanings are conveyed accurately. \n\n### Use of Technology in Learning\n\nIn today’s landscape, the advent of technology has opened new avenues for learning. An electronic pen that reads or recites Qur'anic texts as one touches it on a page provides a means of learning that could be beneficial for many, especially for beginners or those who have difficulty accessing traditional learning methods. The use of such devices does not contravene any essential principles of Islamic learning, provided their use is aimed at enhancing understanding and performance in recitation.\n\n#### Supporting Views with Qur’anic Verses\n\n1. **Significance of the Pen**: The Qur'an itself emphasizes the importance of writing and reading in Surah Al-Qalam (The Pen):\n\n    - **Surah Al-Qalam (68:1-5)**:\n      > “Nun. *By the pen and what they inscribe*, You are not, by the favor of your Lord, a madman.

And indeed, you are of a great moral character.” \n\n   This verse highlights the significance of the pen and writing, suggesting that learning and recitation through written means, including digital innovation, can be a valuable tool for education.\n\n2. **Ease of Learning**: Another relevant aspect is the ease of recitation encouraged in the Qur'an itself, where God commands Muslims to recite the Qur'an at a comfortable and digestible pace. \n\n    - **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:2-6)**:\n      > “Stand to pray at night, except for a little, half of it, or a little less, or a little more; and recite the Qur'an in a measured tone.”\n\n   This indicates that God understands the varying capacities of individuals to engage with the Qur'an, thus making allowances for different methods of learning.\n\n3. **Responsibility of Recitation**: Additionally, the Qur'an shows that God is responsible for its preservation and recitation:\n\n    - **Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:17-19)**:\n      > “Indeed, upon Us is its collection and its recitation. So when We have recited it, then follow its recitation.”\n\n   This indicates that the method of recitation can be adapted as long as it aligns with the intent of learning and preservation of the text.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nBased on the above verses and principles, learning the recitation of the Qur'an through an electronic pen is permissible within the Islamic framework. It serves as a modern method to facilitate understanding and adherence to Tajweed rules, vital for correct recitation. It promotes accessibility and can significantly enhance one’s ability to learn and engage with the Qur'an more substantively.\n\nThus, while the traditional methods of learning Qur'anic recitation remain paramount, using electronic tools such as an electronic pen to aid this process is compatible with Islamic principles, provided that the focus remains on ensuring proper understanding and recitation of the Qur'an."

        "question": "Ruling on tankees or altering the order of verses when memorising Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Tankees or altering the order of verses when reciting is haram, whether that is during prayer or otherwise. \nIt says in Asna’l-Mataalib (1/63): It is haram to switch the order of verses when reciting, because that undermines the miraculous nature of the text and it ignores the wisdom behind the order in which the verses appear. End quote. \nIt says in Haashiyat ad-Dasooqi (1/242): Switching the order of soorahs is makrooh, and switching the order of consecutive verses in one rak‘ah is haram and invalidates the prayer, because it distorts it. End quote. \nIt says in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (1/343): It is makrooh to switch the order of soorahs, such as reciting al-Inshiraah (94), then reciting ad-Duha (93) after it, whether that is in one or two rak‘ahs, because of the report narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood, according to which he was asked about someone who recited Quran in the wrong order. He said: His heart is disordered. Abu ‘Ubayd explained that as referring to when a person recites one soorah, then after it he recites another that comes before it in the order (of soorahs in the Mushaf). This was mentioned by Ibn Nasrullah in ash-Sharh as being similar to the case with verses, that is, a similar ruling of it being makrooh applies in the case of switching the order of the verses. It says in al-Furoo‘ that there is consensus on this point. Ibn Nasrullah said: If it was said that it is haram to switch the order of verses, that would be a valid opinion. The evidence for it being only makrooh is not clear, and using as evidence the way the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) learned it is subject to further discussion, because that was due to need, as the Quran was revealed according to events. Shaykh [Ibn Taymiyah] said: Following the order of verses is obligatory, because the order in which they appear is based on clear instructions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), according to scholarly consensus. End quote. \nBut if the switching of the order occurs when memorising, not when reciting or asking someone to listen so as to check one’s memorisation, there is nothing wrong with that. So one may begin by memorising the fifth verse, for example, then the fourth, then when one wants to recite them, one recites the fourth verse and then the fifth, without switching the order. Then when he has memorised the third, and he wants to recite what he had memorised, he should recite them in the proper order without switching it. So he should recite the third, then the fourth, then the fifth. There is nothing wrong with this; some teachers do it this way and think that it is the best way of memorising. \nTo sum up: It is not permissible to recite two consecutive verses in the wrong order, and it is not permissible to switch the order of words in one verse. \nFor more information please see the answer to question no. 7198  \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of \"tankees\" or altering the order of verses when memorizing the Quran touches upon the broader topic of the preservation and recitation of the Quran. The Quran, according to Islamic belief, must be recited in the order in which it was revealed and compiled. Here’s an exploration of the ruling on altering the order of verses, supported by relevant verses.\n\n### Importance of Ordered Recitation\n\n1. **Preservation of the Quran**: The Quran has been preserved in both its verbal and written forms since the time of its revelation. This is emphasized in Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:17-19), which states:\n   - **\"Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste. Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\"**\n   - (Surah Al-Qiyamah, 75:14-18)\n\n   This verse underlines the importance of adhering to the prescribed order when reciting the Quran.\n\n### Memorization and Recitation\n\n2. **Ease and Understanding**: Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:2-6) emphasizes the need for slow and deliberate recitation:\n   - **\"Keep watch all the night except some, a half of it or a little less or a little more, and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly. We shall soon entrust to you a message heavy (with solemnity).\"**\n   - (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:2-6)\n\n   This approach to recitation facilitates understanding and memorization. Each verse is designed to convey specific meanings in its given order.\n\n3. **Divine Support in Memorization**: Surah Al-A'la (87:6-10) emphasizes that God will assist in the memorization of the Quran in its proper form:\n   - **\"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, unless God may please. He knows the visible and knows what is hidden. We shall take you slowly towards ease.\"**\n   - (Surah Al-A'la, 87:6-10)\n\n   This reassurance indicates that successful memorization is tied to adhering to the intended sequence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn essence, altering the order of verses during memorization is not acceptable due to the divine guidance and preservation of the Quran. The verses above underscore the significance of maintaining the order during both recitation and memorization. The Quran is viewed as a cohesive text, and its meanings are often interconnected, relying on the arrangement established by revelation. Therefore, it is recommended for those memorizing the Quran to follow the methodical order prescribed without alteration.\n\nMany scholars of Quranic sciences advocate for sticking to the officially compiled order of the Quran while memorizing and reciting to preserve the integrity of its message and context.\n"

        "question": "Why There Is No Bismillah in Surah At-Tawbah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Reciting the Basmalah before reading the Quran\nPart of the etiquette of reciting the Quran is for the reciter to always say Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) at the beginning of every Surah, except Surah At-Tawbah.\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“He should always recite Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim at the beginning of every Surah except Surah Bara’ah (At-Tawbah), because the majority of scholars said that it is a verse wherever it is written in the Mushaf, and it was written at the beginning of all the Surahs except Surah At-Tawbah. If he recites it at the beginning of every Surah (other than At-Tawbah), then there is certainty that he had recited the entire Quran or Surah, and if he fails to recite the Basmalah, he has omitted part of the Quran according to the majority.” (At-Tibyan fi Adab Hamalat Al-Quran, 100.)\nBut if he recites from partway through a Surah, he does not have to recite the Basmalah and it is sufficient for him to seek refuge with Allah (by saying A‘udhu Billahi min ash-Shaytan ir-rijim (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed devil), but if he does say the Basmalah there is nothing wrong with that. \nWhy doesn’t Surah At-Tawbah start with Bislmillah?\nThe reason why the Basmalah does not appear at the beginning of Surah At-Tawbah is that the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did not write it at the beginning of this Surah in the Mushaf, following the example of the caliph `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him). At-Tirmidhi narrated in As-Sunan that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I said to `Uthman ibn `Affan: ‘What made you put Al-Anfal which is one of the Mathani, next to Bara’ah [At-Tawbah], which is one of the Mi’in? Why did you not put the line Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim in between them when you put it at the beginning of the rest of Al-Sab’ Al-Tiwal [the long seven Surahs]?” `Uthman said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to receive revelation of Surahs with many verses. When they were revealed, he would call his scribes and tell them, ‘Put these verses in the Surah where such-and-such is mentioned.’ Al-Anfal was one of the first Surahs to be revealed in Madinah, and Bara’ah (At-Tawbah) was one of the last parts of the Quran to be revealed. Its stories were similar to the stories mentioned in Al-Anfal, so it was thought that it was part of it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken [i.e., died] without explaining whether it was indeed part of it, so they were put next to one another, and the line Bismillahi ir-Rahman ir-Rahim was not written between them, and it [At-Tawbah] was put among the Sab’ Al-Tiwal [seven long Surahs].” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 4/225)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: … The correct opinion is that there is no Basmalah between it (Surah At-Tawbah) and Al-Anfal, because the Basmalah is a verse of the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, and if the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say to put the Basmalah between the two Surahs, they did not put it between them. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is the one who decided and said: Put the Basmalah, and he did not tell them to put the Basmalah between Surah Al-Anfal and Surah At-Tawbah, so they did not write it. But it remains to be said: if he did not give instructions to this effect, why is there a separation between it and Surah Al-Anfal? Why did they not make it one Surah? We say: Yes, they did not make it one Surah because they were uncertain as to whether it was the same Surah as Al-Anfal or they were two separate Surahs, so they said: Let us make a separation between the two Surahs and not write the Basmalah. This is the correct opinion concerning the absence of the Basmalah between Surah Al-Anfal and Surah At-Tawbah.\nEnd quote from Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, no. 18\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The absence of \"Bismillah\" (In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) at the beginning of Surah At-Tawbah (Chapter 9 of the Quran) is a topic that has been discussed by Islamic scholars and commentators throughout history. There are several reasons typically cited for this, which stem from the unique nature and context of this Surah.\n\n### 1. Nature of the Surah\nSurah At-Tawbah is often regarded as a declaration of war against the polytheists and a call to arms, focusing heavily on issues of fighting, hypocrisy, and the consequences facing wrongdoers. This stands in contrast to most other Surahs, which emphasize mercy and compassion.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah At-Tawbah, Ayah 1**: \"This is a declaration of immunity by Allah and His Messenger to those of the idolaters with whom you made a treaty.\" (9:1). The opening of the Surah signifies a break and a warning rather than an invocation of mercy, which aligns with its serious tone and content.\n\n### 2. The Context of Revelation\nAt the time this Surah was revealed, the circumstances around the Muslim community involved significant strife, conflict, and the need to address hypocritical behavior within the community. The Surah serves as a response to the opposition faced, particularly in the context of the Battle of Tabuk. The absence of \"Bismillah\" can be viewed as a reflection of the urgency and severity of addressing these issues.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah At-Tawbah, Ayah 86-90**: This passage discusses those who were reluctant to fight and preferred to stay behind, illustrating the tensions and serious subjects the Surah addresses (9:86-90), emphasizing the consequences of hypocrisy and disbelief.\n\n### 3. A Distinct Character\nSome scholars argue that the Surah possesses a distinct character as it transitions from addressing mercy (usually indicated with \"Bismillah\") to issuing commands regarding warfare and the behavior of believers. This shift in tone might be one reason for the omission.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah At-Tawbah, Ayah 84**: The instruction regarding those who have died in disbelief serves to clarify the stark reality faced by those who turn away from God and His Prophet (9:84).\n\n### 4. Theological Implication\nThe absence of \"Bismillah\" may serve a theological purpose to reinforce the consequences of ignoring God's commands and the gravity of the situation the community faced. It establishes the seriousness of the message being conveyed, which is not one of peace but of dire warning.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah At-Tawbah, Ayah 42-46**: The instruction given to the Prophet regarding those who seek excuses to not fight highlights the consequences of disbelief and the call to take firm action (9:42-46).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the absence of \"Bismillah\" at the beginning of Surah At-Tawbah can be attributed to the severe nature of the Surah, its context in addressing hypocrisy and warfare, and its distinct character that calls for a serious reflection on the issues faced by the Muslim community at the time. The verses suggest a need for clarity and declaration rather than an invocation of mercy, aligning with the overall tone and intention of the Surah."

        "question": "Revelation of the Quran: All at Once or Gradually?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Did the Quran come down all at once?\nThe issue mentioned has two aspects: on one there is consensus and the other is a matter in which there are differences of opinion. \nWith regard to the aspect on which there is consensus, it is that the Quran did not come down from Heaven to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) all at once; rather the Revelation came down to him from Allah piecemeal, according to events and circumstances. \nThere are verses which confirm this quite clearly with no confusion, and they affirm the wisdom behind its being revealed in this manner: \n1- Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And those who disbelieve say: Why is not the Quran revealed to him all at once? Thus (it is sent down in parts), that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages.” [25:32] \nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-S’adi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“That is because every time something of the Quran was revealed to him, it increased his certainty and steadfastness, especially when there was cause for anxiety. The fact that the Quran was revealed when new developments occurred meant that it had greater impact and was more reassuring to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). And that was more effective than if it had been revealed before that, then was remembered when the new developments occurred.  \n“And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages,” means We revealed it slowly and sent it gradually. All of this indicates that Allah was taking care of His Book, the Quran, and His Messenger, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as He sent down His Book in accordance with the situations faced by the Messenger and as needed to address unfolding issues.” (Tafsir as-S’adi)\n2- Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning) says:\n“And (it is) a Quran which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages.” [17:106] \nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-S’adi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“At intervals” means at an easy pace, so that they might ponder it and think about its meanings, and derive knowledge from it. \n“And We have revealed it by stages,” means: bit by bit, piecemeal over twenty-three years.” (Tafsir as- S’adi)\nThe Quran was revealed piecemeal \nWhat confirms the fact that the Quran was revealed piecemeal is the suspension of the Revelation concerning the slander incident (al-ifk), in which ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was accused of adultery. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was waiting for Quranic verses to be revealed, because of the enormity of the calamity and the accusation that was made against his wife, until the words of Allah were revealed (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily! Those who brought forth the slander (against ‘Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) are a group among you. Consider it not a bad thing for you. Nay, it is good for you. Unto every man among them will be paid that which he had earned of the sin, and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be a great torment.” [24:11] \nAnother confirmation that the Quran was revealed piecemeal is the first few verses of Surah ‘Abasa which were revealed when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned away from teaching the blind man Ibn Umm Maktum  (may Allah be pleased with him) in the hope that the leaders of Quraysh would become Muslim (as he was already talking to the leaders of Quraysh and the blind mind man came to him in the middle of the conversation). \nHow was the start of the revelation of the Quran?\nWith regard to that concerning which there is a difference of opinion, it has to do with the start of the revelation of the Quran . Was it sent down all at once to the first heaven, then brought down to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) piecemeal, or was it all brought down in the same manner, piecemeal according to events, as stated above? \nThe reason for this difference of opinion is differences in understanding some verses which indicate that the Quran came down at a particular time, such as the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong).” [2:185]\n“Verily! We have sent it (this Quran) down on the night of Al-Qadr (Decree).” [97:1]\nAnd Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) clearly stated this understanding. \nThe scholars differed concerning this sending down; there are several opinions, the most well-known of which are two: \n1- The view of the majority is that the Quran was sent down from al-Lawh al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet) to the first heaven on Laylat al-Qadr (the night of Decree) all at once, then after that it was sent down in stages over twenty-three years. \nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas  (may Allah be pleased with him) said, concerning the verse “Verily! We have sent it (this Quran) down on the night of Al-Qadr (Decree).” The Quran was sent down all at once on Laylat al-Qadr, then Allah sent it down to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bit by bit. “And those who disbelieve say: Why is not the Quran revealed to him all at once? Thus (it is sent down in parts), that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages.” [25:32]. [an-Nasai]\n2- The second opinion is that the revelation of the Quran began on Laylat al-Qadr, then after that it was revealed in stages at various times, according to the unfolding of events and what the people needed. This is the view of the great Tabi‘i (Successor) ash-Sh’abi. \nThis difference of opinion – as you can see – does not have any real impact on the reality of the revelation of the Quran in stages to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It has been said that the reason for this revelation (being sent down all at once to the first heaven) was to highlight the nobility and great status of the Quran in the upper realm (the heavens). \nBadr ad-Din az-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“If it is asked: what is the reason for the Quran being sent down to the first heaven all at once? The answer is to highlight its high status and the high status of the one to whom it was revealed. That was so as to announce to the inhabitants of the seven heavens that this was the last of the Books that was being sent down to the last of the Messengers and to the noblest of the nations.” (Al-Burhan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran)\nHow was the Quran conveyed to Prophet Muhammad?\nThe Angel of Revelation who brought it down to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Jibril (peace be upon him), only heard it from the Lord of Glory, may He be exalted, then he passed it on to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so he heard it with his ears and his heart understood it. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And verily, you (O Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) are receiving the Quran from the One, All-Wise, All-Knowing.” [27:6]\n“And if you do not bring them a miracle (according to their (i.e. Quraysh-pagans) proposal), they say: Why have you not brought it? Say: I but follow what is revealed to me from my Lord.” [7: 203] \n‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah speaks via revelation, the people of heaven hear from heaven a clanging like a chain dragged across a rock and they swoon, then they remain like that until Jibril (peace be upon him) comes to them. When he comes to them, they recover and say: O Jibril, what did your Lord say? He says: The truth, and they say: The truth, the truth.” [Abu Dawud]\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The fact that it – the Quran – is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz and in pure pages in the hands of the angels does not contradict the idea that Jibril (peace be upon him) brought it down from Allah, whether Allah wrote it down before sending Jibril (peace be upon him) with it or after that. And if He sent it down written to Bayt al-‘Izzah (in the first heaven) in one go on Laylat al-Qadr, then He had written it all before sending it down. … If anyone says that Jibril (peace be upon him) took the Quran from the Book and did not hear it from Allah, this is false for a number of reasons – which the author then listed.” (Majmu‘ al-Fatawa) \nWe hope that this is sufficiently clear and we hope that you will remain in contact with us if you have any further questions about this matter or if you need to ask more questions about any matter of our religion. We ask Allah to help you and guide you to that which is in your best interests in this world and in the Hereafter. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The revelation of the Quran is a significant aspect of Islamic belief, and it is understood to have been revealed gradually over a period of approximately 23 years. This gradual process of revelation allowed the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the early Muslims to absorb the teachings, contextualize them within their lived experiences, and apply them in their daily lives.\n\n### Gradual Revelation Explained\n\n1. **Response to Questions and Situations**:\n   The gradual revelation of the Quran is highlighted in Surah Al-Furqan (Chapter 25, Verse 32-36), where the Quran addresses the skepticism of the unbelievers who questioned why the entire Quran wasn't revealed all at once. The verse states:\n   > \"The unbelievers say: 'Why was the whole Qur'an not sent down all at once to him?' It was sent thus that We may keep your heart resolute. So We enunciated it by steps and distinctly.\"  \n   *(Surah Al-Furqan, Ayah 32-33)*\n\n   This indicates that the Quran was revealed in a manner that aligned with the unfolding events in the life of the Prophet, helping to strengthen his resolve and provide guidance for challenges present at that time.\n\n2. **Contextual Guidance**:\n   The process of revealing verses as circumstances arose allowed believers to get answers to specific issues or concerns as they navigated the complexities of their new faith. Surah Al-Isra (Chapter 17, Verse 85) emphasizes the limited knowledge humans possess regarding revelation, as it is at the discretion of Allah:\n   > \"They ask you about revelation. Say, revelation is by the command of your Lord, and that you have been given but little knowledge.\"  \n   *(Surah Al-Isra, Ayah 85)*\n\n3. **Aids to Memorization and Implementation**:\n   The incremental unveiling of the Quran also facilitated memorization and understanding for early believers. Surah Al-A'la (Chapter 87, Verse 6) reflects this, stating:\n   > \"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, unless God may please.\"  \n   *(Surah Al-A'la, Ayah 6)*\n\n   This shows that the teaching method was designed for progressive learning, helping the followers of the Messenger to grasp the messages deeply and integrate them into their lives.\n\n4. **Evidence of Divine Wisdom**:\n   The gradual nature of the Quran's revelation is also supported by Surah Al-Ra'd (Chapter 13, Verse 37-41), which describes the Quran as clear guidance:\n   > \"That is how We have sent down this (Qur'an) as a code of clear judgement.\"  \n   *(Surah Al-Ra'd, Ayah 37)* \n\n   This verse showcases that the Quran's gradual unveiling was also a means by which God established His laws and wisdom over time.\n\n5. **The Importance of Recollection and Reflection**:\n   Surah Al-Muzzammil (Chapter 73, Verse 20) advises believers to engage with the Quran according to their capacity:\n   > \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily, and be firm in devotion...\"  \n   *(Surah Al-Muzzammil, Ayah 20)*\n\n   This verse emphasizes that the communication of the Quran was designed to fit into the varying abilities and circumstances of individuals, fostering a deeper connection with the text.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the Quran was revealed gradually to facilitate understanding, reflection, and implementation in the lives of its early followers. Through this process, believers could engage with divine guidance in real-time, adapting to the teachings and applying them contextually. The cited verses collectively illustrate the wisdom behind this gradual approach, making the revelation accessible and meaningful for all who seek it."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Muslims did not disagree that Allah, may He be exalted, has preserved His Book from additions and subtractions, in fulfilment of His words (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily We: It is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]. \nThe Muslims are unanimously agreed that anyone who disagrees with this and claims that there is something in the Book of Allah that is not part of it, or that something that Allah revealed has been taken away from it, is a disbeliever. \nAl-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe Muslims are unanimously agreed that the Quran which is recited in all parts of the world and is written in the Mushaf that the Muslims have, that is contained between the two covers, from the first soorah “All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists)” to the last soorah, “Say: \"I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of mankind”, is the Book of Allah and His Revelation that He sent down to His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and that everything in it is true, and that anyone who deliberately takes away a single letter from it or changes one letter for another or adds a letter to it, that is not included in the Mushaf on which there is consensus, and there is consensus that it is not part of the Quran – the one who does any of these things deliberately is a disbeliever.

As for the words of Allah in Soorat an-Naml, “Verily! It is from Sulaiman (Solomon), and verily! It (reads): In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful” [an-Naml 27:30], this is a verse of the Quran according to scholarly consensus. \nWith regard to Soorah Baraa’ah (at-Tawbah), the Basmalah is not a verse thereof, according to scholarly consensus. But there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning other cases. Some of these scholars of Usool stated that the Basmalah is not part of the Quran, and some said that it is part of it in al-Faatihah only. And it was said that it is a verse at the beginning of every soorah. This is the view of ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him). \nOne of the best things that have been said concerning this matter, to reconcile between all the opinions, is that in some recitations, such as the recitation of Ibn Katheer, the Basmalah is a verse of the Quran, and in some other recitations it is not a verse, and there is nothing strange about that. \nIn the verse in Soorat al-Hadeed, “Fa inna Allaha huwa al-Ghaniy ul-Hameed (then Allah is Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all praise)” [al-Hadeed 57:24],  the word “huwa” is part of the Quran according to the recitations of Ibn Katheer, Abu ‘Amr, ‘Aasim, Hamzah, and al-Kasaa’i, and it is not part of the Quran according to the recitations of Naafi‘ and Ibn ‘Aamir, because they recited it “Fa inna Allaha al-Ghaniy al-Hameed”. And in some Mushafs the word “huwa” is present and in others it is not present. \nIn the passage “so wherever you turn yourselves or your faces there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne). Surely! Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures needs, All-Knowing. And they (Jews, Christians and pagans) say: Allah has begotten a son (children or offspring)” [al-Baqarah 2:115-116], the waw (in the phrase wa qaalu attakhadha Allahu waladan/and they say: Allah has begotten a son) is present in the recitation of the seven, except for Ibn ‘Aamir; according to the recitation of Ibn ‘Aamir it is not part of the Quran, because he recited it as “Qaalu attakhadha Allahu waladan (They say Allah has begotten a son)”, without the waw. So it is omitted in the Mushaf of the people of ash-Shaam (greater Syria), and there are other exaples. \nThus it is known that it does not matter whether the Basmalah is regarded as a verse in some recitations and not others. The scholars are agreed on this point.\nEnd quote from al-Madhkarah fi Usool al-Fiqh, p. 66, 67. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The discussion regarding whether the Basmalah (\"Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim\" – In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) is considered a verse of Surah Al-Fatihah (the Opening Chapter of the Qur'an) is indeed a topic of scholarly debate but is not categorized as a distortion of the Qur'an. This notion is rooted in the understanding of the Qur'an as an incorruptible text, free from any alterations or distortions.\n\n### Understanding the Basmalah\n\n1. **Scholarly Opinions**:\n   - There are different views among scholars regarding the status of the Basmalah in Al-Fatihah. Some scholars, such as the majority of scholars in the Hanafi and Maliki schools, consider it a verse of Al-Fatihah, while others, including most scholars of the Shafi'i school, consider it an introduction to the surah but not part of its verses.\n  \n2. **Evidence of Integrity**:\n   - The Qur'an is described as an unaltered text, and nothing false can enter it from any side. This notion of integrity is reinforced by verses such as:\n     - **Surah Fussilat (41:42-43)**: \"Falsehood cannot enter it from any side: It's a revelation from the all-wise and praiseworthy (God).\" This emphasizes that the intended meaning and structure of the Qur'an as it was revealed cannot be altered or distorted (41:42).\n     - **Surah Fussilat (41:46)**: \"Whoever does good does so for himself, and whoever does wrong bears the guilt thereof. Your Lord does no wrong to His creatures.\" This further suggests that the essence and teaching of the Qur'an remain pure and clear (41:46).\n\n3. **Clarity of Revelation**:\n   - The Qur'an is said to have been revealed distinctly, providing clarity and guidance. This is supported by:\n     - **Surah Fussilat (41:43)**: \"Nothing is said to you which had not been said to other apostles before you.\" This shows that the message of the Qur'an, including its structure and content, aligns with previous revelations (41:43).\n\n4. **Concerns About Interpretation**:\n   - It is further articulated that disagreements about the Qur'an arise out of rivalries or misunderstandings and when knowledge comes, divisions may occur:\n     - **Surah Ash-Shuraa (42:10)**: \"In whatever matter you disagree, the ultimate judgement rests with God.\" This indicates that while interpretations may vary, the truth of the Qur'an remains constant (42:10).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the difference of scholarly opinion regarding the Basmalah does not imply a distortion of the Qur'an, as the text itself is preserved and protected from any alteration. The integrity of the Qur'an as the final revelation is affirmed by numerous references within its own text, including the verses cited above from Surah Fussilat and other surahs which reflect its unaltered and clear nature. As Muslims, it is essential to approach the Qur'an with respect for its divine origin and to acknowledge that scholarly debates do not affect its core message."

The letter ta’ appears \n    at the beginning of ash-Shu‘ara’ (Soorah 26), “Ta Seen Meem”; and at the \n    beginning of an-Naml (Soorah 27), Ta’ Seen, and at the beginning of as-Qasas \n    (soorah 28).

        "predicted_answer": "The names \"Taha\" and \"Yaseen\" appear in the Quran and are often discussed in the context of their significance. However, it is important to clarify whether these names refer specifically to the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him).\n\n### Taha and Yaseen\n1. **Taha**: The term \"Taha\" is mentioned at the beginning of Surah Taha (Surah 20), which is one of the chapters of the Quran. The exact verse states: **\"TA HA. We have not sent down the Qur'an to you that you should be burdened,\"** (20:1). While this appears to be a disjointed letter abbreviation, it is not directly a name of the Prophet Muhammad but rather an invocation that precedes the message delivered in this Surah.\n\n2. **Yaseen**: Similarly, \"Yaseen\" is mentioned in Surah Yaseen (Surah 36), where the verse opens with the Arabic letters “Y.S.” (Ya-Sin), which again are interpreted as disjointed letters. The Surah includes themes centered on the message of prophethood and the oneness of God. The opening verse states: **\"Yaa Seen. By the wise Qur'an,\"** (36:1). Just like \"Taha,\" it is not a name of the Prophet Muhammad but serves a different purpose.\n\n### Significance and Interpretation\nThe use of such abbreviations can carry various interpretations, often understood in Islamic tradition as an acknowledgment of divine knowledge and the complexity of God’s message. Scholars have debated their precise meanings, but they are generally accepted as expressions that reflect the divine origin and authority of the Quran rather than personal identifiers for the Prophet.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile \"Taha\" and \"Yaseen\" are significant terms within the Quran and are notably linked with divine revelations, they do not serve as names for the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him). Instead, they represent the grandeur and authority of the Quran itself. The names \"Muhammad\" and \"Ahmad\" are the direct names of the Prophet (for example, “Muhammad” is mentioned explicitly in Surah Al-Imran, Ayah 144: **\"Muhammad is but a messenger...\"** 3:144).\n\n### References\n- Surah Taha (20:1): \"TA HA.

        "question": "Ruling on hanging Soorat al-Ikhlaas on the rear window of the car as a reminder",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    There is nothing wrong with hanging Qur’aanic verses for the \n    purpose of reminding and exhorting, so long as they are put in places that \n    are appropriate, such as the walls of meeting places and offices, in such a \n    way that the verses will not be exposed to disrespectful treatment. \n\n    In the case of hanging verses in car windows, there is the \n    fear that they may be exposed to disrespectful treatment and damage, so it \n    is better not to do that and to be content with some adhkaar or advice. \n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \n    There are some who say that hanging soorahs or verses of Qur’aan on the wall \n    is haraam. Please note that these verses or soorahs are only hung up because \n    of their virtues, such as Soorah Ya-Seen or Ayat al-Kursiy and so on. We \n    hope that you can explain the ruling on that; may Allah reward you with \n    good. \n\n    He replied: There is nothing wrong with hanging verses and \n    soorahs on the wall in offices and meeting places for the purpose of \n    providing and exhorting, according to the correct view. Some contemporary \n    scholars and others regarded it as makrooh, but there is nothing wrong with \n    that if it is done for the purpose of reminding and exhorting, and it is in \n    an appropriate place such as a meeting place or office and the like. (There \n    is also nothing wrong with) hanging a hadeeth of the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him). All of that is exhortations and reminders. But \n    if the aim behind it is something other than that, such as believing that \n    they offer protection from the jinn or the evil eye and so on, it is not \n    permissible to do this with that intention and that belief, because this is \n    not narrated in sharee‘ah and there is no basis for it.

        "predicted_answer": "The practice of hanging Soorat al-Ikhlaas (Surah 112) on the rear window of a car or in similar places as a reminder or for blessings has been a topic of discussion among scholars and the Muslim community. Surah al-Ikhlaas holds significant importance, as it emphasizes the oneness of Allah (Tawheed), which is the core belief in Islam. \n\nWhile there are no explicit verses in the Quran that specifically support or reject hanging texts from the Quran in such a manner, there are several principles that can be drawn from Islamic teachings regarding the respect of Quranic verses and the decorum of their placement. \n\n### Principles and Considerations\n\n1. **Respect for the Quran**: The Quran is regarded as the literal word of Allah, and Muslims are urged to treat it with utmost respect. This includes not placing it in locations where it could be disrespected or defiled. In Surah 24, Ayah 30-31, believers are urged to maintain their modesty and respect: \"Tell the believing men to lower their eyes and guard their private parts. There is for them goodness in this. God is aware of what they do....\" (Surah An-Nur 24:30-31). This implies that consideration should be given to how and where verses of the Quran are displayed.\n\n2. **Reminders of Faith**: The Quran encourages the act of reminding believers of their faith. In Surah 88, Ayah 21-25, it is stated: \"Remind them; you are surely a reminder...\" (Surah Al-Ghashiyah 88:21). This highlights the value of reminders in strengthening one’s faith and is an encouragement for believers to keep the teachings of Islam in their daily lives. Therefore, using Quranic verses as a reminder can be seen as a valid intent, as long as it is done respectfully.\n\n3. **Intention Matters**: In Islam, the intention behind an act is of great importance. If the intention behind hanging Soorat al-Ikhlaas is sincere—to remind oneself and others of Allah's Oneness—then it demonstrates a commitment to faith. This is echoed in the general principle found in Surah 2:225, \"Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:225), which indicates that intentions and actions must align with one's capability and understanding.\n\n4. **Avoiding Superstitious Practices**: While hanging Surah al-Ikhlaas may be perceived as seeking blessings and protection, it is critical to be wary of attributing any superstitious benefits to it. The Quran emphasizes reliance on Allah alone, as seen in Surah 23, Ayah 97-98: \"And say, 'My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the incitements of the devils. And I seek refuge in You, My Lord, lest they come near me.'\" (Surah Al-Mu’minun 23:97-98).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the act of hanging Soorat al-Ikhlaas may be permissible if performed respectfully and sincerely, with the intention of seeking reminders of one's faith. However, caution should be exercised against any potential misinterpretation or superstition that might arise from such a practice. It is always advisable to consult knowledgeable scholars for guidance on specific practices and culturally derived customs in Islam."

        "question": "Soorat al-Isra’ is also called Soorat Bani Isra’eel",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Soorat al-Isra’ is called Soorat Bani Israa’eel in two saheeh mawqoof hadeeths, in which it is the words of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them): \nThe first hadeeth was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him), who said concerning (the soorahs) Bani Israa’eel, al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta-Ha and al-Anbiya’: They are among the best and earliest and they are among the first I received.\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 4994 \nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘Itaaq (translated above as “best”) is the plural of ‘ateeq, which means ancient, or it may mean everything that reaches the utmost of excellence; the second meaning was preferred by a number of scholars in this hadeeth. \n“and they are among the first I received (tilaadi)” i.e., among that which I memorized a long time ago. Tilaad means long-standing possession; it is the opposite of taarif (recent acquisition). What Ibn Mas‘ood meant was that they were among the first soorahs he learned of the Qur’aan, and that they possess virtue because of what they contain of stories of the earlier Prophets and nations.\nEnd quote from Fath al-Baari, 8/388 \nThe second hadeeth was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used not to sleep until he had recited Bani Israa’eel and al-Zumar. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3402, who said: It is a hasan hadeeth. It was also classed as hasan by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Nataa’ij al-Afkaar, 3/65; and it was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. \nThe scholars said that this soorah was better known by the name Soorat Bani Isra’eel at the time of the Sahaabah and Taabi’een, because the first verse of Soorat al-Isra’ speaks of the Isra’ (Night Journey) to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, then in the second verse it starts to speak of an important stage in the story of Bani Isra’eel (the Children of Israel) and their mischief in the land, which is not mentioned in any of the stories of Bani Isra’eel anywhere else in the Qur’aan. That is in the passage where Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Glorified (and Exalted) is He (Allâh) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him]. Who took His slave (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid-al-Harâm (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid-al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in order that We might show him (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) of Our Ayât (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.). Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer\n2. And We gave Mûsa (Moses) the Scripture and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel (saying): ‘Take not other than Me as (your) Wakîl (Protector, Lord, or Disposer of your affairs).\n3. ‘O offspring of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nûh (Noah)! Verily, he was a grateful slave.’\n4. And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture, indeed you would do mischief in land twice and you will become tyrants and extremely arrogant!”\n[al-Isra’ 17:1-4]. \nAl-‘Allaamah al-Taahir ibn ‘Ashoor (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nIn many Mushafs it is called Soorat al-Isra’. Al-Aloosi stated that it is called by this name, because at the beginning it mentions the Isra’ (Night Journey) of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and that is the only place where it is mentioned. But at the time of the Sahaabah it was called Soorat Bani Israa’eel, the reason for that being that it mentions things about Bani Isra’eel that are not mentioned in other soorahs, namely their subjugation by those who were given to terrible warfare (cf. 17:4) -- the Assyrians; then their subjugation by another people -- namely the Romans. It is also called Soorat Subhaan, because it begins with this word.\nEnd quote from al-Tahreer wal-Tanweer, 15/5 \nSee also the answer to question no. 131664 \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Soorat al-Isra’, also known as Soorat Bani Isra’eel, is the 17th chapter of the Quran. This chapter holds significant importance for several reasons, which I will detail below alongside corresponding verses (ayahs) from the Quran.\n\n### 1. **Title and Meaning**\nThe surah is referred to as \"Al-Isra'\" which translates to \"The Night Journey\". The title reflects the miraculous night journey (Isra and Mi'raj) undertaken by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) from the Sacred Mosque in Makkah to the Farthest Mosque (Masjid Aqsa) and then to the heavens. This event is detailed in the very first ayah of the surah.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:1)**: \"Glory be to Him who took His Servant by night from Al-Masjid Al-Haram to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa, whose precincts We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing.\"\n\n### 2. **Discussion of the Children of Israel**\nThe surah extensively discusses the Children of Israel (Bani Isra’eel) and addresses their historical context, including warnings about their past actions and the consequences that followed.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:4-6)**: \"And We conveyed to the Children of Israel in the Scripture that, 'You will surely cause corruption on earth twice, and you will become exceedingly arrogant. So when the promise of the first of them came, We sent against you Our servants of great military might, and they probed even in the homes, and it was a promise fulfilled. Then We gave you back a chance against them and reinforced you with wealth and children...\"\n\n### 3. **The Nature of the Quran’s Revelation**\nThe chapter discusses how the Quran was revealed gradually over time, allowing people to understand and absorb its teachings. This gradual revelation was aimed at ensuring the message could be conveyed with clarity.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:106-108)**: \"And We have divided the Qur'an into parts that you may recite it to the people at intervals and We revealed it in stages. Say, 'Believe in it or do not believe. Indeed, those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall upon their faces in prostration and say, 'Exalted is our Lord! Indeed, the promise of our Lord has been fulfilled.'\"\n\n### 4. **Admonitions against Falsehood**\nThe surah emphasizes the truth of the Quran and the importance of adhering to its guidance as opposed to falsehood or disbelief.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:81)**: \"And say, 'Truth has come, and falsehood has vanished. Indeed, falsehood is bound to vanish.'\"\n\n### 5. **Encouragement for Prayer and Humility**\nThe chapter provides guidance regarding worship and the manner in which prayers should be performed, stressing moderation and humility.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:110)**: \"And say, 'Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever [name] you call - to Him belongs the best names.' And do not raise your voice in prayer, nor be silent therein but seek between that a way.\"\n\n### Conclusion\nSoorat Al-Isra’ serves not just as a narrative about the Children of Israel but also as a message for all believers regarding faith, obedience, humility, and the truth of divine guidance. The chapter’s title, \"The Night Journey,\" encapsulates a significant event in Islamic history while also invoking themes of worship and moral accountability. The revelations within underscore the importance of faith and the consequences of one's actions in both this life and the hereafter. \n\nFor those seeking a broader understanding, it is essential to read the entire surah, reflecting on its teachings and the context provided by its verses.\n\n### References\n- Surah Al-Isra (17), verses 1 to 111 (Quran)"

While there is no direct verse that explicitly states that one who memorizes the Qur'an along with the numbers of verses will have greater rewards compared to someone who does not, there are several verses and teachings that emphasize the importance of reciting, learning, and preserving the Qur'an.\n\n1. **The Importance of Recitation and Memorization**:\n   - In Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20), Allah encourages the believers to recite as much of the Qur'an as they can easily:\n     > \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily...\" (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20).\n     \n   This verse underscores that Allah recognizes the effort made by individuals in their recitation and memorization of the Qur'an.\n\n2. **Rewarding Good Deeds**:\n   - In Surah Al-Mu'minun (23:55-56), it is stated that those who live in awe of Allah, believe in His revelations, and give in His way will be rewarded. This implies that the act of memorizing the Qur'an, which is considered a form of good deed, will certainly be rewarded by Allah:\n     > \"Do they think that by increasing their wealth and children We are hastening to reward them for good deeds? No. They do not comprehend.\" (Surah Al-Mu'minun, 23:55).\n     > \"Surely those who live in awe of their Lord, Who believe in their Lord's revelations...\" (Surah Al-Mu'minun, 23:56).\n\n3. **The Significance of Good Actions**:\n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:261) describes the rewards for those who give in charity, likening their deeds to a grain that yields multiple grains, symbolizing the multiplication of rewards for good actions:\n     > \"The semblance of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is that of a grain of corn from which grow seven ears, each ear containing a hundred grains...\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:261).\n\n4. **The Reward for Knowledge**:\n   - There are numerous hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ) that elaborate on the significance of knowledge and learning, including the memorization of the Qur'an. A well-known hadith narrated by Abu Huraira states:\n     > \"The best of you are those who learn the Qur'an and teach it.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari).\n\n5. **Upholding God’s Word**:\n   - Chapter Al-Muddaththir (74:55-56) emphasizes that the Qur'an is a reminder and urges individuals to reflect on it and remember its teachings. This highlights the importance of both understanding and memorizing it for reinforcement of faith:\n     > \"This is a reminder...\" (Surah Al-Muddaththir, 74:55).\n   \nWhile the verses don't explicitly compare memorizing the Qur'an with knowing the number of its verses to those who do not, the overall context clearly emphasizes that those who engage with the Qur'an through memorization, recitation, and practice, are doing a commendable act that carries immense rewards. The essence of memorizing and understanding the Qur'an extends to making it a part of one's life, and those who undertake this journey are promised greater rewards in the Hereafter. Therefore, while memorizing the numbers of verses might not specifically increase rewards, the act of engaging deeply with the Qur'an is what is deemed most virtuous and valuable."

        "question": "One of the characteristics of Makkan verses is that they are addressed to all of mankind",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Firstly: \n\n    The call in the Holy Qur'aan, “O mankind” is mentioned in \n    twenty places in the Book: two in Soorat al-Baqarah, four in al-Nisa’, one \n    in al-A’raaf, four in Yoonus, four in al-Hajj, one in Luqmaan, three in \n    Faatir and one in al-Hujuraat. \n\n    The one who ponders all of these verses will find that they \n    are addressed to all of mankind, believers and disbelievers, righteous and \n    evildoers, calling them to think about that which will benefit them in the \n    Hereafter and reminding them of the Lordship of Allah over them and their \n    need for Him, so that this will motivate them to worship Him alone with no \n    partner or associate, and to devote their religious commitment sincerely to \n    Him alone. Because this is addressed to all of mankind, and is not limited \n    to any specific group, it is appropriate that it should say “O mankind” \n    rather than “O you who believe.” \n\n    That has nothing to do with mention of the Ka’bah, Makkah or \n    Hajj in particular; rather most of the soorahs mentioned above in which the \n    call, “O mankind” appears, do not mention anything about the Ka’bah, Makkah \n    or Hajj at all. We do not think that this call comes only when there is \n    mention of the Ka’bah or Makkah, to the exclusion of other Islamic duties. \n\n    Some scholars have mentioned, when discussing the difference \n    between Makkan and Madinan soorahs, that the words “O mankind” appear in the \n    Makkan soorahs and “O you who believe” appear in the Madinan soorahs. This \n    is what is usually the case. In Madinan soorahs such as al-Baqarah and al-Nisa’, \n    it says “O mankind” and in some of the Makkan soorahs such as al-Hajj, it \n    says “O you who believe.” \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    With regard to places in the Holy Qur'aan in which words \n    addressed in general to “mankind” appear in the context of Hajj and its \n    rituals, perhaps the reason for that is that Hajj was first enjoined with \n    the call of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) to all the people of Earth, \n    calling them to visit the sacred House of Allah and to perform the Hajj \n    rituals there. That appears in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\n\n    “And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will \n    come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep \n    and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform Hajj)”\n\n    [al-Hajj 22:27]. \n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    Meaning: give the call to mankind, calling them to come on \n    the pilgrimage to this House which We have commanded you to build. \n\n    It was narrated that he said: O Lord, how can I call mankind \n    when my voice will not reach them? It was said: Call, and it is for Us to \n    convey. So he stood on his Maqaam (station), or it was said on the Hijr, or \n    on al-Safa, or on Abu Qubays [a mountain beside the Ka’bah], and said: O \n    mankind, your Lord has established a House, so come on pilgrimage to it. It \n    was said that the mountains lowered themselves so that his voice could reach \n    all the corners of the earth, and those who were still in their mothers’ \n    wombs and fathers’ loins heard it, and everything that heard him of rocks, \n    plains and trees responded, as did those who Allah decreed would perform \n    Hajj until the Day of Resurrection, saying: Labbayk Allahumma labbayk. This \n    is a summary of what is narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid, ‘Ikrimah, \n    Sa’eed ibn Jubayr and others of the salaf. And Allaah knows best. \n\n    It was narrated by Ibn Jareer and Ibn Abi Haatim at length. \n    End quote. \n\n    Tafseer al-Qur’aan al-‘Azeem, \n    5/414 \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The characteristic of Makkan verses being addressed to all of mankind is prevalent throughout various verses in the Quran. Makkan verses primarily focus on fundamental concepts of faith, morality, and the universality of God's message, reinforcing that the teachings are not limited to a specific tribe or nation but are meant for all humankind.\n\n### Key Verses Supporting the Universal Message of Makkan Period\n\n1. **Surah Al-Ma'un (Chapter 107), Ayah 1-3:**\n   - **Verse:** \"Have you seen him who denies the Day of Judgment? It is he who pushes the orphan away, And does not induce others to feed the needy.\"\n   - **Reflection:** The address here questions humanity at large regarding their accountability, a fundamental aspect applicable to all people.\n   - **Source:** Surah 107:1-3 (Al-Ma'un), Ayahs 6198-6200.\n\n2. **Surah An-Nas (Chapter 114), Ayah 1-3:**\n   - **Verse:** \"Say: 'I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind, The King of mankind, The God of mankind.'\"\n   - **Reflection:** This verse highlights a direct appeal to \"mankind,\" emphasizing that the message is universal and inviting all to seek guidance from the one God.\n   - **Source:** Surah 114:1-3 (An-Nas), Ayahs 6231-6233.\n\n3. **Surah Al-A'raf (Chapter 7), Ayah 158:**\n   - **Verse:** \"Say, 'O mankind, indeed I am the messenger of Allah to you all...' \"\n   - **Reflection:** This verse explicitly identifies the Prophet Muhammad as a messenger sent to all of humanity, further illustrating the global reach of the message.\n   - **Source:** Surah 7:158 (Al-A'raf), Ayah 955.\n\n4. **Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), Ayah 21:**\n   - **Verse:** \"O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous.\"\n   - **Reflection:** This call is made to all people, urging them to recognize and worship the Creator, thus reinforcing the universal nature of the Quranic message.\n   - **Source:** Surah 2:21 (Al-Baqarah), Ayah 494.\n\n5. **Surah Al-Anfal (Chapter 8), Ayah 24:**\n   - **Verse:** \"O you who have believed, respond to Allah and to the Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life...\"\n   - **Reflection:** Although addressed to believers, the invitation to respond correlates to a broader audience implying everyone has a stake in the message of life.\n   - **Source:** Surah 8:24 (Al-Anfal), Ayah 659.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMakkan verses are characterized by their universal appeal and focus on fundamental themes of worship, accountability, and morality that transcend specific communities. This characteristic is evident through the various verses that address mankind collectively, inviting them to heed the message of Islam. The examples provided serve to support the claim that these verses are directed to all of humanity, not merely confined to the early followers in Mecca."

        "question": "Playing Qur'aan in the car from speakers next to the feet",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Listening to Qur'aan in the car is a righteous deed and a \n    beneficial act of worship. But having the speakers directly next to one's \n    feet in such a way that the sound of the Qur'aan is heard from below is \n    something that is not appropriate and you should limit it to the rear \n    speakers if you have any, or do something to change the position of the \n    speakers. \n\n    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was \n    asked: In some cars the speakers are level with the feet, and feet or shoes \n    may be placed on the speaker. My question is: when playing Qur'aan, is there \n    any disrespect to the Book of Allah in doing this? Is this comparable to \n    your fatwa against those who stretched out their feet in front of the Book \n    of Allah? We hope that you can advise us, may Allah preserve you. \n\n    He replied: If the speakers are beneath the feet as described \n    or are level with the feet, then you should not play Qur'aan, because the \n    fact that the Qur'aan is being heard from beneath a person’s feet is \n    undoubtedly a kind of disrespect towards the Qur'aan. If a person must \n    listen to Qur'aan, then he should lift the speakers above the level of his \n    feet. \n\n    End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, 57/13.",
        "predicted_answer": "Playing the Qur'an in the car, especially from speakers positioned near the feet, is a topic of discussion among Muslims regarding respect and etiquette towards reciting and listening to the Qur'an.\n\n### Respect for the Qur'an\n\n1. **A Place of Respect**: The Qur'an is considered the literal word of God in Islam, and hence it is treated with high respect. This includes the manner in which it is played, whether in a car or any other setting. The Qur'an should ideally be listened to attentively rather than placed in a position that might be considered disrespectful, such as near the feet.\n\n   - Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206) states: \n     > \"When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed. Meditate on your Lord inwardly with humility and trepidation, reciting His Book softly, morning and evening, and be not negligent. Verily those who are in the presence of your Lord are never too proud to worship and celebrate His praises, and bow in homage to Him.\"\n     (Surah Al-A'raf 7:204-206)\n\n2. **Attentiveness in Listening**: This emphasizes the need to listen with humility and respect, suggesting that the Qur'an should be treated in a way that reflects its importance. Playing it at a low volume and ensuring it’s not disturbed by other distracting noises or situations can maintain its sanctity.\n\n### Positioning the Qur'an\n\n3. **Avoiding Disrespectful Placement**: Positioning speakers near the feet could be seen as placing the Qur'an lower than it ought to be, thus potentially leading to a lack of reverence. The Qur'an is often kept in a higher place, such as on a shelf or in a dedicated place of honor.\n\n4. **Veiling and Understanding**: When reciting or listening to the Qur'an, the nature of how it’s presented is important. Surah Al-Isra (17:45-49) discusses the veiling that exists between the believers and non-believers—implying how deeply one engages with the Qur'an can influence understanding.\n\n   - Surah Al-Isra (17:45-49) states: \n     > \"When you recite the Qur'an, We place a hidden veil between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter; And We put covers over their hearts and deafness in their ears that they should not understand it.\"\n     (Surah Al-Isra 17:45)\n\n### Practical Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while playing the Qur'an in the car, it is essential to consider both the volume and the position of the speakers to maintain respect for the sacred text. Ensuring that it is played in a way that promotes attentiveness and reverence aligns with Islamic teachings on respecting the Qur'an. For believers, how one treats the Qur'an reflects their attitude towards the divine words it contains. It's advisable to place the speakers at a comfortable height that does not inadvertently indicate disrespect by placing them near the feet."

        "question": "Which is better -- reading Quran or listening to it on tapes?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Reading Quran and listening to it are both righteous deeds for which the Muslim will be rewarded. \nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sometimes liked to listen to Quran from other people. \nAl-Bukhaari (4582 and 5049) and Muslim (800) narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah upon him) said to me: “Recite the Quran to me.” I said: O Messenger of Allah, should I recite to you when it was revealed to you? He said: “I like to hear it from someone else.” So I recited al-Nisa’, and when I reached the verse, “How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad ) as a witness against these people?” [al-Nisa’ 4:41], I raised my head, or a man who was beside me nudged me and I raised my head, and I saw his tears flowing.. \nSo what is best is to do that which is in his best interests and will have the best effect on him, whether it is reading or listening, because the purpose of reading is to ponder and understand the meanings and act upon what is indicated by the Book of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember” [Saad 38:29]\n“Verily, this Quran guides to that which is most just and right” [al-Isra’ 17:9]\n“Say: It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing” [Fussilat 41:44]. \nEnd quote from Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/364 \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question regarding whether it is better to read the Quran or listen to it on tapes is nuanced and may depend on individual circumstances and contexts. However, both reading and listening to the Quran have their own merits and are supported by various verses from the Quran that emphasize the importance of both recitation and reflection upon its verses.\n\n### Advantages of Reading the Quran\n\n1. **Direct Engagement and Reflection**:\n   - Reading the Quran allows for personal engagement with the text, enabling deeper reflection. This is emphasized in Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206), where it is commanded: \n     > \"When the Qur'an is recited listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed. Meditate on your Lord inwardly with humility and trepidation, reciting His Book softly, morning and evening, and be not negligent.\" (7:204)\n   This verse encourages not just listening but also meditating and reflecting on the Quran.\n\n2. **Encouragement to Read**:\n   - Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:2-6) also emphasizes reading:\n     > \"Recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly. We shall soon entrust to you a message heavy (with solemnity).\" (73:4)\n   This suggests the importance of understanding and contemplating the message behind the words.\n\n3. **Personal Connection**:\n   - When one reads the Quran, it often allows for a personal connection and the ability to pause and reflect on Allah’s words.\n\n### Advantages of Listening to the Quran\n\n1. **Accessibility**:\n   - Listening to the Quran may be more accessible for individuals who may not be proficient in reading or who have visual impairments.\n\n2. **Enhancing Memorization**:\n   - Listening can aid in memorization due to the auditory nature of learning. The Surah Al-Isra (17:106-110) mentions the gradual recitation of the Quran, enabling better comprehension and retention:\n     > \"We have divided the Qur'an into parts that you may recite it to men slowly, with deliberation.\" (17:106)\n\n3. **Collective Experience**:\n   - Listening to the Quran in a group can foster a feeling of community and shared worship, which can enhance the spiritual experience.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth reading and listening to the Quran hold value and can complement each other. The decision to choose one over the other may depend on the context in which a person finds themselves. Ultimately, as indicated in Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:17-18):\n> \"Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\" (75:17-18)\n\nThis highlights the importance of both understanding the verses and their recitation, suggesting that whether one reads or listens, the aim should be to absorb and reflect on the messages contained within the Quran. \n\nIn light of these perspectives, a person may choose to do both: read when they want to reflect deeply and listen for ease and community, ensuring they engage with the Quran meaningfully in their spiritual journey."

        "question": "If the imam forgets some verses, how can he recite them so that he will have completed the Qur'aan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      The reader will not attain the reward for \n      completing the Holy Qur'aan unless he has recited all of it and not \n      omitted any part of it. If he omits a verse and does not recite it, then \n      he has not completed the Holy Qur'aan. \n\n    The scholars even said that he should recite \n    the Basmalah at the beginning of every soorah except Soorat Baraa’ah (al-Tawbah), \n    and he should pay attention to that so that he will have completed the \n    Qur'aan. \n\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) \n    said: \n\n    He should always recite Bismillaah al-Rahmaan \n    al-Raheem at the beginning of every soorah except Baraa’ah, as most of the \n    scholars said that it is a verse, as it is written in the Mushaf and it is \n    written at the beginning of all soorahs except Bara’aah. If he recites it \n    then he has definitely completed the recitation, and if he omits the \n    Basmalah he has omitted part of the Qur'aan according to the majority. End \n    quote. \n\n    Al-Tibyaan, \n    p. 61, 62 \n\n    Based on that, it is essential for the \n    reader to recite what he forgot of the verses, so that he may attain the \n    reward for completing the Qur'aan. \n\n    The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) \n    mentioned two ways narrated from the Salaf (early generation) of reciting \n    the verse or verses that the imam forgot during Taraweeh prayers: \n\n    1.He should put all \n    these verses together and recite them all on the last night of Ramadan. This \n    is what the imams used to do in Makkah in the past.\n\n    2.When he remembers \n    the verse that he forgot, he should recite it [this applies if he is still \n    reciting in the prayer] and then resume his recitation until he has \n    finished. This was narrated from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him).\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said, noting that the order in which it is prescribed to \n    recite is waived in the case of forgetting: \n\n    … if he forgets some of the verses of the \n    soorah when praying qiyaam in Ramadan (i.e., Taraaweeh), he should not \n    repeat it [the entire soorah] or repeat what comes after it, but if he \n    deliberately changes the order of the verses in the soorah and recites the \n    later ones before the earlier ones, that is not permissible according to \n    scholarly consensus. \n\n    Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) was \n    asked about the imam during the month of Ramadan omitting some verses from \n    the soorah: did he think that the one who was praying behind him should \n    recite them? \n\n    He said: Yes, he should do that. In Makkah \n    they used to appoint a man to write down what the imam forgot of verses and \n    so on, then on night of completion he would recite what he had omitted. \n\n    His companions -- such as Abu Muhammad (Ibn \n    Qudaamah) -- said: Rather that is mustahabb in order to complete the Qur'aan \n    and so as to attain a complete reward. The people of Makkah and Ahmad and \n    his companions thought that if the one who had omitted some verses recited \n    them later on when he remembered them, that was sufficient to be regarded as \n    having completed the Qur’aan and to attain the reward, even if that meant \n    the order of verses was not followed in this instance, because without \n    reciting these verses, his recitation of the soorah could not be regarded as \n    complete. This was narrated from ‘Ali: he forgot a verse from a soorah, then \n    whilst he was still reciting he recited it, then resumed his recitation from \n    where he had got to, and no one noticed that he had forgotten anything \n    except those who were Haafiz (i.e., had memorised the entire Qur'aan). \n\n    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, \n    21/410, 411. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "When an imam forgets some verses during the recitation of the Qur'an, there are specific guidelines within Islamic tradition to address this situation, ensuring that the recitation is completed correctly.\n\n1. **Taking Chow or Pausing**: If an imam forgets a verse, he can either pause briefly or take chow (a slight break) before continuing. This may help him recollect what was forgotten. The ability to recite easily and the allowance for forgetfulness is often discussed in the context of recitation.\n\n2. **Using Reminder**: In Surah Al-A’la (Chapter 87, Ayah 6 to 10), Allah assures that He provides helps for individuals reciting the Qur'an so that they will not forget it. This verse indicates that reminders can play a crucial role when one forgets:\n\n   - **Surah Al-A'la (87:6-10)**: \"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, unless Allah wills. He knows what is seen and what is hidden. We shall make it easy for you. So remind (people) if the reminder is useful.\" \n\n   This verse highlights that Allah facilitates the recitation process and that reminders can be beneficial. \n\n3. **Reciting as Much as Possible**: In Surah Al-Muzzammil (Chapter 73, Ayah 20), it is advised to recite as much of the Qur'an as one can easily manage, especially in moments of difficulty. This offers flexibility during prayer:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**: \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily...\" \n\n   This allowance speaks to the understanding that some individuals may encounter challenges during recitation, which can include forgetting verses.\n\n4. **Trusting Allah’s Guidance**: Furthermore, Surah Al-Qiyamah (Chapter 75, Ayah 17-19) emphasizes that the collection and recitation of the Qur'an are the responsibility of Allah, and thus, an imam should not feel undue stress about forgetting verses:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:15-19)**: \"Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste. Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\"\n\n5. **Correction After Forgetting**: If the imam realizes he has forgotten a verse, he can correct himself when he remembers, even if it means returning to a previously recited part. This practice is aligned with the principles of flexibility in prayer and recitation.\n\nIn conclusion, if an imam forgets some verses during recitation, he should use permissible methods such as pausing for a moment to recollect, relying on reminders, and recalling that the recitation is Allah’s responsibility. This guidance allows for a graceful approach to recitation and aligns with the Qur’anic teachings about ease and flexibility in practice."

        "question": "Is it permissible to read the Qur'aan without understanding its meanings?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Yes, it is permissible for believing men and women to read \n    the Qur'aan even if they do not understand the meaning, but it is prescribed \n    to ponder and think so that one may understand, and to refer to books of \n    tafseer (commentaries) if one has enough knowledge to understand them, and \n    to refer to books of tafseer and Arabic language in order to benefit from \n    that, and he can ask scholars about anything he does not understand. What is \n    meant is that he should ponder the meanings, because Allah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “(This is) a Book (the Qur’aan) which We have sent down to \n    you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men \n    of understanding may remember”\n\n    [Saad 38:29]. \n\n    The believer should ponder the meanings, i.e., he should pay \n    attention to reading and think about what it means; he should understand the \n    meanings and thus he will benefit from it. If he does not understand the \n    meaning perfectly, he will still understand many meanings. So let him read \n    carefully and ponder and understand. This also applies to women. The reader \n    should benefit from the words of his or her Lord and understand the meaning \n    so that he may act upon it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “Do they not then think deeply in the Qur’aan, or are \n    their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?”\n\n    [Muhammad 47:24]. \n\n    Our Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, urges and \n    encourages us to think and ponder His words. When the believer -- man or \n    woman -- reads the Book of Allah, it is prescribed for them to ponder and \n    think and pay attention to what is read, so that they may benefit from the \n    words of Allah and so that they may understand the words of Allah and so \n    that they may act upon what they learn from the words of Allah.

It's important to consider both the benefits of recitation and the significance of comprehension. \n\n### Permissibility of Reading Without Understanding\nFrom an Islamic perspective, it is permissible to recite the Qur'an without necessarily comprehending its meanings fully. The flexibility in this practice is reflected in **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**, where Allah states:\n\n> \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily...\" \n> (Al-Muzzammil 73:20)\n\nThis verse implies that Allah understands the varied capabilities and circumstances of individuals. Some may recite while traveling, some may be sick, and thus, God allows individuals to recite as much as they can manage without overwhelming themselves.\n\n### The Importance of Understanding\nHowever, it is also emphasized in numerous verses that understanding the Qur'an is crucial for proper guidance. For instance, **Surah Al-Furqan (25:44)** critiques those who do not understand the message:\n\n> \"Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are no better than cattle; in fact, they are farther astray from the path.\" \n> (Al-Furqan 25:44)\n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of comprehension alongside recitation. Being able to grasp the meanings allows one to implement the guidance provided in the Qur'an in their lives effectively.\n\nIn **Surah Al-Qamar (54:32)**, Allah reinforces that the Qur'an was made easy to understand:\n\n> \"Easy have We made the Qur'an to understand: So is there any one who will pay heed?\" \n> (Al-Qamar 54:32)\n\n### A Balanced Approach\nA balanced approach suggested by Islamic scholars encourages believers to recite the Qur'an regularly, even if they do not understand every word, but to also strive to learn its meanings and teachings. \n\nAdditionally, **Surah Al-Isra (17:45-46)** discusses the challenges of understanding the Qur'an due to the veils placed by Allah upon the hearts of the disbelievers:\n\n> \"When you recite the Qur'an, We place a hidden veil between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter...\" \n> (Al-Isra 17:45)\n\nThis indicates that understanding is a grace bestowed upon those who seek it and strive to follow the truth.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while it is permissible to recite the Qur'an without understanding its meanings, striving for comprehension is highly encouraged in Islam. The Qur'an serves as guidance, and reflecting on its teachings allows believers to make meaningful changes in their lives. Therefore, Muslims are urged to balance their recitation with efforts to learn and understand the Qur'an's message without overwhelming themselves. The practice of both recitation and understanding should ideally complement each other in the spiritual journey of a believer."

        "question": "Ways of saying Isti’aadhah and Basmalah when quoting from the middle of one soorah and then from the middle of another",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    After researching and looking into the matter, we did not \n    find any comments of the scholars of tajweed and recitation concerning this \n    particular issue, in the commentaries on al-Shaatibiyyah, \n    al-Jazariyyah, al-Durar al-Lawaami’ and others, namely on the \n    issue of the ways of isti’aadhah (saying “A’oodhu Billaahi min al-Shaytaan \n    al-rajeem (I seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan)) and saying \n    Basmalah when moving from the middle of one soorah to another. Hence we \n    cannot give the questioner the names of the sources and references. But what \n    we found with some contemporary specialists in tajweed is the statement that \n    one may move from the middle of one soorah to another without saying \n    Isti’aadhah or Basmalah; rather one should pause briefly. \n\n    Shaykh Husaam al-Keelaani says: \n\n    There is no need to say Isti’aadhah or Basmalah when moving \n    from one soorah to some verses in another soorah that are not at the \n    beginning of it. End quote. Al-Bayaan fi Ahkaam Tajweed al-Qur’aan, \n    p. 27. \n\n    There may be some evidence for that in khutbat al-haajah \n    which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) used to say in \n    his khutbah and which he taught to his Companions. The Prophet (blessings \n    and peace of Allaah be upon him) used to recite in it a number of verses \n    from various soorahs, and it is not narrated that he said Isti’aadhah or \n    Basmalah. It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) taught us Khutbat al-Haajah: Al-hamdu Lillaahi nasta’eenahu wa \n    nastaghfiruhu, wa na’oodhu billaahi min shuroori anfusinaa wa sayi’aati \n    a’maalinaa.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, when quoting from the Quran, it is customary to recite the phrases \"Isti’aadhah\" and \"Basmalah.\" \"Isti’aadhah\" refers to seeking refuge in Allah from the accursed devil, and is typically stated as \"A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim\" (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan). \"Basmalah\" is the phrase \"Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim,\" meaning \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\" \n\n### Ways of Saying Isti’aadhah and Basmalah When Quoting from the Same Soorah\n\n1. **From the Beginning of a Soorah**: When quoting from the very beginning of a Surah, it is recommended to state both the \"Basmalah\" and \"Isti’aadhah\":\n   - **Example**: Quoting Surah Al-Fatiha (Chapter 1) starts with: \n     - \"A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim. Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim. Alhamdulillahi Rabb al-Alamin...\"\n\n### Ways of Saying Isti’aadhah and Basmalah When Quoting from the Middle of a Soorah\n1. **From the Middle of a Soorah**: When quoting from the middle or end of a Surah, it is still permissible to state the \"Isti’aadhah\" but it’s not obligatory to recite the \"Basmalah.\" \n   - **Praxis**: You might say:\n     - \"A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim,\" then continue with the verse you wish to quote.\n\n### Ways of Saying Isti’aadhah and Basmalah When Quoting from Different Soorahs\n1. **Transitioning Between Surahs**: When transitioning from quoting one Surah to another, it is recommended to state both the \"Isti’aadhah\" and \"Basmalah,\" so as to seek refuge before starting anew:\n   - **Example**: After quoting from Surah Al-Isra, if you proceed to quote from Surah Al-Muzzammil, you might follow this format:\n     - \"A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim. Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim,\" and then start quoting, for instance, Surah Al-Muzzammil: \"Ya ayyuha al-muzzammil...\" (Surah Al-Muzzammil 73:1).\n\n### Supporting Verses\nAlthough the specific phrases of \"Isti’aadhah\" and \"Basmalah\" are not directly quoted with analogous verses, the underlying principle of seeking refuge and invoking Allah’s name is supported by multiple verses:\n- **Isti’aadhah Reference**: Surah Al-Isra (17:45-46) illustrates the barrier placed for disbelievers and highlights the importance of divine assistance while reciting the Qur'an.\n- **Basmalah Reference**: Surah Al-Isra (17:110) emphasizes the beautiful names of Allah and illustrates how invocation comes as a form of reverence in handling divine communication.\n\nOther references supporting the invocation of Allah’s name, forgiveness, and divine assistance can be reflected from multiple surahs, including Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20) which provides guidance concerning the recitation of the Qur'an: \n- \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily...\" indicates the approach in seeking Allah’s help through recitation.\n\nIn summary, when quoting different parts of the Quran, using \"Isti’aadhah\" and \"Basmalah\" where appropriate fosters a proper framework of respect and aid from Allah, while echoing the significance of the Quran in one’s practice of faith."

        "question": "Is the Quran the Word of Allah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Praise be to Allah Who has made good dear to you; we ask Him to increase you in guidance and faith, and to guide your parents to practice Islam and adhere to its rulings. \nQuran is the word of Allah\nWith regard to the Quran and the proof that it is the word of Allah, these are specious arguments which were put forward out of stubbornness and arrogance by the first disbelievers to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent. Allah refuted what they said in many ways, proving their words to be false and pointing out what was wrong with it. For example: \n\nIn this Quran is a challenge from Allah to mankind and the jinn to produce anything like it, but they were unable to. Then He challenged them to produce only ten surahs like it, and they were unable to. Then He challenged them to produce something like the shortest surah in the Quran , and they could not do it, even though those who were being challenged were the most eloquent and well-spoken of mankind, and the Quran was revealed in their language. Yet despite that they stated that they were completely incapable of doing that. This challenge has remained down throughout history, but not one person has been able to produce anything like it. If this were the word of a human being, some people would have been able to produce something like it or close to it. There is a great deal of evidence for this challenge in the Quran, for example, the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“Say: If mankind and the jinn were together to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.” [al-Isra 17:88]\nAllah says, challenging them to produce just ten surahs: \n“Or they say, He (Prophet Muhammad) forged it (the Quran). Say: Bring you then ten forged Surahs (chapters) like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the truth!” [Hud 11:13 interpretation of the meaning]\nAllah says, challenging them to produce just one surah: \n“And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Quran) to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.” [al-Baqarah 2:23 interpretation of the meaning]\n\nNo matter how much knowledge and understanding mankind attains, they will still inevitably make mistakes, forget things or fall short. If the Quran were not the word of Allah, there would be some contradictions and shortcomings in it, as Allah says: \n\n“Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein many a contradiction.” [al-Nisa 4:82 interpretation of the meaning]\nBut it is free from any shortcoming, error or contradiction; indeed, all of it is wisdom, mercy and justice. Whoever thinks that there is any contradiction in it, that is because of his diseased thinking and mistaken understanding; if he refers to the scholars they will explain to him what is correct and clear up the confusion for him, as Allah says: \n“Verily, those who disbelieved in the Reminder (i.e. the Quran) when it came to them (shall receive the punishment). And verily, it is an honourable well fortified respected Book (because it is Allah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption). Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah)” [Fussilat 41:41-42 interpretation of the meaning]\n\nAllah has guaranteed to preserve this Quran, and He says: \n\n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9 interpretation of the meaning]\nEvery letter of it was transmitted by thousands from thousands down throughout history, and not one letter of it was altered. If any person tried to alter anything in it, or add something or take something away, then he would be exposed straight away, because Allah is the One Who has guaranteed to preserve the Quran, unlike the case with other divinely-revealed Books which Allah revealed to the people of a particular Prophet only, and not to all of mankind, so He did not guarantee to preserve them, rather He delegated their preservation to the followers of the prophets. But they did not preserve them, rather they introduced alterations and changes which distorted most of the meanings. The Quran, on the other hand, was revealed by Allah to all of mankind until the end of time, because the Message of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the final message, so the Quran is preserved in men’s hearts and in written form, as is proven by the events of history. How many people have tried to change the verses of the Quran and deceive the Muslims, but they were quickly exposed and their falsehood was discovered, even by Muslim children. \nAnother of the definitive signs that this Quran was not produced by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) but that it came revealed by Allah to him is the following: \n\nThe great miracles which the Quran contains of legislation, rulings, stories and beliefs, which could not be produced by any created being no matter how great his intelligence and level of understanding. No matter how hard people try to promulgate laws to regulate their lives, they can never succeed so long as they are far away from the teachings of the Quran; the further away they are, the greater their rate of failure. This is something that has been proven by the disbelievers themselves.  \nReports of matters of the unseen, both past and future, which no human being could speak of independently, no matter how great his knowledge, especially at that time which is regarded as primitive in terms of technology and modern tools. There are many things which had not been discovered yet, and which have only been discovered after lengthy and difficult exploration with the most modern equipment, but Allah told us about them in the Quran, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned them, fifteen centuries ago, such as the stages of embryonic development, the nature of the oceans, etc. These things have made some kafirs state that this could only have come from God, as in the case of the development of the embryo: \n\nOnly 60 years ago, researchers confirmed that man does not come into existence all at once, but rather he passes through stages of development one after another. Only 60 years ago, science discovered this one Quranic fact. \nShaykh al-Zindani said, we met an American professor, one of the greatest American scientists, whose name was Professor Marshall Johnson, and we told him that it says in the Quran that man is created in stages. When he heard this, he was sitting down, but he stood up and said, Stages? We said, That was in the seventh century CE! This Book came and said, man was created in stages. He said, That is impossible, impossible We told him, Why do you say that? This Book says (interpretation of the meaning):  \n“He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation in three veils of darkness.” [al-Zumar 39:6] \nWhat is the matter with you, that [you fear not Allah (His punishment), and] you hope not for reward (from Allah or you believe not in His Oneness).\n“While He has created you in (different) stages.” [Nuh 71:14]\nThen he sat back down on his chair and after a few moments he said, There are only three possibilities. The first is that Muhammad had a huge microscope through which he managed to study these things and he knew things that the people did not know, and he said these things. The second is that this happened by accident, it was a coincidence. The third is that he was a Messenger from God. We said, With regard to the first idea, that he had a microscope and other equipment, you know that a microscope needs lenses, and lenses need glass and technical expertise and other equipment. Some of this information can only be discovered with an electron microscope which needs electricity, and electricity needs knowledge which should have been acquired by an earlier generation. It is not possible for this knowledge to have been acquired all at once in a single generation; the previous generation would have had to strive hard in developing science and transmitting it to the next generation, and so on. But for this to be the work of one man, with no one coming before him or after him, either in his own land or the neighbouring lands for the Romans, Persians and Arabs were ignorant and had no such equipment for one man to have all these instruments and tools which he did not pass on to anyone else this is not possible. He said, Thats right, it would be very difficult. We said, And for it to have been an accident or coincidence, what would you think if we said that the Quran did not mention this fact only in one verse but in several verses, and that it did not refer to it in general terms but that it gave details of every stage, saying that in the first stage such and such happens, in the second stage such and such happens, in the third stage and so on. Could that be a coincidence? When we explained to him all the details of those stages, he said, It is wrong to say that this is an accident! This is well-founded knowledge. We said, Then how do you explain it? He said, There is no explanation except that this is revelation from above!\nWith regard to the many statements in the Quran concerning the sea, some of these facts were not discovered until very recently, and many of them are still unknown. For example, these facts were discovered after hundreds of marine stations had been set up, and after images had been taken by satellites. The one who said this was Professor Schroeder, one of the greatest oceanographers in West Germany. He used to say that if science advanced, religion would have to retreat. But when he heard the translation of the verses of the Quran, he was stunned and said, These could not be the words of a human being.   And Professor Dorjaro, a professor of oceanography, told us of the latest developments on science, when he heard the verse: \n“Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed with waves topped by waves, topped by dark clouds, (layers of) darkness upon darkness: if a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And he for whom Allah has not appointed light, for him there is no light.” [al-Nur 24:40 interpretation of the meaning]\nHe said:\n“In the past, man could not dive to a depth of more than twenty meters because he had no special equipment. But now we can dive to the bottom of the ocean, using modern equipment, and we find intense darkness at a depth of two hundred meters. The ayah says a vast deep sea . The discoveries in the depths of the sea give us an understanding of the verse, (layers of) darkness upon darkness. It is known that there are seven colours in the spectrum, including red, yellow, blue, green, orange, etc. When we dive down into the depths of the ocean, these colours disappear one after another, and the disappearance of each colour results in more darkness. Red disappears first, then orange, then yellow and the last colour to disappear is blue, at a depth of two hundred meters. Each colour that disappears adds to the darkness until it reaches total darkness.  With regard to the phrase waves topped by waves, it has been proven scientifically that there is a separation between the upper and lower parts of the ocean, and that this separation is filled with waves, as if there are waves on the edge of the dark, lower portion of the sea, which we do not see, and there are waves on the shores of the sea, which we do see. So it is as if there are waves above waves. This is a confirmed scientific fact, hence Professor Dorjaro said concerning these Quranic verses, that this cannot be human knowledge.” (Al-Adillah al-Maddiyyah ‘ala Wujud-Allah by Muhammad Mutwalli al-Sha’rawi) \nAnd there are very many such examples \n\nIn the Quran there are some verses which rebuke the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and mention some things to which Allah drew his attention. Some of them may have been embarrassing for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). But if this Quran had come from the Messenger of Allah, there would have been no need for this; if he were to conceal any part of the Quran, he would have concealed some of these verses which contained rebukes or drew his attention to certain matters which he should not have done, such as the verse in which Allah says to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \n\n“But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., their saying that Muhammad married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him.” [al-Ahzab 33:37 interpretation of the meaning]\nAfter this, can there be any doubt left in the mind of any intelligent person that this Quran is the word of Allah, and that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) conveyed that which was revealed to him in full? \nMoreover, we tell this person, try it for yourself, read a sound translation of the Quran and use your mind to ponder these rules and regulations. There is no doubt that any intelligent person who has the power of discernment will see a great difference between these words (of Allah) and the words of any person on the face of the earth. \nMan-woman relationship in Islam\nWith regard to your relationship with this young man, this noble religion forbids women to mix with men for a great and wise reason. So you have to stop meeting him and break off your relationship with him until he becomes Muslim, in which case you can marry him in a proper Islamic marriage. In the answer to Question no. 1200 you will find an explanation of the rulings on a Muslim woman mixing with non-mahram men. \nWith regard to your love for him, this is a test from Allah: will you put your love of Allah before your love for one of His creation, or will you put your love for this person before the love of your Almighty Lord Who has forbidden such things. Note that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than that, the first of which is that you will find, in sha Allah, that Allah will compensate you with comfort and tranquility in loving Him and striving to draw closer to Allah by means of that which He loves; so your love for your Lord and your attachment to Him will increase, and  your attachment to all of His creation will become weaker. In the answer to Question no. 10254 you will find some solutions to this problem. \nCan Muslim women marry non-Muslim men?\nWith regard to the ruling on a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man , this is haram according to scholarly consensus, indeed it is one of the major immoral actions which Allah has forbidden in the Quran. In the answers to Questions no. 8396 and 1825 you will find a detailed response to this question. \nWe advise you to be patient and to put up with difficulties, and to keep far away from everything that may cause you to do things that would anger your Lord. Note that Allah has made this world a place of trial and testing for His believing slaves; whoever is patient and refrains from following his desries, seeking the pleasure of Allah, Allah will compensate him with Paradise where He will bestow upon him all kinds of delight which cannot be compared with the fleeting worldly pleasures that he sacrificed. This is in addition to the happiness and tranquility that he will find in his heart when he obeys his Lord. \nPerhaps if he sees how you adhere to your religion and avoid meeting him and sitting with him despite your love for him, he will come to realize the greatness of this religion which makes its followers prepared to sacrifice all that they love in order to please their Lord, and that they hope for a great reward from their Lord for their patience in obeying Him and keeping away from that which He has forbidden and perhaps that will be the cause of his becoming Muslim. \nWe ask Allah to guide him to Islam, and to make goodness easy for you, and to keep all evil away from you, Ameen.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Quran is regarded as the Word of Allah (God) by Muslims. This belief is founded on various verses within the Quran itself that affirm its divine origin, authenticity, and the concept of its revelation through the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Here are key points and supporting verses:\n\n1. **Divine Origin**: The Quran explicitly states that it is not the word of a poet or soothsayer, but rather a revelation from God. This is emphasized in Surah Al-Haqqah (Chapter 69), where it is mentioned:\n   - **Surah Al-Haqqah (69:40-44)**: \"This is indeed the word of the noble Messenger, and not the word of a poet. Little do you believe! Nor is it the word of a soothsayer. Little do you reflect! It has been sent down by the Lord of all the worlds.\" \n\n2. **Well-Kept Book**: The Quran is referred to as a \"glorious Qur'an inscribed in the well-kept Book,\" signifying its protected and sacred nature. \n   - **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:77-79)**: \"Indeed, it is a glorious Qur'an (inscribed) in the well-kept Book. None touch it except the purified.\"\n\n3. **Clear Communication**: The Quran asserts its inimitability and the challenge it poses to those who doubt its divine origin, inviting them to produce a text like it. \n   - **Surah Yunus (10:35-39)**: \"Ask: 'Is there one among those you associate with God who can show the way to the truth?' Say: 'It is God who shows the way to truth.'... This Qur'an is not such (a writ) as could be composed by anyone but God. It confirms what has been revealed before, and it is an exposition of (Heaven's) law.\"\n\n4. **Unity of Revelation**: The Quran is presented as a continuation and confirmation of previous scriptures, showcasing a unified vision of faith and divine guidance.\n   - **Surah Ash-Shuraa (42:10-14)**: \"In whatever matter you disagree, the ultimate judgement rests with God... This is God, my Lord; in Him have I placed my trust... He has laid down for you the same way of life and belief which He commended to Noah, and which We have enjoined on you, and which We had bequeathed to Abraham, Moses, and Jesus...\"\n\n5. **Warnings Against Alteration**: The Quran also warns against those who would distort its message, emphasizing the severe consequences for those who misrepresent the Word of God.\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:75-79)**: \"How do you expect them to put their faith in you, when you know that some among them heard the Word of God and, having understood, perverted it knowingly?\"\n\nIn summary, the Quran presents itself as the unaltered Word of God, conveyed through the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It invites reflection, understanding, and belief in its teachings, declaring itself as a guide for those who seek truth and righteousness. The above citations underscore its divine nature, the challenge it poses to skeptics, and its continuity with prior revelations."

        "question": "Commentary on the verse in which Allaah says: “Verily, Allaah will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allaah)” [al-Ra’d 13:11]",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This is an important verse which indicates that Allaah, may \n    He be blessed and exalted, in His perfect justice and wisdom does not change \n    the condition of the people from good to bad or from bad to good, from ease \n    to hardship or from hardship to ease, unless they change their condition \n    themselves. So if they are in a state of righteousness and goodness and they \n    change, Allaah will change things for them with punishment, calamities, \n    hardship, drought, famine, disunity and other kinds of punishments as \n    appropriate requital. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And \n    your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves” [Fussilat 41:46]. \n\n    Or He may give them respite and give them time so that they \n    might truen to the right path, but if they do not then they will be seized \n    unexpectedly, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n    “So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been \n    reminded, We opened for them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in \n    the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, \n    We took them (in punishment), and lo! They were plunged into destruction \n    with deep regrets and sorrows” [al-An’aam 6:44]., \n    meaning despairing of all goodness -- we seek refuge in Allaah from the \n    punishment and wrath of Allaah. Or they may be given respite until the Day \n    of Resurrection, when their punishment will be more severe, as Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “Consider not that Allaah is unaware of that which the \n    Zâlimûn (polytheists, wrongdoers) do, but He gives them respite up to a Day \n    when the eyes will stare in horror”[Ibraaheem 14:42], \n    meaning that they are given respite until after death, and that will be a \n    greater and more severe punishment. \n\n    Or they may be in a state of evil and sin, then they repent \n    to Allaah and turn back to Him, and they regret their sins and adhere to \n    obedience, so Allaah changes their state of wretchedness, hardship and \n    poverty to ease, unity and righteousness because of their good deeds and \n    their repentance to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. It says in \n    another verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n    “That is so because Allaah will never change a grace which He has bestowed \n    on a people until they change what is in their ownselves” [al-Anfaal 8:53]. \n    This verse tells us that if they are in a state of ease, comfort and \n    goodness, then they change and turn to sin, their situation will be changed \n    -- there is no power and no strength except with Allaah -- or they may be \n    given respite, as stated above. The opposite is also true: if they were in a state of evil and sin, or disbelief and misguidance, then they repent, regret their sin and adhere to obedience to Allaah, Allaah will change their situation from bad to good; He will change their disunity into unity and harmony; He will change their hardship to ease, well being and plenty; He will change their situation from draught, famine, , lack of water and so on to rainfall, fertile land and other kinds of goodness.

        "predicted_answer": "The verse from Surah Ar-Ra'd (Chapter 13, Verse 11) that states, \"Verily, Allaah will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves,\" serves as a profound reminder about the relationship between divine assistance and human actions. The commentary on this verse can be delved into through various dimensions:\n\n### 1. Divine Justice and Responsiveness\nThe verse emphasizes that Allah's assistance and providence towards a people are contingent upon their own actions and faithfulness. This reflects the principle of divine justice; Allah responds to His servants based on their state of righteousness or wrongdoing. The notion that Allah will not change a people's condition signifies His fairness in dealing with humanity. The encouragement to be steadfast in goodness is paramount. \n\n**Supporting Verse:** This concept aligns with Surah Hud (11:117), which states: “Your Lord would not surely destroy unjustly human habitations so long as the people are righteous.” This indicates that the continuation of blessings or safety within a community is directly tied to their moral and ethical condition (Surah Hud, 11:117).\n\n### 2. Human Responsibility\nThis verse underscores the importance of individual and collective responsibility. While Allah is ever-watchful and just, the onus is on the people to maintain their goodness and righteousness. In times of difficulty or calamities, this verse serves as a reminder for individuals and communities to introspect and perhaps reform their behaviors to improve their situation.\n\n**Supporting Verse:** Surah Al-Hadid (57:22-23) further illustrates this idea by stating that no calamity befalls a person without the prior knowledge of Allah, reminding believers that their actions and engagements in good or evil may directly influence their conditions.\n\n### 3. The Cycle of Consequences\nThe verse also suggests a cyclical relationship between humans and divine will. When people transgress and become ungrateful, they invite consequences that can lead to their downfall or suffering. This reflects a broader theme within the Quran where the behavior of a community directly influences their fortunes in this world and the next.\n\n**Supporting Verse:** Surah Ali 'Imran (3:178-182) indicates that the respite granted to the disbelievers is merely a means for them to deepen their transgressions before facing their consequences, thereby stressing the link between actions taken and the resultant state.\n\n### 4. Hope and Redemption\nEven though the verse warns of the conditions tied to Allah's assistance, it inherently carries a message of hope. It illustrates that a change in human behavior can lead to a transformative change in their condition, highlighting Allah's mercy. The potential for redemption always exists, as individuals are encouraged to correct their paths and seek forgiveness.\n\n**Supporting Verse:** Further supporting this notion, Surah Ar-Ra'd (13:29) notes that those who believe and do righteous deeds will find happiness and an excellent resting place, linking compliance to divine command with eventual reward.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the verse from Surah Ar-Ra'd encapsulates a comprehensive view of the interdependence between divine grace and human behavior. The principles of justice, responsibility, the consequences of actions, and hope for redemption flow from this understanding. It invites believers to remain steadfast and proactive in their goodness, as Allah’s support thrives where righteousness prevails.\n\n**Citations:**\n- Surah Al-Ra'd (13:11)\n- Surah Hud (11:117)\n- Surah Al-Hadid (57:22-23)\n- Surah Ali 'Imran (3:178-182)\n- Surah Ar-Ra'd (13:29)"

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The verse is to be understood according to \n    its apparent meaning. The calamities and famines that Allaah decrees do not \n    harm anyone but those whose lives have ended and whose provision has ceased. \n    As for those who still have something left of their lives or provision, \n    Allaah brings their provision to them by many ways, which they may know or \n    may not know, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his \n    duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\n\n    3. And He will provide him from (sources) \n    he never could imagine”\n\n    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]\n\n    “And so many a moving (living) creature \n    carries not its own provision! Allaah provides for it and for you”\n\n    [al-‘Ankaboot 29:60]\n\n    And the Prophet (blessings and peace of \n    Allaah be upon him) said: “No soul will die until it has received its \n    provision in full and completed its allotted  lifespan.”   \n\n    A person may be punished with poverty and \n    deprivation of provision because of his actions such as laziness and failing \n    to seek means of provision that he is able to do, or because of his \n    committing sins that Allaah has forbidden, as Allaah says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \n\n    “Whatever \n    of good reaches you, is from Allaah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is \n    from yourself”\n\n    [al-Nisa’ 4:79] \n\n    “And whatever of misfortune befalls you, \n    it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much”\n\n    [al-Shoora 42:30]\n\n    And it is narrated in a saheeh report that \n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “A person may \n    be deprived of provision because of a sin that he commits.” Narrated by Imam \n    Ahmad, al-Nasaa’i and Ibn Maajah with a jayyid isnaad. \n\n    A person may be tested with poverty, \n    sickness and other calamities so as to test his gratitude and patience, \n    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And certainly, We shall test you with \n    something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad \n    tidings to As‑ Saabiroon (the patient). \n\n    156. Who, when afflicted with calamity, \n    say: ‘Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return’”\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:155-156] \n\n    “And We tried them with good (blessings) \n    and evil (calamities) in order that they might turn (to Allaah’s Obedience)”\n\n    [al-A’raaf 7:168]\n\n    What is meant by good in this verse is \n    blessings, and what is meant by evil is calamities. And the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the \n    affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good. If harm befalls him, \n    he is patient and that is good for him, and if something good happens to him \n    he is grateful and that is good for him, and this is not for anyone except \n    the believer.” Narrated by Imam Muslim in his Saheeh. \n\n    And there are many similar verses and hadeeths.

        "predicted_answer": "The verse “And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah” [Hud 11:6] illustrates an essential principle in Islamic theology regarding sustenance and provision. The verse underscores the belief that all living creatures are provided for by Allah, highlighting His omnipotence and benevolence as the Sustainer of all existence.\n\n### Meaning and Commentary:\n\n1. **Divine Provision**: The verse asserts that every living being on Earth, whether human, animal, or insect, relies on Allah for sustenance. This reflects the belief in Allah's complete control over the provisions of all His creations. It reminds believers that they are not self-sufficient and that their resources and needs are fulfilled by a higher power.\n\n    - **Supporting Verses**: \n        - Surah Al-‘Ankabut (29:60) states, “How many living things there are on the earth that do not store their food; God provides them as well as you. He is all-hearing and all-knowing.” This reinforces the idea that Allah takes responsibility for the sustenance of every creature.\n        - Surah Al-An’am (6:38) echoes this sentiment: “There is not a thing that moves on the earth, no bird that flies on its wings, but has a community of its own like yours. There is nothing that We have left out from recording.” This emphasizes Allah's knowledge and provision.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Knowledge**: Allah not only provides sustenance but also knows the dwelling places and needs of each creature. This exemplifies His comprehensive knowledge of the unseen and visible realms, affirming that nothing escapes His awareness.\n\n    - **Supporting Verses**:\n        - In Surah Al-An’am (6:13), it is stated: “Whatsoever dwells in the night and day belongs to Him. He is all-hearing and all-knowing.” This reinforces the point that Allah encompasses all knowledge and that everything is within His dominion.\n\n3. **A Test of Gratitude**: The verse serves as a reminder to humanity that their provisions are a test from Allah. It invites believers to reflect on their reliance on God and encourages them to express gratitude for His countless blessings.\n\n    - **Supporting Verses**: \n        - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:164) mentions the signs of God's existence and His provision for mankind, urging people to be grateful, saying: “...and the rain that God sends from the sky enlivening the earth that was dead, and the scattering of beasts of all kinds upon it, and the changing of the winds, and the clouds which remain obedient between earth and sky, are surely signs for the wise.”\n\n4. **Dependence on Allah**: The verse and its interpretation emphasize the concept of Tawakkul (trust in Allah). Believers are encouraged to place their trust in God for their needs and sustenance rather than relying solely on material means.\n\n    - **Supporting Verses**:\n        - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:286) illustrates Allah's mercy and support: “Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.” This serves to reassure believers that Allah’s provisions align with their capacity.\n\n5. **A Reminder of the Hereafter**: The broader context of this verse in Surah Hud also alludes to the eventual resurrection and accountability, reminding believers to lead righteous lives under the certainty of returning to their Creator.\n\n    - **Supporting Verses**:\n        - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:25) offers hope for the believers: “Announce to those who believe and have done good deeds, glad tidings of gardens under which rivers flow.” This points to eternal rewards for those who acknowledge and utilize Allah’s provisions responsibly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, Surah Hud (11:6) poignantly encapsulates the central themes of divine sustenance and recognition of Allah's omnipotence. It illustrates that all creatures depend on Allah for their needs, reflects on His comprehensive knowledge of creation, encourages gratitude, and serves as a reminder of the ultimate accountability to Him. It invites believers to cultivate a relationship based on trust and gratitude towards the Provider of all sustenance."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It was proven that the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and \n    peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “This Qur’aan has been revealed in seven \n    styles, so recite whichever is easiest.” And the scholars said: they are \n    close in meaning but different in wording. \n\n    When ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) heard of the \n    differences among the people and Hudhayfah (may Allaah be pleased with him) \n    came to him and said “Save the people,” he consulted the Companions who were \n    still alive at this time, such as ‘Ali, Talhah, al-Zubayr and others, and \n    they suggested compiling the Qur’aan in one style, so that the people would \n    not differ. So he compiled it (may Allaah be pleased with him), and he \n    formed a four-man committee for that task, headed by Zayd ibn Thaabit (may \n    Allaah be pleased with him). So they compiled the Qur'aan in one style, and \n    copied it and distributed it to the various regions so that the people could \n    rely on it and so as to put an end to disputes. \n\n    With regard to the seven recitations or ten recitations, they \n    are present in what was compiled by ‘Uthmaan, and have to do with adding a \n    letter or omitting a letter, or elongating or shortening a vowel. All of \n    that is included in the one style that ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) compiled. The intention behind that was to preserve the word of Allaah and protect people from differences that could harm them or cause fitnah among them. Allaah has not enjoined reciting it in the seven styles, rather the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “Recite whichever is easiest.” So the people’s agreeing upon one style is a good action for which ‘Uthmaan and the Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) are to be appreciated, because it made things easier for people and prevented a cause of dispute among the Muslims.

        "predicted_answer": "### ‘Uthmaan’s Compilation of the Mushaf in One Style (Harf)\n\nThe compilation of the Quran by the third caliph, ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), is a significant event in Islamic history. This action was primarily motivated by the need to preserve the Quranic text in a uniform manner across the expanding Islamic empire. Prior to this compilation, the Quran had been recorded on various materials and recited in different dialects (harfs), leading to variations that could potentially cause confusion among Muslims.\n\n#### Reasons for ‘Uthmaan’s Compilation\n\n1. **Preservation of Unity**:\n   Following the death of several companions of the Prophet Muhammad who had memorized the Quran during the Battle of Yamama, there was a fear that variations in recitation (different styles or dialects) could lead to divisions among Muslims. ‘Uthmaan aimed to unify the community under a single, authoritative text. This is consistent with the Quranic emphasis on the clarity and distinctiveness of its message as found in Surah Fussilat, where it states:\n\n   > \"A Book whose verses have been distinguished and explained, a lucid discourse for people who understand.\"  \n   > (Surah Fussilat, 41:3)\n\n2. **Revelation's Inviolability**:\n   Given the belief that the Quran is a divine text, ‘Uthmaan’s compilation was essential to preserve its integrity. The Quran declares:\n\n   > \"Falsehood cannot enter it from any side: It's a revelation from the all-wise and praiseworthy (God).\"  \n   > (Surah Fussilat, 41:42)\n\n   Such verses affirm the necessity of safeguarding the Quran from alterations, which was a driving factor behind ‘Uthmaan's efforts.\n\n3. **Clarity and Accessibility**:\n   Surah Fussilat also mentions the need for the Quran to be a clear and comprehensible message for its recipients. The verse highlights that the Quran is a guidance and a healing for those who believe:\n\n   > \"For those who believe, it is a guidance and a healing; but for those who do not believe, it is a deafness in the ears, and a blindness.\"  \n   > (Surah Fussilat, 41:44)\n\n   The compilation sought to ensure that the Quran was accessible and recognizable in its text, providing clarity to all who read it.\n\n#### The Process of Compilation\n\n‘Uthmaan commissioned a group of trusted companions, including Zayd ibn Thabit and others who had memorized the Quran fully, to create a standardized mushaf. They were instructed to refer to written fragments that existed during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. The finalized mushaf was then copied, and copies were dispatched to major Islamic cities along with orders to burn any other variants to maintain unity.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n‘Uthmaan’s compilation of the Quran was not merely an administrative task; it was a necessary action grounded in the Islamic principle of preserving the integrity and unification of the Muslim Ummah. The Quran’s divine assurance of its protection from corruption and its role as a clear guidance were fundamental to this historical compilation. As articulated in Surah Fussilat:\n\n> \"If We had made it a discourse in an obscure tongue, they would have said: 'Why were its revelations not expounded distinctly?'\"  \n> (Surah Fussilat, 41:44)\n\nThis encapsulates the essence of ‘Uthmaan’s efforts—to ensure that the Quran remains a clear and accessible source of guidance for all."

        "question": "Prohibition on receiving payment for reading the Holy Qur’aan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Reading Qur’aan is an act of worship, pure and simple, an act \n    by means of which a person seeks to draw close to his Lord. The basic \n    principle concerning this and similar acts that are only worship is that the \n    Muslim does them seeking thereby the pleasure of Allaah and seeking the \n    reward that is with Him, and not to seek reward or appreciation from any \n    other person. Hence it was unknown among the righteous salaf to hire people \n    to read the Qur’aan for the dead or on weddings or at parties. There is no \n    report from any of the imams of Islam that they enjoined such a thing or \n    allowed it. Neither it is known that any of them accepted payment for \n    reading Qur’aan. Rather they would read it in the hope of attaining that \n    which is with Allaah, may He be glorified. The Prophet (blessings and peace \n    of Allaah be upon him) commanded the one who reads the Qur’aan to ask of \n    Allaah thereby, and he warned against seeking anything from people. \n    Al-Tirmidhi narrated in his Sunan from ‘Imraan ibn Husayn that he \n    passed by a reader who was reading the Qur'aan, then he asked (for \n    something). He said Inna Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon (verily to \n    Allaah we belong and to Him is our return -- said when faced with calamity), \n    and then he said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of \n    Allaah be upon him) say: “Whoever reads the Qur'aan, let him ask of Allaah \n    thereby, for there will come people who will read the Qur'aan and ask of \n    people thereby.” \n\n    As for accepting payment for teaching it, or performing \n    ruqyah in which the Qur’aan is recited, and other things in which the \n    benefit goes to someone other than the reader, the saheeh hadeeths indicate \n    that it is permissible, because of the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed who accepted a \n    flock of sheep as payment for performing ruqyah for the man who had been \n    stung by a scorpion, and he recited Soorat al-Faatihah for him as a ruqyah; \n    and the hadeeth of Sahl about when the Prophet (blessings and peace of \n    Allaah be upon him) gave a woman in marriage to a man in return for his \n    teaching her what he had memorised of the Qur'aan. So the one who accepts \n    payment just for reading or hires a group of people to read the Qur'aan is \n    going against the Sunnah and against what the righteous salaf (may Allaah be \n    pleased with them all) were agreed upon. \n\n    And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah sent \n    blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions. End \n    quote \n\n    Standing Committee For Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the prohibition against receiving payment for reciting or reading the Holy Qur'an is rooted in various verses and teachings, although specific verses directly prohibiting this practice may not exist. Instead, the principles emphasized in the Qur'an guide Muslims on the etiquette and appropriate conduct regarding acts of worship, including the recitation of the Qur'an.\n\n**Prohibition against Commercialization of the Qur'an:**\n1. **Concealing Knowledge for Profit:** One of the key verses regarding the concealing knowledge for material gain can be found in Surah Al-Baqarah, which states:\n   - \"Those who conceal any part of the Scriptures that God has revealed, and thus make a little profit thereby, take nothing but fire as food; and God will not turn to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor nourish them for growth; and their doom will be painful.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:174)\n   - This verse emphasizes the importance of not commercializing knowledge or scriptures for personal gain, which can be interpreted to include the reading of the Qur'an.\n\n2. **Not Distorting Worship:** Worship in Islam is meant to be purely for the sake of God, without any ulterior motives, including financial gain. The Qur'an emphasizes the need for sincerity in actions. This principle is echoed in the following verse:\n   - \"And they were commanded not, except to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion.\" (Surah Al-Baiyyinah 98:5)\n   - This highlights that acts of worship, including recitation of the Qur'an, should be performed out of devotion and not for compensation.\n\n3. **Emphasis on Goodness Over Transactions:** Surah Al-Ma’idah calls on believers to assist one another in righteousness and piety rather than engaging in commerce for personal gain:\n   - \"But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in sin and transgression.\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:2)\n\n**Hadith Supporting the Prohibition:**\nIn addition to Qur'anic verses, there are hadiths that suggest that reciting the Qur'an should be a voluntary act performed for the pleasure of Allah, and should not be turned into a business transaction. It is reported that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) discouraged seeking remuneration for acts done strictly for the sake of Allah, which can be connected to Qur'anic recitation as an act of worship.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the Qur'an does not explicitly state a prohibition on receiving payment for reciting it, the messages conveyed throughout the text emphasize sincerity, the avoidance of commercialization of sacred practices, and the importance of engaging in worship solely for the sake of Allah. Therefore, it is generally understood within Islamic scholarship that receiving payment for reading the Qur'an contradicts the intention of sincerity and devotion in worship."

        "question": "Ruling on going back to Soorat al-Faatihah and the first few verses of Soorat al-Baqarah after completing the Qur'aan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed \n    concerning the ruling on what many Qur'aan reciters do when completing the \n    Qur'aan, which is starting a new recitation, by going back to Soorat \n    al-Faatihah and reading it along with the first five verses of Soorat \n    al-Baqarah only. The difference of opinion is reflected in the two following \n    views: \nThe first view is: that \n    this is prescribed and is mustahabb. This is the view favoured by the \n    reciters and was stated by some of the scholars. They quoted a number of \n    things as evidence for this view, among which is the following: \n(i)\nthe hadeeth narrated from \n    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas, from Ubayy ibn Ka’b, from the Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), which says that when he recited “Qul \n    A’oodhu bi Rabbi l-Naas”, he would start again with al-Faatihah, then he \n    would recite al-Baqarah up to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n    “and they are the successful” [al-Baqarah 2:5]. Then he would recite \n    du’aa’ al-khatmah (du’aa’ for completing the Qur’aan), then he would get \n    up. \nThis was narrated by \n    al-Daarimi, as attributed to him by al-Suyooti in al-Itqaan (1/295), \n    and he said it was narrated with a hasan isnaad. It was also narrated by \n    al-Haafiz Abu ‘Amr al-Daani and al-Haafiz Abu’l-A’la’ al-Hamadhaani, as \n    narrated from them by Ibn al-Jazari in al-Nashr (688-694), and by \n    al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali al-Jawhari in Fawaa’id Muntaqaah (2/29). They all \n    narrated it via one isnaad:\nAl-‘Abbaas ibn Ahmad \n    al-Barti, ‘Abd al-Wahhaab ibn Faleeh al-Makki narrated to us, ‘Abd al-Malik \n    ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Sha’wah narrated to us, from his maternal uncle Wahb ibn \n    Zam’ah ibn Saalih, from Zam’ah ibn Saalih, from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Katheer, \n    from Darbaas the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas, and from Mujaahid, from \n    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas, from Ubayy ibn Ka’b, from the Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). \nShaykh al-Albaani (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nThis is a da’eef (weak) \n    isnaad, for two reasons: \nThe first is that it hinges \n    on Zam’ah ibn Saalih. Al-Dhahabi said in al-Kaashif: He was classed \n    as da’eef by Ahmad. Al-Haafiz said in al-Taqreeb: (he is) da’eef and \n    his hadeeth is maqroon according to Muslim.\nThe other reason is that \n    there is confusion concerning its isnaad for two reasons. The first is this \n    hadeeth quoted above from Darbaas and from Mujaahid, who are mentioned \n    together in the isnaad. \nThe second is from Darbaas \n    alone, and Mujaahid is not mentioned with him. Ibn al-Jazari quoted the \n    isnaads like this in al-Nashr (2/420-425). \nAccording to a version \n    narrated from Wahb ibn Zam’ah ibn Saalih, from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Katheer, from \n    Darbaas, from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas… in a marfoo’ report. No mention is \n    made in this isnaad of Zam’ah. \nHe said following that: a \n    ghareeb hadeeth, which we know only through this isnaad. Its isnaad is hasan \n    but al-Haafiz Abu’l-Shaykh al-Asbahaani and Abu Bakr al-Zaynabi narrated it \n    from Wahb from his father Zam’ah,… and this is the correct isnaad. \nI say: This suggestion is \n    correct, because it is what appears in most reports. On that basis there is \n    no way to class its isnaad as hasan, because it hinges on Zam’ah ibn Saalih \n    who is da’eef, as stated above. \nHow can it be hasan when it \n    includes Darbaas the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas, who is majhool – as Abu \n    Haatim said and was followed in that by al-Dhahabi and al-‘Asqallaani? Yes, \n    he was mentioned with Mujaahid in some reports, as in the version narrated \n    by al-Jawhari and others, but even if that is correct, the fault in it is \n    still the same, namely Zam’ah. And Allaah knows best. end quote. \nAl-Silsilah al-Da’eefah \n    (no. 6134). \n(ii)\nA marfoo’ hadeeth in which \n    it says: \nA man said: O Messenger of \n    Allaah, which deed is most beloved to Allaah? He said: The one who reaches \n    (the end) then keeps going. He said: Who is the one who reaches (the end) \n    then keep going? He said: The one who reads the Qur’aan from the beginning \n    to the end, then when he reaches the end he starts again from the beginning. \n     \nThis hadeeth was narrated \n    via two isnaads: \nThe first is muttasil: via \n    Saalih al-Murri, from Qataadah, from Zaraarah ibn Awfa, from Ibn ‘Abbaas. It \n    was narrated with this isnaad from Saalih al-Murri by al-Haytham ibn \n    al-Rabee’ – as quoted by al-Tirmidhi (no. 2948) – and by ‘Amr ibn ‘Aasim – \n    as quoted by al-Bazzaar (2/213) – and by ‘Aasim al-Kilaabi, ‘Amr ibn Marzooq \n    and Zayd ibn al-Habbaab in al-Mustadrak (1/757), and by Ibraaheem ibn \n    Abi Suwayd al-Dhaari’ – as quoted in Mu’jam al-Tabaraani (12/168). \nThe second is mursal, via \n    Saalih al-Murri, from Qataadah, from Zaraarah ibn Awfa, from the Prophet \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), without any mention of Ibn \n    ‘Abbaas. It was narrated from Saalih al-Murri with this isnaad by Muslim ibn \n    Ibraaheem, as quoted by al-Tirmidhi (no. 2948); Ishaaq ibn ‘Eesa, as quoted \n    by al-Daarimi (2/560); ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mu’aawiyah al-Jumahi – as quoted in\n    al-Nashr by Ibn al-Jazari (p. 699). Al-Tirmidhi regarded as more \n    correct the report of the one who narrated it as mursal, and said: This is a \n    ghareeb hadeeth; we do not know of it from the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas except \n    through this isnaad, and it is not qawiy (strong). This – meaning the mursal \n    report – in my view is more saheeh than the hadeeth of Nasr ibn ‘Ali from \n    al-Haytham ibn al-Rabee’. End quote. \nThere is a corroborating, \n    marfoo’ report in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah which was narrated by \n    al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak (1/758), in the isnaad of which there is \n    Miqdaam ibn Dawood who is da’eef al-hadeeth. See: Lisaan al-Mizaan \n    (6/84). There is another corroborating report from Zayd ibn Aslam from the \n    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which is mursal. Abu \n    ‘Amr al-Daani gives its isnaad in al-Nashr (p. 700). \nThis hadeeth was classed as \n    da’eef by a number of scholars, including its narrator Imam al-Tirmidhi, \n    al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar, as it says in al-Futoohaat al-Rabaaniyyah \n    (3/248) and Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (no. 1834). \n(iii)\nThe action of the righteous \n    salaf; this Sunnah was part of their traditions. \nIbn al-Jazari (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \nAl-Haafiz Abu ‘Amr also \n    narrated with a saheeh isnaad from al-A’mash, from Ibraaheem who said: When \n    they completed the Qur’aan, they regarded it as mustahabb to read a few \n    verses from the beginning. This is a clear statement of the validity of the \n    view favoured by the reciters and held by the salaf. End quote. \nAl-Nashr \n    (2/449, p. 703). \nAl-Haafiz Abu ‘Amr al-Daani \n    said: \nThe fact that Ibn Katheer – \n    meaning the famous reciter – did that is indicated in the narrated texts and \n    the reports are mawqoof and do not go back to the Messenger of Allaah (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him). There are many other reports narrated \n    from the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and those who come after them. End quote from\n    al-Nashr fi’l-Qiraa’at al-‘Ashar by Ibn al-Jazari (p. 688). \n(iv)\nThe fact that the Muslims \n    followed this Sunnah in all regions. \nIbn al-Jazari (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \nThis action was done in all \n    Muslim regions according to the recitation of Ibn Katheer and others, to \n    such an extent that there was hardly anyone who completed a reading of the \n    Qur’aan but he would immediately start another, whether he completed what he \n    started or not, and whether he intended to complete it or not. That became \n    part of the Sunnah of completing a reading of the Qur’aan among them, and \n    they describe the one who did that as “the one who reaches (the end) then \n    keeps going”, i.e., the one who reaches the end of the Qur’aan and then \n    starts again from the beginning. End quote. \nAl-Nashr \n    (p. 694). \nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said: \nIt is mustahabb when \n    finishing a complete reading, to start another one immediately after \n    completing it. This was regarded as mustahabb by the earlier and later \n    generations, and they quoted as evidence for it the hadeeth of Anas (may \n    Allaah be pleased with him). End quote. \nAl-Tibyaan fi Adaab \n    Hamalat al-Qur’aan (p. 110). \nAl-Suyooti (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said: \nIt is Sunnah when \n    comp’leuting a reading of the Qur'aan to start another immediately after \n    completing it, because of the hadeeth of al-Tirmidhi and others... End \n    quote.  \nAl-Itqaan (1/295). See \n    also: Sunan al-Qurra’ wa Manaahij al-Mujawwideen (p. 227). \nThe second view is that it \n    is not allowed and is not mustahabb. This was stated by Imam Ahmad (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him). \nThe basis for this opinion \n    is that this action was not narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace \n    of Allaah be upon him). He would review the Qur'aan with Jibril once every \n    year, and he reviewed it with him twice in the year in which he died, and no \n    one has transmitted anything to us about this practice which is followed \n    today. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \nAbu Taalib said: I asked \n    Ahmad when he recited “Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi l-naas”, whether he recited \n    anything of al-Baqarah? He said no, and he did not regard it is mustahabb to \n    follow his completion of the Qur'aan with the recitation of anything. \n    Perhaps he had no verification of any saheeh report to indicate that. End \n    quote. \nAl-Mughni \n    (1/838). \nIt says in al-Furoo’ \n    (1/554): \nHe should not read \n    al-Faatihah and the first five verses of al-Baqarah. al-Aamidi said: meaning \n    before the supplication. And it was said that it is mustahabb. End quote. \nIbn Muflih said in \n    al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah (2/319): \nIf one finishes reciting \n    Soorat al-Naas, he should not add al-Faatihah and five verses of al-Baqarah. \n    He said in the commentary: Perhaps he did not have any proven saheeh report. \n    And it was said: it is permissible after the du’aa’, or it is mustahabb. \nAl-Qaadi said, after \n    mentioning the meaning of this report from the hadeeth of Anas which was \n    narrated by Ibn Abi Dawood – meaning the hadeeth which mentions “The one who \n    reaches (the end) then keeps going” –: The apparent meaning of this is that \n    this is mustahabb. The answer is that what is meant is to encourage repeated \n    reading of the entire Qur’aan, time after time. There is nothing in this to \n    indicate that the du’aa’ should not come immediately after completing the \n    Qur’aan. End quote. \nImam Ibn al-Qayyim (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nSome of them understood \n    from this that every time one finishes reading the entire Qur’aan, he should \n    read the Opening of the Book (al-Faatihah) and three verses of Soorat \n    al-Baqarah, because he has reached the end then kept going by starting again \n    from the beginning. \nNone of the Sahaabah did \n    this, nor did the Taabi’een, and none of the imams regarded it as \n    mustahabb. \nThe hadeeth “The one who \n    reaches (the end) then keeps going” may mean either of two things. One is \n    that every time he reaches the end of a soorah or juz’, he keeps going and \n    moves on to the next; the second is that every time he completes the Qur’aan \n    he starts it again from the beginning. End quote. \nI’laam al-Muwaqqi’een \n    (4/306). \nThe second view is more \n    likely, based on the evidence, in sha Allaah, because there is no proven \n    evidence that such a thing is mustahabb, rather the apparent meaning of the \n    Sunnah indicates the opposite, as explained above. This view is favoured in \n    the answer to question no. 12032. \nBut we should note that \n    this issue, even though we have pointed out what we believe is more correct, \n    is a matter of ijtihaad, and it is not a definitive matter. If someone has \n    sound evidence that the salaf used to do that, or he believes that the \n    hadeeth narrated concerning it is saheeh, then he is not innovating or going \n    astray, rather he should not be denounced. \nSimilarly, those who follow \n    the view that we regard as more correct should not be denounced. Rather Imam \n    al-Jazari (may Allaah have mercy on him), who is one of those who say that \n    this is prescribed, says: \nWhatever the case, we do \n    not say that this is binding upon every reader, rather we say what our imam \n    Faaris ibn Ahmad and others said: Whoever does that has done well, and \n    whoever does not do it, there is no blame on him. End quote. \nAl-Nashr \n    (p. 704). \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The practice of reciting Surah Al-Fatiha (The Opening) and the early verses of Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow) after completing the Quran is seen positively within Islamic tradition, especially among various scholarly opinions. Here’s a detailed look into its significance, supported by relevant verses from the Quran.\n\n### Importance of Surah Al-Fatiha and Surah Al-Baqarah\n\n**Surah Al-Fatiha**: This surah, comprising just seven verses, holds a pivotal role in Islamic prayer (Salah). It serves as an opening prayer and is an expression of a believer's devotion, supplication for guidance, mercy, and grace from Allah. It is mentioned in various Hadith that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of this surah. \n\nFor example, a Hadith reported by Abu Huraira states: \"Allah said: ‘I have divided the prayer into two halves between Myself and My servant, and My servant shall have what he asks for.’ When the servant says: ‘All praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,’ Allah says: ‘My servant has praised Me’...\" (Narrated in Sahih Muslim).\n\n**Surah Al-Baqarah**: As the longest surah in the Quran, it serves multiple essential functions—addressing matters of faith, law, morality, guidance, and community. Notably, it mentions the importance of the Quran itself. \n\nThe verse from Surah Al-Baqarah states:\n> \"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:2)\n\nThis verse reaffirms the Quran's role as a guidance for the believers and signifies the importance of regular recitation and reflection upon its meanings.\n\n### Ruling on Reciting After Completion\n\n1. **Enduring Reflection and Recitation**: Post completion of the Quran, one should aspire to continue reflecting on its meanings and applying its lessons. Surah Al-Fatiha and the early verses of Al-Baqarah are essential in maintaining the spiritual momentum gained during the recitation of the Quran. They strengthen the believer’s connection to the Quran and reinforce its teachings.\n\n2. **Encouragement of Recitation**: As indicated in Surah Al-Baqarah:\n> \"And when My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me.” (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:186)\n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of keeping the lines of communication with Allah open through prayer and supplication. Reciting Surah Al-Fatiha and Al-Baqarah allows one to maintain a spiritual dialogue with Allah.\n\n3. **Spiritual Reinvigoration**: The act of reciting these Surahs after finishing the Quran can serve as a way to engage in ibadah (worship), reminding oneself of the core themes established throughout the Quran. The emphasis on continuous remembrance and supplication aligns with the teachings illustrated within Surah Al-Furqan:\n> \"And those who say, 'Our Lord, grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes and make us an example for the righteous.' \" (Surah Al-Furqan, 25:74)\n\nThis clarion call for righteous companions can find a resonant echo when one turns back to the Quran, initiating a cycle of prayer and reflection.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReciting Surah Al-Fatiha and initial verses of Surah Al-Baqarah after completing the Quran can be viewed as a commendable practice, reinforcing one's connection to Allah, facilitating continued worship, and encouraging ongoing engagement with the teachings of the Quran. This practice not only enhances spiritual ascension but also sustains the principles of piety and guidance emphasized in these Surahs.\n\nThe act of turning back to these significant Surahs after completing the Quran acts as an invitation for engagement with Allah and striving toward righteousness, thus fostering a deeper, continuous relationship with the divine scriptures."

        "question": "The Quran and medicine",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nAllah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with a religion that covers all aspects of life, as Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left us and no bird flapped its wings in the sky except that he had taught us some knowledge about it. \n(Narrated by Ahmad, 20399. See Majma’ al-Zawaa’id, 8/263. al-Haythami said: it was narrated by al-Tabaraani and its men are the men of saheeh apart from Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Yazeed al-Muqri’ who is thiqah (trustworthy)). \nIslam came to meet the needs of people in all aspects of their lives.  \nSecondly: \nWhat is narrated in the Sunnah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) complements what is in the Quran. These two sources are the principal sources for Muslims. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that Allah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down a cure for it. \nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down a cure for it.” \nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 5678. \nThirdly: \nWhat the questioner has mentioned, that some Muslims say that many remedies were discovered through the Holy Quran, we say that this is somewhat exaggerated. \nThe Quran is not a book of medicine or geography or geology as some Muslims like to say to westerners. Rather it is a book of guidance for mankind and one of the greatest of its miracles is its eloquence and the ideas and concepts that it contains. This is the main aspect of its miraculous nature. Allah revealed it to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at a time when eloquence had reached great heights, so this book came to amaze those people and challenge them in their area of expertise, to prove to them that it was from Allah. \nThis is not strange, and it is nothing new in religion. The signs of Moosa (peace be upon him) – his stick and his hand – were of the kind that was prevalent during his time, which was magic (sihr). The signs of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) – raising the dead and healing the blind and lepers – were of the kind that his people were skilled in and that was widespread among them, which was medicine. \nHence we say that the greatest feature of the Quran is its eloquence. Scholars nowadays are still discovering new aspects of its eloquence through their study of its verses.  \nThis does not mean that there is no other miraculous aspects to the Quran. Rather in some verses Allah mentions things about the design of the human body, the stages of its creation and development, some natural phenomena, etc. \nBut with regard to cures for various diseases, as the questioner mentions, the Quran is a healing for the believers. This includes healing the heart (mental or spiritual disease) and physical healing. Allah mentions honey in the Quran and says that it is a healing for mankind. And He mentions the principle of preserving good health and guarding against sickness. So whoever says that the Quran says a lot about medicine in this regard is right, but whoever goes beyond that is exaggerating. Rather this is a kind of exaggeration coined by some Muslims. The Quran is not a book of medicine. There are some diseases that did not exist previously, so how could their cure come – according to what the questioner says – before they appeared? \nFourthly: \n(a)The following are some of the verses which indicate that the Quran is healing:\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe”\n[al-Isra’ 17:82]\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nAllah says “And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe”. The correct view is that the word min (translated here as “of”) serves to explain the nature of the Quran as a whole, not to refer to parts of it and not other parts.  \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Quran, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your hearts”\n[Yoonus 10:57]\nThe Quran is the complete healing for all mental, spiritual and physical diseases, all diseases of this world and the Hereafter. But not everyone is guided to use it for the purpose of healing. If the sick person uses the Quran for healing in the proper way, and applies it to his disease with sincerity, faith, complete acceptance and firm conviction, fulfilling all its conditions, then no disease can resist it. \nHow can disease resist the words of the Lord of heaven and earth which, if He had revealed it to the mountains they would have crumbled and if He had revealed it to the earth it would have broken it apart? There is no sickness, spiritual or physical, but in the Quran there is that which indicates its remedy, its cause and how to protect against it for those who are blessed with understanding of His Book. \nZaad al-Ma’aad, 4/352 \n(b)The Quran contains the treatment for hearts and souls, and as such it is a means of expelling all sicknesses from the body. In this regard the Quran is a healing and a remedy for many diseases.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWe and others have tried this on many occasions and we have seen that it works in ways that physical remedies do not. Indeed we now regard physical medicine as the doctors regard folk medicine. This is in accordance with the law of divine wisdom, not contrary to it, but the causes of healing are many and varied. When the heart is in contact with the Lord of the Worlds, the Creator of the disease and the remedy, the Controller of nature Who directs it as He wills, he has other remedies apart from the remedies that are sought by the heart that is far away from Him and that turns away from Him. It is known that when a person’s spirits are high and his body is in good shape, they cooperate in warding off disease and suppressing it, so if a person is in high spirits and physical good shape, finds comfort in being close to his Creator, loving Him, enjoying remembrance of Him (dhikr), devoting all his strength and power for His sake and focusing on Him, seeking His help, putting his trust in Him, how can anyone deny that this is the greatest medicine or that this spiritual power gives him the means to ward off pain and defeat it completely? No one would deny this but the most ignorant of people, those who are furthest away from Allah and the most hard-hearted and unaware of human nature. \nZaad al-Ma’aad 4/12 \n(c)In the Quran there is Soorat al-Faatihah which is a ruqyah to be recited as a prayer for healing.\nIt was narrated that Abu Sa’eed (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “A group of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out on a journey and traveled until they stopped in (the land of) one of the Arab tribes. They asked them for hospitality but they refused to welcome them. The chief of that tribe was stung by a scorpion and they tried everything but nothing helped them. Some of them said, ‘Why don’t you go to those people who are camped (near us), maybe you will find something with them.’ So they went to them and said, ‘O people, our chief has been stung by a scorpion and we have tried everything but nothing helped him. Can any of you do anything?’ One of them said, ‘Yes, by Allah, I will recite ruqyah for him, but by Allah we asked you for hospitality and you did not welcome us, so I will not recite ruqyah for you until you give us something in return.’ Then they agreed upon a flock of sheep.’ Then he went and spat drily and recited over him Al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen [Soorat al-Faatihah]. (The chief) got up as if he was released from a chain and started walking, and there were no signs of sickness on him. They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e. the companions) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who performed the ruqyah said, ‘Do not divide them until we go to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him what happened, then wait and see what he tells us to do.’ So they went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, ‘How did you know that it (al-Faatihah) is a ruqyah?’ Then he added, ‘You have done the right thing. Share out (the flock of sheep) and give me a share too.’ And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled.”   \nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 2156; Muslim, 2201 \nIbn al-Qayyim said concerning Soorat al-Faatihah:  \nWhoever is guided by Allah and is given good insight to understand the deep meaning of this soorah and what it contains of Tawheed, understanding of the Divine nature, the names, attributes and actions of Allah, the Divine decree, the Resurrection, rejecting any misconception that undermines the concept of the Oneness of the Divine Lordship and Divine nature, complete trust in Allah and referring all one’s affairs to the One Who has full control of all things – to Him be all praise, for all goodness is in His hand and to Him all things return – and feeling in need of Him in seeking guidance that is the root of happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, will realize the connection between the contents of this soorah and bringing good and warding off evil. He will understand that ultimate goodness and blessing is connected to this soorah and is dependent upon understanding it and acting upon it. Then this soorah will make him independent of many other kinds of medicine and ruqyah, and it will open the door to a great deal of goodness and ward off a great deal of evil. \nZaad al-Ma’aad, 4/347 \n(d)The Quran mentions the principle of maintaining good health.\nIbn al-Qayyim said: \nThe basic principles of medicine are three: prevention, maintaining good health, and removing harmful substances from the body. \nAllah has mentioned them all together, to His Prophet and his ummah in three places in His Book. \nHe prevented the sick person from using water lest it harm him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum)”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:43]\nAllah allowed the sick person to do tayammum to protect him, just as He permitted it to the one who has no water. \nAllah says concerning the maintenance of good health: \n“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days”\n[al-Baqarah 2:185]\nThe traveller is allowed to break his fast during Ramadaan, to protect his health lest the combination of fasting and the difficulties of travel weakens him and affects his health. \nAnd Allah said concerning the removal of harmful things by shaving the head of the person in ihraam (for Hajj or ‘Umrah): \n“And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Sawm (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity — feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)”\n[al-Baqarah 2:196]\nSo if a person has an ailment in his scalp when he is in ihraam, he is permitted to shave his head and remove the harmful thing or the bad substance that is causing lice to develop – as happened to Ka’b ibn ‘Ajrah – or if it is causing sickness to develop. \nThese three matters are the basic principles of medicine. We have mentioned an example of each one in order to point out the blessing of Allah to His slaves in preventing sickness, protecting their health and removing harmful substances from them, as a mercy and kindness towards His slaves, for He is the Most Kind, Most Merciful. \nZaad al-Ma’aad, 1/164, 165 \nIbn al-Qayyim said: On one occasion I discussed this with one of the chief doctors of Egypt, and he said: By Allah if I had to travel to the west to obtain these benefits that would not be too much – or words to that effect. \nIghaathat al-Lahfaan, 1/25 \n(e)Mention of honey in the Quran, and that it is a healing for mankind.\n Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“There comes forth from their [bees’] bellies, a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men”\n[al-Nahl 16:69]\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWith regard to the Prophet’s guidance concerning drinking, it is the most perfect guidance that maintains good health. He used to drink honey mixed with cold water. This is very healthy and no one can understand how healthy it is except the most prominent doctors. For drinking honey on an empty stomach dissolves phlegm, cleanses the stomach, reduces its viscosity, washes away waste matter, warms it up a little and opens its inlet and exit. It has a similar effect on the liver, kidneys and urethra. It is more beneficial to the stomach than any other kind of sweet that enters it. However it may cause side effects in people who are suffering from jaundice because it is hot and jaundice is hot, so it may aggravate it; in order to avoid this effect vinegar may be added, then honey will become beneficial and drinking it will be more useful than many or most of the drinks that are made from sugar, especially for those who are not used to these drinks, for if they drink them they will not suit them as well as honey does, or even come close.  \nWith regard to drinking it when it is collected and well-prepared, this is one of the most beneficial things for the body, and one of the greatest means of preserving health; it is very refreshing and energizing, and it is good for the liver and heart. If it is well-prepared it provides nutrition and makes food reach all parts of the body in the most effective manner. \nZaad al-Ma’aad, 4/224, 225 \nAnd he said (may Allah have mercy on him): \nHoney contains great benefits, for it cleanses impurities from the veins and stomach etc, whether it is eaten or applied to the skin. It is good for the elderly, the phlegmatic and those whose humours are cold and wet. It is nourishing, aids digestion, energizes, makes unpleasant medicine palatable, is good for the liver and chest, is a diuretic and helps to ease coughs caused by phlegm. If it is drunk warm mixed with rosewater it is beneficial for one who has been bitten by a scorpion or who has consumed opium. If it is drunk on its own mixed with water, it is good for the one who has been bitten by a rabid dog or eaten poisonous mushrooms. If fresh meat is placed in honey, it will stay fresh for three months, as will cucumbers, pumpkins and eggplants. Many fruits can be kept in it for six months. It will also preserve a dead body, and it is known as the trustworthy preserver. If the body of one who is afflicted with lice is painted with honey, it will kill the lice and their eggs. It makes the hair long, beautiful and smooth. If used on the eyes like kohl it clears the vision. If the teeth are brushed with it, it whitens the teeth and makes them bright, and keeps the gums healthy. It opens the veins and induces menstruation. If taken on an empty stomach it takes away phlegm and cleanses the stomach, clearing away waste matter and restoring the correct temperature. It does likewise to the liver, kidneys and urethra.\n As well as all this, it has no side effects and causes little harm. It may cause side effects in one who is suffering from jaundice, but that may be counteracted by vinegar and the like, in which case it becomes very beneficial for him.\n It is a kind of nourishment, a kind of medicine, a kind of drink, a kind of sweet, a kind of cream. There is nothing that has been created for us for a similar purpose that is better than it, or even comes close. The ancient peoples relied on it, and in most of the books of the ancients there is no mention of sugar at all and it was unknown to them, for it is something that is very new. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to drink honey mixed with water on an empty stomach, and this is the secret of maintaining good health that no one can understand except one who is intelligent and blessed.\nZaad al-Ma’aad, 4/33, 34.",
        "predicted_answer": "The relationship between the Quran and medicine is multifaceted, as it encompasses spiritual, physical, and ethical dimensions. In Islam, health and well-being are viewed as significant blessings from Allah, and seeking knowledge, including in the fields of medicine and healthcare, is not only encouraged but considered an act of worship. Below are several aspects highlighting how the Quran addresses the concept of health, healing, and medicine, supported by relevant verses.\n\n### 1. **Seeking Healing and the Role of Allah**\nThe Quran emphasizes that ultimate healing comes from Allah. Believers are encouraged to seek treatment for their ailments while maintaining a belief in God's ability to heal. This relationship between faith and healing is underscored in several verses:\n\n- **Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:80-84)**: “And He (Allah) heals me when I am sick, and who will make me die, then give me life again...” This verse highlights that healing is attributed to Allah, indicating that believers should trust in His power while seeking medical treatment.\n\n### 2. **Lawful and Unlawful Considerations in Medical Practices**\nThe Quran makes distinctions between what is lawful (halal) and unlawful (haram) concerning food, which indirectly impacts health and medicine. Clean and permissible substances are encouraged for consumption:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:4-5)**: This verse elaborates on the lawful foods, promoting what is clean for both physical nourishment and spiritual wellness. The emphasis on consuming clean and lawful food can be interpreted as foundational for maintaining good health.\n\n### 3. **God’s Mercy and Forgiveness in Health**\nThe Quran also reflects on God’s mercy, highlighting that even in illness, believers should remain hopeful and seek forgiveness:\n\n- **Surah Al-Anbya (21:90-94)**: This passage discusses those who prayed to Allah in love and awe, and received blessings, including curing illness. It encourages a connection to God through prayer, especially in times of health crises.\n\n### 4. **Physical Cleanliness and its Importance in Prayer**\nIslamic teachings emphasize cleanliness not just for spiritual reasons but also for physical health:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:6)**: The importance of washing before prayer—hands, face, and feet, among others—demonstrates an aspect of hygiene essential for health. In situations where water is not available, the alternative of using dust (tayammum) is provided. This indicates flexibility in maintaining health and cleanliness, even in adverse conditions.\n\n### 5. **Illness and Divine Testing**\nThe concept of illness as a test from God is also prevalent in Islam, suggesting that health issues can serve a higher spiritual purpose:\n\n- **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**: \"And He knows that some among you will be sick, and some will be traveling...\" This verse shows understanding towards the sick and highlights the importance of remaining devoted to God and reading the Quran even in times of ill health.\n\n### 6. **Ethics of Healing**\nIslam encourages the pursuit of medical knowledge and its application ethically. The pursuit of good health and alleviation of suffering is a key ethical principle in Islamic medicine:\n\n- **Surah Al-Mu'minun (23:18-22)**: This passage reflects on how Allah provides sustenance and resources essential for life, including the cultivation of fruit and grains. Health professionals are encouraged to utilize these provisions in responsible and ethical. \n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the Quran outlines principles that not only encourage seeking medical attention but also emphasize reliance on God for healing and well-being. The intertwining of spiritual and physical health reminds Muslims of the holistic nature of well-being. Ethical considerations in health, cleanliness, and lawful consumption further guide practitioners and individuals in their health choices. The verses discussed reflect the expansive relationship between Islam and medicine, illustrating that caring for one’s health is a divine duty. \n\n**References:** \n- Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:80-84)\n- Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:4-5, 5:6)\n- Surah Al-Anbya (21:90-94)\n- Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)\n- Surah Al-Mu'minun (23:18-22)"

        "question": "Can We Read Quran While Lying Down?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with reading the Quran from the Mus-haf whilst lying down.  \nAl-Bukhari (7549) and Muslim (301) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to lie in ‘Aishah’s lap and recite Quran. \nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Sahهh Muslim: \n“This indicates that it is permissible to read Quran when reclining and lying down.” \nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan said: \n“There is nothing wrong with reading the Quran when lying down, whether one is lying on a bed or on the ground. There is nothing wrong with that. A person may recite Quran whatever position he is in, standing or sitting or reclining, and whether he has wudu or is in a state of minor impurity, if he is reciting from memory. But if he is reading from the Mus-haf, then it is not permissible for the one who does not have wudu to touch the Mus-haf unless he has done wudu.” (Al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan)\nFor more information about the issues related to lying down and sitting, please see these answers: 294088 , and 13822 . \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Question: Can We Read the Quran While Lying Down?\n\nIn Islam, reading the Quran is a highly revered act of worship, and the conditions under which a person reads it can vary. While traditional practices emphasize reverence and respect, the physical position of the reader—such as standing, sitting, or lying down—is not explicitly restricted in the Quran or Hadiths. Here, we will explore the implications and references for reading the Quran, particularly in a lying down position.\n\n#### 1. **Flexibility in Position**\nThe Quran mentions the importance of recitation and reflection at various times and states that one should recite it as much as one finds easy. In Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20), Allah addresses the varied circumstances of the believers:\n\n> “So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily.” \n> \n> **(Surah Al-Muzzammil, Ayah 20)**\n\nThis verse indicates Allah’s understanding of the varied conditions people may be in, which includes physical states like sickness or fatigue. Therefore, if someone is lying down due to illness or fatigue and wishes to recite the Quran, it is acceptable.\n\n#### 2. **Recommended Conduct While Reciting**\nWhile the physical position is flexible, the intent and respect shown during recitation hold greater significance. In Surah Al-Isra (17:106-109), Allah elaborates on the importance of reciting the Quran thoughtfully:\n\n> \"We have divided the Qur'an into parts that you may recite it to men slowly, with deliberation...\"\n>\n> **(Surah Al-Isra, Ayah 106)**\n\nThis suggests that the quality and mindfulness of recitation are more critical than the physical position.\n\n#### 3. **Respect and Reverence**\nReading while reclining or lying down may not be seen as the most dignified way of engaging with the sacred text, but it is not prohibited. Many scholars advise maintaining a level of respect, which can include being in a clean place or facing the Qibla, yet they do not specify prohibiting lying down as a position to read. \n\nIn different cultural practices, some may emphasize sitting up in respect, but the core message from Islamic texts encourages accessibility and ease, especially in circumstances like healing or exhaustion.\n\n#### 4. **Mindfulness and Concentration**\nIt is also worth noting that when reading the Quran, one should strive to be mentally engaged and attentive. If reading while lying down leads to distraction or reduces concentration, it may be preferable to adopt a more upright position. Moreover, in Surah Al-A'raf (7:204), there's an emphasis on listening attentively when the Quran is recited:\n\n> \"When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence...\"\n>\n> **(Surah Al-A'raf, Ayah 204)**\n\nThis underscores the importance of engagement, regardless of physical position.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, it is permissible to read the Quran while lying down, especially in circumstances that necessitate comfort, such as illness or fatigue. The emphasis should be on the intention of reciting the Quran thoughtfully and respectfully. Ideally, one should aim to find a position that allows for the best focus and engagement with the text. The Quran encourages reflection and ease in worship, allowing flexibility in how one engages with it."

        "question": "Quoting a verse of Qur’aan as a proverb",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    There is nothing wrong with quoting Qur’aanic verses as \n    proverbs, if that is for a valid purpose, such as saying This is something \n    that “will neither nourish nor avail against hunger” or saying \n    “Thereof (the earth) We created you, and into it We shall return you, and \n    from it We shall bring you out once again”, if one wants to remind \n    people of their relationship with the earth, from which they were created \n    and to which they will return. If quoting Qur’aan as a proverb is not \n    intended by way of mockery and making fun, there is nothing wrong with it. \n    But if it is done by way of mockery and making fun, as the questioner \n    mentions, then this is regarded as apostasy from Islam, because the one who \n    makes fun of the Qur’aan or of any mention of Allaah, may He be glorified \n    and exalted, has apostatized from Islam, as Allaah says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \n\n    “Say: “Was it at Allaah ( \n    عز و جل \n    ), and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, \n    etc.) and His Messenger (صلى \n    الله عليه وسلم) that you were mocking?”\n\n    66. Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had \n    believed”\n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:65-66]\n\n    It is essential to venerate and respect the Qur’aan, but that does not mean that one cannot quote it as a proverb in a proper and respectful manner. There is nothing wrong with that, but using it by way of mockery and making fun is apostasy from Islam. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Quoting verses of the Qur'an as proverbs is a common practice in Islamic culture, often to provide moral lessons or guidance based on divine wisdom. The wisdom encapsulated in these verses can resonate at various levels with believers and may also serve as proverbs due to their succinctness and profoundness.\n\n### Key Verses That Can Be Used as Proverbial Wisdom\n\n1. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:67)**:\n   > \"Who are neither prodigal nor miserly in their spending but follow a middle path.\"\n   \n   This verse emphasizes the virtue of moderation in financial dealings. It teaches that both extreme extravagance and excessive frugality are undesirable, and instead promotes a balanced approach to spending.\n\n   **Citation**: Surah Al-Furqan, Ayah 67\n\n2. **Surah Luqman (31:17)**:\n   > \"O my son, fulfil your moral obligations, bid what is known to be right and forbid what is wrong, and bear with patience what befalls you. These are indeed acts of courage and resolve.\"\n   \n   This verse encapsulates a vital proverb about the essence of duty to oneself and to society, emphasizing the importance of moral courage and patience in the face of challenges.\n\n   **Citation**: Surah Luqman, Ayah 17\n\n3. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:74)**:\n   > \"And those who say, 'Our Lord, grant us from among the wives and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes and make us an example for the righteous.'\"\n   \n   This is a beautiful supplication that underlines the importance of family and righteous companionship, providing a framework for understanding the value of supportive relationships and community.\n\n   **Citation**: Surah Al-Furqan, Ayah 74\n\n4. **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:25-26)**:\n   > \"They will hear no nonsense there or talk of sin.\"\n   \n   This verse serves as a comforting reminder about the eternal peace of Paradise, where one is free from negativity and wrongdoing, and indicates the value of virtuous speech and conduct.\n\n   **Citation**: Surah Al-Waqi'ah, Ayah 25-26\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing these verses as proverbs can offer guidance in various scenarios in life, underscoring principles such as moderation, moral integrity, patience, the importance of family, and the pursuit of righteousness. Such verses can serve not only as reminders for individual conduct but also as a collective ethical framework for the community. These teachings encourage reflection, personal growth, and adherence to the values laid out by Islam. \n\nIn summary, the Qur'an provides profound insights that serve well as proverbs; ones that can guide Muslims in both their personal lives and social conduct."

        "question": "The revelation of the Quran in seven styles (ahruf, sing. harf)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly :\nyou should note, may Allah bless you, that the Quran was revealed in one style at the beginning, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kept asking Jibreel until he taught him seven styles, all of which were complete. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas who narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibreel taught me one style and I reviewed it until he taught me more, and I kept asking him for more and he gave me more until finally there were seven styles.”\n(narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3047; Muslim, 819) \nSecondly, what is meant by styles (ahruf, sing. harf)? \nThe best of the scholarly opinions concerning what is meant is that there are seven ways of reciting the Quran, where the wording may differ but the meaning is the same; if there is a different meaning then it is by way of variations on a theme, not opposing and contradiction. \nThirdly: \nSome of the scholars said that what was meant by ahruf was the dialects of the Arabs, but this is far-fetched, because of the hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab who said: “I heard Hishaam ibn Hakeem reciting Soorat al-Furqaan in a manner different from that in which I used to recite it and the way in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me to recite it.  I was about to argue with him whilst he was praying, but I waited until he finished his prayer, and then I tied his garment around his neck and seized him by it and brought him to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I heard this man reciting Soorat-al-Furqaan in a way different to the way you taught it to me.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, ‘Recite it,’ and he recited it as I had heard him recite it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘It was revealed like this.’ Then he said to me, ‘Recite it,’ so I recited it and he said, ‘It was revealed like this.’ This Qur'aan has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way that is easiest for you.’”\n(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2287; Muslim, 818) \nIt is known that Hishaam was Asadi Qurashi (i.e., from the clan of Bani Asad in Quraysh) and ‘Umar was ‘Adawi Qurashi (i.e., from the clan of Bani ‘Adiyy in Quraysh). Both of them were from Quraysh and Quraysh had only one dialect. If the difference in ahruf (styles) had been a difference in dialects, why would two men of Quraysh have been different? \nThe scholars mentioned nearly forty different opinions concerning this matter! Perhaps the most correct is that which we have mentioned above. And Allah knows best. \nFourthly: \nIt seems that the seven styles were revealed with different wordings, as indicated by the hadeeth of ‘Umar, because ‘Umar’s objection was to the style, not the meaning. The differences between these styles are not the matter of contradiction and opposition, rather they are synonymous, as Ibn Mas’ood said: “It is like one of you saying halumma, aqbil or ta’aal (all different ways of saying ‘Come here’).” \nFifthly: \nWith regard to the seven recitations (al-qiraa’aat al-saba’), this number is not based on the Quran and Sunnah, rather it is the ijtihaad of Ibn Mujaahid (may Allah have mercy on him). People thought that al-ahruf al-saba’ (the seven styles) were al-qiraa’aat al-saba’ (the seven recitations) because they happened to be the same number. But this number may have come about coincidentally, or it may have been done deliberately by Ibn Mujaahid to match what was narrated about the number of styles (ahruf) being seven. Some people thought that the styles (ahruf) were the recitations, but this is a mistake. No such comment is known among the scholars. The seven recitations are one of the seven styles, and this is the style that ‘Uthmaan chose for all the Muslims.  \nSixthly: \nWhen ‘Uthmaan made copies of the Quran, he did so according to one style (harf), but he omitted the dots and vowel points so that some other styles could also be accommodated.  So the Mus-haf that was copied in his time could be read according to other styles, and whatever styles were accommodated by the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan remained in use, and the styles that could not be accommodated fell into disuse. The people had started to criticize one another for reciting differently, so ‘Uthmaan united them by giving them one style of the Quran. \nSeventhly: \nYour saying that Mujaahid’s different recitations meant the seven styles (ahruf) is not correct, as was said by Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah. (Majmoo’ah al-Fatawa, vol. 13, p. 210) \nEighthly: \nThe seven readers or reciters were: \n1-Naafi’ al-Madani\n2-Ibn Katheer al-Makki\n3-‘Aasim al-Kufi\n4-Hamzah al-Zayaat al-Kufi\n5-Al-Kisaa’i al-Kufi\n6-Abu ‘Amr ibn al-‘Ala’ al-Basri\n7-‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Aamir al-Shaami\nThe ones who have the strongest isnaad in recitation are Naafi’ and ‘Aasim. \nThe most eloquent are Abu ‘Amr and al-Kisaa’i. \nWarsh and Qaaloon narrated from Naafi’.\nHafs and Shu’bah narrated from ‘Aasim. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The concept of the Qur'an being revealed in seven styles (often referred to as *ahruf*) is a significant aspect of Islamic teachings concerning the Qur'an's nature and transmission. These styles facilitate the Qur'an's comprehension and recitation for diverse audiences, considering their linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Below, I will outline this concept and support it with the relevant verses as per your request.\n\n### 1. The Revelation in Multiple Styles\n\nThe notion that the Qur'an was revealed in seven ahruf is attributed to a hadith reported by Ibn 'Abbas and other companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Prophet (pbuh) confirmed that the Qur'an was revealed in various forms to accommodate the linguistic diversity of the early Muslim community, ensuring that people could understand and recite it in a manner that aligned with their dialects and speech patterns. This served both to facilitate learning and to enhance memorization.\n\n### 2. Supportive Verses\n\n1. **Surah Al-A'raf (7:52-56)** discusses the clarity and distinctness of the Qur'an as a Book full of guidance and grace:\n   - **\"Indeed We had brought to them a Book distinct, replete with knowledge, and guidance and grace for men who believe.\"**\n   - **Reference:** Surah Al-A'raf, Ayah 52\n\n2. **Surah Al-Hijr (15:87)** explicitly mentions the seven oft-repeated verses and the majestic Qur'an:\n   - **\"We have indeed given you the seven oft-repeated (examples), and the majestic Qur'an.\"**\n   - **Reference:** Surah Al-Hijr, Ayah 87\n\n### 3. The Importance of the Ahruf\n\nThe existence of multiple styles within the Qur'an is understood as significant in terms of:\n- Accessibility: It helps cater to the varied linguistic abilities of its audience.\n- Recitation: Different ahruf allow for variations in pronunciation and recitation methodologies, enriching the experience of engaging with the text.\n- Depth of Meaning: Some ahruf convey nuances in meaning that might not be immediately clear in one style, allowing for a broader interpretation of certain verses.\n\n### 4. Guidelines for Reading and Reflecting\n\nThe Qur'an instructs its readers to approach the text with an open heart and a mindset of humility, as indicated in **Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206)**:\n   - **\"When the Qur'an is recited listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.\"**\n   - **\"Meditate on your Lord inwardly with humility and trepidation, reciting His Book softly, morning and evening, and be not negligent.\"**\n   - **Reference:** Surah Al-A'raf, Ayah 204-206\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe seven styles of the Qur'an, represented through the concept of *ahruf*, play an essential role in helping believers understand and connect with the divine messages conveyed within the text. The teachings encourage respectful and reflective reading practices, emphasizing the Qur'an's unique nature as both a spiritual guide and a linguistic masterpiece. \n\nThese insights indicate that the Qur'an's varying styles are not merely about linguistic differences but serve a higher purpose in making its wisdom accessible to all those who seek guidance."

        "predicted_answer": "Musaajalah (مُسَاجَلَة) refers to a form of a game played by reciting verses from the Qur'an, where a person who has memorized the Qur'an is asked to quote a verse that begins with the same letter that a previous verse ended with. The practice raises questions regarding its permissibility in Islamic law.\n\n### Rulings on Musaajalah\n\n1. **Permissibility of the Activity**:\n   - In Islam, it is essential to remember that anything that promotes the recitation and memorization of the Qur'an is generally considered meritorious. The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of recitation and reflection on its verses. In Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:14-18), it is highlighted that the collection and recitation of the Qur'an is the responsibility of Allah: \n\n     > \"In fact man is a witness against himself, Whatever the excuses he may offer. Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste. Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\" \n     > *(Surah Al-Qiyamah, 75:14-18)*\n\n   - This verse underscores the sanctity of reciting the Qur'an and can support the premise that engaging in activities that revolve around its recitation, including Musaajalah, could be permissible, especially if it enhances memorization and understanding.\n\n2. **Encouragement of Recitation**:\n   - Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:4-6) encourages believers to recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly, as this aids in understanding and reflecting upon the words:\n\n     > \"Or a little more, and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly. We shall soon entrust to you a message heavy (with solemnity). Surely in the watches of the night the soul is most receptive and words more telling.\"\n     > *(Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:4-6)*\n\n   - This verse implies that reciting the Qur'an in contemplative manners is highly rewarded, thus reinforcing the positive effects of engaging in various forms of recitation.\n\n3. **Avoidance of Potential Issues**:\n   - It is essential, however, to maintain the integrity and respect of the Qur'an. The manner in which the verses are recited should not lead to mockery or trivialization. In Surah Al-Mujadila (58:11), it is stated that a believer should honor the commandments of God:\n\n     > \"O you who believe, when you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room; God will give you more room to spread.\"\n     > *(Surah Al-Mujadila, 58:11)*\n\n   - While Musaajalah can be an enjoyable way to engage with the Qur'an, it is crucial that it upholds its dignity as a holy text.\n\n4. **Absence of Explicit Prohibition**:\n   - There is no specific verse in the Qur'an or in Hadith that explicitly prohibits such a practice. On the contrary, since it revolves around the recitation of the Qur'an, it can be argued that it becomes a form of remembrance (dhikr) and thus can be seen as an encouraged act.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe practice of Musaajalah is, therefore, permissible as it fosters a relationship with the Qur'an and encourages recitation, provided that it is conducted respectfully without leading to any form of irreverence. Engaging in this activity not only serves to remember and quote the Qur'an but also enhances one's memorization and understanding of the verses being recited, which is in line with the principles laid out in the Qur'an. Thus, while this activity can be seen as positive and beneficial, the manner in which it is performed should always be considered to maintain respect for the sacred text."

Its challenge to mankind and the jinn to \n    produce something similar to it still stands. Allaah says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \n“Say: If the mankind and \n    the jinn were together to produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not \n    produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another”\n[al-Isra’ 17:88]. \nIbn al-Qayyim discussed the \n    number 7 in his book Zaad al-Ma’aad fi Huda Khayr al-‘Ibaad (4/90) \n    when he discussed the hadeeth in al-Saheehayn: “The one who eats seven dates \n    of al-‘Aaliyah in the morning will not be harmed that day by poison or \n    witchcraft.” He said: As for specifying the number seven, it has to do with \n    the creation and sahr’i commands of Allaah. Allaah created seven heavens, \n    seven earths and seven days, and man’s creation is completed in seven \n    stages; Allaah has prescribed that His slaves should walk around the Ka’bah \n    seven times (tawaaf) and go back and forth between Safa and Marwah seven \n    times (saa’i), and stone the jamaraat with seven pebbles each, and the \n    takbeeraat of Eid are seven in the first rak’ah. The Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Instruct your children to pray when \n    they are seven.” When the boy reaches the age of seven he should be given \n    the choice between his parents according to one report, and according to \n    another report, his father has more right to him than his mother; according \n    to a third report his mother has more right to him. When he was sick, the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered that water \n    from seven skins be poured on him. Allaah sent the wind against the people \n    of ‘Aad for seven days. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) asked Allaah to help him by sending upon his people seven (years) \n    like the seven years of Yoosuf – i.e., seven years of famine. Allaah likened \n    the reward of one who gives charity to a grain that produces seven ears, in \n    each of which are one hundred grains. The number of ears of grain seen by \n    the companion of Yoosuf (in the dream) was seven, the number of years for \n    which they were cultivated was seven, and (the reward for charity) is \n    multiplied seven hundred fold or more.

This vision speaks to the importance of preparation and the cyclical nature of abundance and famine:\n\n> **\"The king said (to his courtiers): 'I saw seven fat cows in a dream being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven ears of corn that were green and seven others that were seared.'\"**\n> *(Surah Yusuf, Ayah 43)*\n\nThis underscores themes of foresight and preparedness within the context of the natural order.\n\n### 4. **The Seven Aayat (Verses) of Al-Fatiha**\nThe opening chapter of the Quran, *Surah Al-Fatiha*, contains seven verses that are recited in each unit of prayer (Salah). This chapter encapsulates the essence of worship and guidance sought from Allah, marking its integral role in Islamic practice.\n\n### 5. **Seven Earths**\nThere are also references to the existence of seven earths, suggesting a divine plan that includes multiple layers or realms of existence:\n\n> **\"It is He who has created for you what is on the earth and then turned to the heaven and made them seven heavens...\"**\n> *(Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 29)*\n\n### 6. **Sabbath Observance and Seven Days**\nThe mention of the Sabbath, where the Israelites were commanded to refrain from work, ties back to the number seven as a period associated with rest and spiritual reflection:\n\n> **\"Enquire of them about the town situated by the sea where, when they did not keep the Sabbath, the fish came up to the surface of the water for them; but on days other than the Sabbath the fish did not come.\"**\n> *(Surah Al-A'raf, Ayah 163)*\n\n### Conclusion\nThe recurrent theme of the number 7 signifies completion, perfection, and divine order in creation according to Islamic teachings. Each instance, whether it relates to the heavens, earth, sacred texts, or cycles of nature, underscores a holistic view of the world that reflects Allah's meticulous planning and the integration of spiritual practice into the rhythms of life. \n\nThrough these references and teachings, Muslims are reminded of the importance of balance, consciousness of God's creation, and the necessity of guidance in both personal behavior and broader community practices."

        "question": "Meaning of ‘Qul Huwallahu Ahad’ Being Equivalent to One-Third of the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Hadiths about Qul Huwallahu Ahad being one-third of the Quran\nThere follow some of the ahadith narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which state that Surat al-Ikhlas (Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad) is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.\n Al-Bukhari (6643) narrated from Abu Sa’id that a man heard another man reciting Qul Huwallahu Ahad and repeating it. The next morning he came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him about that. The man thought that it was too little, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.”\nMuslim (811) narrated from Abu’l-Darda that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Is any one of you unable to recite one-third of the Quran in one night?” They said, “How could anyone read one-third of the Quran?” He said, “Qul Huwallahu Ahad is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.”\n Muslim (812) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Gather together, for I will recite to you one-third of the Quran.” So those who could gather together gathered there, then the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out and recited Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad, then he went in. They said to one another, perhaps there has been some news from heaven on account of which he has gone inside (the house). Then the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out and said, “I told you that I was going to recite to you one-third of the Quran. Verily it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.” \nThe bounty of Allah is immense \nThe bounty of Allah is immense, and Allah has bestowed His bounty upon this ummah and has made up for its short life span by giving it more reward for simple deeds. It is strange that with some people, instead of this motivating them to do more good, this makes them apathetic and lazy in doing acts of worship, or they feel that this bounty and reward is strange and farfetched.\nHow Qul Huwallahu Ahad  is equivalent to one-third of the Quran\nThere is a difference between jaza (reward) and ijza (what is sufficient). What is making the brother confused is that he does not see the difference between them.\n Jaza means the reward which Allah gives for obeying Him.\n Ijza means what is sufficient and takes the place of something else.\nReciting Qul Huwallahu Ahad brings a reward equivalent to reciting one-third of the Quran, but it does not take the place of reading one-third of the Quran.\n If a person vows – for example – to read one-third of the Quran, it is not sufficient for him to read Qul Huwallahu Ahad, because it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran in reward, but not in terms of being sufficient or taking the place of reading one-third of the Quran.\n The same may be said of reciting it three times. If a person recites it three times in his prayer,  that does not mean that he does not have to recite al-Fatihah, even though he will be given the reward of reciting the whole Quran.\n A similar example is the reward given by the Lawgiver to one who offers a single prayer in the Sanctuary of Makkah, and that he will have the reward of one hundred thousand prayers. Does anyone take this divine bounty to mean that he does not have to pray for decades because he offered a single prayer in the Haram that is equivalent to one hundred thousand prayers?\n Rather this has to do with reward; as for what is sufficient, that is another matter altogether.\n Moreover, none of the scholars has ever said that there is no need for us to read the Quran or that Qul Huwallah Ahad is sufficient and takes the place of that. \nWhy Qul Huwallahu Ahad  is equivalent to one-third of the Quran \nThe correct scholarly view is that this surah has this great virtue because the Quran deals with three topics: one-third for rulings, one-third for promises and warnings, and one-third for the Divine names and attributes.\n This surah combines names and attributes.\n This is the view of Abu’l-‘Abbas ibn Surayj, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah stated that it was good in Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 17/103.\n The Muslim cannot do without the two other issues, which are the rulings and the promises and warnings. His knowledge cannot be complete unless he looks at the Book of Allah as a whole. The one who stops at Surat al-Ikhlas cannot know the other two matters.\n Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah – may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\"Rewards are of different types, just as wealth is of different types, such as food, drink, clothing, houses, money and so on. If a man possesses one type of wealth, to the value of one thousand dinars, that does not mean that he can do without the other types. Rather if he has wealth in the form of food, he also needs clothing and a place to live, etc. Similarly if it is a type other than money, he still needs other things. If he has nothing but money, he will need all kinds of wealth that are usually needed. In al-Fatihah there are the benefits of praise and du’a which people need, and Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad cannot replace it in that sense. Although its reward is very great, he cannot benefit from it unless he also recites the Opening of the Book (al-Fatihah) in his prayer. Hence if a person recites only Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad in his prayer, without al-Fatihah, his prayer is not valid. Even if he recited the whole of the Quran without al-Fatihah, his prayer would not be valid, because al-Faatihah refers to the basic needs that people cannot do without.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 17/131)\n And he said:\n“The people need the commands, prohibitions and stories that are in the Quran, even though Tawhid is greater than that. Man needs to know what he is enjoined to do and what he is forbidden to do; he needs to know what is enjoined upon him and the stories and promises and rewards. These cannot be replaced by anything else, and Tawhid cannot be replaced by these. The stories cannot take the place of the commands and prohibitions, and the commands and prohibitions cannot take the place of the stories. Rather everything that was sent down by Allah is beneficial and people need it.\n If a person recites Qul Huwallahu Ahad, he earns a reward equivalent to the reward of one-third of the Quran, but that does not mean that the reward is of the same kind as that earned by reading the rest of the Quran. Rather he may need the kind of reward that comes from reading the commands and prohibitions and stories, so Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad cannot take the place of all that.”  \nAnd he said:\n“The knowledge that is to be gained by reading the rest of the Quran cannot be gained by reciting this surah only. So whoever reads the whole Quran is better than one who simply recites this surah three times in the sense that he earns different kinds of reward, even though the one who recites Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad earns a reward equivalent to that reward, but it is of one type and does not include all the types that a person needs. This is like a man who has three thousand dinars and another who has food, clothing, accommodation and money equivalent to three thousand dinars.  The latter has that which will benefit him in all his affairs, whereas the former needs what the latter has, even though what he has is equivalent in value. Similarly, if he has the finest food, equivalent to three thousand dinars in value, he still needs clothing and accommodation, and weapons and tools that will ward off harm from him, and the like, which cannot be done with food alone.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 17/137-139)\n And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase \"Qul Huwallahu Ahad\" (Say, \"He is Allah, [who is] One\") is a verse from Surah Al-Ikhlas, which is the 112th chapter of the Quran. This Surah, composed of only four verses, encapsulates the Islamic creed regarding the oneness of God (Tawhid). \n\n### Meaning of \"Qul Huwallahu Ahad\"\n\n1. **Oneness of God**: The declaration that \"He is Allah, One\" emphasizes the monotheistic essence of Islam. It reaffirms that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, who is unique in His attributes. This is foundational to Islamic belief.\n  \n   - *Supporting Verse*: Surah Al-Ikhlas (Surah 112, Ayah 1) states: **\"Qul Huwallahu Ahad\"** (Say, \"He is Allah, [who is] One\").\n  \n2. **Unity of God**: The concept of God being \"Ahad\" implies that He has no partners, no equals, and no distinctions. This singular nature of Allah distinguishes Islamic theology from polytheistic beliefs.\n  \n   - *Supporting Verse*: Surah Al-Ikhlas (Surah 112, Ayah 2) continues: **\"Allahus-Samad\"** (Allah, the Eternal Refuge), indicating that Allah is Self-Sufficient and in need of no one.\n\n### Significance of Being Equivalent to One-Third of the Quran\n\nThe saying that \"Qul Huwallahu Ahad\" (Surah Al-Ikhlas) is equivalent to one-third of the Qur'an stems from various hadith that illustrate its doctrinal importance. It encompasses the essential aspects of Islamic belief regarding the oneness and uniqueness of Allah and serves as a profound declaration of faith.\n\n1. **Comprehensiveness of Faith**: The Surah's concise yet profound message covers the key aspects of Tawhid—Allah's oneness, His absolute nature, and rejection of all forms of polytheism. \n\n   - A famous narration by Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) mentions that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: *“By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, it is equivalent to a third of the Qur’an.”* (Narrated in Sahih Bukhari).\n\n2. **Spiritual Weight**: The repetition of Tawhid in daily prayers and its recitation in various acts of worship emphasizes its significance in creating a strong spiritual foundation for believers.\n\n   - The Surah is often recited in the daily prayers (Salah), and it is common to recite it frequently to reinforce the belief in the oneness of God.\n\n3. **Foundation of Islamic Theology**: In Islamic theology, understanding God's oneness is the cornerstone of being a believer. Every aspect of worship, command, and societal law in Islam derives from the principle of Tawhid found in Surah Al-Ikhlas, among other verses.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\"Qul Huwallahu Ahad\" represents a critical aspect of Islamic theology, reiterating the concept of God's oneness and uniqueness. Its designation as equivalent to one-third of the Quran underscores its foundational importance within the Islamic faith. \n\nIn summary, it is pivotal to recognize that while the Surah is only four verses in length, its message encapsulates the essence of the Quran's teachings regarding monotheism and the nature of Allah, making it invaluable to the understanding of Islamic belief. \n\n- **Citations**: \n   - Surah Al-Ikhlas (Surah 112, Ayah 1): \"Qul Huwallahu Ahad\"\n   - Hadith regarding its equivalency to one-third of the Qur'an can be found in Sahih Bukhari."

        "question": "Imam repeating some verses that speak of mercy or punishment",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    I do not know of anything wrong with that, because it \n    encourages the people to ponder and focus and benefit. It was narrated that \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) repeated the \n    verse (interpretation of the meaning): “If You punish them, they are Your \n    slaves, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You, are the All‑Mighty, \n    the All‑Wise” [al-Maa'idah 5:118] several times.  \n\n    To sum up: if it is done for a good reason and not for the \n    purpose of showing off, then there is nothing wrong with it, but if he \n    thinks that repeating it may annoy them or result in disturbing sounds such \n    as weeping, then it is better not to do that, so that there will not be any \n    distraction.

        "predicted_answer": "The question regarding an Imam repeating verses that speak of mercy or punishment in Islam touches upon themes prevalent in the Quran—where mercy is often juxtaposed with punishment. This duality serves a purpose in guiding believers towards righteousness and instilling a sense of accountability.\n\n### Mercy in the Quran\n\n1. **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:118-120)** states:\n   * \"If You punish them, indeed they are Your creatures; if You pardon them, indeed You are mighty and wise.\" \n   This verse emphasizes God's ability to pardon, showcasing His mercy. He reassures believers that on the Day of Judgment, the truthful will be rewarded. Hence, it underscores the significance of God’s mercy: it is unconditional, and He has the authority to forgive sins (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:118-120).\n\n2. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:70-73)** expresses:\n   * “Whose punishment will be doubled on the Day of Judgement, and he will live forever in disgrace, Except those who repent and come to believe and do the right, for whom God will turn evil into goodness... for God is forgiving and kind.\"\n   This illustrates that repentance can transform sinful acts into goodness, reinforcing the theme of mercy.\n\n### Punishment in the Quran\n\n1. In **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:178)**, it mentions:\n   * “O men of sense, you may haply take heed for yourselves. Ordained for you is retribution for the murdered... But he who is pardoned some of it by his brother should be dealt with equity... He who transgresses in spite of it shall suffer painful punishment.”\n   This verse indicates the gravity of sin and the importance of justice, establishing the concept that justice is vital for societal balance.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:16-20)** states:\n   * \"But the Pharaoh disobeyed the apostle; so We seized him with a grievous punishment... How then, if you disbelieve, will you preserve yourselves on the day which will even turn the children hoary?\"\n   This warning reinforces the idea of eventual accountability for one's actions, especially for those who defy divine guidance.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Anbya (21:46-50)** illustrates:\n   * \"Even if a whiff of the Lord's chastisement were to touch them they would surely say: 'Ah woe, alas, we were surely sinful.'\"\n   This suggests that even a hint of divine punishment leads to acknowledgment of wrongdoing, emphasizing the seriousness of ignoring divine warnings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nImams may repeat these verses to provide a balanced understanding of God's attributes—His mercy paired with His justice. This duality serves to motivate individuals towards good actions while making them aware of the consequences of their choices. The hope is that by understanding the vastness of God’s mercy and the severity of His punishment, believers will lead righteous lives.\n\nIn summary:\n- **Mercy** is emphasized in **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:118-120)** and **Surah Al-Furqan (25:70-73)**.\n- **Punishment** is detailed in **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:178)**, **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:16-20)**, and **Surah Al-Anbya (21:46-50)**.\n\nThis interplay between the themes encourages believers not only to seek forgiveness but also to remain vigilant in leading a life aligned with divine guidance."

        "question": "What is meant by reciting Qur’aan in a melodious voice",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In the saheeh Sunnah it is encouraged to recite the Qur’aan in a melodious voice, i.e., making the voice beautiful when reciting it. It does not mean that one should recite it as if singing, rather what is meant is that one should make the voice beautiful when reciting. For example the saheeh hadeeth says: “Allaah never listens to anything as He listens to a Prophet with a beautiful voice reciting the Qur’aan out loud” and “He is not one of us who does not recite Qur’aan in a melodious voice when reciting it out loud.” What this means is making the voice beautiful, as stated above. \nThe meaning of the hadeeth quoted above refers to listening in a manner that is befitting to Allaah and it is not like the attributes of His creation, as is the case with all His other attributes. It may be said of His listening that it is like His other attributes, that it is in a manner that is befitting to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and there is nothing like unto Him, may He be glorified and exalted. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “There is nothing like Him, and He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Seer” [al-Shoora 42:11]. Reciting in a melodious tone means reciting out loud and making the voice beautiful and with proper focus, so that the heart is moved, because the aim is to stir the heart with this Qur’aan, so that people will fear Allaah and so that they will find peace and benefit from it. An example of this is the story of Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be pleased with him), when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by him as he was reciting Qur’aan, and he started listening to him and said: “You have been given a beautiful voice like the beautiful voices of the family of Dawood.” When Abu Moosa came, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him about that and Abu Moosa said: If I had known, O Messenger of Allaah, that you were listening, I would have made it very beautiful indeed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not denounce him for that, which indicates that making the voice beautiful and being careful in reciting is something that is required, so that both the reader and the listener will focus properly and will both benefit. End quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "Reciting the Qur'aan in a melodious voice encompasses a range of practices and spiritual attitudes, primarily rooted in the appreciation of its beauty and depth. Below are several key points along with supporting verses from the Qur'an.\n\n### 1. **Importance of A Good Voice in Recitation**\nThe Qur'an encourages reciting its verses with a beautiful and melodious voice. This is meant to enhance the experience of both the reciter and the listener. The virtues of a pleasant voice are highlighted in the following verses:\n\n- **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:4-5)** states: \n  \"Or a little more and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly. We shall soon entrust to you a message heavy (with solemnity). Surely in the watches of the night the soul is most receptive and words more telling.\"  \n  This verse emphasizes the importance of deliberate, clear, and engaging recitation, especially at times of spiritual reflection such as in the night (73:6).\n\n### 2. **Listening to the Qur'an**\nThe practice of listening attentively to the Qur'an is also emphasized, as it allows the listener to absorb its meanings fully.\n\n- **Surah Al-A'raf (7:204)** instructs: \n  \"When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.\"  \n  This instruction enhances the understanding of the text's melodic quality as it requires concentration and humility.\n\n### 3. **Spiritual and Psychological Benefits**\nReciting the Qur'an in a melodious manner can have profound spiritual effects, enriching the soul and enhancing contemplation. \n\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:43-44)** describes the high regard for the Qur'an, stating: \n  \"Too glorious and high is He, too exalted for what they say! The seven skies, the earth, and all that lies within them, sing hallelujahs to Him...\"  \n  This verse indicates that all creation praises Allah, reflecting the importance of the Qur'an's recitation as a form of praise.\n\n### 4. **Proficiency in Recitation**\nThe way the Qur'an is recited includes proficiency in its phonetics, rules of Tajweed (the art of reciting the Qur'an), and melodic intonation, which can lead to a greater appreciation of its textual and thematic intricacies.\n\n- **Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:17-19)** highlights: \n  \"Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\"  \n  This stresses the importance of adhering to correct pronunciation and recitation practices in delivering the Qur'an’s message accurately.\n\n### 5. **Emotional Connection**\nMelodious recitation allows for emotional engagement with the text, facilitating a more profound connection to its themes and messages, ultimately leading to greater spiritual fulfillment.\n\n- **Surah Al-A'raf (7:202-206)** mentions: \n  \"These (revelations) are an evident proof from your Lord, and a guidance and grace for those who believe.\"  \n  This emphasizes that recitation, especially when done in a melodious way, can enhance spiritual guidance and grace.\n\n### Conclusion\nReciting the Qur’an in a melodious voice is not merely about aesthetics; it is an invitation to engage deeply with the text, reflect upon its meanings, and offer it back to the Creator in a manner that underscores its sacredness. Through guidelines in the Qur'an itself (such as those found in Surah Al-Muzzammil and Surah Al-A'raf), Muslims are encouraged to embrace this beautiful practice as part of their worship. The Qur'an is a wellspring of spiritual nourishment, and reciting it melodiously serves to elevate both the act and the message contained therein."

        "question": "Writing Qur’aan on mobile phones in something other than the ‘Uthmaani script",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to write the Mus-haf in anything other than the ‘Uthmaani script that was agreed upon at the time of the Sahaabah. \nAshhab said: Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Can the Mus-haf be written in the scripts that the people are used to. He said: No, it should be written as it was written initially.  \nThis was narrated by Abu ‘Amr al-Daani in al-Muqni’, then he said: None of the scholars of the ummah disagreed with that. \nImam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is haraam to differ from the script of the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan in ya’, waw, alif or any other letter. \nAl-Bayhaqi said in Shu’ab al-Eeeman: Whoever writes a Mus-haf should adhere to the letters as they are written in these Mus-hafs and not write them differently or change anything that they wrote, for they had more knowledge and were more sincere in heart and in speech, and were more trustworthy than us, so we should not think that we know better than them.   \nAnd he narrated that Zayd said: Recitation should be done in accordance with the Sunnah. Sulaymaan ibn Dawood al-Haashimi said: This means, do not differ from the people, rather follow the Sunnah. \nHe said: I heard something similar in meaning from Abu ‘Ubayd concerning that, and you see that the reciters never paid any attention to the way the Arabic language is written if that differs from the script of the Mus-haf and adhering to the script of the Mus-haf is one of the established ways that no one has the right to differ from. End quote. \nSee: al-Burhaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan by al-Zarkashi (1/379); al-Itqaan by al-Suyooti (4/146). \nAl-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Itqaan: They are unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to follow the script of the ‘Uthmaani Mus-hafs in [rules of tajweed]. End quote from al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan (1/250). \nAll of this applies if what is meant is writing the Mus-haf in full. \nBut when it comes to writing a verse or a few verses, and quoting them in books or magazines, and the like, there is nothing wrong with it, and this is what people do in their books, although it is better to use the script of the Mus-haf whenever possible, and to quote it directly from the Mus-haf. \nThe ruling on that has been explained in the answer to question no. 97741. \nBased on that: \nThere is nothing wrong with what you have mentioned about showing some verses on the screens of mobile phones in something other than the ‘Uthmaani script, if it is not possible to show them in the ‘Uthmaani script, but one should take care to make sure than the verses that are written in this manner are those that are usually easy to read, and not subject to mistakes. And one should take care to make sure that they are written correctly so that there will be no errors in reading and publishing them.  \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Writing or presenting the Qur'an on mobile phones in a script other than the ‘Uthmāni script raises questions regarding the preservation of the text and its meaning. To address this, we can refer to several key points derived from the Qur'anic text and understanding of scholarly interpretations.\n\n### 1. Preservation of the Qur'an\nThe Qur'an emphasizes its own preservation. References in Surah Al-Hijr demonstrate God's commitment to guarding the Qur'an from corruption:\n\n- **Surah Al-Hijr (15:9)**: \"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian.\" (15:9)\n\nThis verse implies that maintaining the integrity of the Qur'an is of paramount importance, which can extend to the manner in which it is inscribed or presented.\n\n### 2. Clarity of the Message\nThe Qur'an is described as a \"Mubeen\" (clear) message in various verses, suggesting that comprehension and clarity are fundamental aspects of its recitation and writing:\n\n- **Surah Az-Zukhruf (43:1-4)**: \"Ha, Meem. By the manifest Book, Indeed, We made it an Arabic Qur'an that you might understand.\" (43:1-3)\n\nThis indicates that the language and script of the Qur'an are integral to its understanding.\n\n### 3. The Uthmani Script\nThe ‘Uthmāni script is the standard written form of the Qur'an, established during the caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan. This script is recognized for its fidelity to the oral recitations of the Qur'an, which were preserved through multiple channels.\n\n- It is crucial to consider the implications of using other scripts that could alter pronunciation or meaning. Scholars often caution against this as it could lead to misinterpretations or changes in meaning.\n\n### 4. Accessibility and Modern Technology\nIn contemporary times, the use of mobile devices for reading the Qur'an has made the text more accessible. However, there is a balance to maintain between accessibility and fidelity to the original text. While QR codes or translations are helpful, they should always be clearly marked as translations or interpretations rather than substitutions for the original text.\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:2)**: \"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah.\" (2:2)\n\nThis underlines that the Qur'an serves as governmental guidance; thus, presenting it in any form must honor its message and integrity.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, while mobile technology can enhance access to the Qur'an, using scripts other than the established ‘Uthmāni script should be approached with caution. The preservation of the Qur'an's form and meaning is vital, as highlighted by verses stressing the book's protection and clarity. Thus, scholars and practitioner communities tend to advocate for the continued use of the ‘Uthmāni script, ensuring that both the letter and spirit of the Qur'an are accurately conveyed.\n\n### Key Verses Cited\n- **Surah Al-Hijr (15:9)**\n- **Surah Az-Zukhruf (43:1-4)**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:2)**\n\nThese references emphasize the importance of preservation, clarity, and the original text of the Qur'an as integral to its understanding."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Yes, if the Mus-haf becomes worn out and there is the fear \n    that it may be mishandled and may reach a state where it cannot be read and \n    benefited from, there is nothing wrong with burning it or burying it in pure \n    earth, because both were done by the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with \n    them). They buried Mus-hafs and they also burned them, when the Sahaabah \n    united the people upon a single Mus-haf, which was the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan \n    (may Allaah be pleased with him), and they burned all other Mus-hafs. \n\n    If a Mus-haf has reached a state where it cannot be benefited \n    from because it has become worn out, then it should either be buried in a \n    pure place, or be burned. Both were done by the companions of the Messenger \n    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).",
        "predicted_answer": "Burning pages of the Mus-haf (the written copy of the Quran) that have become worn out is a sensitive topic in Islam, as it pertains to the respect and preservation of the Holy Quran. While there isn't a specific verse in the Quran that explicitly addresses the act of burning worn-out copies of the Quran, the general Islamic principles regarding the respect for the Quran can be applied here.\n\n### Respect for the Quran:\n1. **Sacredness of the Quran**: The Quran is considered the literal word of God, and thus, all Muslims are required to treat it with the utmost respect. Surah Al-Hijr (15:9) emphasizes that Allah has taken it upon Himself to protect the Quran. The verse states:\n   - *\"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Quran and indeed, We will be its guardian.\"* (Al-Hijr, 15:9)\n\n2. **Handling Worn-Out Copies**: When copies of the Quran become worn out or damaged, it is recommended to handle them respectfully. Acts such as burning or discarding them need to be approached with caution. Typically, the traditional method of disposal for worn-out copies is to bury them in a clean place or to place them in water. This maintains the respect due to the words of the Quran.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n3. **Actions Against the Quran**: Any act that could be seen as disrespecting the Quran, including burning pages, is discouraged. Surah Al-Mursalat (77:28-30) portrays the disbelievers as deserving of punishment, which emphasizes the seriousness of disregarding God's revelations:\n   - *\"Alas, the woe that day for those who deny! 'Go to what you used to deny.'\"* (Al-Mursalat, 77:28-29)\n\n4. **Guidelines on Handling Loss of Texts**: Scholars have derived that when a Quranic text has deteriorated to the point where it cannot be used, it should be treated with honor. The principles of maintaining the sanctity of the text lead many to recommend alternative forms of disposal rather than burning.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile specific Quranic verses do not directly address the burning of worn-out pages, the principles of respect for the Quran assert that such actions should be avoided. Instead, more respectful methods, such as burial or water disposal, are recommended. Maintaining the sanctity and respect for the Quran remains central to Islamic teachings, and believers should act in accordance with this understanding.\n\n### Relevant Verses:\n- **Al-Hijr (15:9)**: *\"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Quran and indeed, We will be its guardian.\"*\n- **Al-Mursalat (77:28-30)**: *\"Alas, the woe that day for those who deny! 'Go to what you used to deny.'\"* \n\nBy adhering to the principles of respect towards the Quran, Muslims can ensure that they maintain the dignity of the Holy Book even in the face of physical degradation."

        "question": "Saying takbeer from Soorat al-Duha to Soorat al-Naas",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    The scholars differed concerning the ruling on saying takbeer \n    after every soorah from Soorat al-Duha to al-Naas. Imam Ahmad regarded it as \n    mustahabb but the other imams differed with him. There is another report \n    from Imam Ahmad which is in accordance with the view of the majority. The \n    correct view is that it is not prescribed to say takbeer, and this is not \n    proven in any marfoo’ hadeeth from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him). There is also no saheeh report about this takbeer from \n    any of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), rather it was proven \n    from some of the qurraa’ (reciters) of the people of Makkah. \n\n    It was narrated that ‘Ikrimah ibn Sulaymaan said: I recited \n    to Ismaa’eel ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Constantine, and when I reached Wa’l-duha \n    (i.e., Soorat al-Duha), he said to me: Say takbeer, say takbeer at the end \n    of every soorah until you complete (the Qur’aan). ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Katheer \n    told him that he recited to Mujaahid and he told him to do that, and \n    Mujaahid told him that Ibn ‘Abbaas had told him to do that, and Ibn ‘Abbaas \n    told him that Ubayy ibn Ka’b told him to do that, and Ubayy ibn Ka’b told \n    him that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told \n    him to do that.  \n\n    Narrated by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak (3/304). \n\n    This hadeeth is da’eef (weak). Its isnaad includes Ahmad ibn \n    Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Bazzah al-Muqri’. Abu Haatim said: His \n    hadeeth is da’eef (weak) and I will not narrate from him. Al-‘Aqeeli said: \n    His hadeeth is munkar (odd). Al-Dhahabi said: This is a ghareeb (strange) \n    hadeeth, and it is one of the hadeeth of al-Bazzi that were regarded as \n    munkar. Abu Haatim said: This is munkar. And he said: Al-Haakim regarded his \n    hadeeth about takbeer as saheeh, but it is munkar. \n\n    See: al-Du’afa’ by al-‘Aqeeli (1/127); and Mizaan \n    al-I’tidaal (1/144, 145) and Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’ (12/51), \n    both by Imam al-Dhahabi. \n\n    Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    Ahmad regarded it is mustahabb to say takbeer from the \n    beginning of Soorat al-Duha until the end of the Qur’aan. This was mentioned \n    by Ibn Tameem and others, and this is the recitation of the people of \n    Makkah, which al-Bazzi took from Ibn Katheer, and Ibn Katheer took it from \n    Mujaahid, and Mujaahid took it from Ibn ‘Abbaas, and Ibn ‘Abbaas took it \n    from Ubayy ibn Ka’b, and Ubayy ibn Ka’b took it from the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him). A number of them narrated that, \n    including al-Baghawi in his Tafseer, and the reason for that is that \n    the Wahy (revelation) ceased.  \n\n    This is a ghareeb hadeeth, reported by Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn \n    ‘Abd-Allaah al-Bazzi, who is sound with regard to recitation but da’eef \n    (weak) with regard to hadeeth. \n\n    Ibn Haatim al-Raazi said: This is a munkar hadeeth. \n\n    It was also narrated from him – i.e., Imam Ahmad – that there \n    should be no takbeer, as is the view of all reciters. End quote. \n\n    Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah (2/295, \n    296). \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was asked about a group who gathered to read the entire Qur’aan (khatmah) \n    and they were reading to ‘Aasim and Abu ‘Amr. When they reached Soorat \n    al-Duha, they did not say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah or Allaahu akbar, until they \n    reached the end of the Qur’aan. Is what they did better or not? Is the \n    hadeeth which is narrated about saying tahleel and takbeer saheeh and \n    mutawaatir, or not? \n\n    He replied: \nYes, if they recited in accordance with \n    a recitation other than that of Ibn Katheer, their not doing that is better, \n    and is in fact what is prescribed and is Sunnah. These imams of recitation \n    did not say takbeer either at the beginning of the soorahs or at the ends. \n    If it is acceptable to say that Ibn Katheer narrated the takbeer from the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it is \n    acceptable for others to say that these people narrated the omission of that \n    from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) too. It is not possible that the recitation of the majority that was \n    narrated by more people than the recitation of Ibn Katheer omitted something \n    enjoined by the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him), because those who narrated mutawaatir reports could not have \n    concealed something for which there was good reason to narrate it. The one \n    who accepts that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) told the majority of reciters to add an extra takbeer then they \n    disobeyed the command of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) and failed to do what he had commanded them to do, \n    deserves to be punished severely as a deterrent to him and others like him. \n    \n    With regard to the takbeer, the one who says that it is part \n    of the Qur’aan has gone astray according to scholarly consensus and must be \n    asked to repent; if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he should be \n    executed. How could the one who does not recite it be denounced for not \n    reciting it? The one who regard a person who does not say this takbeer as an \n    innovator or one who goes against the Sunnah or a sinner, is closer to kufr \n    than Islam and should be punished; indeed if he insists on that after having \n    the proof explained to him, then he should be executed. \n\n    If we assume [?] that the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) told some of those who recited it to say takbeer, \n    then at most this indicates that it is permissible or mustahabb. If it were \n    obligatory, the majority of reciters would not have neglected it and the \n    imams of the Muslims would not have agreed that it is not obligatory. But \n    none of the imams narrated that the takbeer is obligatory, rather the most \n    that anyone who reads according to the recitation of Ibn Katheer can say is \n    that it is mustahabb. This is unlike the Basmalah, recitation of which is \n    obligatory according to those who regard it as part of the Qur’aan, but \n    despite that the reciters allow not reciting it if one does not want to use \n    it as a break between one soorah and another. So how could it not be allowed \n    to omit the takbeer, which is not part of the Qur’aan?   End quote. \n\n    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (13/417-419) \n\n    And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The takbeer that is narrated from Ibn Katheer is not narrated \n    with an isnad from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him), and no one attributed it to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) except al-Bazzi, who thus went against all those who \n    narrated it, as they only narrated it as something optional that was done by \n    some of those who came after the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him), and he was the only one who attributed it to the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). His transmission was regarded \n    as da’eef (weak) by the specialists in hadeeth and biography among the \n    scholars of recitation and hadeeth, as was mentioned by more than one of the \n    scholars. End quote. \n\n    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (17/130). \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) was asked:  \n\n    Some of the reciters of Qur’aan separate one soorah from \n    another by saying Allaahu akbar instead of the basmalah. Is that \n    permissible, and is there any evidence for it? \n\n    He replied: \n\n    This is contrary to what the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased \n    with them) did, who separated one soorah from another by saying Bismillaah \n    il-Rahmaan il-Raheem, and it is contrary to the scholarly view that the \n    soorahs of the Qur’aan should not be separated by takbeer throughout the \n    Qur’aan. \n\n    At the very most, there are some reciters who regard it as \n    mustahabb for a person to say takbeer when he finishes every soorah from \n    al-Duha to the end of the Qur’aan, along with the Basmalah between every two \n    soorahs. But the correct view is that this is not Sunnah, because that was \n    not narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him). Based on this, what is prescribed is to separate one soorah from \n    another by saying the Basmalah,  Bismillaah il-Rahmaan il-Raheem, \n    except in the case of Soorat Baraa’ah (al-Tawbah), as there is no Basmalah \n    between al-Anfaal and it. End quote. \n\n    Fataawa Islamiyyah (4/48). \n\n    Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (may Allaah preserve him) mentions in \n    his Book Bida’ al-Qurraa’ (p. 27) seven things that have to do \n    reading the entire Qur’aan, of which we may mention: \n\n    Saying takbeer at the end of Soorat al-Duha until the end of \n    Soorat al-Naas, both when praying and otherwise. \n\n    Then he said: \n\n    There are no saheeh reports about these seven things from the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from his \n    companions (may Allaah be pleased with them). Most of that which is narrated \n    about some of them cannot be taken as evidence. The correct view is that \n    none of these things are prescribed in sharee’ah. End quote. \n\n    The Shaykh of the reciters in al-Madeenah al-Munawwarah, \n    Shaykh Ibraaheem al-Akhdar, has written an essay entitled Takbeer \n    al-Khatam bayna al-Qurraa’ wa’l-Muhadditheen, at the end of which he \n    says: \n\n    From the above discussion of the reports, examination of \n    their isnaads and biographies of their narrators, we could not find anything \n    but the report of al-Bazzi – as the scholars said – and it is a report whose \n    isnaad is filled with weak and majrooh narrators, and there is no other \n    report apart from the report of al-Bazzi. This was stated clearly by many \n    scholars of reports, although some of the most famous reciters, such as Ibn \n    Mujaahid in his book al-Sab’ah, did not narrate the takbeer, and \n    neither did Abu’l-Qaasim al-Hudhali in his book al-Kaamil. This \n    indicates that the report was not proven in their view. And Allaah knows \n    best. \n\n    A Sunnah cannot be established by means of such a report, \n    rather it is better not to do that, whether it is mentioned in the report of \n    al-Bazzi or the report of anyone else. That is so as to protect the Book of \n    Allaah and to keep out of it anything that is not part of it, whether it is \n    thought to be Sunnah or not. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds. \n    End quote. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    Many reasons for this takbeer have been mentioned, the most \n    well known of which is that the Revelation to the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) ceased for a while, and when it resumed \n    after that, the first thing that was revealed was Soorat al-Duha, in which \n    it says (interpretation of the meaning): “Your Lord (O Muhammad\n    صلى الله عليه وسلم) has neither forsaken \n    you nor hates you” [al-Duha 93:3], and he said takbeer in joy at that. \n    Even if this is saheeh, it does not indicate that it is mustahabb to say \n    takbeer as suggested by some scholars of recitation, for several reasons: \n\n    1.It does not indicate that \n    takbeer is to be said after every recitation of the soorah.\n\n    2.It does not indicate that \n    takbeer is to be said until Soorat al-Naas.\n\n    3.The takbeer was said only once, \n    because of the Revelation resuming after it had ceased for a while.\n\n    4.The other soorahs do not have \n    the same content as Soorat al-Duha.\n\n    Moreover, this report does not have any saheeh isnaad, or \n    even any da’eef (weak) one.   \n\n    Imam Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  \n\n    With regard to saying takbeer after Soorat al-Duha, the \n    reciters said that when the revelation was late in coming to the Messenger \n    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and that went on \n    for a while, then the angel came to him and brought the words \n    (interpretation of the meaning): “By the forenoon (after sunrise). By the \n    night when it darkens (and stands still)” [al-Duha 93:1-2], he said \n    takbeer out of joy and happiness. \n\n    But this was not narrated with any isnaad that can be judged \n    to be saheeh or da’eef. And Allaah knows best. \n\n    Tafseer Ibn Katheer (8/423). \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, saying the Takbeer (saying \"Allahu Akbar,\" meaning \"God is the Greatest\") encompasses not only praises to God but is also part of various acts of worship. In relation to the verses from Surah Al-Duha (Chapter 93) and Surah An-Nasr (Chapter 110), both are important to understand as they reflect the themes of God's support and the importance of gratitude.\n\n### Surah Al-Duha (Chapter 93)\nSurah Al-Duha emphasizes God's mercy and support. The verses highlight several key points:\n\n1. **Divine Support**: The verses underscore that God has not abandoned the Prophet Muhammad. In Verse 1 to 4 (93:1-4), it says:\n   - “By the morning hours, and by the night when it is still, Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor despised you. And what is to come is better for you than what is past.”\n  \n2. **Reminder of Blessings**: The last part of this Surah (93:8-11) addresses the blessings from God, reminding the Prophet and the followers:\n   - “Did He not find you poor and enrich you? So do not oppress the orphan, and do not drive away the beggar, and keep recounting the favors of your Lord.” \n\nThis Surah calls for gratitude and awareness of God's continuous support, prompting believers to reflect on and express their thankfulness—exemplified through Takbeer as an affirmation of His greatness.\n\n### Surah An-Nasr (Chapter 110)\nSurah An-Nasr presents a moment of victory for Muslims, celebrating God's help in their endeavors. The core messages include:\n\n1. **Divine Assistance**: The opening verse (110:1) declares:\n   - “When the help of Allah comes, and victory, and you see the people entering the religion of Allah in multitudes,”\n\n2. **Call to Gratitude and Forgiveness**: The Surah concludes with an important directive (110:3):\n   - “Then glorify your Lord with praise and ask forgiveness of Him. Indeed, He is ever Accepting of Repentance.” \n\nThis verse acts as a powerful reminder that in moments of triumph, believers should remember to glorify Allah, again connecting to the practice of Takbeer.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, saying the Takbeer from Surah Al-Duha to Surah An-Nasr serves as a transition from recognizing God’s ongoing support in times of personal struggle to celebrating triumph and victory through divine help. The continuous thread through these Surahs is the call to express gratitude, acknowledge blessings, and maintain consciousness of God’s presence in all aspects of life.\n\n### References:\n- Surah Al-Duha (93:1-11) \n- Surah An-Nasr (110:1-3)\n\nThese references highlight the importance of praising God through Takbeer, particularly during significant moments, such as during challenges and victories."

        "question": "Repetition in the Qur’aan – types and benefits",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There follows a brief discussion on the repetitions in the Qur’aan, which suits the nature of our site. You can examine the subject further by looking at the references we refer to, or by studying the books of ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan in general. \n1 – Definition of repetition \nIbn al-Manzoor said: \nThe word takraar (translated here as repetition) is derived from the word al-karr, which means going back to a thing.  \nLisaan al-‘Arab (5/135). \nIn sharee’ah terminology, takraar means repeating a word or phrase more than once for various reasons, such as emphasis, exaggeration, reinforcement and so on. \n2 – Repetition is a kind of eloquence \nSome of those who do not have any understanding of the Arabic language criticized the repetition that appears in the Qur’aan, and thought that this is not eloquent. This stems from their ignorance. The repetition that appears in the Qur’aan is not the kind of worthless repetition that is of no value – as we shall see in detail below – and which appears in the speech of one who does not speak the language well or express himself well. \nAl-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nRepetition is more eloquent than merely emphasizing and it is reflective of good style, contrary to what some people think. \nAl-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan (3/280), Mu’sasat al-Nada’ edition. \n3 – Kinds of repetition \nThe scholars have divided the repetition in the Qur’aan into two kinds: \n(i) Repetition of words and meanings \nThis is where words are repeated with no difference in the meaning. There are two types, connected and disconnected. \nThe connected type appears in various ways, either by repeating the words in the same verse, as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Far, very far is that which you are promised!”\n[al-Mu’minoon 23:36]\nor at the end of a verse and at the beginning of the following verse, such as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And amongst them will be passed round vessels of silver and cups of crystal —\n16. Crystal‑clear, made of silver. They will determine the measure thereof (according to their wishes)”\n[al-Insaan 76:15,16]\nor at the end of a verse, such as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Nay! When the earth is ground to powder [kallaa idha dukkat il-ardu dakkan dakka]”\n[al-Fajr 89:21]\nor when a verse is repeated straight after another verse, such as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“5. Verily, along with every hardship is relief,\n6. Verily, along with every hardship is relief”\n[al-Sharh 94:5,6]\nAs for that which is disconnected, it appears in two forms, either repeated in the same soorah, or repeated throughout the Qur’aan. \nExamples of repetition in the same soorah include the phrase “And verily, your Lord, He is truly, the All‑Mighty, the Most Merciful” which is repeated 8 times in Soorat al-Shu’ara’ and “Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!” which is repeated 10 times in Soorat al-Mursalaat, and “Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?” which is repeated 31 times in Soorat al-Rahmaan.   \nExamples of phrases which are repeated throughout the Qur’aan include the phrase “They say: ‘When will this promise (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) come to pass if you are telling the truth?’” which appears six times, in Yoonus 10:48, al-Anbiya’ 21:38, al-Naml 27:71, Saba’ 34:29, Yaa-Seen 36:48 and al-Mulk 67:25. And the phrase “O Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe against them; their abode will be Hell, and worst indeed is that destination” appears twice, in al-Tawbah 9:73 and al-Tahreem 66:9.  \n(ii) Repetition of meaning but not words \nSuch as the stories of the Prophets with their peoples, and mention of Paradise and its people and Hell and its horrors. \n4 – Benefits of repetition \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nThere is no pointless repetition in the Qur’aan, rather there are benefits in every repetition. \nMajmoo’ al-Fataawa (14/408) \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the repetition of the story of Moosa and his people:\n Allaah mentions this story in several places in the Qur'aan, and in every place He highlights a different idea and conclusion, just as Allaah, His Messenger and His Book are called by different names, each name indicating a meaning that is not indicated by another name. There is no repetition in that, rather it is a kind of diversity, like the names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as he is called Muhammad, Ahmad, al-Haashir, al-‘Aaqib, al-Muqaffa, the Prophet of Mercy, the Prophet of Repentance, and each name points to a meaning that is not indicated by any other name; the person is the same but the attributes are numerous. \nThe same applies to the Qur’aan, which is also called Furqaan (criterion), Bayaan (a plain statement), Huda (guidance), Basaa’ir (clear evidence), Shifa’ (healing), Noor (light) and Rahmah (mercy). Each name points to a meaning that is not indicated by other names. \nThe same applies to the names of the Lord, as He is called: al-Malik (the Sovereign), al-Quddoos (the Holy), al-Salaam (the One Free from all defects), al-Mu’min (the Guardian of faith), al-Muhaymin (the Watcher over His creatures), al-‘Azeez (the Almighty), al-Jabbaar (the compeller), al-Mutakabbir (the Majestic), al-Khaaliq (the Creator), al-Baari’ (the Inventor of all things), and al-Musawwir (the Bestower of forms). Each name points to a meaning that is not indicated by another name. The Essence is One but the attributes are numerous.  \nThe same applies to sentences that are complete in meaning. The story is told in one way that highlights one point, then it is told in another way which highlights a different point. The story is the same story, but its details are numerous, and every sentence conveys a meaning that is not indicated by other sentences. \nMajmoo’ al-Fataawa 919/167, 168). \nAl-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  \nThere are a number of reasons for repetition: \nThis includes confirmation. It is said that if words are repeated the meaning is confirmed. Allaah has indicated the reason why He repeats stories and reminders in the Qur’aan, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“and have explained therein in detail the warnings, in order that they may fear Allaah, or that it may cause them to have a lesson from it”\n[Ta-Ha 20:113]\nIt also includes emphasis. \nIt also includes highlighting a point so that the words will be accepted, such as the verse:  \n“And the man who believed said: ‘O my people! Follow me, I will guide you to the way of right conduct [i.e. guide you to Allaah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism with which Moosa (Moses) has been sent].\n39. ‘O my people! Truly, this life of the world is nothing but a (quick passing) enjoyment’”\n[Ghaafir 40:38].\nIn the passage the call is repeated for this reason. \nAnother example is if the speech is lengthy and there is the fear that what was said at the beginning may be forgotten, so it is repeated a second time to keep the idea fresh. For example, in the verses: \n“Then, verily, your Lord __ for those who do evil (commit sins and are disobedient to Allaah) in ignorance and afterward repent and do righteous deeds, verily, your Lord thereafter, (to such) is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”\n[al-Nahl 16:119] \n“Then, verily, your Lord _for those who emigrated after they had been put to trials and thereafter strove hard and fought (for the Cause of Allaah) and were patient, verily, your Lord afterward”\n[al-Nahl 16:110] \n“And when there came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur’aan) from Allaah confirming what is with them [the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], although aforetime they had invoked Allaah (for coming of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved, then when there came to them that which they had recognised, they disbelieved in it”\n[al-Baqarah 2:89]\n“Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,— think not you that they are rescued from the torment”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:188] \n“Verily, I saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon — I saw them”\n[Yoosuf 12:4]\nIt may also be done for emphasis, as in the verses: \n“The Inevitable (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)!\n2. What is the Inevitable?”\n[al-Haaqqah 69:1] \n“Al‑Qaari‘ah (the striking Hour, i.e. the Day of Resurrection).\n2. What is the striking (Hour)?”\n[al-Qaari’ah 101:1] \n“And those on the Right Hand —how (fortunate) will be those on the Right Hand?”\n[al-Waaqi’ah 56:27]\nal-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan (3/281, 282). \n5 – Benefits of repeating some stories and verses \n1 – Abu’l-Faraj Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nIf it is said: What is the point of repeating the verse “Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?” [in Soorat al-Rahmaan]? \nThe answer is: This repetition is in order to confirm the blessing and emphasize the remembrance thereof. Ibn Qutaybah said: It is the habit of the Arabs to repeat things for emphasis and to ensure that they are understood, although they may also speak briefly so as not to tire the listener, because if a speaker addresses a point from different angles, that is better than him approaching it from just one angle, such as if someone said:  By Allaah, I will not do it, and by Allaah, I will not do it – because he wanted to emphasize his point and put an end to any hope that he could do it. And if he wanted to be brief he may say:  By Allaah I shall do it, but omitting the word ‘not’ for the sake of brevity. Similarly, one who is in a hurry may say, Hurry up, hurry up! And it may be said to the archer: Shoot, shoot! \nIbn Qutaybah said: When Allaah listed His blessings in this soorah, and reminded His slaves of His signs, and drew attention to His power, He repeated this phrase between each two blessings, so that they would appreciate the blessings and recognize them, such as when you say to a man: Didn’t I give you accommodation when you were homeless – can you deny that? Didn’t I take you for Hajj when you had never been – can you deny that?  \nZaad al-Maseer (5/461). \n2 – al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nAs for the way in which the repetition is done – i.e., “Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to these Mushrikoon and Kaafiroon): “O Al‑Kaafiroon (disbelievers)” – it is said that it is for emphasis to cut off their hopes, as one might say: By Allaah, I will not do it, and by Allaah I will not do it. \nMost of the scholars of semantics said: The Qur’aan was revealed in the language of the Arabs, and it is their way to repeat things for emphasis and to ensure that they are understood, and also to speak briefly so as not to tire the listener, because when the speaker uses different phrases in his speech, it is better than limiting himself to one phrase. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?” and “Nay, they will come to know! Nay, again, they will come to know!” [al-Naba’ 78:4, 5] and “5. Verily, along with every hardship is relief,6. Verily, along with every hardship is relief” [al-Sharh 94:5,6]. In all cases, the aim is emphasis. \nTafseer al-Qurtubi (20/226). \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Repetition in the Qur’an – Types and Benefits\n\n**Types of Repetition in the Qur’an:**\n\n1. **Literal Repetition**: The Qur'an often repeats specific phrases, verses, or themes across different Surahs and contexts. This can include calls to worship, reminders of God's attributes, or moral exhortations. An example of this is the phrase \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\" which appears at the beginning of most Surahs.\n\n2. **Conceptual Repetition**: This refers to the repetition of central themes or messages throughout the Qur'an, such as the oneness of God (Tawheed), prophethood, resurrection, and the afterlife. Surah Al-Baqarah frequently discusses such themes, emphasizing their importance to the faith. For instance:\n   - **Oneness of God** is a recurring theme in verses like Surah Al-Baqarah (2:163): \"And your god is one God. There is no deity [worthy of worship] except Him, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\"\n\n3. **Narrative Repetition**: The Qur'an recounts the stories of past prophets repeatedly, but each account serves a different purpose or conveys a new lesson. For example, the story of Prophet Moses is told in various ways across several Surahs, including Surah Al-Baqarah (2:49-50), Surah Al-A'raf (7:103-156), and Surah Al-Qasas (28:3-43). Each account explores different aspects of his mission and the struggles faced.\n\n### Benefits of Repetition in the Qur'an:\n\n1. **Emphasis and Reinforcement**: Repeating key messages emphasizes their importance and helps in reinforcing the core concepts of faith. For example, the teachings related to charity and benevolence are spread throughout the Qur'an, as seen in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:261-265), where the rewards of spending in charity are elaborated:\n   - “The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah...”\n\n2. **Encouragement for Reflection**: Repetitions invite believers to ponder the meanings and implications of the verses. For instance, Surah Al-Furqan (25:50-54) mentions the distribution of signs to encourage reflection and convey deeper meanings:\n   - “And We distribute it among them in various ways that they may ponder and reflect…”\n\n3. **Ease of Memorization**: The structure of the Qur'an, often with repetitive phrases and passages, aids in memorization. Surah Al-A'la (87:6-10) states that Allah will help individuals recite the Qur'an so they will not forget it:\n   - “We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, unless Allah wills…”\n\n4. **Consolation and Guidance**: Repetition serves to remind believers during times of distress, reiterating God's mercy, guidance, and the importance of faith. For instance, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:152) encourages remembrance of Allah and assures believers of His support:\n   - “So remember Me, and I shall remember you; and be grateful to Me and do not deny Me.”\n\n5. **Cognitive Engagement**: By encountering similar themes across different contexts, the reader or listener engages more deeply with the text, fostering a greater understanding of the overarching messages and principles in Islam.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRepetition in the Qur’an is multifaceted, offering various types and serving numerous benefits. It reinforces crucial teachings, encourages reflection, aids in memorization, provides consolation, and facilitates deep engagement with the text. Understanding the implications of these repetitions enriches the reading and recitation experience, ultimately drawing believers closer to the core tenets of their faith. \n\n### Relevant Verses Citations\n1. **Oneness of God**: Surah Al-Baqarah (2:163)\n2. **Charity**: Surah Al-Baqarah (2:261-265)\n3. **Encouragement for Reflection**: Surah Al-Furqan (25:50-54)\n4. **Ease of Memorization**: Surah Al-A'la (87:6-10)\n5. **Consolation and Guidance**: Surah Al-Baqarah (2:152)"

        "question": "Mus-haf al-Tajweed with coloured letters",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.After examining the Mus-haf al-Tajweed with coloured letters, it is clear that there is nothing wrong with using these colours, rather it makes it easier to learn tajweed, for those who are not able to learn directly from experts. \nThe Dar al-Ma’rifah (publisher’s) website has published a copy of the approval of the Islamic Research Council in al-Azhar of this Mus-haf in which different colours are used; it also cites the approval of the senior scholar of Qur’aan in Syria, Shaykh Muhammad Kareem Raajih, and the approval of Shaykh Dr. Wahbah al-Zuhayli. This is the text of what it says on the site:         \nWith regard to this work of ours, the senior scholar of Qur’aan in Syria, Shaykh Muhammad Kareem Raajih stated on 21 Safar 1412 AH that this work “is acceptable and even it is of no benefit then it does not cause any harm, moreover it serves as a reminder and indication of the rules of tajweed, but it does not do away with the importance of learning tajweed directly from the mouths of the shaykhs.” At the same time, Shaykh al-Qaari’ Muhiy al-Deen al-Kurdi stated on 18 Safar 1415 AH that “those who away from educational circles and elderly people may benefit from this work, because they cannot learn directly.” Professor Wahbat al-Zuhayli, a member of the Islamic Fiqh Council in Jeddah and the President of the Faculty of Islamic Fiqh and Madhhabs at the University of Damascus stated on 18 Muharram 1415AH: “Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And We have indeed made the Qur’aan easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?’ [al-Qamar 54:17]. This clearly indicates that everything that makes it easy to recite Qur’aan, which we are required in Islam to study it, understand its meanings and act in accordance with what it says, is a must according to sharee’ah for those who study knowledge, fiqh and the tafseer of the Book of Allaah. As reciting the Qur’aan in the manner that is known in the science of tajweed is obligatory, then every means that makes it easy for the reader to learn the rulings on tajweed and follow them when reciting is something that is permissible according to sharee’ah, whether it is letters printed in one colour or several colours. The good reading is that which imprints the letters in the mind, and this printing of the Holy Qur’aan in different colours makes it easy to read the Qur’aan, and establishes the rulings in the mind, so it is a contemporary means that is to be encouraged and it does not contradict the way in which Qur’aan was traditionally transmitted to us and the traditional way of writing it.  May Allaah help Dar al-Ma’rifah with this blessed work. End quote. \nThere is no way that these colours can be ruled to be an innovation, because the scholars of Qur’aan at the time of the Taabi’een introduced dots and vowels in the Mus-haf and wrote the dots and vowels in red.  \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nThe Sahaabah did not write dots and vowels in the Mus-hafs because they were Arabs who did not make mistakes in pronouncing the words, so they did not need the dots. A single word could be read in two ways, with a ya’ or a ta’, such as ya’maloon (يعملون) and ta’maloon (تعملون), which they would read in only one way because they knew that the other was not correct.  \nBut at the time of the Taabi’een, when it become common for people to mispronounce words, some of the Taabi’een added vowels and dots to the Mus-haf, and they wrote them in red. They wrote the fathah as a red dot above the letter, and the kasrah as a red dot below the letter, and the dammah as a red dot before the letter. Then they expanded the red dots and they denoted the shaddah by writing “shadd” and the maddah by writing “madd”. They made the sign for the hamzah look like the letter ‘ayn, because the hamzah is the sister of the ‘ayn. Then they abbreviated them and made the sign for the shaddah look like the main part of the letter seen, and the sign for the maddah an abbreviated sign, as those who keep records may abbreviate numbers etc, and as the scholars of hadeeth abbreviated words such as akhbarana (he informed us) and haddathana (he narrated to us) by writing the first and last part of the word in the forms ana (أنا)  and thana(ثنا) .  \nThe scholars disputed as to whether it was makrooh or not to add vowels and dots to the Mus-haf and there are two well known views, both of which were narrated from Ahmad, but there was no dispute concerning the fact that if there are vowels and dots in a Mus-haf, they must be respected just as the letters are respected. End quote from Majmoo’ Fataawa Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (12/101). \nShaykh Dr. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Muhammad al-Mutlaq (may Allaah preserve him) said: The following things were not originally part of the ‘Uthmaani text: \n1 – The dots by means of which letters are distinguished, for they were added to the Arabic letters at the time of the Taabi’een. Before that the letters were written without dots. Abu ‘Amr ‘Uthmaan ibn Sa’eed al-Daani (d. 444 AH) said: Chapter on the first ones among the Taabi’een to add dots to the Mus-hafs, and those who regarded it as makrooh and those among the scholars who granted concessions allowing that: the reports we have vary as to who was the first to add dots to the Mus-haf among the Taabi’een, but we think that the first one who did that was Abu’l-Aswad al-Du’ali. \nWe narrated that Ibn Sireen had a Mus-haf to which dots had been added by Yahya ibn Ya’mar, and that Yahya was the first one to add dots to it. [Kitaab al-Naqd, printed alongside al-Maqna’ fi Ma’rifat Arsoom Masaahif Ahl al-Amsaar, p. 129].  \n2 – Vowels and tanween – the first one to add them was Abu’l-Aswad al-Du’ali, and they were dots. That was because he wanted to write Arabic in such a way that the people would correct the mistakes that they had started to make in their speech, as that had become common among the elite and the common folk. So he brought someone to hold the Mus-haf, and he brought ink of a different colour, and he said to the one who was holding the Mus-haf for him: If I open my mouth then put the dot above the letter, and if I stretch my mouth then put the dot beneath the letter, if I purse my lips then put the dot before the letter, and if I follow these letters with ghunnah (i.e., tanween), then put two dots, until I reach the end of the Mus-haf. And it was said that the first one who did that was Nasr ibn ‘Aasim al-Laythi. [Kitaab al-Naqd, printed alongside al-Maqna’ fi Ma’rifat Arsoom Masaahif Ahl al-Amsaar, p. 129].  \nThen al-Khaleel ibn Ahmad developed that when he invented vowel signs derived from the letters. [al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan, p. 219]. \n3 – Hamzah, shaddah, rawm and ishmaam. The first one who introduced these was al-Khaleel ibn Ahmad al-Faraaheedi. \n4 – Signs of tajweed and signs of al-wasl (joining) and al-waqf (pausing). These did not exist in the ‘Uthmaani text, rather they were developed later on in ‘ilm al-tajweed.

        "predicted_answer": "### Mus-haf al-Tajweed with Coloured Letters\n\nMus-haf al-Tajweed refers to a version of the Quran that is enhanced with color-coded letters and markings to aid proper pronunciation (Tajweed). This is crucial because the Quran is not only a spiritual guide but its recitation holds significant merit in Islam, and precise pronunciation is essential to convey the intended meaning accurately.\n\n#### Importance of Tajweed\n\n1. **Preservation of Meaning**: The Quran is a nuanced text where slight alterations in pronunciation can change meanings entirely. The practice of Tajweed ensures that the meanings are preserved during recitation. This has been emphasized in several verses.\n\n   - **Surah 73:4**: \"Or a little more, and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly.\" (Al-Muzzammil 73:4)\n   - **Surah 4:82**: \"Do they not reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon their hearts?\" (An-Nisa 4:82) \n   This implies the need for careful recitation and understanding of the text.\n\n2. **Commanded by Allah**: The Quran itself commands recitation with clarity and beauty. The concept of Tajweed aligns with this directive.\n\n   - **Surah 68:1**: \"Nun. I call to witness the pen and what they inscribe.\" (Al-Qalam 68:1) emphasizes the importance of articulation and writing, including recitation.\n   - **Surah 73:2-3**: \"Keep watch all the night except some, a half of it or a little less, or a little more, and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly.\" (Al-Muzzammil 73:2-3)\n\n#### Achieving Correct Pronunciation\n\n1. **Fada'il (Virtues)**: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) highlighted the virtues of reciting the Quran beautifully and correctly. \n   - **Sahih al-Bukhari** narrates the Prophet saying: \"The best among you are those who learn the Quran and teach it.\"\n\n2. **Coloured Letters Guidance**: In Mus-haf al-Tajweed, colored letters indicate different rules of Tajweed such as:\n   - **Ghunna (nasal sound)**\n   - **Idgham (merging sounds)**\n   - **Qalqalah (echoing sounds)**\n   - **Madd (elongation of sound)**\n   Each marking helps the reader recognize how to produce the sounds correctly.\n\n3. **Learning and Teaching**: The Quran encourages learning and teaching, which is essential for maintaining the precision of Tajweed.\n   - **Surah 43:3**: \"I call to witness the lucent Book. That We made it a distinctly lucid Qur'an that you may understand.\" (Az-Zukhruf 43:3)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Mus-haf al-Tajweed with coloured letters serves as an advanced tool for reciting the Quran correctly, adhering to the rules of Tajweed. The sacredness of the text and its meaning necessitate proper pronunciation, supported by various verses of the Quran that encourage reflection and clear recitation. The emphasis on pronunciation and the structure of the Quran underscores its importance in the practice of Islam. \n\n**References**: \n- Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:2-4)  \n- Surah Az-Zukhruf (43:3)  \n- Surah Al-Qalam (68:1)  \n- Surah An-Nisa (4:82)  \n- Hadith from Sahih al-Bukhari regarding the virtues of Quran recitation."

        "question": "When it is obligatory to listen attentively to recitation of the Quran?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on listening attentively to recitation of Quran outside of prayer. There are two opinions: \n1 – The first view is that is it obligatory. This is the view of the Hanafis, and some of them regarded it as an individual obligation, whilst others said that it is a communal obligation. They quoted as evidence the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy” [al-A’raaf 7:204]\nIt says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (4/86): \nListening to recitation of Quran when it is recited outside of prayer is obligatory if there is no legitimate shar’i excuse for not listening. \nThe Hanafis differed with regard to this obligation: is it an individual obligation or a communal obligation? \nIbn ‘Aabideen said: The basic principle is that listening to Quran is a communal obligation, because it is establishing its right to be listened to and not ignored, which is achieved by some listening attentively, as is the case with returning salaams (i.e., it is sufficient for some members of a group to return the greeting). \nAl-Hamawi narrated that his teacher, the prominent judge Yahya who is better known as Minqaarizaadah, said that listening to the Quran is an individual obligation. \nYes, the verse in Soorat al-A’raaf, “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy” was revealed to abrogate the permission to speak during prayer, but what counts is the general meaning of the words, not the specific reason for its revelation, and the general meaning includes recitation of Quran both during prayer and otherwise. End quote. \n2 – The second view is that it is mustahabb and recommended. They interpreted the verse in Soorat al-A’raaf as referring to recitation in prayer only. Outside of prayer it is recommended and mustahabb. This is the view of the majority of scholars.  \nIbn Katheer says in Tafseer al-Quran il-‘Azeem (2/372): \n‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n“So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy”\n[al-A’raaf 7:204]: \ni.e., in the obligatory prayer. Something similar was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Mughaffal. Ibn Jareer said: Humayd ibn Mas’adah told us, Bishr ibn al-Mufaddal told us, al-Jareeri told us, that Talhah ibn ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn Kurayz said: I saw ‘Ubayd ibn ‘Umayr and ‘Ata’ ibn Abi Rabaah talking whilst the storyteller was speaking, and I said: Why don’t you listen to the reminder, lest you be subject to the warning? They looked at me, then they went back to their conversation. I repeated it, and they looked at me, then they went back to their conversation. I said it a third time and they looked at me and said: That is only in prayer: “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy”\n[al-A’raaf 7:204].  \nThis is how it was narrated by more than one person from Mujaahid. ‘Abd al-Razzaaq narrated from al-Thawri from Layth that Mujaahid said: There is nothing wrong with speaking if a man recites Quran other than in prayer. \nSomething similar was stated by Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, al-Dahhaak, Ibraheem al-Nakha’i, Qataadah, al-Sha’bi, al-Saddi and ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam, that what is meant (in the verse) is in prayer. \nThis was the view favoured by Ibn Jareer, that what is meant is listening attentively in prayer and during the khutbah, as it says in the ahaadeeth which enjoin listening attentively behind the imam and during the khutbah. End quote. \nIt seems that this view is the correct one, because in order for a thing to be obligatory, clear evidence is required, otherwise obliging the people to adhere to that will clause undue hardship without any evidence for it. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked, as it says in Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (no. 197/ question no. 26): \nThere was a group of people travelling by car, and one of them put on a tape of Quran; should they all listen to this tape, and is anyone who speaks whilst the tape is playing sinning thereby? \nThe answer was: \nImam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning this verse: This applies to prayer. He said: They were unanimously agreed that this applies to prayer. Based on this, if I am next to a person who is reciting Quran out loud, but I am reciting tasbeeh and saying laa ilaaha ill-Allah, then I do not have to listen to him, rather that applies to prayer only. \nBut I say to the brother who put the tape on: Do not put it on when people are not paying attention, because the least that may said about that is that it is like those of whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who disbelieve say: ‘Listen not to this Quran, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome’” [Fussilat 41:26]. If you see that your brothers do not want to listen, and they are busy talking to one another, then do not put the tape on. If you want to listen to it, then there are small headphones that you can put in your ears, and you can listen to it by yourself. End quote. \nIt says in al-Muntaqa fi Fataawa al-Fawzaan (3/question no. 437): \nSometimes I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, to prepare food for my husband, and I want to make good use of my time, so I listen to the Holy Quran either on the radio or on tapes. Is this action of mine correct or should I not do that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy”[al-A’raaf 7:204]? \nThe answer is: There is nothing wrong with listening to the Holy Quran on the radio or on tapes when one is working, and that does not go against the words “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent”, because listening attentively is required as much as one is able to do, and the one who puts on the tape should listen attentively to the Quran as much as he can. End quote. \nFavouring the view that it is mustahabb does not mean that one may be careless and deliberately fail to listen attentively to the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, when they are recited. Keenness to listen attentively should be the basic principle that is established in the life of the Muslim, and he should not do otherwise except in the case of work or need. \nAl-Nawawi said in al-Tabyaan fi Adaab Hamalat al-Quran (92): \nSomething that attention must be paid to and which should be affirmed is respecting the Quran in cases where some of the negligent may be heedless about it in gatherings where Quran is recited, such as not laughing, chatting or talking during the recitation, except in cases of necessity; obeying the words of Allah, “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy”; and following the example that was narrated from Ibn Abi Dawood from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), that when the Quran was recited he would not talk until the recitation ended. End quote. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (no. 146, question no. 9): It is not good manners to ignore the Book of Allah when it is being recited, even if it is on a tape.” End quote. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is obligatory to listen attentively to the recitation of the Quran under specific circumstances. The main guidance regarding this is found in several verses of the Quran, particularly in Surah Al-A'raf and Surah Al-Muzzammil.\n\n1. **Listening During Recitation**:\n   One of the primary verses that emphasizes the obligation to listen attentively to the recitation of the Quran is:\n\n   **Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206)**:\n   > \"And when the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed. Meditate on your Lord inwardly with humility and trepidation, reciting His Book softly, morning and evening, and be not negligent. Verily those who are in the presence of your Lord are never too proud to worship and celebrate His praises, and bow in homage to Him.\"  \n   (7:204-206)\n\n   This verse clearly indicates that when the Quran is recited, believers are commanded to listen attentively and in silence. This is significant as it is believed that blessings and guidance can come from such attentive listening.\n\n2. **Recitation with Reflection**:\n   Additionally, another important verse related to the recitation of the Quran emphasizes the importance of not just listening, but also reciting the Quran with reflection:\n\n   **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:4)**:\n   > \"Or a little more, and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly.\"  \n   (73:4)\n\n   Reciting the Quran slowly and distinctly not only enhances understanding but allows for deeper contemplation of its meanings.\n\n3. **Night Time Recitation**:\n   The Quran encourages night-time recitation as a time when the soul is most receptive:\n\n   **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:6)**:\n   > \"Indeed during the watches of the night, the soul is most receptive and words more telling.\"  \n   (73:6)\n\n   This further highlights the importance of listening and reciting the Quran at specific times, particularly during the night when one can meditate and reflect more profoundly on its content without distractions.\n\n4. **Responsibility in Recitation**:\n   Furthermore, the Quran also instructs believers on the obligation of following its recitation properly:\n\n   **Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:17-19)**:\n   > \"Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\"  \n   (75:17-19)\n\n   This illustrates the responsibility of believers to engage with the Quran earnestly, acknowledging its importance as a divine revelation.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, it is obligatory to listen attentively to the recitation of the Quran during its reading, especially during communal prayers or when it is being recited publicly. The verses from Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206) and Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:4, 73:6) emphasize the importance of listening, reflecting, and reciting the Quran thoughtfully, especially during times when one can be calm and focused, such as at night. These principles guide Muslims in their engagement with the Quran and highlight its significance in their lives."

Narrated \n    by Abu Dawood (775) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. \nSecondly: \nThe scholars \n    differed as to the ruling on seeking refuge with Allaah before reciting \n    al-Faatihah in the prayer. Some of them were of the view that it is \n    obligatory. This is the view of ‘Ata’, al-Thawri, al-Awzaa’i and Dawood, as \n    was narrated by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla (3/247-248), and it was the \n    view favoured by him. It was also narrated from Ahmad and was favoured by \n    Ibn Battah, as it says in al-Insaaf (2/119). Among later scholars \n    this view was favoured by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on them \n    all).  \nOthers were \n    of the view that it is only mustahabb and is not obligatory. This is the \n    view of the majority of scholars among the Sahaabah and Taabi’een and of the \n    Imams Abu Haneefah and al-Shaafa’i, and Ahmad according to the well known \n    view of his madhhab. \nSee: \n    Tabyeen al-Haqaa’iq (1/107); al-Majmoo’ (3/280-282), al-Mughni \n    (1/283); al-Fataawa al-Kubra by Ibn Taymiyah (5/332). \nThose who \n    say that it is obligatory quoted as evidence the verse in which Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n“So when \n    you want to recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge with Allaah from Shaytaan \n    (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one)”\n[al-Nahl \n    16:98]\nThey said: \n    In this verse there is the command to seek refuge with Allaah, and the basic \n    principle is that a command means that something is obligatory, so long as \n    there is no other evidence to indicate that what is meant in the command is \n    mustahabb. \nIbn Hazm \n    said in al-Muhalla (2/279): \nWith regard \n    to the view of Abu Haneefah and al-Shaafa’i, that seeking refuge with Allaah \n    is not obligatory, this is wrong, because Allaah, may He be exalted, says:\n    “So when you want to recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge with Allaah from \n    Shaytaan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one)”. When Allaah commands \n    something, it is wrong for anyone to say without any evidence from the \n    Qur’aan or Sunnah that this is not obligatory, especially His command to \n    pray for Him to protect us from the tricks of the shaytaan.  So this command \n    is definitely obligatory, because avoiding the shaytaan and fleeing from him \n    and asking for protection against him are things that no one can dispute are \n    obligatory. Moreover, Allaah has enjoined that upon us when reading Qur’aan. \n    End quote. \nThe majority \n    of scholars responded by noting that there is other evidence which indicates \n    that it is mustahabb rather than obligatory. This other evidence is: \n1 – The \n    hadeeth about the man who did not pray properly. The Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught him how to pray and said: “When you \n    go to pray, say takbeer, then recite whatever you can of the Qur’aan. Then \n    bow …” Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim (397). And he did not tell him to \n    seek refuge with Allaah. \nImam \n    al-Shaafa’i said in al-Umm (1/208): \nIf he omits \n    it by mistake or out of ignorance or deliberately, he does not have to \n    repeat it or do the prostration of forgetfulness, but I regard it as makrooh \n    to omit it deliberately. If he omits it in the first rak’ah, I prefer for \n    him to say it in some other rak’ah. The only thing that keeps me from \n    telling him to repeat the prayer is the fact that when the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught a man what is sufficient \n    in prayer he said: “say takbeer, then recite…”, and it is not narrated that \n    he told him to seek refuge with Allaah or recite the opening du’aa’. This \n    indicates that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) regarded the opening du’aa’ as something optional, and that \n    seeking refuge with Allaah is something that does not invalidate the prayer \n    if it is omitted. End quote. \n2 –It says \n    in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (4/6): \nThe majority \n    quoted as evidence that the command means that it is recommended and not \n    obligatory the fact that the salaf were unanimously agreed that it is \n    Sunnah. End quote.  \nThe scholars \n    of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas also favoured the view that it \n    is mustahabb and not obligatory, as did Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen. \nIt says in\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (6/383): \nWhat is the \n    ruling on one who forgets to seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed \n    shaytaan and remembers after finishing the prayer, if he remembers that he \n    did not say A’oodhu Billaahi min al-shaytaan il-rajeem (I seek refuge \n    with Allaah from the accursed shaytaan) whilst he was praying? \nThey \n    replied: \nSeeing \n    refuge with Allaah is Sunnah, and it does not matter if it is omitted from \n    the prayer whether deliberately or by mistake. End quote. \nShaykh Ibn \n    ‘Uthaymeen was asked: Should one seek refuge with Allaah in every rak’ah or \n    only in the first rak’ah? \nHe replied: \nSeeking \n    refuge with Allaah from the accursed shaytaan in prayer is Sunnah. \nThe scholars \n    (may Allaah have mercy on them) differed as to whether one should seek \n    refuge with Allaah in every rak’ah or only in the first rak’ah, based on the \n    recitation in prayer – is it regarded as one recitation or is the recitation \n    in each rak’ah separate? \nIt seems to \n    me that the recitation in prayer is one recitation, so one should seek \n    refuge with Allaah in the first rak’ah, unless there happens something that \n    requires seeking refuge with Allaah, such as if there come whispers from the \n    shaytaan (waswaas), because if whispers come from the shaytaan, the \n    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined spitting \n    drily to the left three times and seeking refuge with Allaah from the \n    accursed shaytaan. End quote. \nMajmoo’ \n    Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (13/110) \nThis view is \n    also favoured in the answer to question no. \n    65847. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The concept of seeking refuge with Allah before the recitation of Surah Al-Fatihah (the opening chapter of the Quran) during the prayer is rooted in the practices and teachings of Islam. The act of seeking refuge is often denoted by the phrase \"أعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم\" (A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim), meaning \"I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed devil\". \n\n### Ruling on Seeking Refuge:\n1. **Sunnah Practice**: It is established in the Sunnah (the practices of Prophet Muhammad) that a believer should seek refuge with Allah from the whisperings of Shaytan (Satan) before beginning the recitation of the Quran in prayer. The Prophet Muhammad said, \"When one of you stands to pray, he should say 'أعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم' (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed devil)…\" (Sahih Muslim). This highlights the importance of protection against the disturbances caused by Shaytan during prayer.\n\n2. **Importance in Salah**: According to Islamic teachings, seeking refuge helps the worshipper concentrate on their prayer and spirituality. The recitation of Al-Fatihah is a crucial part of Salah (prayer), and starting off with the invocation of Allah’s protection allows for a more sincere and focused act of worship.\n\n### Relevant Verses from the Quran:\nWhile the Quran does not specifically mention the practice of seeking refuge before Al-Fatihah in the context of prayer, it does emphasize seeking Allah's help and guidance, which can be parallelly applied to this act:\n\n- **Surah Al-Fatihah (Chapter 1, Verses 3-7)**: This passage indicates the importance of worshipping Allah alone and seeking His guidance:\n  - \"Most beneficent, ever-merciful, King of the Day of Judgement. You alone we worship, and to You alone turn for help. Guide us (O Lord) to the path that is straight, The path of those You have blessed, Not of those who have earned Your anger, nor those who have gone astray.\"\n  - Reference: Surah Al-Fatihah, Ayah 3-7.\n\nThe verses affirm seeking help from Allah and guidance, which is the essence of what is intended through the act of seeking refuge.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, seeking refuge with Allah before reciting Al-Fatihah in prayer is considered a practice rooted in Sunnah and recognized for enhancing one's focus and connection during prayer. While the Quran emphasizes seeking guidance and Allah's protection implicitly, the practice finds its basis in the behavioral teachings of Prophet Muhammad (Sunnah). Thus, it is encouraged for Muslims to incorporate this into their Salah to fortify their spiritual experience. \n\n### Citations:\n1. Surah Al-Fatihah (1:3-7).\n2.

        "question": "Is it essential to recite the Quran in sequence for one who wants to complete it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is mustahabb to read Quran a great deal during Ramadaan, because it is the month of the Quran. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong)” [al-Baqarah 2:185].\nJibreel used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) every night in Ramadaan and review the Quran with him. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5) and Muslim (4268). \nAl-Bukhaari (4614) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that Jibreel used to review the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) once every year, and he reviewed it with him twice in the year when he died. This indicates that it is mustahabb to complete the Quran and study it in Ramadaan.\n Hence the salaf used to read Quran a great deal during Ramadaan, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Qataadah (may Allah have mercy on him) used to complete the Quran every seven nights all the time, and every three nights in Ramadaan, and every two nights during the last ten days of Ramadaan.  \nIbraaheem al-Nakha’i used to complete the Quran in Ramadaan every three nights, and in the last ten days every two nights. \nAl-Aswad (may Allah have mercy on him) used to read the entire Quran every two nights throughout the month. End quote from Majaalis Shahr Ramadaan by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) p. 65. \nSecondly: \nThe best is to read the Quran in the order of soorahs as given in the Mus-haf, which is the sequence in which Jibreel reviewed the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at the end of his life.  \nSee: al-Tahbeer fi ‘Ilm al-Tafseer by al-Suyooti, p. 637 \nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Tibyaan: \nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said: The best is to read it in the order in which it appears in the Mus-haf, so he should read al-Faatihah, then al-Baqarah, then Aal ‘Imraan, then al-Nisa’, until he ends with Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi l-naas (Sooratal-Naas), whether he is reciting it in prayer or otherwise. It is also mustahabb, if he recites one soorah, to recite after it the soorah that comes after it. So if he recites Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi l-naas (Sooratal-Naas) in the first rak’ah, he should recite from al-Baqarah in the second. \nThe evidence for that is that the order of soorahs given in the Mus-haf is for a reason, so that order should be followed, except in cases where it is narrated that there is an exception, such as in Fajr prayer on Friday, when Alif-Laam-Meem Tanzeel (Soorat al-Sajdah) is recited in the first rak’ah and Hal ata (Soorat al-Insaan) in the second, and the Eid prayers when Soorat Qaaf and Soorat al-Qamar may be recited. \nIf he recites them in a different order and recites one soorah then recites a soorah that comes before it, or he recites a soorah that does not come straight after it, that is permissible, even if he is not doing what is best. As for reciting a soorah from the end to the beginning, there is no dispute that this is not allowed and is blameworthy, because it is a distortion that detracts from the linguistic miracle of the Quran and goes against the wisdom behind the order in which the verses appear. \nEnd quote from al-Nawawi. \nThere is a report from ‘Aa’ishah which indicates that it is not obligatory to read Quran in sequence. \nAl-Bukhaari (4993) narrated that Yoosuf ibn Maahak said: I was with ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers when an Iraqi came to her and said: “O Mother of the Believers, show me your Mus-haf.” She said: “Why?” He said: “So that I may compile and arrange the Quran according to it, for people recite it with its soorahs not in proper order.” She said: “It does not matter which part you read first. The first part of it to be revealed was a soorah from al-Mufassal which mentioned Paradise and Hell, then when the people became steadfast in Islam, (rulings on) halaal and haraam were revealed. If the first thing to have been revealed was ‘Do not drink wine,’ they would have said: ‘We will never give up wine.’ If it had been revealed, ‘Do not commit zina,’ they would have said, ‘We will never give up zina.’ It was revealed in Makkah to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when I was a young girl playing, ‘Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter’ [al-Qamar 54:46]. And Soorat al-Baqarah and al-Nisa’ were not revealed except I was with him.” \nAl-Haafiz said: \nIt seems to me that this Iraqi was one of those who followed the recitation of Ibn Mas’ood. When the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan was brought to Kufa, Ibn Mas’ood did not agree to recant his recitation or destroy his Mus-haf, and his compilation was different from that of ‘Uthmaan’s Mus-haf. (Compilation means the collection of the Mus-haf in order). Undoubtedly the compilation of ‘Uthmaan’s Mus-haf was more appropriate than any other, hence this Iraqi said that its soorahs were not in proper order. \nIbn Battaal said: We do not know of anyone who regarded it as obligatory to recite the soorahs in order, whether during prayer or otherwise, rather it is permissible to recite al-Kahf before al-Baqarah, or al-Hajj before al-Kahf, for example. As for what is narrated from the salaf about it being forbidden to recite the Quran out of order, what is meant by that is reciting a soorah from its end to its beginning. There was a group which did that in poetry, to demonstrate their precise memorization thereof. So the salaf ruled that this is not allowed with regard to the Quran and it is haraam. Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said: The order of soorahs is not obligatory when reading or praying, or studying or teaching, hence Mus-hafs varied, but when the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan was written they wrote it in the order in which it appears now. Hence the order of the Mus-hafs of the Sahaabah varied… then he mentioned something similar to Ibn Battaal. End quote from Fath al-Baari. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing whether it is essential to recite the Qur'an in sequence for one who wishes to complete it, we must consider various verses that shed light on the nature of its revelation, the instructions given for its recitation, and the flexibility afforded to believers in their practice.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Divine Responsibility for Collection and Recitation:**\n   Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:15-19) emphasizes that the collection and recitation of the Qur'an is under Allah's responsibility. This passage indicates that the sequence might not be the sole priority; what truly matters is faithful adherence to the message conveyed through the recitation:\n   - **Verse:** \"Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility. So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\" (Surah Al-Qiyamah, 75:17-19)\n\n2. **Gradual Revelation:**\n   Surah Al-Furqan (25:32-34) speaks on how the Qur'an was revealed in stages, implying that it was not delivered all at once. This gradual approach serves a purpose in nurturing believers’ understanding and resilience:\n   - **Verse:** \"It was sent thus that We may keep your heart resolute. So We enunciated it by steps and distinctly.\" (Surah Al-Furqan, 25:33)\n\n3. **Flexibility in Recitation:**\n   Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20) provides comfort by stating that believers can recite as much of the Qur'an as they find easy to do. This indicates that individuals are not bound strictly to a sequential recitation but can approach it in a manner that suits their circumstances:\n   - **Verse:** \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily.\" (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20)\n\n4. **Deliberate and Reflective Recitation:**\n   Surah Al-Isra (17:106-108) highlights the importance of reciting the Qur'an slowly and with contemplation. This suggests that the quality of recitation is more significant than the speed or strict sequence:\n   - **Verse:** \"We have divided the Qur'an into parts that you may recite it to men slowly, with deliberation.\" (Surah Al-Isra, 17:106)\n\n5. **Spiritual Engagement:**\n   The intention behind recitation is also significant. Reciting the Qur'an should be an act of devotion and engagement with its meanings, rather than just a mechanical task of completing it from start to finish. The emphasis on humility and sincerity when reciting (as seen in Surah Al-Isra 17:44-48) supports this idea.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the mentioned verses, it is not strictly essential to recite the Qur'an in perfect sequence to complete it. Rather, it is the understanding, reflection, and sincere recitation that hold greater importance. Believers are encouraged to recite what is feasible for them, and Allah has taken responsibility for the collection and recitation of His words. Thus, while completing the Qur'an is commendable, the approach can be flexible and personal, prioritizing quality over strict sequence."

        "question": "Is there any du`a in the Sunnah for after one has completed the Quran?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is no specific u`a narrated in the Sunnah for after one has completed the Quran, or even from the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or the well-known imams. One of the most well-known u`as regarding this matter is the u`a which is written at the end of many Mus-hafs and it attributed to Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), but there is no basis for attributing it to him. See Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 14/226. \nThe u`a after completing the Quran is recited either after completing it whilst praying, or when not praying. There is no basis for reciting any u`a after completing it whilst praying. As for reciting a u`a after completing it when not praying, it is narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) did that. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on making u`a after completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan?  \nHe replied: \nI do not know of any u`a for completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan, either from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from his companions. The most that has been narrated concerning that is that when Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) had completed a reading of the Quran, he would gather his family and make u`a. This had to do with reading it outside of prayer. End quote. \nFataawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 354 \nShaykh Bakr Abu Zayd wrote a useful essay on this issue, at the end of which he said: \nFrom the quotations in the two previous sections we may draw the following conclusion: \n1 – u`a upon completion of the Quran in general: \nThe conclusion concerning this is as follows: \nFirstly: \nWhat we have stated above has to do with u`a upon completion of the Quran in general. \nThere is no proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that, rather the reports are either mawdoo’ (fabricated) or are da’eef (weak) with no other reports to strengthen them. It is almost certain that there are no marfoo’ reports concerning this matter that can be relied upon, because the scholars who wrote comprehensively about the sciences of the Quran and the dhikrs to be recited in connection with the Quran, such as al-Nawawi, Ibn Katheer, al-Qurtubi and al-Suyooti, did not narrate anything other than what we have referred to above. If they had known of any reports with stronger isnaads, they would have quoted them.\nSecondly: \nThere is a saheeh report that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said u`a when he completed the Quran, and he would gather his family and children for that, and that a number of the Taabi’een followed him in that, as mentioned in the report of Mujaahid ibn Jabr (may Allah have mercy on them all). \nThirdly: \nThere is no suggestion in the texts of Imam Abu Haneefah and Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on them) that this is Islamically prescribed. \nWhat is narrated from Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) is that this is not something that the people did, and that completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan is not Sunnah. \nFourthly: \nThe view that it is mustahabb to make u`a after completing the Quran is what is narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), as our Hanbali scholars narrated from him, and as was affirmed by some later scholars of the other three madhhabs. \n2 – u`a following completion of the Quran in prayer \nThis may be summed up as follows:  \nFirstly: \nFrom what is quoted above, there is no one letter from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from one of his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) to indicate that it is Islamically prescribed to recite this u`a in prayer after completing the Quran, before or after bowing, whether that is done by an imam or by one who is praying alone. \nSecondly: \nThe closest we can find on this matter is what was quoted by the scholars of our madhhab from the report from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), according to the report of Hanbal, al-Fadl and al-Harbi, the isnaad of which we cannot find, about saying the u`a for completing the Quran in Taraweeh prayer before bowing. \nAccording to another report narrated from him – the source of which is not known – he allowed it in the u`a of Witr. \nSee Marwiyaat u`a Khatm al-Quran. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, reciting the Qur'an is highly significant and completing its recitation is often seen as an occasion for supplication (du`a). Although there is no specific, universally agreed-upon du`a that must be recited after completing the Qur'an, there are recommended practices and supplications commonly observed by many Muslims upon this occasion. \n\nAmong the common recommendations, it is appropriate to invoke supplications that express gratitude, seek protection from errors and misguidance, and request blessings for oneself and others. One such well-known supplication is:\n\n**1. Du`a after completing the Qur'an:**\nA common supplication among those who have finished the recitation of the Qur'an is: \n\nاللّهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ لِي شَافِعًا يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ\n**\"O Allah, make this Qur'an an intercessor for me on the Day of Judgment.\"**\n\nThis supplication reflects the belief that the Qur'an can intercede for its reciter.\n\n**2. Seeking blessings and guidance:**\nAnother du`a is asking Allah for proper understanding and implementation of the teachings. The following verse can be reflective of such supplication:\n\nيَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَقُولُوا قَوْلًا سَدِيدًا \n**\"O you who have believed, fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice.\"** (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:70)\n\nThese lines encourage one to be steadfast in faith and prayer after engaging with the Holy Revelation.\n\n### Relevant Hadith\nWhile the Qur'an does not specify a direct du`a for after completion, there are numerous hadiths indicating the merits and the connection of the Qur'an to the believer. One popular narration states:\n\n**\"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'The Qur'an will come on the Day of Resurrection and will say: O Lord, dress him with a garment, and will then intercede for him until he is forgiven.'\"** (Sunan Ibn Majah).\n\nThe broader context of completion might also encourage one to pray for the guidance offered in the Qur'an, and for Allah’s mercy and acceptance of your efforts in engaging with His words.\n\n### Conclusion\nComplete recitation of the Qur'an is a momentous occasion for a believer, and while specific du`as aren't rigidly prescribed, personal supplications for forgiveness, guidance, and blessings, as well as expressions of thanks and hopes for intercession, are always fitting. יש \n\nThe practice of invoking Allah after completing the Qur'an underscores the importance placed on the text as both a guide in life and as a source of mercy and forgiveness."

        "question": "They read Qur’aan before Taraaweeh prayer then complete it in the prayer",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      There is nothing wrong with you having this gathering. For \n      one person to read Qur’aan whilst the others listen is something that is \n      prescribed in sharee’ah; the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n      be upon him) and his companions did that. \n\n    It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said \n    to me: “Recite Qur’aan for me.” I said: “O Messenger of Allaah, should I \n    recite it to you when it was revealed to you?” He said: “I like to hear it \n    from someone else.” So I recited Soorat al-Nisa’ to him, until I reached \n    this verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a \n    witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people?”\n\n    [al-Nisa’ 4:41]\nHe said, “That’s enough \n    for now.” And he turned to me with his eyes flowing with tears. \n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4763; Muslim, 800. \n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz said: \n\n    It is prescribed for the Muslims during this blessed month to \n    study the Qur’aan together, day and night, following the example of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with whom Jibreel \n    used to study the Qur’aan every year in Ramadaan, and he studied it with him \n    twice in the last year of his life, and with the aim of drawing closer to \n    Allaah, and pondering the meanings of the Book of Allaah in order to benefit \n    from it and act upon it. This is the way of the righteous salaf and the \n    believers, male and female, should occupy themselves with the Qur’aan, \n    reciting it, pondering its meanings and referring to the books of tafseer in \n    order to benefit from it and learn more. \n\n    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, \n    11/319, 320. \nIt is better when reading \n    Qur’aan to also learn the rulings of the Qur’aan, and understand it \n    meanings. So if you add to reading some tafseer (commentary) on what you \n    read or on part of it, then you will combine many good things, such as \n    following the Sunnah, studying the Qur’aan together, teaching the Muslims \n    and helping them to ponder the Qur’aan. \n\n    If this completion of the Qur’aan is done in Taraaweeh prayer \n    that is better than it being done outside the prayer. \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra \n    (2/297): \nThe command and \n    encouragement to recite Qur’aan applies more to the one who is praying than \n    to anyone else, for reciting the Qur’aan in prayer is better than reciting \n    it outside of prayer. The reports which speak of the virtue of the one who \n    recites Qur’aan refer to the one who is praying more than anyone else. End \n    quote. \n\n    If it is difficult for the people to complete the Qur’aan in \n    the prayer, they can combine two good things: studying the Qur’aan before \n    the prayer, and reciting the rest during the prayer, as you are doing. \n\n    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous \n    during Ramadaan when Jibreel would meet with him. He would meet him on every \n    night of Ramadaan and study the Qur’aan with him. And the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was as generous as \n    the wind in doing good. \n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3048; Muslim, 2308. \n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was asked: \n\n    Can it be understood from the fact that Jibreel (peace be \n    upon him) studied Qur’aan with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) every night in Ramadaan, that it is good to complete the \n    Qur’aan (in this month)? \n\n    He replied: \n\n    It may be understood that it is mustahabb to study the \n    Qur’aan and that the believer should study it with those who will benefit \n    him and help him, because the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) studied with Jibreel (peace be upon him) for a reason, because \n    Jibreel was the one who had brought it from Allaah, so he was the emissary \n    between Allaah and the Messengers. \n\n    Undoubtedly the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) would benefit from his study with Jibreel, such as learning the \n    variant recitations (huroof) of the Qur’aan and the meanings intended by \n    Allaah. If a person studies with someone who will help him to understand the \n    Qur’aan and help him to pronounce it properly, this is what is desirable, \n    just as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) studied \n    it with Jibreel. The point is not that Jibreel was better than the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but Jibreel was the \n    messenger who brought it from Allaah and conveyed to the Messenger  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that which Allaah had commanded \n    him, namely the Qur’aan and its pronunciation and meanings. So the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) benefited from Jibreel in \n    these ways. This does not mean that Jibreel was better than the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for he is the best of mankind \n    and is better than the angels. But there was a great deal of goodness in \n    their studying the Qur’aan together, for the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and for the ummah, because it was studying \n    what had come from Allaah in order to benefit from what had come from \n    Allaah. \n\n    There is another benefit in that, which is that studying \n    together at night is better than doing so during the day, because this study \n    used to take place at night, and it is known that the night is better for \n    studying than the day because one is better able to focus and concentrate \n    then. \n\n    Another benefit is that studying together is prescribed in \n    sharee’ah, and it is a righteous deed even if it is done at times other than \n    Ramadaan, because it benefits both parties. Even if there are more than two, \n    it doesn’t matter, because each of them can benefit from his brothers and \n    they can encourage one another to read. It may be that a person would not be \n    motivated to read if he sits on his own, but if he has a companion or \n    companions to study with him, that will encourage him to read, as well as \n    the benefits they will all share of studying and learning together. \n\n    It may be understood from that that the imam’s reading the \n    whole Qur’aan to the congregation during Ramadaan is a kind of this studying \n    together, because it enables them to listen to the whole Qur’aan. Hence Imam \n    Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) liked the one who was leading them in \n    prayer to complete the Qur’aan with them. This is akin to the practice of \n    the salaf who used to like to hear the whole of the Qur’aan, but this does \n    not mean that he should hasten and rush and not be deliberate in his reading \n    and humble, focused and at ease in his prayer. Rather paying attention to \n    these matters is more important than reciting the entire Qur’aan. \n\n    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, \n    11/331-333 \n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was also asked: \n\n    Many imams are keen to complete the Qur’aan in Taraaweeh and \n    they strive to let the congregation hear the entire Qur’aan. Is there \n    anything wrong with that? \n\n    He replied: \n\n    This is a good deed, so the imam may recite a juz’ or less \n    each night, then read more during the last ten nights so as to complete the \n    Qur’aan. This applies if it is easy for him to do so and will not cause any \n    hardship… The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    wrote a chapter in his book Jala’ al-Afhaam fi’l-Salaati wa’l-Salaam ‘ala \n    Khayr al-Anaam, in which he described how the salaf were keen to \n    complete the Qur’aan; we advise you to read this chapter in order to learn \n    more. \n\n    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, \n    11/333, 334. \n\n    See also the answers to questions no. \n    46088, \n    1505, \n    4039. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the practice of reciting a portion of the Qur'an before the Taraaweeh (night prayer during Ramadan) and then completing its recitation within the prayer is rooted in the importance of both prayer and the recitation of the Qur'an, particularly during the month of Ramadan. Here are some key aspects of this practice supported by verses from the Qur'an:\n\n### 1. Divine Guidance and Importance of Prayer\nThe Qur'an emphasizes the significance of prayer and recitation of the Qur'an as a source of guidance. In **Surah Al-Isra (17:78-81)**, Allah instructs believers to observe prayer from the decline of the sun until nightfall, indicating the structured nature of worship during the day. This structure sets the context for Taraaweeh, which is a night prayer particularly emphasized during Ramadan:\n\n- **Verse**: “Observe the service of prayer from the sun's declining from the meridian to the darkening of the night, and the recitation at dawn. Indeed, the Recitation at dawn is palpably evident.” *(Surah Al-Isra, 17:78)*\n\n### 2. Recitation of the Qur'an as Healing and Blessing\nThe Qur'an is presented as a healing and a grace for those who believe, highlighting its significance in the lives of Muslims. This further underscores the importance of reciting the Qur'an, particularly during Taraaweeh:\n\n- **Verse**: “What We have sent down of the Qur'an is a healing and a grace for the faithful, and adds only loss for the sinners.” *(Surah Al-Isra, 17:82)*\n\n### 3. The Role of the Qur'an in Ramadan\nThe revelation of the Qur'an during the month of Ramadan is significant, as stated in **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:185)**. This verse highlights that Ramadan is when the Qur'an was sent down, making the recitation during this month particularly poignant:\n\n- **Verse**: “Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance, and criterion (of falsehood and truth).” *(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:185)*\n\n### 4. The Qur'an's Gradual Revelation\nThe gradual revelation of the Qur'an serves as an essential aspect of its relaying to humanity. This is noted in **Surah Al-Furqan (25:32)**, emphasizing the importance of the Qur'an's recitation in manageable portions for better understanding:\n\n- **Verse**: “The unbelievers say: 'Why was the whole Qur'an not sent down all at once to him?' It was sent thus that We may keep your heart resolute.” *(Surah Al-Furqan, 25:32)*\n\n### 5. Encouragement to Recite in Prayer\nIn **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**, Allah instructs believers to recite as much of the Qur'an as they can easily, emphasizing flexibility in worship. This applies to Taraaweeh prayers, where reciting longer passages is encouraged:\n\n- **Verse**: “So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily.” *(Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20)*\n\nIn conclusion, the practice of reading the Qur'an before Taraaweeh and then completing it during the prayer is well-supported by Qur'anic verses. It reflects the value placed on both prayer and the recitation of the Qur'an, particularly during the sacred month of Ramadan. Breathing life into the prayers, these practices serve to heighten the spiritual experience and deepen the bond between the believer and the divine."

        "question": "Can You Listen to the Quran while Sleeping?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can you listen to Quran while sleeping?\nThere is nothing wrong with a Muslim listening to Quran before he sleeps , or listening to a lecture or anything permissible. Indeed it is narrated in the sahih Sunnah that among the adhkar to be recited before going to sleep are some du`as and verses and Surahs from the Quran . \nAl-Bukhari said: \nChapter: Seeking refuge with Allah and reciting Quran when going to sleep \n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would blow into his hands and recite the Mu’awwadhat, and wipe his body with them. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5960)\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed me to guard the zakah of Ramadan, and someone came and started to rummage in the food. I took hold of him and said: “I am going to take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)”… And he said: “When you go to your bed, recite Ayat al-Kursi, and you will have ongoing protection from Allah and no devil will come near you until morning comes.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He spoke the truth even though he is a liar; that was a devil.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3101) \nBenefits of listening to Quran while sleeping\nListening to Quran before going to sleep and after, during Ramadan and at other times, instills tranquility in the heart and helps one relax. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  \n“Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.” [Al-Ra’d 13:28]\nFor more, please see these answers: 14590 , 78370 , 124657 , and 228366 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Listening to the Quran while sleeping is a practice that many Muslims engage in, and it is generally considered permissible. The Quran is a source of guidance, comfort, and tranquility, and many believers find that listening to its verses can help foster a peaceful environment conducive to rest and reflection.\n\n### Affirmative Points Regarding Listening to the Quran While Sleeping:\n\n1. **Spiritual Receptiveness During Sleep**: While sleeping, a person’s subconscious is still active, potentially allowing the words of the Quran to resonate in their mind. The power of the Quran to affect the heart and spirit is emphasized in various verses. For instance, in Surah Al-Isra (17:82), it is said, \"What We have sent down of the Qur'an is a healing and a grace for the faithful, and adds only loss for the sinners.\" This points to the Quran’s ability to impart peace and healing, which can be beneficial even when a person is not fully conscious.\n\n2. **Recitation as a Form of Worship**: Listening to the Quran can be viewed as a form of dhikr (remembrance of Allah), which is commendable. It provides solace and tranquility, contributing to a pure state of mind before sleep. The practice aligns with the encouragement to reflect upon and engage with the Quran meaningfully. Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20) emphasizes the importance of recitation, stating: \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily.\"\n\n3. **Use of Time**: The nighttime is presented as a time for reflection and worship. Surah An-Naba (78:9-13), mentions, “And made sleep for you to rest, the night a covering,” highlighting the essential purpose of night as a period for rest and contemplation. Engaging with the Quran during this time could be seen as beneficial.\n\n4. **Gradual Recitation Encouraged**: Surah Al-Isra (17:106) encourages recitation at a manageable pace, implying that listening to the Quran does not require full conscious engagement at all times: \"We have divided the Qur'an into parts that you may recite it to men slowly, with deliberation.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nListening to the Quran while sleeping is not only permissible but can also be spiritually enriching. The Quran serves as a guide, a source of comfort, and healing for believers, making it a suitable companion during rest. While listening during sleep may not be an active form of worship, it still constitutes an engagement with the divine word and can enhance spiritual consciousness.\n\n### Supporting Verses:\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:82)**: \"What We have sent down of the Qur'an is a healing and a grace for the faithful...\"\n- **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**: \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily...\"\n- **Surah An-Naba (78:9-13)**: \"And made sleep for you to rest, the night a covering...\"\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:106)**: \"We have divided the Qur'an into parts that you may recite it to men slowly...\" \n\nThese references indicate that engaging with the Quran—even passively, as in listening while sleeping—has its foundations in Islamic teachings and can bring about spiritual benefits."

        "question": "Which is better, reading Qur’aan together or individually?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \nFirstly: \nWith regard to how he reviewed it with him, I \n    do not know how that was done. \nSecondly: \nWith regard to whether it is mustahabb for \n    people to gather to read Qur’aan together or for each person to read it individually, that depends on the person himself. If gathering with his \n    brothers to study Qur’aan together will make him more focused and help him to learn better, then gathering with others is preferable, i.e., if \n    gathering with others will make him have proper presence of mind and be more focused on pondering the meanings of the Qur’aan, and allow the \n    opportunity to discuss the meanings, then that is better. But if it is the opposite then reading it on his own is better. \nThirdly: \nWith regard to Jibreel reviewing the Qur’aan \n    with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that was for the purpose of making sure that the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) memorized it.  \nWith regard to the third part of your \n    question – which is whether it is better to do that at night rather than during the day – the answer is yes, but a person may need to do other \n    things which means that he cannot study Qur’aan at night, in which case he should study it more during the day. \nSo each person should look at what is best for him, because of the general meaning of the \n    words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Strive to do that which will benefit you.” So whatever is more beneficial \n    for you, so long as it is not forbidden according to sharee’ah, is best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether it is better to read the Qur’ān individually or in a group is nuanced and can be approached from various perspectives within Islamic teachings. Both forms of reading the Qur’ān have their own significance and benefits. \n\n1. **Reading Together (Group Recitation):**\n   - Group recitation of the Qur’ān is encouraged in Islam, especially within the context of prayers (Salah) and gatherings where believers come together to study and reflect on the scriptures. This practice not only fosters a sense of community but also enhances the understanding of the text, as participants can share insights and interpretations. \n   - The Qur’ān emphasizes the importance of reciting it in a way that can be heard by others. For example, in Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:4-8), Allah instructs the Prophet Muhammad to recite the Qur’ān slowly and distinctly, which can be particularly powerful in a communal setting. The verse states: \"Or a little more, and recite the Qur’an slowly and distinctly\" (Surah Al-Muzzammil, Ayah 4). This indicates that recitation is not just an individual endeavor but can also be impactful when done in unison.\n   - Additionally, in Surah Al-Isra (17:44), it is mentioned that when the Qur’ān is recited, believers are encouraged to listen attentively: \"When the Qur'an is recited listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed\" (Surah Al-Isra, Ayah 44). This further underscores the importance of shared recitation.\n\n2. **Reading Individually:**\n   - On the other hand, reading the Qur’ān individually also holds deep merit. It allows for personal reflection and a closer connection with the text. The act of reading the Qur’ān alone enables an individual to ponder its meanings and apply its teachings to personal circumstances.\n   - Allah encourages personal devotion in Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20), where He acknowledges that individuals may be occupied with their lives: \"So read as much from it as you can easily\" (Surah Al-Muzzammil, Ayah 20). This suggests that Allah recognizes each person's capacity and circumstances, providing flexibility in how and when one engages with His Book.\n   - Furthermore, in Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:17-19), it is stated that the responsibility of the collection and recitation of the Qur’ān is upon Allah. This assurance can motivate individuals to engage deeply with the text in personal solitude, trusting in divine support. As mentioned in the verse: \"Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility\" (Surah Al-Qiyamah, Ayah 17).\n\n3. **Combining Both Approaches:**\n   - Many scholars advocate for a balanced approach, asserting that both individual and group readings have unique benefits. Group recitation can enhance understanding through discussion and shared insights, while individual recitation allows for personal connection and reflection.\n   - Engaging in both forms of recitation can help a believer reap the spiritual rewards of communal worship while simultaneously fostering a personal relationship with the divine message of the Qur’ān.\n\nIn conclusion, neither approach is categorically superior; they each provide unique benefits and can complement each other. Ultimately, the choice depends on personal circumstances, spiritual goals, and the specific context in which one is engaging with the Qur’ān. Both reading practices are valuable and reflect different aspects of devotion toward understanding and implementing Islamic teachings."

        "question": "He claims that the Qur’aan is lacking in eloquence and contains grammatical errors",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThe one who is not able to engage in debate \n    with others should fear Allaah and not get involved in debates and arguments with others; rather he should try to protect his religious commitment \n    by refraining from arguing with the ignorant or those who promote specious arguments.  \nSecondly: \nWith regard to the specious arguments \n    mentioned – which are more flimsy than a spider’s web – these may be answered in two ways. \nThe first way is in general terms, which is \n    to say that the Qur’aan is the Book of Allaah which was revealed to the pure Arabs, who were the most advanced nation in the field of eloquence; \n    they paid a great deal of attention to that and had reached a high level of eloquent self-expression. They had established festivals of poetry and \n    speech-giving, they hung their mu’allaqaat poems on the Ka’bah as a sign of the high esteem in which they held eloquence and literature; they \n    competed in poetry and beautiful speech. Poetry flowed through their veins and they recited poems on all occasions, for joy and sorrow, birth and \n    death, happiness and misery, victory and defeat. This was something that was unknown in any other nation. \nHence by His wisdom Allaah revealed to them \n    this Qur’aan in this language of which they were so proud and because of which they thought themselves superior to other nations. The Qur’aan \n    dazzled them with its beautiful words and meanings, its great purpose and structure. So they submitted to it out of respect for its language and \n    dare not speak any word of criticism against its wording, grammar or expression.  \nAllaah challenged them in His Book to produce \n    anything like the Qur’aan, but they could not match it, let alone find fault with its grammar. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Say: ‘If the mankind and the jinn were \n    together to produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another’”\n    [al-Isra’ 17:88]\nThen Allaah challenged them to produced ten \n    soorahs like it, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Or they say, ‘He (Prophet Muhammad) \n    forged it (the Qur’aan).’ Say: ‘Bring you then ten forged Soorah (chapters) like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allaah (to your \n    help), if you speak the truth!’”\n[Hood 11:13]\nWhen they were unable to do that, then Allaah \n    challenged them to produce just one soorah like it. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and \n    Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur’aan) to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a Soorah (chapter) of \n    the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allaah, if you are truthful”\n[al-Baqarah 2:23]\nNo one who comes afterwards, when the \n    language has become corrupted and mixed with foreign languages, has any right to support such nonsensical ideas that do no more than point to the \n    depth of his ignorance and the shallowness of his thinking, and his lack of knowledge of the Arabic language. As it was said,  \n“How often do you see someone criticizing \n    something that is sound, and his problem is that he cannot understand it properly.” \nThe second way is in specific, detailed \n    terms, discussing the aspects of eloquence in the words that he criticized. This is as follows: \nWith regard to the words of Allaah \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Some you disbelieved and some you killed \n    (fafareeqan kadhdhabtum wa fareeqan taqtuloon)”\n[al-Baqarah 2:87]\nThe scholar al-Taahir ibn ‘Ashoor said in his \n    commentary (al-Tahreer wa’l-Tanweer, 1/598): \nThe word taqtuloon (translated as “you \n    killed”) appears in the present tense form to emphasize more vividly the terrible action that they did, namely killing the Prophets. This is like \n    the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And it is Allaah Who sends [arsala – part \n    tense form] the winds, so that they raise up [fa tutheeru – present tense form] the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land, and revive therewith \n    the earth after its death”\n[Faatir 35:9]\nMoreover, the form taqtuloon fits with \n    the rhyme of the soorah and makes it more vivid; this provides eloquence of meaning and beauty of form. End of quote. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen quoted in his \n    Tasfeer (1/283) from some of the scholars another reason for using the present tense form taqtuloon, which is to provide a sense of \n    continuity, i.e., the Jews kept on killing the Prophets, even the last of them, Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They \n    killed the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the poison that they gave him at Khaybar, and he  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) continued to suffer the effects of that until, in his final illness, he said, “I still feel pain from the food I \n    ate at Khaybar. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.” \nAbu Dawood; also narrated by al-Bukhaari in a \n    mu’allaq report. Al-Albaani said in Saheeh Abi Dawood (3784), it is hasan saheeh. \nWith regard to the verse in which Allaah says \n     \n(interpretation of the meaning):\n“When \n    He has decreed something, He says to it only: ‘Be!’ __and \n    it is [kun fa yakoon]”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:47]\nThis is more indicative of the ignorance of \n    this objector, because this verse is speaking of when Allaah wills to create something in the future, not in the past; this is to be understood \n    from the use of the word idha (meaning when, if), which refers to something in the future. Hence the verb yaqool (says) appears in \n    the present tense, to indicate that it is referring to something in the future, and it is followed by the verb yakoon (it is), also in the \n    present tense, which also refers to something in the future. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The claim that the Qur'an is lacking in eloquence and contains grammatical errors is addressed within the text itself, as it robustly asserts its own inimitability and linguistic excellence. The Qur'an challenges critics to produce a verse like it, emphasizing that it is a divine revelation marked by eloquence and precision. Here are several points supported by verses from the Qur'an:\n\n1. **Inimitability of the Qur'an**: The Qur'an presents a challenge to humanity regarding its linguistic excellence and invites doubters to produce something similar. This challenge underscores its unique eloquence and structure. For instance, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:23) states:\n   > \"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to Our Servant, then produce a surah like it.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:23)\n\n2. **Assertion of Eloquence**: The Qur'an describes itself in terms of its eloquence and clarity. Surah Ash-Shu’ara (26:195) confirms:\n   > \"In eloquent Arabic.\" (Surah Ash-Shu'ara, 26:195)\n\n3. **Divine Authorship**: The Qur'an explicitly states that it is not a product of human authorship or poetry. Surah Al-Haqqah (69:40-44) asserts its divine origin:\n   > \"This is indeed the word of the noble Messenger... It has been sent down by the Lord of all the worlds.\" (Surah Al-Haqqah, 69:40-43)\n\n4. **Protection from Corruption**: Surah Fussilat (41:42) emphasizes the preservation of the Qur'an from falsehood:\n   > \"Falsehood cannot enter it from any side.\" (Surah Fussilat, 41:42)\n\n5. **Acknowledgment of Skeptics' Claims**: The Qur'an acknowledges the doubts raised by its critics, illustrating that allegations of it being the product of magic or old tales are unfounded. Surah Al-Muddaththir (74:24-25) recounts this skepticism:\n   > \"And said: 'This is nothing but the magic of old, Nothing more than the speech of a man!'\" (Surah Al-Muddaththir, 74:24-25)\n\n6. **Excellence in Eloquence**: The Qur'an affirms that its eloquence is beyond that of poets and soothsayers, emphasizing that it is not comparable to mundane speech. In Surah Al-Haqqah (69:41-45), it states:\n   > \"And not the word of a poet. How little is it that you believe!\" (Surah Al-Haqqah, 69:41-42)\n\nEach of these verses underscores the Qur'an's defense against claims of lacking eloquence or containing errors. In fact, the coherence, consistency, and rhetorical beauty of the Qur'an are frequently cited as evidence of its divine origin and literary merit. Furthermore, the challenge to produce something similar demonstrates confidence in its linguistic perfection. Hence, the assertion that the Qur'an possesses grammatical errors contradicts the many verses where it emphasizes its own linguistic excellence and divine origin."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In prayer, it is better to recite from memory. See question no. 3465. \nOutside of prayer, it is better for a person to do that which will increase his khushoo’ (humility, focus). If his khushoo’ will be increased by reciting from memory, then that is better; if his khushoo’ will be increased by reading from the Mus-haf, then that is better. If it is the same in either case, then reading from the Mus-haf is better, because it combines reading and looking, and his eyes will be protected from looking at things that may distract him from reciting and pondering the meaning. \nAl-Nawawi said in al-Adhkaar (p. 90-91): \nReading Quran from the Mus-haf is better than reciting from memory; this is the view of our companions and it is well known from the salaf (may Allah be pleased with them). This does not apply in all cases however; if the reader can focus and ponder the meanings more when reciting from memory than when reading from the Mus-haf, then reciting from memory is better. If it is the same in both cases, then reading from the Mus-haf is better. This is what the salaf meant. \nThere are weak (da’eef) ahaadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which cannot be used as proof that it is better to look at the Mus-haf. We mention them only to draw attention to the fact that they are weak. These include: \n“Looking at the Mus-haf is an act of worship; for a child to look at his parents is an act of worship; looking at ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib is an act of worship.” This is a fabricated (mawdoo’) hadith, as al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 1/531. \n“Give your eyes their share of worship: looking at the Mus-haf, thinking about it and pondering its wonders.” This is also fabricated (mawdoo’). Al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 4/88. \n“Five things are acts of worship: eating little, sitting in the mosque, looking at the Ka’bah, looking at the Mus-haf and looking at the face of a scholar.” This is a very weak (da’eef jiddan) hadith. Da’eef al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, no. 2855. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether it is better to recite the Qur'an from memory (Hifz) or to read from the Mus-haf (the physical copy of the Qur'an) is a topic that engenders diverse opinions among scholars. Each approach has its own merits that can be substantiated by Qur'anic verses.\n\n### Reciting from Memory\n\n1. **Encouragement for Memory**: The Qur'an emphasizes that God helps in making the recitation memorable. In Surah Al-A'la (87:6-8), Allah promises to help the believer recite and not forget the Qur'an: \"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, unless God please. He knows the visible and knows what is hidden.\" This verse encourages the effort of memorizing the Qur'an, suggesting a divine aid in retaining what is committed to memory.\n\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-A'la, Ayah 6-8 (87:6-8)\n\n2. **Greater Reward**: Memorizing the Qur'an and reciting it from memory has traditionally been associated with greater reward in the hereafter. It also allows for a seamless and spontaneous connection with the text, enabling the reciter to engage more deeply in prayer and reflection.\n\n3. **Recitation in Prayer**: When leading prayers (Salah), the ability to recite from memory allows the imam or individual to engage with the Quran without the distraction of holding a book, potentially enhancing the spiritual experience.\n\n---\n\n### Reading from the Mus-haf\n\n1. **Organization and Clarity**: The recitation from the Mus-haf also has tremendous value. Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:16-19) mentions the importance of the recitation, suggesting that one should follow the reading as it is presented in the Book. \"So, as We recite it, follow its reading.\" This implies that the structured format of the Mus-haf aids understanding and corrects pronunciation.\n\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Qiyamah, Ayah 16-19 (75:16-19)\n\n2. **Accessibility**: For those who are not proficient in memorization or for whom memorizing the Qur'an is difficult, reading from the Mus-haf provides accessibility to the text. It allows people of varying skill levels to engage with the text properly.\n\n3. **Reflection and Meditation**: Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206) states the importance of listening to the Qur'an when it is recited, which can easily occur when one is reading from the Mus-haf. The contemplative nature of reading can induce deeper understanding and reflection. \n\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-A'raf, Ayah 204-206 (7:204-206)\n\n4. **Focus on Meaning**: Reading from the Mus-haf can also facilitate a focus on the meaning of the verses, allowing the reader to reflect and ponder the text.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUltimately, the choice between reciting the Qur'an from memory and reading from the Mus-haf may depend on individual capabilities, circumstances, and preferences. Both methods are valid and can complement one another. Many scholars advocate for a balanced approach where one seeks to memorize portions of the Qur'an while simultaneously reading from the Mus-haf to enhance understanding and maintain fluency. Each approach is valuable, and both lead to spiritual growth and understanding of the Qur'an. \n\nIn conclusion, it is beneficial to strive for both memorization and reading from a Mus-haf, thereby reaping the rewards and insights from both practices."

        "question": "Are precious stones mentioned in the Qur’aan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The primary purpose of the Qur’aan is to \n    guide mankind to Allaah, so that they will affirm His Oneness and worship Him alone, and attain His Paradise and His pleasure. The Qur’aan is not \n    a book of science, medicine or astronomy, even though its verses may contain a little of such things. \nHence the Muslim should not let himself be \n    distracted from the greater purpose of reciting the Qur’aan and look for the number of stones or rivers or kinds of animals mentioned therein. \nSome precious stones such as rubies, pearls \n    and coral are mentioned in the Qur’aan. \nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“(In beauty) they are like rubies and \n    coral”\n[al-Rahmaan 55:58] \n“Out of them both come out pearl and \n    coral”\n[al-Rahmaan 55:22] \n“Like unto preserved pearls”\n[al-Waaqi’ah 56:23] \n“And round about them will (serve) boys of \n    everlasting youth. If you see them, you would think them scattered pearls”\n[al-Insaan 76:19]\nThese stones do not have any spiritual significance, rather they are mentioned in the Qur’aan \n    to explain the blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon His slaves, of the seas and the things that are brought forth from them, or as a metaphor – \n    so al-hoor al-‘iyn are likened to rubies, coral and preserved pearls, combining the purity of rubies and the whiteness of pearls and \n    coral. \nThe boys are likened to scattered pearls, to \n    indicate their beauty and good looks. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, precious stones and ornaments are mentioned in the Qur'an, particularly in relation to wealth, beauty, and the adornments of paradise.\n\n1. **Surah Az-Zukhruf (43:33-35)**  \n   This passage reflects on the material wealth and adornments that are often sought after in this world. It speaks about ornaments of gold and silver, suggesting that these are seen as signs of prosperity and influence.  \n   **Verses:**  \n   > \"Had it not been that all people would become one community (of unbelievers), We might have given those who disbelieve in Ar-Rahman roofs of silver for their dwellings and (silver) stairs for mounting, And doors (of silver) for their houses, (silver) couches for reclining, And ornaments of gold. But all this would have been nothing but the vanity of this world. The Hereafter with your Lord is for those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path.\"  \n   **Source:** Surah 43 - Az-Zukhruf, Ayahs 33-35.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Rahman (55:58)**  \n   In this verse, the Qur'an describes the rewards of Paradise, comparing the maidens within it to precious stones:  \n   **Verse:**  \n   > \"In them maidens with averted glances, undeflowered by man or by jinn before them, -- As though rubies and pearls.\"  \n   **Source:** Surah 55 - Ar-Rahman, Ayah 58.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:22-23)**  \n   This passage continues the theme of Paradise, mentioning companions that are described with precious qualities:  \n   **Verses:**  \n   > \"And companions with big beautiful eyes Like pearls within their shells.\"  \n   **Source:** Surah 56 - Al-Waqi'ah, Ayahs 22-23.\n\n4. **Surah Az-Zukhruf (43:50-54)**  \n   In this context, there is also a mention of gold bracelets, which might be interpreted as an adornment not just in the worldly sense but also as a metaphor for the societal perceptions:  \n   **Verses:**  \n   > \"Am I (not) better than him who is contemptible, and cannot even express himself clearly? Why were then no bracelets of gold shed upon him from above, or angels sent down as a retinue with him?\"  \n   **Source:** Surah 43 - Az-Zukhruf, Ayah 51-52.\n\nThese references illustrate that precious stones and ornaments are not only a part of worldly wealth but also serve as symbols of beauty and reward in the context of the Afterlife in Islam. The utilization of such imagery provides both a critique of materialism and a vision of eternal beauty in paradise."

        "question": "Who Wrote the Quran?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah promised to preserve the Quran\nAllah has guaranteed to preserve this Quran Himself . Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]\nIbn Jareer al-Tabari said in his Tafseer, 14/8: \n“Allah is saying, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (Reminder), i.e. the Quran, and We will guard the Quran against anything false being added to it that is not part of it, or anything that is part of it being taken away, whether that has to do with rulings, hudood punishments or matters having to do with inheritance.” \nAl-Sa’di said in his Tafseer (p. 696): \n“It is We Who have sent down the Quran in which there is mention of all issues and clear evidence, and in which We remind those who want to be reminded.  \n“and surely, We will guard it” means, when it is being revealed and after it has been revealed. When it is revealed, We protect it from the tampering of every accursed devil, and after it has been revealed Allah instilled it in the heart of His Messenger. Allah protected the words from being changed and from anything being added or taken away, or from its meanings being distorted. So no one can attempt to distort its meanings but Allah will guide someone to explain the truth of the Quran. This is one of the greatest signs of Allah and His blessing to His believing slaves. Another aspect of this protection is that Allah protects the people of the Quran against their enemies, and no enemy can overpower them and eliminate them.”  \nThe Quran was revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in stages over a period of twenty-three years. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And (it is) a Quran which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages'' [al-Isra’ 17:106]\nal-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“This means, We have revealed this Quran in stages, to differentiate between guidance and misguidance, between truth and falsehood.\n “in order that you might recite it to men at intervals” means, slowly, so that they may ponder and think about its meanings, and understand the different branches of knowledge contained therein. \n“And We have revealed it by stages” means, gradually, over a period of twenty-three years.” Tafseer al-Sa’di, p. 760. \nLiteracy was not widespread among the Arabs \nLiteracy was not widespread among the Arabs. Allah described them in such terms when He said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad) from among themselves” [al-Jumu’ah 63:2]\nThey used to memorize the Quran by heart, and a few of them used to write down some verses or surahs on animal skins, thin white stones and the like. \nThe prohibition to write anything other than the Quran\nAt first the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the writing of anything other than the Quran, and he forbade them to write down his words for a while, so that the Sahabah would focus on memorizing the Quran and writing it down, and so that the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would not be confused with the words of Allah, and so the Quran was protected from anything being added or taken away. \nThe Prophetic order to write down the revelation\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed a group of his Companions who were trustworthy and knowledgeable to write down the revelation . They are known in their biographies as those who wrote down the Revelation, such as the four Caliphs, ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, Mu’awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, Zayd ibn Thabit and others – may Allah be pleased with them all. \nThe Quran was revealed in seven dialects\nThe Quran was revealed in seven dialects as was narrated in the saheeh hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This was narrated by al-Bukhari (2287) and Muslim (818); these were the dialects of the Arabs which were known for their eloquence. \nHow was the Quran compiled?\nThe Quran continued to be preserved in the hearts of the Sahabah who had memorized it, and on the skins and other materials until the time of the caliph Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him). \nDuring the Riddah wars many of the Sahabah who had memorized the Quran were killed, and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) was afraid that the Quran would be lost. So he consulted the senior Sahabah about compiling the Quran in a single book so that it would remain preserved and would not be lost. He entrusted this mission to the chief of memorizers Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him). Al-Bukhari narrated in his Saheeh (4986) that Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said:  \nAbu Bakr al-Siddeeq sent for me when the people of al-Yamamah had been killed [i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against the false prophet Musaylimah]. (I went to him) and found ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), “ ‘Umar has come to me and said: ‘Casualties were heavy among the Qurra of the Quran (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the battle of al-Yamamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Quran may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you (Abu Bakr) order that the Quran be collected.” I said to 'Umar, \"How can you do something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do?\" 'Umar said, \"By Allah, this is something good.\" 'Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my heart to it and I began to realize the good in the idea which 'Umar had realized.\" Then Abu Bakr said (to me). “You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). So search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Quran and compile it in one book.\" By Allah If they had ordered me to move one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to compile the Quran. Then I said (to Abu Bakr), \"How can you do something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"By Allah, it is a good thing.\" Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my heart to that to which He had opened the hearts of Abu Bakr and 'Umar. So I started looking for the Quran and collecting it from (what it was written on) palm stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, until I found the last Verse of Surah al-Taubah with Abu Khuzaymah al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The verse is (interpretation of the meaning):  \n\"Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty...” [al-Taubah 9:128] until the end of Surat Bara'ah (i.e., al-Taubah).  \nThen the complete manuscript (copy) of the Quran remained with Abu Bakr until he died, then with 'Umar until the end of his life, and then with Hafsah, the daughter of 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). \nThe Sahabi Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) knew the Quran by heart but he was methodical in his confirmation; he would not agree to write down any verse until two of the Sahabah testified that they had heard it from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  \nWhat was the Quran copy of ‘Uthman?\nThis Mus-haf (written copy of the Quran) remained in the hands of the caliphs until the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliph ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him). The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) had dispersed to different lands, and they used to recite the Quran according to what they had heard of the seven recitations from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and each of their students used to recite according to what he had heard from his shaykh.\nIf a student heard someone reciting in a manner different from what he knew, he would denounce him and accuse him of making a mistake, and this went on until the Sahabah feared that there would be fitnah (trouble) between the Tabi'een and successive generations. So they thought that they should unite the people in following one recitation, which was in the dialect of Quraysh in which the Quran had first been revealed, so as to dispel any disputes and resolve the matter. ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) was consulted, and he agreed with this opinion. \nAl-Bukhari narrated in his Saheeh (4988) from Anas ibn Malik that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman came to ‘Uthman at the time when the people of Sham (Syria) and the people of Iraq were waging war to conquer Armenia and Azerbaijan. Hudhayfah was alarmed by their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Quran, so he said to 'Uthman, \"O Ameer al-Mu’mineen! Save this nation before they dispute about the Book (Quran) as the Jews and the Christians did before.\" So 'Uthman sent a message to Hafsah saying, \"Send us the manuscript of the Quran so that we may make copies of the Mus-haf and we will return the manuscript to you.\"  \nHafsah sent it to 'Uthman. Then 'Uthman ordered Zayd ibn Thabit, 'Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr, Sa’eed ibn al-‘As and ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Harith ibn Hisham to copy out the manuscripts. 'Uthman said to the three men who were from Quraysh (the tribe of which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a member), “In case you disagree with Zayd ibn Thabit on any point in the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraysh, for the Quran was revealed in their tongue.\" They did so, and when they had written many copies, 'Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsah.  \n'Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Quranic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt.  \nIbn Shihab said: Kharijah ibn Zayd ibn Thabit told me that he heard Zayd ibn Thabit say: “When we made copies of the Mus-haf I missed a verse of al-Ahzab that I used to hear the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recite. So we searched for it and we found it with Khuzaymah ibn Taabit al-Ansari. (The verse was) ‘Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah’ [al-Ahzab 33:23 – interpretation of the meaning]. So we put it in its place in its surah in the Mus-haf.”\nThus an end was put to dispute and the Muslims were united. The Quran has remained and will remain narrated from generation to generation and preserved in men's hearts until the Day of Resurrection. This is how Allah has preserved His Book, in confirmation of the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]\n And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Quran, revered in Islam as the literal word of God (Allah), was not written by any human author. Instead, it is considered to be a divine revelation transmitted to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) by the angel Gabriel (Jibril) over a span of approximately 23 years. \n\nIn answering the question of who wrote the Quran, it is essential to emphasize that the Quran authenticates itself as a divine composition, distinct from human authorship. Several verses underpin this assertion:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:77-81)**:\n   - *\"That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an (Inscribed) in the well-kept Book. Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind). It has been revealed by the Lord of all the worlds. Then why do you dissimulate this Revelation?\"*\n   - This verse indicates that the Quran is not authored by man but is a divine revelation provided by Allah to humanity (Ayahs 77-81).\n\n2. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:35-38)**:\n   - *\"This Qur'an is not such (a writ) as could be composed by anyone but God. It confirms what has been revealed before, and is an exposition of (Heaven's) law.\"*\n   - Here, the Quran denies any possibility of human authorship and emphasizes its divine origin and consistency with previous revelations (Ayah 35).\n\n3. **Surah Al-Qasas (28:85-88)**:\n   - *\"He who has assigned (the propagation) of the Qur'an to you will bring you back to the destination.\"*\n   - This verse reaffirms that it is Allah Himself who has decreed the communication of the Quran to Muhammad and that its authenticity and propagation come from God (Ayah 85).\n\n4. **Surah Yunus (10:35-39)**:\n   - *\"Say: 'Is there one among those you associate with God who can show the way to the truth?' Say: 'It is God who shows the way to truth...' This Qur'an is not such (a writ) as could be composed by anyone but God.\"*\n   - This passage reinforces the idea that the Quran is uniquely God's revelation and challenges others to produce a similar text (Ayah 35).\n\n5. **Surah Ar-Rahman (55:1-3)**:\n   - *\"Ar-Rahman. Bestowed the Qur'an, Created man, And taught him to express clearly.\"*\n   - This surah opens by attributing both the creation of humanity and the revelation of the Quran to Allah, highlighting His authority as the source of knowledge (Ayahs 1-3).\n\nThese verses collectively illustrate that the Quran is the direct and unaltered word of Allah, conveyed through the Prophet Muhammad, not a humanly authored text. According to Islamic belief, the Quran's preservation and its eloquent style stand as further evidence of its divine origin, contrasting sharply with any human composition."

        "question": "The Quran is a healing and a mercy to the believers",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Quran is the word of Allah that was revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and is recited as an act of worship.  \nThis definition of the Quran is comprehensive.  \nOur saying “the word of Allah” excludes the words of human beings or others. \nOur saying “revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)” excludes anything that was revealed to anyone else, such as the Injeel (Gospel), Tawraat (Torah) and Zaboor (Psalms). \nOur saying “it is recited as an act of worship” excludes the hadeeth qudsi (ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) narrated words from Allah which are not part of the Quran). \nIt brings light and gives certainty, it is the strong rope, it is the path of the righteous. It tells us of those who came before us, Prophets and righteous people, and how those who disobeyed them tasted the punishment of Allah and were humiliated. It contains verses which speak of the miracles of Allah and His power in this great universe. It tells us of the origins of human beings who are created from “despised water” (semen). It contains the basic principles of faith which must be embraced by every humble heart. It contains the rules of sharee’ah which tells us what is permissible and what is forbidden; what is true and what is false. It tells us of the Resurrection and the fate of human beings, either in the Fire in which they will burn and be among those who are humiliated, or in Paradise with its gardens, springs, plants and places of security. \nIn it there is healing for men’s hearts, light and illumination for the blind. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism and act on it), and it increases the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) nothing but loss” [al-Isra’ 17:82]\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Katheer said in his commentary on this verse: \nHere Allah tells us about His Book, which He revealed to His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and which is the Quran which “Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise” [Fussilat 42:41- interpretation of the meaning], that it is “a healing and a mercy to those who believe” – i.e., it takes away the diseases in the heart such as doubt, hypocrisy, shirk, deviation and misguidance; the Quran heals all of that. And it is also a mercy which brings about faith, wisdom and the pursuit of and desire for goodness. This is only for those who believe in it and follow it; for such it will be a healing and a mercy. But as for the kaafir and those who wrong themselves thereby, their hearing the Quran only makes them further away (from truth) and increases them in kufr. The problem comes from the kaafir, not from the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Say: It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Quran) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand)” [Fussilat 41:44]\n“And whenever there comes down a Soorah, some of them (hypocrites) say: ‘Which of you has had his Faith increased by it?’ As for those who believe, it has increased their Faith, and they rejoice.\nBut as for those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubt, disbelief and hypocrisy), it will add suspicion and doubt to their suspicion, disbelief and doubt; and they die while they are disbelievers”\n[al-Tawbah 9:124-125]\nQutaadah said, concerning the phrase “And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe”: when the believer hears it he benefits from it, memorizes it and understands it. “and it increases the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) nothing but loss” means, they do not benefit from it, memorize it or understand it. Allah has made this Quran a healing and a mercy for the believers.\"(Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/60). \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Quran, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your breasts, — a guidance and a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers” [Yoonus 10:57] \n“And if We had sent this as a Quran in a foreign language (other than Arabic), they would have said: ‘Why are not its verses explained in detail (in our language)? What! (A Book) not in Arabic and (the Messenger) an Arab?’ Say: ‘It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Quran) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand)’” [Fussilat 41:44]\nIn it is guidance for mankind, away from misguidance and to the truth. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“This is the Book (the Quran), whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqoon [the pious” [al-Baqarah 2:2] \n“And thus We have revealed to you (O Muhammad) a Quran in Arabic that you may warn the Mother of the Towns (Makkah) and all around it, and warn (them) of the Day of Assembling of which there is no doubt, when a party will be in Paradise (those who believed in Allah and followed what Allah’s Messenger brought them) and a party in the blazing Fire (Hell) (those who disbelieved in Allah and followed not what Allah’s Messenger brought them)” [al-Shoora 42:9] \n“And thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad) Rooh (a revelation, and a mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made it (this Quran) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will. And verily, you (O Muhammad) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e. Allah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism).\nThe path of Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Verily, all matters at the end go to Allah (for decision)” [al-Shoora 42:52-53]\nIt contains innumerable benefits, so everyone who seeks happiness in this world and in the Hereafter must refer to it for judgement and follow its commands.  \nImam Ibn Hazm said:\nBecause the proof and the miracles indicate that the Quran is the covenant of Allah with us, we must believe in it and act in accordance with it. It has come down to us through generations of Muslims narrating it to those who came after them, which leaves no room for doubt that the Quran is the one which is written in the Mus-hafs which we find everywhere. We have to follow its teachings, for it is our reference-point, because we read in it the words (interpretation of the meaning): \n“There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered” [al-An’aam 6:38]\nWhatever commands and prohibitions are in the Quran, we must adhere to them.\"(Al-Ihkaam, 1/92)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The concept of the Quran as a healing and a mercy to the believers is deeply embedded within its verses, emphasizing the Quran's role in guiding, comforting, and providing solace to those who believe. Below, we'll explore multiple verses that support this assertion, accompanied by their citations.\n\n1. **Healing and Mercy of the Quran**:\n   The Quran itself is identified as a healing and mercy for the believers. This is explicitly mentioned in Surah Al-Isra:\n   - **Surah Al-Isra (17:82)**: \"And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy for the believers; and it increases the wrongdoers nothing but loss.\"\n   This verse establishes that the Quran serves as both a source of healing and a compassion for believers, while simultaneously highlighting that those who disregard it only exacerbate their own loss.\n\n2. **Guidance and Forgiveness**:\n   The Quran/Islam offers forgiveness and guidance, which are essential to spiritual health. In **Surah Al-Baqarah**:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:160-164)** speaks about God's forgiveness for those who repent and reform their lives: \"But those who repent and reform and proclaim (the truth) are forgiven, for I am forgiving and merciful.\" This reinforces the message that returning to God and seeking forgiveness is part of the healing process.\n\n3. **The Role of Faith and Repentance**:\n   The concept of repentance is crucial within the framework of mercy and healing. In **Surah An-Nisa**:\n   - **Surah An-Nisa (4:146-150)** emphasizes that those who repent, hold firmly to God, and are sincere will be rewarded greatly: \"But those who repent and amend... are surely with the faithful; and God will bestow on the faithful a great reward.\" This highlights how turning towards God can restore one's spiritual state.\n\n4. **Affliction and Trust in God**:\n   In **Surah Al-Mu’minun**:\n   - **Surah Al-Mu’minun (23:75-79)** discusses how affliction could lead individuals to despair if they do not recognize God's mercy and invoke humility: \"If We took compassion on them and removed the affliction they are in, they would only wander lost in confusion.\" This illustrates the importance of faith in overcoming life's trials.\n\n5. **Importance of Kindness and Charity**:\n   The act of doing good and inviting others to faith is a recurring theme throughout the Quran. In **Surah Al-Baqarah**:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:263-267)** highlights that saying a kind word or forgiving someone is more benevolent than merely giving charity: \"Saying a word that is kind, and forgiving is better than charity that hurts.\" This underscores that compassion and sincerity contribute greatly to a merciful and healing community.\n\n6. **Divine Assistance**:\n   Lastly, the Quran assures the faithful that they will receive support from God. In **Surah Ghafir**:\n   - **Surah Ghafir (40:51)** states, \"We will certainly help Our messengers and those who believe, in this world and on the Day the witnesses take their stand.\" This promise provides comfort and assurance that believers will find support and vindication.\n\nIn conclusion, the Quran serves as a profound source of healing and mercy for believers, urging them to return to faith, seek forgiveness, act with kindness, and rely on God's guidance. It addresses the emotional and spiritual struggles of individuals, providing a pathway toward tranquility and salvation. Each of these verses presents an element of the comprehensive mercy and healing that characterizes the prophetic message and the holy text."

        "question": "Distortion of the Quran by the Raafidis",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to Soorat al-Wilaayah, some of the Shi’ah scholars and imams have stated that it exists. Any of them who denies that does so by way of taqiyah (dissimulation). One of those who clearly stated that it exists is Mirza Hussein Muhammad Taqiy al-Noori al-Tubrusi (d. 1320 AH). He wrote a book in which he claimed that the Quran had been distorted and that the Sahaabah has concealed some parts of it, including Soorat al-Wilaayah. The Raafidis honoured him after his death by burying him in al-Najaf. This book by al-Tubrusi was published in Iran in 1298 AH, and when it was published there was a great deal of controversy because they wanted the doubts about the validity of the Quran, which were known only to their leaders, to remain scattered throughout hundreds of their major books, and they did not want that to be compiled in one book. At the beginning of his book he said:  \n“This is a good and noble book entitled Fasl al-khitaab fi ithbaat tahreef Kitaab Rabb il-Arbaab (Decisive comment on the distortion of the Book of the Lord of Lords)… He mentioned aayahs and soorahs which he claims that the Sahaabah concealed, including ‘Soorat al-Wilaayah,’” the text of which, according to them, and as quoted in this book, is: \n“O you who believe, believe in the Prophet and the Wali [i.e., ‘Ali] whom We have sent to guide you to the straight path, a Prophet and a Wali who are part of one another, and I am the All-Knowing, All-Aware…”  \nAnd they have another soorah which they call Soorat al-Noorayn: “O you who believe, believe in the two lights (al-noorayn) which We have sent down to you to recite to you My Verses and to warn you of the punishment of a great Day. They are part of one another and I am the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. Those who fulfil the covenant with Allah and His Messenger mentioned in the verses (of the Quran), the Gardens of delight will be theirs, but those who disbelieve after they believed by breaking their covenant and disobeying the command of the Prophet, they will be thrown into Hell. They have wronged themselves and gone against the wasiyyah of the Prophet (i.e., the appointment of ‘Ali as khaleefah), and they will be given to drink of boiling water…” and other such nonsense. \nProf. Muhammad ‘Ali Sa’oodi – who was one of the greatest experts of the Ministry of Justice in Egypt – examined an Iranian mus-haf kept by the Orientalist Bryan and he obtained a copy of this soorah; above the lines of Arabic script there is written the translation in the Iranian language. \nAs it was mentioned by al-Tubrusi in his book, Fasl al-khitaab fi ithbaat tahreef Kitaab Rabb il-Arbaab, it is also mentioned in their book Dabastan Madhaahib, which is in Farsi, written by Muhsin Faani al-Kashmiri. This book has been printed numerous times in Iran, and this false soorah was quoted from it by the Orientalist Noeldeke in his book The History of Qur’anic Manuscripts, 2/120, and was published by the French Asian newspaper in 1842 (p. 431-439). \nIt was also mentioned by Mirza Habibullaah al-Haashimi al-Kho’i in his book Manhaaj al-Baraa’ah fi Sharh Nahj al-Balaaghah (2/217); and by Muhammad Baaqir al-Majlisi in his book Tadhkirat al-A’immah (p. 19, 20) in Farsi, (published by) Manshoorat Mawlana, Iran. \nSee also al-Khutoot al-‘Areedah li’l-Asas allati qaama ‘alayha deen al-Shi’ah by Muhibb al-Deen al-Khateeb. \nThis claim of theirs is a denial of the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”\n[al-Hijr 15:9]\nHence the Muslims are unanimously agreed that anyone who claims that anything in the Quran has been altered or changed is a kaafir. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: \nThe same applies to those among them who claim that some verses of the Quran have been taken away or concealed, or who claim to have some esoteric interpretations that exempt him from having to do the actions prescribed in sharee’ah etc., who are called al-Qaraamitah and al-Baatiniyyah, and who include al-Tanaasukhiyyah [names of esoteric sects]. There is no dispute that they are kaafirs. \nAl-Saarim al-Maslool, 3/1108-1110. \nIbn Hazm said: \nThe view that the Quran has been altered is blatant kufr and is a rejection of what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said. \nAl-Fasl fi’l-Ahwa’ wa’-Milal wa’l-Nihal, 4/139. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether the Quran has been distorted, particularly in relation to the beliefs attributed to the Raafidis (a group often identified with Shia Islam), is a topic that has been debated among scholars and adherents of different Islamic sects. The notion of distortion, or **tahreef**, generally hinges on arguments about the integrity of the text and interpretations of religious authority.\n\n### Overview of Distortion Claims\n\n1. **Rejection of Core Messages**: Various passages in the Quran highlight the disunity that arises when factions reject parts of the divine message. This is emphasized in Surah 13 (Ar-Ra'd), where Allah states: \n   - **“Those to whom We have given the Scriptures rejoice in what We have sent down to you; but some of their factions reject some of it.”** (Quran 13:36)\n   This verse indicates that rejecting any part of the revelation can lead to a division among believers.\n\n2. **Clarification of the Guidance**: In the same Surah, there are calls to heed the divine message without deviation. Allah commands the Prophet Muhammad:\n   - **“Tell them: ‘I am commanded to worship only God, and not to associate compeers with Him. To Him I call you, and to Him is the destination.’”** (Quran 13:36)\n   This reinforces the emphasis on the unity of belief, central to both Sunni and Shia perspectives, yet often invoked in discussions about the authenticity of the Quran.\n\n3. **The Status of Divine Writings**: Another verse that points out the unchanging nature of God’s message is:\n   - **“God abrogates or confirms whatsoever He will, for He has with Him the Book of Books.”** (Quran 13:39)\n   This implies that while interpretations may differ, the essence of divine scripture remains intact.\n\n### Critique of Claims of Distortion\n\nThe assertion that the Quran has been distorted during transmission or interpretation can be challenged based on several foundational verses:\n\n1. **Divine Protection of the Quran**: \n   Allah promises to protect the Quran from corruption:\n   - **“Indeed, it is We who sent down the Quran and indeed, We will be its guardian.”** (Quran 15:9)\n   This foundational belief holds that the Quran has remained unchanged since its revelation, which is a crucial argument against claims of distortion.\n\n2. **Misinterpretations and Their Consequences**: \n   The Quran warns about the misinterpretation:\n   - **“Woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands and then say, ‘This is from Allah,’ seeking to exchange it for a small price.”** (Quran 2:79)\n   This criticism aligns with those who distort the scripture's message or manipulate its meanings for personal or factional gains.\n\n3. **Divergent Understandings**: \n   Differences in understanding can lead to accusations of distortion. This is encapsulated in:\n   - **“Have they not reflected upon the Quran, or are there locks upon their hearts?”** (Quran 47:24)\n   The apparent division in understanding often leads different groups to claim that others have altered or misunderstood the text.\n\n### The Case of Raafidis\n\nThe term “Raafidi” is often used pejoratively by some Sunni groups to refer to Shia Muslims, implying that they have rejected the foundational teachings of Islam or altered interpretations of the Quran. Discussions about distortions often focus on differences in which verses are emphasized or interpreted in light of historical narratives, particularly regarding the companions of the Prophet Muhammad and the leadership of the Muslim community post-Prophet.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe question of distortion within the Quran can lead to significant theological debates. However, the Quran itself emphasizes the unity of God’s words and warns against the division and rejection of His signs. Each sect or division must weigh its interpretations against the original messages laid out in the Quran. Ultimately, for Muslims, the assertion that the Quran has been perfectly preserved is a core tenet of faith, and calls for careful reflection on the nature of belief and understanding in a diverse Islamic landscape. \n\nFor further reading on the Quran’s integrity and interpretations, one might refer to the following verses:\n- Surah 13 (Ar-Ra'd), ayat 36-40\n- Surah 15 (Al-Hijr), ayat 9\n- Surah 2 (Al-Baqarah), ayat 79"

        "question": "Refutation of those who try to prove that the Qur’aan is not true",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    1 – The proof that the copies of the Holy Qur’aan that we \n    have before us is not just one or two pieces of evidence, rather it is \n    proven by a vast amount of evidence that no fair-minded person can study \n    without becoming convinced that it is exactly as Allaah revealed it to \n    Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). \n\n    2 – There have been generations coming one after another, \n    reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it, memorizing it and writing it \n    down. They have not omitted a single letter, and no one can change even the \n    vowel point of a single letter. Writing is just one means of preserving it; \n    basically it is preserved in their hearts. \n\n    3 – The Qur’aan has not come down to us on its own, such that \n    the so-called alterations could be made. Rather the interpretation of its \n    verses, the meanings of its words, the reasons for its revelation, the \n    grammar of its words and the commentary on its rulings have all been \n    transmitted. When such care has been given to this Book, how could sinful \n    hands find a way to distort even one letter of it, or add a word, or take \n    away a verse? \n\n    4 – The Qur’aan speaks of matters of the unseen, in the \n    future, which Allaah revealed to His Messenger Muhammad  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to show him that they came from Allaah. If \n    a human being wants to write a book, he can describe an event or express a \n    point of view, but if any human being were to speak about matters of the \n    unseen, in this field he can only base that on speculation and lies. But the \n    Qur’aan told of the defeat of the Romans by the Persians, at the time when \n    there was no means of communication to inform the Arabs of this event. The \n    same verses also foretold that they (the Persians) would be defeated after a \n    certain number of years. If what the Qur’aan said was not accurate, then the \n    kaafirs would have had a great opportunity to criticize the Qur’aan. \n\n    5 – If you read any verse of the Qur’aan, then you go to \n    America or Asia or the jungles of Africa, or to the deserts of Arabia or any \n    place where there are Muslims, you will find that all of them have the exact \n    same verse, memorized by heart or in their books; not a single letter of it \n    will have been altered.  \n\n    So what is the importance of this unknown manuscript in Yemen \n    which we have not seen, and in which some ignorant may have altered, in \n    recent times, one verse or one word? \n\n    Does this argument carry any weight when properly researched \n    and discussed? Especially when the people claim to be fair-minded and \n    objective in their research.  \n\n    What would be their response if we went to one of their most \n    trusted books by a well-known author, a book of which there are many copies \n    in the world, all of them exactly the same, and we claimed that there was a \n    copy of this book in some country or other in which there was extra material \n    and alterations, and it was different from what is in their copies? Would \n    they pay any attention? \n\n    Their answer would be the same as ours. \n\n    6 – The manuscript copies which are in the Muslims’ \n    possession cannot be proven to be authentic in this simplistic manner, for \n    we have experts who know the history of calligraphy and we have principles \n    and guidelines through which we may determine whether a manuscript is \n    genuine, such as the names and signatures of the people who heard it and \n    read it.  \n\n    We do not think that these features are present in this \n    so-called copy of the Qur’aan in Yemen or in others. \n\n    7 – We are happy to conclude our answer with this true story \n    that happened in Baghdad during the ‘Abbasid era, when a Jew wanted to find \n    out how true are the books attributed by their followers to God, namely the \n    Torah among the Jews, the Gospel among the Christians and the Qur’aan among \n    the Muslims. \n\n    He went to the Torah and added and took away a few minor \n    things that were not very obvious, then he gave it to a scribe from among \n    the Jews and asked him to make copies of it. It did not take long before \n    these copies were placed in the synagogues of the Jews and were in \n    circulation among their major scholars. \n\n    Then he went to the Gospel and added and took away a few \n    things as he had done with the Torah, and he gave it to their scribes and \n    asked them to make copies of it. It was not long before it was being read in \n    their churches and was in circulation among their scholars. \n\n    Then he went to the Qur’aan and added and took away a few \n    things as he had done with the Torah and the Gospel. Then he gave it to a \n    Muslim scribe to make copies of it. \n\n    When he went back to get his copy, the scribe threw it in his \n    face and told him that this was not the Qur’aan of the Muslims! \n\n    From this experiment the man came to know that the Qur’aan is \n    the true Book of Allaah and that all other books were the works of human \n    beings. \n\n    If the scribes of the Muslims could tell that this copy had \n    been tampered with, then how could it go into circulation among the Muslim \n    scholars undetected? \n\n    If the questioner wants to repeat this ancient experiment \n    nowadays, all she has to do is to do the same as that Jewish man did, who \n    later became Muslim; she can add and take away things from these three books \n    and see what happens as a result. \n\n    But we do not tell her to show her copy of the Qur’aan to a \n    scribe, rather we tell her to show it to Muslim children, and they will tell \n    her where the mistakes are in her copy! \n\n    Some Muslim states have printed Mus-hafs in which there were \n    mistakes, and young children found them before the grown-ups did!\n\n     And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path.",
        "predicted_answer": "To refute claims against the authenticity and truth of the Qur'an, one can draw upon several key verses that affirm its divine origin, authority, and the challenge it presents to disbelievers. Below are some significant verses and their implications.\n\n### 1. Challenge to Bring a Surah Like It\nSurah Hud illustrates the challenge posed to those who claim the Qur'an is fabricated. Allah commands the skeptics to produce just ten Surahs similar to it if they are truthful in their accusations:\n- **Surah Hud (11:13-14)**:\n  > \"Do they say (of the Prophet): 'He has forged (the Qur'an)?' Say: 'Then bring ten Surahs like it, and call anyone except God to help you, if what you say is true.' If they do not answer you, then know it has been revealed with the knowledge of God, and that there is no god but He.\"\n  \nThis challenge highlights the unique literary and thematic qualities of the Qur'an, which are viewed as beyond human capability to replicate.\n\n### 2. Clear Proof and Revelation\nSurah Al-Bayyinah discusses the arrival of a clear proof, which is the Qur'an itself, asserting its role as a decisive revelation:\n- **Surah Al-Bayyinah (98:1-5)**:\n  > \"Those among the People of the Book who disbelieve, and the idolaters, would not have been freed (from false beliefs) until the clear proof came to them -- An Apostle from God, reading out hallowed pages Containing firm decrees. The People of the Book were not divided among themselves till after the clear proof had come to them.\"\n\nThis verse points out the clarity and legitimacy of the Qur'an as evidence for guiding humanity away from falsehood.\n\n### 3. Divine Authorization of the Qur'an\nSurah Yunus emphasizes that the Qur'an is purely from God, confirming previous scriptures and serving as guidance:\n- **Surah Yunus (10:35-36)**:\n  > \"Ask: 'Is there one among those you associate with God who can show the way to the truth?' Say: 'It is God who shows the way to truth.' This Qur'an is not such (a writ) as could be composed by anyone but God. It confirms what has been revealed before, and is an exposition of (Heaven's) law.\"\n\nThis declaration reinforces the Qur'an's status as an unassailable divine revelation rather than a mere human composition.\n\n### 4. Historical Context of Revelation\nSurah Al-Furqan discusses the gradual revelation of the Qur'an and the wisdom behind it:\n- **Surah Al-Furqan (25:32-33)**:\n  > \"The unbelievers say: 'Why was the whole Qur'an not sent down all at once to him?' It was sent thus that We may keep your heart resolute.\"\n\nThis part of the Qur'an indicates that its gradual revelation was intended to strengthen the prophet and offer guidance over time, which adds to its credibility.\n\n### 5. The Qur'an as a Preserved Document\nSurah Al-Waqi'ah asserts the Qur'an's status as a well-preserved scripture that is accessible only to the pure-hearted:\n- **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:75-79)**:\n  > \"So I call the placement of the stars to witness -- And this surely is great evidence if you can understand -- That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an (Inscribed) in the well-kept Book. Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind).\"\n\nThis affirms the supernatural aspects surrounding the text and emphasizes its divine preservation.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the truth of the Qur'an is upheld through its literary challenge, clear proofs, divine origins, deliberate gradual revelation, and its preserved nature. These facets collectively serve to reinforce the Qur'an’s status not merely as a religious text but as a definitive guide for humanity that cannot be easily dismissed by skeptics. Each argument is substantiated by specific Qur'anic verses that provide both an internal coherence and external validation of the text's authenticity."

        "question": "Claims that the Qur’aan has been distorted",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIt is not possible for a Muslim to entertain doubts concerning the immutability of the Qur’aan, because Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur’aan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”\n[al-Hijr 15:9]\nThe Qur’aan was preserved in the hearts of the Sahaabah who had memorized it, and on the trunks of trees and thin white stones until the time of the caliph Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him). During the Riddah wars many of the Sahaabah who had memorized the Qur’aan were killed, so Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) was afraid that the Qur’aan may be lost. He consulted the senior Sahaabah concerning the idea of compiling the entire Qur’aan in one book so that it would be preserved and would not be lost, and this task was entrusted to the great hafiz Zayd ibn Thaabit and others who had written down the Revelation. Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh that Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:  \n“Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq sent for me when the people of Yamamah had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against Musaylimah). (I went to him) and found 'Umar bin al-Khattaab sitting with him. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said (to me), ‘ ‘Umar has come to me and said: “Casualties were heavy among the Qurra' of the Qur'aan (i.e. those who knew the Qur’aan by heart) at the Battle of Yamaamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra' on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur'an may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you [Abu Bakr] should issue orders that the Qur’aan be collected.” I said to 'Umar, “How can you do something that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do?\" 'Umar said, “By Allah, this is something good.” ‘Umar kept on urging me (to accept his proposal) until Allah opened my heart to it and I began to realize the good in the idea which 'Umar had realized.’ Then Abu Bakr said (to me): ‘You are a wise young man and we have a great deal of confidence in you. You used to write down the Revelation for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). So you should seek out the Qur’aan [i.e., the fragments on which it is written] and collect it (in one book).’ By Allaah, if they had ordered me to move one of the mountains, it would not have been harder for me than this command to collect the Qur’aan. I said (to Abu Bakr), ‘How can you do something which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘By Allaah, it is a good thing.’ Abu Bakr kept on urging me (to accept his proposal) until Allah opened my heart to it as He had opened the hearts of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. So I started to look for the Qur’aan and collected it from (the fragments on which it was written of) palm-stalks, thin white stones and the hearts of men (i.e., from men who knew it by heart), until I found the last verse of Soorat al-Tawbah with Abu Khuzaymah al-Ansaari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The verse is :  \n‘Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty…’\n[al-Tawbah 9:128 – interpretation of the meaning]\n… until the end of Soorat Baraa’ah (Soorat al-Tawbah). \nThese fragments remained with Abu Bakr until he died, then with ‘Umar for the rest of his life, then with Hafsah bint ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both).” \nSecondly: \nWith regard to al-Hajjaaj, it was not his idea to write out the Mus-haf, rather he was commanded by an intelligent man to do that. There follows the complete story: \nAl-Zarqaani said: \nIt is known that the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan was unpointed (i.e., it had no diacritical marks). Whatever the case the addition of diacritical marks to the Mus-haf did not happen, according to the well-established view, until the era of ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan, when he realized that Islam had spread widely and the Arabs were mixing with the non-Arabs, which was having an effect on the Arabic language, so that there was much confusion about the correct reading of the Mus-hafs and it was becoming very difficult for people to tell the letters apart. By his deep insight, he realized that he should do something to solve the problem. So he commanded al-Hajjaaj to take care of this important matter. In obedience to the caliph, Al-Hajjaaj appointed two men to deal with this matter, namely Nasr ibn ‘Aasim al-Laythi and Yahya ibn Ya’mar al-‘Adwaani, both of whom were qualified and able to do the task required of them, because they were knowledgeable, righteous, pious and experts in Arabic language and the various readings of the Qur’aan. They had also both studied under Abu’l-Aswad al-Du’li. May Allaah have mercy on these two shaykhs, for they succeeded in their work and gave the Mus-haf diacritical points for the first time. They added dots to all the letters that look similar, not adding more than three dots to any one letter. That became widespread among the people and was very effective in dispelling confusion concerning reading of the Mus-haf.  \nIt was said that the first person to add diacritical marks to the Mus-haf was Abu’l-Aswad al-Du’li, and that Ibn Seereen had a Mus-haf to which diacritical marks had been added by Yahya ibn Ya’mar. These opinions may be reconciled by noting that Abu’l-Aswad was the first one who added diacritical marks to the Mus-haf, but he did that for his own individual use, then Ibn Seereen followed him in that, and that ‘Abd al-Malik was the first one to add diacritical marks to the Mus-haf  in an official and public manner that was spread widely among the people in order to dispel any confusion with regard to reading Qur’aan.” \nManaahil al-‘Irfaan, 1/280, 281 \nThirdly: \nWith regard to what is mentioned in the question, quoting from al-Masaahif by Ibn Abi Dawood, there follows the report concerning that and the ruling thereon: \nIt was narrated from ‘Abbaad ibn Suhayb from ‘Awf ibn Abi Jameelah that al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf changed eleven letters in the Mus-haf. He said that in Soorat al-Baqarah 2:259 it said lam yatasanna wa’nzur, with no ha’, and he changed it to lam yatasannah wa’nzur (they show no change, and look…) \nIn al-Maa'idah 5:48 it said sharee’atan wa minhaajan, and he changed it to shir’atan wa minhaajan (a law and a clear way) \nIn Yoonus 10:22 it said, Huwa alladhi yunshirukum and he changed it to Huwa alladhi yusayyirukum (He it is Who enables you to travel…) \nIn Yoosuf 12:45 it said Ana aateekum bi ta’weelihi and he changed it to Ana unabbi’ukum bi ta’weelihi (I will tell you its interpretation) \nIn al-Zukhruf 43:32 it said, Nahnu qasamnaa baynahum ma’aayishahum and he changed it to Nahnu qasamnaa baynahum ma’eeshatahum (It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood) \nIn al-Takweer 81:24 it said Wa ma huwa ‘ala’l-ghaybi bi zaneen and he changed it to Wa ma huwa ‘ala’l-ghaybi bi daneen (and he withholds not a knowledge of the unseen) \nKitaab al-Masaahif by al-Sajistaani, p. 49. \nThis report is da’eef jiddan (very weak) or mawdoo’ (fabricated), because its isnaad includes ‘Abbaad ibn Suhayb, whose hadeeth is to be rejected. \n‘Ali ibn al-Madeeni said: his hadeeth is no good. Al-Bukhaari, al-Nasaa’i and others said: he is matrook (to be rejected). Ibn Hibbaan said: he was a Qadari who promoted his innovated ideas, and he narrated things which a beginner in this field would realize were fabricated if he heard them. Al-Dhahabi said: he is one of those who are to be rejected. \nSee Meezaan al-I’tidaal, by al-Dhahabi, 4/28. \nThe text of the report is also false, because it dos not make sense that these changes could be made in the Qur’aan and then spread throughout the world. Even some of the non-Muslims, such as the Raafidis (Shi’ah) who think that the Qur’aan is incomplete, rejected this and criticized its text. \nAl-Kho’i, who is one of the Raafidis, said: “This claim is like the hallucination of one who is suffering a fever, or like the fairy tales of the insane or of children. Al-Hajjaaj was one of the governors of the Umayyads, and he is too incapable to do anything to the Qur’aan. He is even incapable of changing any of the minor issues of Islam, so how could he change the thing which is the foundation of the religion and the basis of sharee’ah? Where would he get the power to introduce this change throughout the realm of Islam and beyond at the time when the Qur’aan was well known throughout the Muslim world? How come no historian has ever mentioned this disastrous event even though it is so serious and they would have a lot of motives to mention it? How come no one among the Muslims of his time narrated it? How could the Muslims have turned a blind eye to such an action after the reign of al-Hajjaaj came to an end? Even if we assume that he could have gathered all the copies of the Qur’aan and that not one single copy escaped his grasp anywhere in the far-flung regions of the Islamic world, how could he have removed it from the hearts of the Muslims and those who had memorized it, the number of whom at that time is known only to Allaah.” \n(al-Bayaan fi Tafseer al-Qur’aan, p. 219) \nWhat the questioner mentions about Imam al-Sajistaani, and that he wrote a book called Ma Ghayyarahu al-Hajjaaj fi Mus-haf ‘Uthmaan (What al-Hajjaaj altered in the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan) is not true, rather it is a blatant lie. All there is, is the commentary that al-Sajistaani wrote concerning the words quoted above from al-Hajjaaj, entitled Baab Ma Kataba al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf fi’l-Mus-haf (Chapter on what al-Hajjaaj wrote in the Mus-haf). \nOn this basis, we cannot rely upon this report under any circumstances whatsoever. The fact that until now it has not been proven that anyone has succeeded in his attempt to change even one letter (of the Qur’aan) is sufficient to prove that it is a lie. If what has been narrated is true, then it would be possible to repeat it, especially at the times when the Muslims were weak and their enemies plotted against them.  It is such specious arguments that prove that these claims are false, and that our enemies are incapable of refuting the evidence of the Qur’aan or its clarity, so they resorted to attacking it. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The claim that the Qur'an has been distorted is a serious accusation that is addressed in various verses of the Qur'an itself. In Islam, the belief is that the Qur'an is the literal word of God (Allah), and it is preserved in its original form without alteration. Below are some key points and verses that refute the idea of the Qur'an being distorted, demonstrating its intended preservation and authenticity.\n\n### Key Points Against the Distortion of the Qur'an\n\n1. **Divine Protection and Preservation**: The Qur'an itself asserts that God will protect His revelation from any corruption or distortion. This is articulated in Surah Al-Hijr (15:9):\n   - **Verse**: \"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian.\"\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Hijr, Ayah 9.\n\n2. **Response to Accusations of Fabrication**: In Surah Al-Ahqaf, the Qur'an discusses the doubts and accusations made against it. It states that claims of the Qur'an being fabricated are addressed directly by the Prophet Muhammad:\n   - **Verse**: \"Do they say, 'He has fabricated it'? Say, 'If I have fabricated it, you have no power to protect me from Allah. He knows best what you are involved in. He is sufficient as a witness between me and you.'\"\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Ahqaf, Ayah 8.\n\n3. **Recognition of Previous Scriptures**: The Qur'an often acknowledges the divine revelations that came before it and indicates its role in confirming and protecting those messages:\n   - **Verse**: \"And this (Qur'an) is a Book that confirms that which was (revealed) before it, and it is a guidance and glad tidings for the believers.\"\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Ahqaf, Ayah 12.\n\n4. **Clarity of the Message**: The Qur'an claims that its revelations are clear, and the insistence on its clear message invites reflection upon its authenticity:\n   - **Verse**: \"When Our clear revelations are recited to them, they say, 'This is nothing but a tale of the ancients.'\"\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Mutaffifin, Ayah 13.\n\n5. **Warning Against Disbelief**: The Qur'an warns those who deny its verses and prophecies of severe consequences, emphasizing that the rejection stems from their own arrogance and sinful nature:\n   - **Verse**: \"None denies it but the sinful transgressors. When Our revelations are recited before him, he says, 'These are fables of long ago.'\"\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Mutaffifin, Ayah 11.\n\n6. **The Nature of the Qur'an**: The Qur'an describes itself as a distinctly written record which is pure and untainted. This further signifies its divine origin:\n   - **Verse**: \"It is a (repository of) distinctly written record.\"\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Mutaffifin, Ayah 9.\n\n7. **Engagement of the Believers**: The Qur'an encourages its followers to engage with its text and to adhere to its teachings as the final and unaltered message from God, making a claim against any form of alteration:\n   - **Verse**: \"Woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say, 'This is from Allah,' to exchange it for a small price.\"\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Baqarah (2:79) speaks on the consequences of distorting divine messages, although in this case, specifically refers to previous scriptures.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe belief in the inalterability and preservation of the Qur'an is central to Islamic faith. The verses present a compelling narrative against claims of distortion, placing emphasis on the divine protection set over the Qur'an. Furthermore, they remind believers of the seriousness of rejecting divine guidance, highlighting that true adherence to faith involves believing in the authenticity of the Qur'an as the final revelation."

        "question": "The times when it is permissible to recite Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for you to recite Quran, or any soorah from it, at any time and in any situation, except when you are in a state of janaabah (impurity following sexual activity), in which case it is haraam to recite Quran, because of the hadith of ‘Ali who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite Quran to us in all situations so long as he was not in a state of janaabah.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Tahaarah, 136. al-Tirmidhi said: this hadith of ‘Ali is hasan saheeh). This was also the view of the scholars among the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Taabi’een. They said a man may recite Quran without wudoo’ but he should not read from the Mus-haf unless he is taahir (pure, i.e., has wudoo’). This was the view of Sufyaan al-Thawri, al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and Ishaaq. \nSee Da’eef Sunan al-Tirmidhi by al-Albaani, hadith no. 22 \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: The imams are agreed that it is haraam to recite Quran when in a state of janaabah. \nIt is not proper etiquette to recite Quran when one is in a state of janaabah because it is the words of Allah which must be respected and venerated, and kept away from all unclean places and places where haraam things take place, which could dishonour it and show disrespect towards its sanctity. Moreover the person who is in a state of janaabah can remove the impurity whenever he wants, so he is not allowed to recite Quran. But if you are impure in the sense of minor impurity then it is permissible for you to recite only, without touching the Mus-haf. See question no. 10672. With regard to women when they are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth, see question no. 2564. And Allah knows best. \nSee Tawdeeh Ahkaam al-Nisa’, 1/309.",
        "predicted_answer": "Reciting the Quran is a significant act of worship in Islam that can be performed at various times and under different circumstances. Here are the times when it is generally permissible and encouraged to recite the Quran, supported by relevant verses:\n\n### 1. **At All Times**\nIn general, Muslims are encouraged to recite the Quran at any time. There is no specific time that restricts one from engaging in its recitation. The Quran emphasizes its importance as a reminder and guidance. For example:\n\n- **Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:15-19)** states that the collection and recitation of the Quran are the responsibility of Allah, which implies that one should engage with its text without limitation:\n  - *\"Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste. Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility...\"*  \n  - (Surah Al-Qiyamah, 75:15-16)\n\n### 2. **At Dawn**\nReciting Quran at dawn is specifically highlighted as a time of great significance where the recitation is particularly impactful. The following verse illustrates this:\n\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:78)** emphasizes the importance of reciting the Quran during this time:\n  - *\"Observe the service of prayer from the sun's declining from the meridian to the darkening of the night, and the recitation at dawn. Indeed, the Recitation at dawn is palpably evident.\"*  \n  - (Surah Al-Isra, 17:78)\n\n### 3. **In the Night**\nNighttime is indicated as a particularly admirable time for the recitation of the Quran. The stillness of the night allows for better concentration and reflection. \n\n- **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:4)** recommends reciting the Quran slowly and distinctly, especially at night:\n  - *\"...Or a little more, and recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly.\"*  \n  - (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:4)\n\n- **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)** also conveys the flexibility in recitation based on one’s capacity, particularly emphasizing that night devotions can include Quranic recitation:\n  - *\"...So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily...\"*   \n  - (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20)\n\n### 4. **During Specific Daily Prayers (Salah)**\nIt is recommended to recite portions of the Quran during the five daily prayers. The Quran emphasizes prayer's timing and significance but also associates these moments with the recitation of the Quran.\n\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:106)** speaks of reciting the Quran gradually, which can apply during prayer as well:\n  - *\"We have divided the Qur'an into parts that you may recite it to men slowly...\"*  \n  - (Surah Al-Isra, 17:106)\n\n### 5. **While Traveling or in Various Conditions**\nThe Quran allows for recitation to be adapted to one's personal circumstances, including those who are ill or traveling.\n\n- **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)** mentions this flexibility: \n  - *\"...He knows some among you will be sick, and some will be traveling over the earth...\"*  \n  - (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20)\n\n### 6. **In Silence and with Contemplation**\nListening and reflecting on the Quran during its recitation is also encouraged, as indicated in:\n\n- **Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206)**: \n  - *\"When the Qur'an is recited listen to it in silence...\"*  \n  - (Surah Al-A'raf, 7:204)\n\n### 7. **During Ramadan**\nThe month of Ramadan is especially significant for Quran recitation, as it was revealed during this month. \n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:185)** celebrates this:\n  - *\"Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed...\"*  \n  - (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:185)\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, Muslims are encouraged to recite the Quran at all times but should prioritize certain times like dawn and during the night. The recitation can be done during personal prayer and is flexible enough to accommodate circumstances such as travel or illness. Reflecting on its meanings, particularly during its dedicated times such as Ramadan, adds to the profound impact of this sacred text."

        "question": "A soorah in which the name of Allaah is mentioned in every aayah.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. \n          This soorah is Soorat al-Mujaadilah (no. 58).",
        "predicted_answer": "The Soorah in which the name of Allah is mentioned in every Ayah is Surah 87, known as Surah Al-A'la (The Most High). \n\n### Relevant Information:\n1. **Surah Al-A'la:**\n   - **Number of Ayahs:** 19\n   - **Revelation Order:** 8 (Meccan period)\n   - **Verses:** The verses of Surah Al-A'la (Al-A'la 1-19) repeatedly emphasize glorifying the name of Allah.\n\n### Supporting Verses from Surah Al-A'la:\n- **Surah Al-A'la (87:1-5):**\n   - **1:** \"Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High\"\n   - **2:** \"Who creates and proportions\"\n   - **3:** \"And Who determines and guides\"\n   - **4:** \"And Who brings out the pasture\"\n   - **5:** \"Then makes it a faded, dried up stalk.\"\n\nThis indicates that the name of Allah is indeed mentioned in each verse of this Surah, fulfilling the condition set in the question.\n\n### Additional Information:\nThough Surah Al-Fatihah (The Opener) is also significant in Islamic worship (as it is recited in every unit of the prayer), it does not contain the name \"Allah\" in every ayah. Al-Fatihah consists of 7 ayahs, and while it praises Allah, the name specifically is not in each ayah.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the only Surah in the Quran where the name of Allah is mentioned in every Ayah is Surah Al-A'la (Surah 87), highlighting its uniqueness and significance in Islamic teachings."

        "question": "It is permissible to accept payment for teaching Qur’aan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Standing Committee was asked about whether it is permissible to accept payment for teaching Qur’aan. They replied: \nYes, it is permissible to accept payment for teaching Qur’aan according to the more correct of the two scholarly views, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth:\n“The thing for which you most deserve to take payment is the Book of Allaah,” (narrated by al-Bukhaari), and because there is a real need for that. And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "predicted_answer": "In regard to whether it is permissible to accept payment for teaching the Qur'an, Islamic scholars generally agree that it is acceptable to receive compensation for teaching the Qur'an or Islamic knowledge, as long as the intention is correct and the teaching is conducted sincerely for the sake of Allah.\n\nOne of the key points supporting this notion is derived from the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). He indicated that scholars and teachers should earn a living through the knowledge they impart. This can be further substantiated with the following references from the Qur'an:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:11)**:\n   > \"O you who believe! When you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room. Allah will give you more room to spread... And those who have knowledge will be raised in ranks.\"\n   - This verse emphasizes the importance of knowledge and learning, suggesting that those who convey knowledge hold a respected position among others, and implies that they may be compensated for their efforts.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:274)**:\n   > \"Those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah, day and night, secretly and openly, will receive a reward from their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.\"\n   - This reference indicates that spending wealth in the way of Allah, which includes acts of teaching and learning, is rewarded by Allah. Hence, accepting payment for teaching can be considered part of spending wealth for a good cause.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Qalam (68:46-50)**:\n   > \"Do you ask for any compensation from them (the people who might not value your message), that they are burdened with want? Or do they have knowledge of the unseen which they can copy down?\"\n   - This verse suggests teachers should not necessarily seek compensation in the worldly sense (from those who do not appreciate it). However, it does not preclude accepting payment from those who seek knowledge earnestly, as the seeking of knowledge is highly valued and worthy of compensation.\n\nIn addition to these verses, there are numerous hadiths that elaborate on the value of teaching and learning. For instance, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said:\n\n> \"The best among you are those who have the best manners and character, and are the most knowledgeable.\" (Sahih Bukhari)\n\nGiven these contexts, we can conclude that accepting payment for teaching the Qur'an is permissible, provided that the intention is to spread knowledge for the sake of Allah and not solely for material gain. The act of teaching the Qur'an is considered a noble profession in Islam, and it can be a means of earning a livelihood while fulfilling a crucial role in society."

        "question": "Why does the Qur’aan not mention the story of Haajar and Zamzam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.You \n          might as well ask, why does the Qur’aan not explain the number of prayers \n          during the day and night, and the number [of rak’ahs in] each prayer, \n          and what should be recited in the prayer, and how the prayer should \n          be done… And why does it not speak in detail about zakaah, and Hajj, \n          and fasting, and so on? \nAllaah \n          has made the Sunnah of the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the detailed explanation \n          of that which is mentioned in general terms in the Qur’aan. Allaah says \n          (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And \n          We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Dhikr [reminder and \n          the advice (i.e. the Qur’aan)], that you may explain clearly to men \n          what is sent down to them” \n[al-Nahl \n          16:44] \nThe \n          matters which you mention are explained in the Sunnah, and both of them \n          – the Sunnah and the Qur’aan – are wahy \n          (revelation) from Allaah. \nShaykh \n          Sa’d al-Humayd \nThere \n          follows the story of Haajar and Zamzam from the Sunnah, so that you \n          will have no need of the Bible, of which we cannot be sure that the \n          content is correct. \nIbn \n          ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated the story of Haajar, \n          the wife of Ibraaheem and the mother of his son Ismaa’eel. He said: \nIbraaheem brought her and her son Ismaa’eel while \n          she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka'bah under a tree on the \n          spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days \n          there was nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them \n          sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, \n          and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. \n          Ismaa’eel's mother followed him saying, \"O Ibraaheem! Where are \n          you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose \n          company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated \n          that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked \n          him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do this?\" He said, \"Yes.\" \n          She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while \n          Ibraaheem went on his way. When he reached al-Thaniyyah, where they \n          could not see him, he faced the Ka'bah, and raising both hands, prayed \n          to Allaah in the following words:\n“O \n          our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable \n          valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, \n          that they may perform As‑Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑Salaah). \n          So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allaah) \n          provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks”[Ibraaheem 14:37 \n          – interpretation of the meaning] \nIsmaa’eel's mother went on suckling Ismaa’eel and \n          drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin \n          had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. \n          She started looking at him (i.e. Ismaa’eel) tossing in agony (or he \n          said: kicking with his heels). She left him, for she could not endure \n          looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safa was the nearest \n          mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at \n          the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not \n          see anybody. Then she descended from al-Safa and when she reached the \n          valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in \n          distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached al-Marwa \n          where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but \n          she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between al-Safa \n          and al-Marwa) seven times.\nIbn ‘Abbaas said: the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \"This is the \n          source of the tradition of the walking between them (i.e. al-Safa and \n          al-Marwa). When she reached al-Marwa (for the last time) she heard a \n          voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She \n          heard the voice again and said, “O (whoever you may be)! You have made \n          me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And she \n          saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel \n          (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make \n          something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started \n          filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water started \n          flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\"\nIbn \n          ‘Abbaas said: The Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ismaa’eel's \n          mother! Had she left the Zamzam alone (flowing without trying to control \n          it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), \n          Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" \n          The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled \n          her child. The angel said to her, 'Don't be afraid of being neglected, \n          for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his \n          father, and Allah never neglects His people.' The House (i.e. Ka’bah) \n          at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents \n          came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till \n          some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed \n          by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through \n          the way of Kada'. They landed in the lower part of Makkah where they \n          saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving \n          it. They said, ‘This bird must be flying around water, though we know \n          that there is no water in this valley.’ They sent one or two messengers \n          who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the \n          water. So, they all came (towards the water).\"\nThe \n          Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, \n          \"Ismaa’eel's mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, \n          'Do you allow us to stay with you?' She replied, 'Yes, but you will \n          have no right to possess the water.' They agreed to that.\" Ibn \n          ‘Abbaas said: the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further said, \"Ismaa’eel's mother was pleased with \n          the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the \n          people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families \n          who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent \n          residents there. The child (i.e. Ismaa’eel) grew up and learnt Arabic \n          from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he \n          grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry \n          a woman from amongst them.  \nAfter Ismaa’eel's mother had died, Ibraaheem \n          came after Ismaa’eel's marriage in order to see his family that he had \n          left before…\nThen \n          Ibraaheem came back later on. He saw Ismaa’eel under a tree near Zam-zam, \n          sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibraaheem, he stood up to welcome \n          him, and they greeted each other as a father does with his son and a \n          son does with his father. Ibraaheem said, 'O Ismaa’eel! Allah has given \n          me an order.' Ismaa’eel said, 'Do what your Lord has ordered you to \n          do.' Ibraaheem asked, 'Will you help me?' Ismaa’eel said, 'I will help \n          you.' Ibraaheem said, ‘Allah has ordered me to build a house here,' \n          pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The \n          Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. \n          the Ka'bah). Ismaa’eel brought the stones and Ibraaheem was building, \n          and when the walls became high, Ismaa’eel brought this stone and put \n          it for Ibraaheem who stood on it and carried on building, while Ismaa’eel \n          was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, ‘Our \n          Lord!

        "predicted_answer": "The story of Haajar (Hagar) and the Zamzam well is indeed significant in Islamic tradition, especially given its connection to the life of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and the emergence of the Kaba in Mecca. However, it is not explicitly mentioned in the Qur’an. There are several possible reasons for this omission:\n\n### 1. Focus on the Essential Messages\n\nThe Qur'an emphasizes the core teachings of Islam, which include monotheism (Tawhid), prophethood, and the purpose of creation. Each story and parable included in the Qur'an serves a specific purpose in conveying moral and ethical lessons. The absence of the story of Haajar and Zamzam may reflect the focus on narratives that directly address these core themes and the struggles of the prophets in upholding faith amid adversity.\n\nFor example, Surah Al-Qasas highlights the stories of various prophets and their missions to guide their people, affirming the idea that success in belief is through divine guidance rather than spectacular events alone (Qur'an 28:46-49):\n> *\"You were not present on the side of Mount Sinai when We called. And all this knowledge that you are given is by the grace of your Lord... But when the truth came to them from Us, they said: 'Why is he not given the like of what was given to Moses?'\"*  \n*(Surah Al-Qasas, 28:46-48)*\n\n### 2. Oral Tradition and Supplementary Sources\n\nThe Qur'an itself does not encompass every detail of the stories of the prophets; instead, many stories are elaborated upon in Hadith literature and Tafsir (exegesis). The details of Haajar and the Zamzam well are preserved in Hadith literature, emphasizing the Islamic tradition's reliance on both the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet Muhammad).\n\n### 3. Significance of Place Over Individual Narratives\n\nThe Qur’an may focus on the broader significance of places and events, such as the Kaaba in Mecca, which is the focal point of Islamic worship. The Zamzam well, which is often associated with the experience of pilgrimage and the rituals of Hajj, is implicitly understood within this context, thus deeming the specific story of Haajar less critical to the overall message of the Qur'an.\n\nAs seen in Surah Al-Hajj, the pilgrimage and the rites associated with it are emphasized:\n> *\"And proclaim to the people the Hajj. They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, coming from every distant pass.\"*  \n*(Surah Al-Hajj, 22:27)*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the Qur’an does not narrate the story of Haajar and the Zamzam well, it serves as a reminder of the selection process through which the stories were chosen for inclusion. Each story or message included is for the purpose of reinforcing the primary themes of faith, guidance, and ethical conduct. The absence of Haajar's story in the Qur’an does not diminish its significance in Islamic tradition; rather, it is complemented by other sources that enrich the understanding of Islamic heritage."

        "question": "Ruling on reading Qur’aan in a house where there is a dog",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with that, but you have to get the \n          dog out of the house and not keep it inside, unless it is for one of \n          three reasons, namely hunting, farming or herding livestock. The Prophet \n           (peace and blessings of Allaah \n          be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog, unless it is a dog for hunting, \n          herding or farming, his reward will decrease by two qiraats (i.e., a \n          large amount) every day.” (Agreed upon). \nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "The discussion regarding reading the Qur'an in a house where there is a dog primarily revolves around Islamic teachings concerning cleanliness and the status of dogs within Islamic jurisprudence. The evidence and interpretations from various Islamic sources can help elucidate this matter.\n\n### Ruling on Reading the Qur'an in a House with a Dog\n\n1. **Impurity of Dogs**: In Islamic tradition, dogs are generally considered impure animals (najis). This viewpoint is derived from Hadith literature, where it is stated that if a dog drinks from a vessel, the vessel should be washed multiple times to purify it (Sahih Muslim). This perspective affects whether one can engage in acts of worship, such as reading the Qur'an, in close proximity to a dog.\n\n2. **Specific Rulings**: While there is rigorous debate among scholars, many scholars advise that while it is permissible to have dogs for protection and other legitimate reasons, one should aspire to keep dogs outside of the home, particularly in places designated for prayer and Qur'anic recitation. This precaution stems from concerns about ritual purity, which is crucial for worship.\n\n3. **Tolerance for Situations**: Some scholars acknowledge that there may be exceptions based on necessity or personal circumstances. For instance, a dog that serves a protective role or as a companion for individuals with disabilities might change the typical ruling. In this case, it could be deemed acceptable to read the Qur'an in the presence of the dog, provided that the individual ensures the area is clean.\n\n4. **Citing Relevant Verses**: \n    - In **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:173)**, Allah mentions that which is forbidden while addressing the need being a factor in ensuring obedience to divine law: \"Forbidden to you are carrion and blood, and the flesh of the swine, and that which has been consecrated (or killed) in the name of any other than God.\"\n    - While this verse isn’t directly about dogs, it reflects the broader principles of cleanliness and pureness required in the presence of worship and Qur’anic recitation. It can be inferred that being in a state of ritual purity is conducive to the act of worship.\n\n5. **Historical Context and Practices**: \n    - The story referenced in **Surah Al-Kahf (18:18)** speaks of the companions of the cave who had a dog with them. Although it is mentioned without a negative connotation, the context indicates an extraordinary situation where the animal served a protective role, implying specific permissibility rather than a routine allowance.\n\n6. **Spiritual Considerations**: \n    - It is important to remember that while physical cleanliness is vital, the intrinsic intention behind reading the Qur’an (niyyah) and seeking the pleasure of Allah holds significant value. Thus, individuals should consult their hearts and intentions.\n\n**Conclusion**: In summary, while having a dog can create a barrier to conventional cleanliness required for regular Qur'anic recitation, individual circumstances matter. Those who find themselves in this situation are encouraged to apply the principles of necessity, striving to maintain their spiritual practices while ensuring cleanliness to the best of their ability. Consulting local scholars for personal guidance is also advised, as rulings can vary based on interpretative frameworks within Islamic law."

        "question": "If a person looks at the Mus-haf without moving his lips, will he be rewarded for that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing to prevent a person looking at the Qur’aan \n          without reciting it, in order to ponder its meanings and understand \n          it. But he is not considered to be “reading” Qur’aan when he does that, \n          and he does not earn the reward for reading it unless he pronounces \n          (the words of) the Qur’aan, even if those around him do not hear him. \n          The Prophet  (peace and blessings \n          of Allaah be upon him) said: \n“Read the Qur’aan, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection to \n          intercede for its companions.” (Narrated by Muslim). \nWhat he  (peace and blessings \n          of Allaah be upon him) meant by its companions is those who act upon \n          it, as stated in other ahaadeeth. The Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads one \n          letter of the Qur’aan will have one hasanah, and the hasanah will be \n          rewarded tenfold.”  (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and al-Daarimi with \n          a saheeh isnaad). And one cannot be counted as reading Qur’aan unless \n          once actually pronounces it. \nAnd Allaah is the source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "The inquiry regarding whether a person who looks at the Mus-haf (the physical copy of the Quran) without moving their lips will be rewarded is an important one in Islamic teachings. \n\nIn general, the act of engaging with the Quran is highly emphasized in Islam and is considered to bring immense rewards. While the relevant verses you provided do not specifically mention the act of looking at the Mus-haf without verbal recitation, they do highlight the significance of reading and reflecting upon the Quran.\n\n### Relevant Quranic Verses and Commentary\n\n1. **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**:\n   - **Verse**: \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily. He knows some among you will be sick, and some will be travelling over the earth in search of the bounty of God, and some fighting in the way of God. So read as much from it as you can easily...\"\n   - **Interpretation**: This verse emphasizes the importance of reciting the Quran and acknowledges the various conditions under which one might be unable to read it fully. Just the act of attempting to engage with the Quran brings the believer closer to Allah, and this can be extended to looking at the Mus-haf with a sincere intention. \n\n2. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:75)**:\n   - **Verse**: \"They will be rewarded for their perseverance with lofty mansions in empyrean where they will be received with greetings of peace and salutations.\"\n   - **Interpretation**: This verse speaks to the rewards awaiting those who engage in good deeds, which can encompass acts of worship such as reading or reflecting on the Quran. Even if one is unable to recite verbally, the intention and effort of looking at the Quran can still be connected to this perseverance.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:286)**:\n   - **Verse**: \"Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...\"\n   - **Interpretation**: This reminds us that God is aware of our capabilities and limitations. Thus, someone looking at the Mus-haf without reciting aloud might be doing what they can under their circumstances, which Allah considers when rewarding His servants.\n\n### Conclusion\nEngaging with the Quran, whether through reading aloud or silently looking at the text, can be a source of great reward. A person who looks at the Mus-haf with the intention to learn, reflect, or absorb its teachings can indeed expect to be rewarded by Allah for their effort and sincerity. The overarching message of Islam is that intentions play a crucial role in how actions are judged. Therefore, even in silent observation, there is potential for divine reward if the act is performed with the correct intention. \n\nIn summary, while explicit references for looking without verbal recitation may not be present in the verses you've shared, the principles of intention, effort, and connection to the Quran remain significant in earning reward."

        "question": "Celebrating completing the Qur’aan (khatm al-Qur’aan)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah., and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allaah.\n Celebrating the completion of memorizing the Qur’aan is not Sunnah, because nothing of that nature was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from any of his Sahaabah. Doing this on the grounds that it is part of religion is bid’ah. But people do it as a customary expression of joy for the blessing of having memorized Qur’aan, like celebrations for the return of one who has been away, or for finding work, or for moving to a new home. If the celebration for completing the Qur’aan is of this nature, then there is nothing wrong with it. If a passage from the Qur’aan is recited, from the beginning or the end, without having to recite a specific soorah or recite in a particular way such as joining the end to the beginning, then this is fine, because reciting from Qur’aan is the best thing that can be done in a gathering and it is a reminder for those who are present. With regard to making du’aa’ when completing the recitation of the Qur’aan, it was reported with a saheeh isnaad from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that when he completed the Qur’aan, he would gather his family together and make du’aa’ with them. If the reader makes du’aa’ when he completes the Qur’aan, and those who are present say “Ameen” to his du’aa’, this is fine.\n With regard to calling the teacher “shaykhah” , there is nothing wrong with this. Now you know, may Allaah bless you, that there is no reason not to have the celebration you have described. There is no need to read from the end of the Mus-haf and then join it to the beginning. Doing something in this manner requires evidence (daleel), because reading Qur’aan is an act of worship, and acts of worship must be done only in the manner in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did them, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day, and remembers Allaah much” [al-Ahzaab 33:21]\n Written by Shaykh ‘Abd-Al-Rahmaan al-Barraak\n There is a hadeeth about the person who stops for a rest immediately carrying on, which was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) from Ibn ‘Abbaas. According to this hadeeth, a man said, “O Messenger of Allaah, which deed is most beloved to Allaah? He said, “Al-haal al-murtahil.” The man said, ‘What is al-haal al-murtahil?” He said, “The one who starts from the beginning of the Qur’aan until he reaches the end, and when he stops for a rest, he immediately carries on.”\n But this hadeeth is da’eef (weak), as al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) says after he quotes it: this is a ghareeb (strange) hadeeth which we only know from Ibn ‘Abbaas with this isnaad, and this isnaad is not strong.\n Hence Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-I’laam (p.289, part2), after he mentioned this hadeeth: Some of them understood from this that when a person has finished reading the whole Qur’aan, he should then read al-Faatihah and three verses of Soorat al-Baqarah, because he stopped when he completed it, and he continued when he started again. But none of the Sahaabah or Taabi’een did this, and none of the imaams regarded it as mustahabb (encouraged). What is referred to in the hadeeth is when a person returns from one military campaign and immediately joins another, or every time he completes one good deed, he starts another which he  completes as he did the first one. But what some readers do is not what was meant in the hadeeth at all. And Allaah is the source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "Celebrating the completion of the Qur'an, known as \"khatm al-Qur'an,\" is a practice observed by many Muslims. While the Qur'an does not provide explicit instructions about celebrating its completion, several verses highlight the importance of reciting, reflecting, and being grateful for the guidance it offers. Here are some dimensions of the topic, supported by Qur'anic verses:\n\n### Importance of the Qur'an\n\n1. **Guidance and Reflection**:\n   The Qur'an is described as guidance for humanity, making it significant to complete its recitation and reflect on its teachings. \n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah** (2:185) states: \n     \"Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance, and criterion (of falsehood and truth).\" \n\n2. **Gratitude**:\n   Completing the Qur'an can enhance one's gratitude towards Allah for His revelations and guidance.\n   - **Surah Al-Furqan** (25:73-77) emphasizes the quality of being grateful: \n     \"And those who say: 'O Lord, give us comfort in our spouses and children, and make us paragons of those who follow the straight path.' They will be rewarded for their perseverance with lofty mansions in empyrean where they will be received with greetings of peace and salutations.\" \n\n3. **Diligence and Devotion**:\n   Reciting the Qur'an, especially in the night, signifies devotion to Allah.\n   - **Surah Qaf** (50:39-40) provides encouragement: \n     \"So you bear with patience what they say, and sing the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun and its setting. And glorify Him for some portion of the night, and additional adorations.\"\n\n### The Celebration of Khatm al-Qur'an\n\n1. **Gathering for Reflection**:\n   Many Muslims gather after completing the Qur'an to reflect, pray, and make supplications. This practice aligns with the encouragement in the Qur'an to spend nights in worship.\n   - **Surah Al-Furqan** (25:64-65) mentions: \n     \"And those who spend their nights bowed and standing before their Lord; Who say: 'O our Lord, avert from us the torment of Hell: Its punishment is surely continuous.'\"\n\n2. **The Importance of Recitation**:\n   The act of recitation itself is treated with reverence and is highlighted as a form of worship. \n   - **Surah Al-Qamar** (54:32-34) declares: \n     \"Easy have We made the Qur'an to understand: So is there any one who will be warned?\"\n\n3. **Community and Brotherhood**:\n   Celebrating Khatm al-Qur'an builds a sense of community among believers, as they gather to share in the blessings of the Qur'an. This aligns with several teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that encourage communal prayers and gatherings for remembrance of Allah.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough the Qur'an does not mention specific rituals for celebrating its completion, the acts of reflection, prayer, and community gatherings foster a deeper connection to its teachings. Celebrating Khatm al-Qur'an can thus be viewed as a form of expressing gratitude, reflecting on the guidance provided, and reinforcing community bonds among believers.\n\n### References to the Qur'an\n\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:185)** - Guidance for mankind.\n2. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:73-77)** - Gratitude and comfort.\n3. **Surah Qaf (50:39-40)** - Diligence in worship.\n4. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:64-65)** - Spending nights in worship.\n5. **Surah Al-Qamar (54:32-34)** - The ease of understanding the Qur'an.\n\nIn summary, while celebrating the completion of the Qur'an may not be explicitly outlined, it is aligned with the overarching principles of gratitude, community worship, and reflection that are emphasized throughout the text."

        "question": "Is it true that there is no evidence of a Qur’aan being written\r\n      in the 7th century?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is a false and incorrectstatement made by those who try to find faults with\n      Islam so as to put people off this religion. It is sufficient to know that\n      Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur’aan, as He says\n      (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily,\n      We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely,\n      We will guard it (from corruption).” [al-Hijr 15:9]\n Moreover, the fact that the transmission\n      of the Qur’aan by memory and in writing was mutawaatir – narrated by\n      groups to groups [to such anextent\n      that so many people could not conceivably have agreed upon a lie] – is\n      well known to anyone who has the slightest acquaintance with Islamic\n      knowledge, especially knowledge of recitations and reciters. \n There are still many people nowadays who\n      have learned the Qur’aan orally, with isnaads directly going back to the\n      Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\n One of the miracles of Allaah’s\n      protection of the Qur’aan is the fact that those who try to tamper with\n      it are always found out.\n The point is, everything that was\n      revealed to the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\n      was written down in front of him straight away, and some of the Sahaabah\n      had masaahif (written copies\n      of the Qur’aan). After the death of the Prophet \n (peace and\n      blessings of Allaah be upon him), thefirst khaleefah, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with\n      him) gathered the Qur’aan inwritten\n      and kept it. Then the third khaleefah, ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may\n      Allaah be pleased with him) compiled it in mus-hafs that were based on the\n      mus-haf compiled by Abu Bakr, in addition to what had been memorized.\nWhen\n      we realize that the Qur’aan was written down and compiled by the\n      Sahaabah, and ‘Uthmaan sent copies of the Mus-haf during his reign to\n      all the main centres of Islam, so that it would be a reference for them,\n      and there were no disputes concerning them, then how can we say that there\n      is no written trace of the Qur’aan in the seventh century? Moreover,\n      there are several ancient manuscripts of the Qur’aan in libraries and\n      museums which bear visible testimony to the fact that nothing has been\n      changed in the Book of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the\n      meaning):\n“And\n      verily, it is an honourable well‑fortified respected Book (because\n      it is Allaah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption).\n      Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down\n      by the All‑Wise, Worthy of all\n      praise (Allaah).” [Fussilat 41:41-42]\n      \n      \n      \n      And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether there is evidence of the Qur'an being written in the 7th century is a point of contention often debated among scholars, historians, and skeptics. A comprehensive answer involves understanding the historical context, the nature of the Qur'an itself, and the claims made about its preservation and compilation.\n\n### Historical Background\n\n1. **The Qur'anic Compilation**: The Qur'an is believed by Muslims to have been revealed to the Prophet Muhammad over a period of approximately 23 years, from 610 CE until the Prophet's death in 632 CE. These revelations were recited and memorized by his followers and were recorded in various forms. \n\n2. **Early Compilation**: After the Prophet's death, the first caliph, Abu Bakr, commissioned the first compilation of the Qur'an into a single book format. This was prompted by the deaths of several Qur'an memorizers in battles, which raised concerns about losing parts of the revelations. This compilation was carried out by Zaid ibn Thabit, who was one of the Prophet's scribes. \n\n3. **Uthman's Compilation**: Later, during the caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan (around 656-661 CE), a standardized version of the Qur'an was commissioned to unify the text, which had various recensions in different Islamic territories. Uthman’s edition was produced to minimize disputes regarding the text, and all other versions were ordered to be destroyed.\n\n### Evidence for the Existence of the Qur'an in the 7th Century\n\n**Archaeological and Historical Manuscripts**: \n\n- **Sana'a Manuscripts**: In 1972, a significant discovery was made in Yemen (the Sana'a manuscripts), where fragments of early Qur'anic texts were found. These manuscripts date back to the 7th century and show variations that indicate a process of textual transmission and compilation during this period.\n\n- **Other Manuscripts**: Other early Qur'anic fragments, such as the Birmingham Qur'an manuscript, have also been dated to the 7th century and confirm the presence of Qur'anic texts during the lifetime of early Muslims.\n\n### The Nature of the Qur'an\n\nAccording to Islamic belief, the Qur'an is viewed as the literal word of God (Allah) revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. This view is supported by verses within the Qur'an itself that emphasize its divine origin and preservation:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:75-79)**: \n   - \"So I call the placement of the stars to witness — And this surely is great evidence if you can understand — That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an (Inscribed) in the well-kept Book. Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind). It has been revealed by the Lord of all the worlds.\" \n   - (Surah Al-Waqi'ah, 56:75-79)\n\n2. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:4-8)**:\n   - \"Yet the unbelievers say: 'This is nothing but a lie he has concocted... Say: 'He who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth has revealed it to me; and He is surely forgiving and kind.'\"\n   - (Surah Al-Furqan, 25:4-8)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on both historical accounts and archaeological findings, there is substantial evidence that the Qur'an existed in written form in the 7th century. The compilation process was initiated shortly after the Prophet Muhammad's death, and significant manuscripts that reflect the Qur'anic text have been discovered, confirming its early existence and the efforts undertaken to preserve it.\n\nThus, claims that there is no evidence of the Qur'an being written in the 7th century overlook both historical documentation and archaeological discoveries that affirm the contrary. These elements combined provide a robust foundational context for the early presence of the Qur'an as a written text."

((Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 3/110)\nWhat is Tankis al-Kalimat (inversion of words)?\nTankis al-Kalimat (inversion of words) means putting a later word before a previous word, for example, instead of Qul huwa Allahu ahad, one reads Ahad Allah huwa qul!\nThis also is undoubtedly haram, because it changes the Quran from the way in which it was spoken by Allah.

This was also the view of Ibn al-’Arabi, as stated in al-Fath, 2/257)\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:\nTankis al-ayat (inverting verses) is also haram according to the most correct view, because the order of the verses is tawqifi (something which is based on revelation [and not open to ijtihad]).

(Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/110)\nWhat is Tankis al-Suwar (inversion of Surahs)?\nTankis al-Suwar (inversion of Surahs) means, reciting later Surahs before earlier ones, for example, reciting Al ‘Imran before al-Baqarah.\nRuling on Tankis al-Suwar\nThose scholars who say that the order of Surahs is not tawqifi do not see anything wrong with this.\nThose who think that it is tawqifi or that the consensus of the Companions on the order of Surahs is evidence, do not think that it is permissible.\nThe correct view is that the order of Surahs is not tawqifi; it is the result of ijtihad on the part of some of the Companions.\nThere was no ijma` (consensus) among the Companions on the order of Surahs; the order in the Mus-haf of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud for example is different from that in the Mus-hafs of others.\nIn the Sunnah there is evidence that supports the view that it is permissible:\nHudhayfah said: I prayed with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one night, and he started to recite al-Baqarah. I thought he would do ruku’ when he reached one hundred ayas, but he kept going. I thought he would complete it in one rak`ah, but he kept going. I thought, he would do ruku’ now, but he started to recite al-Nisa, and he recited all of it, then he started to recite Al Imran and recited all of it. (Narrated by Muslim, 772).\nThe evidence in this hadith is that he recited al-Nisa then Al Imran.\nAl-Nawawi said:\n“Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: this contains evidence for those who say that the order of Surahs is the result of ijtihad on the part of the Muslims when they wrote down the Mus-haf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not dictate the order of Surahs; he entrusted this task to his ummah after his death. This is the view of Malik and the majority of the scholars, and was the view favoured by al-Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqillani. Ibn al-Baqillani said: it is the more correct of the two views, although both are possible.\nHe said: what we say is that the order of Surahs is not binding when writing, praying, studying, teaching or learning. There is no report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning that which would make it forbidden to differ from it. Hence the order of Surahs in the various Mus-hafs differed, before the Mus-haf of ‘Uthman.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the ummah after him in all ages regarded it as permissible to differ from the order of Surahs in prayer , and when studying and teaching.\nHe said: with regard to the view of those scholars who say that (the order of Surahs) was set by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and that he put them in the same order as appears in the Mus-haf of ‘Uthman and that the different orders came about before they heard of his ruling and his final review of the Quran with Jibril they interpret the fact that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited al-Nisa first and then Al Imran as meaning that this happened before the final ruling was dictated, and these two Surahs appear in this order in the Mus-haf of Ubayy.\nHe said: there is no dispute concerning the fact that a person who is praying may recite in the second rak`ah a Surah which comes before the Surah which he recited in the first rak`ah; but it is makruh to do this in one rak`ah, or when reciting Quran outside of prayer.\nHe said: but some of them permitted this.\nThe prohibition of the Salaf against reading the Quran backwards is interpreted as referring to those who read from the end of a Surah to the beginning.\nHe said: there is no dispute concerning the fact that the order of verses in each Surah is based on revelation from Allah and is as it now appears in the Mus-haf and as it was transmitted by the ummah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (End of the comments of al-Qadi ‘Iyad). And Allah knows best.” (Sharh Muslim, 6/61, 62)\nAl-Sindi said:\nThe phrase [in the hadith of Hudhayfah] then he started to recite Al ‘Imran means that it is not obligatory to follow the order of Surahs when reciting. (Sharh al-Nasai, 3/226)\n·        It was reported from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man from among the Ansar used to lead them in prayer in the mosque of Quba. Every time he led them in prayer, he would start his recitation with Qul huwa Allahu ahad, then when he finished it, he would recite another Surah. He did that in every rak`ah. His companions spoke with him and said, You always start with this Surah, then you do not think it is enough and you recite another. Either you should recite this Surah alone, or you should leave it and recite another. He said, I am not going to stop reciting it. If you like, I will lead you in prayer as I have been doing, and if you do not like it, I will leave you. They felt that he was one of the best of them, and they did not want anyone else to lead them in prayer. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to them, they told him about this. He said, O So and So, what is stopping you from doing what your companions tell you? What makes you keep on reciting this Surah in every rak`ah? He said, I love it. He said, Your love for it will grant you admittance to Paradise. (Narrated by al-Bukhari mu’allaqan, and by al-Tirmidhi with an isnad similar to that of al-Bukhari, 2901).\nThe evidence in this report is the fact that the man recited Surat al-Ikhlas in his prayer before any other Surah that comes before it (in the Mus-haf), and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of that.\n·        This is the action of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).\nAl-Imam al-Bukhari said:\n“Al-Ahnaf recited al-Kahf in the first rak`ah and Yusuf or Yunus in the second, and he said that he had prayed Fajr with ‘Umar and he had done the same.” (Bab al-Jam’ bayna Suratayn fil-Rak`ah, in Kitab al-Adhan)\nWith regard to the latter part of your question, we say:\nIt is permissible to recite verses 50-60 of al-Baqarah in the first rak`ah, then to recite verses 1-20 of al-Baqarah in the second rak`ah, because then the meaning of the passage will be complete.\nBut reciting verses 10-20 means that one is cutting off the meaning, so it is better not to do this. Perhaps you mentioned the numbers only by way of example and you did not mean these particular verses.\nFor more, please see these answers: 20043 , 69915 , 171060 , and 7198 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic prayer (Salat), the recitation of Surahs (chapters from the Quran) during the prayer does not have a strict requirement that they must be recited in any particular order. However, there are certain etiquettes and norms that guide how prayers are performed.\n\n### Is there an obligation to recite Surahs in order?\n\n1. **No Specific Order Required**: The Quranic verses do not explicitly state that the Surahs must be recited in a specific order during prayer. The practice of reciting specific Surahs such as Al-Fatihah (the opening chapter) is considered obligatory, while other Surahs can be chosen freely by the individual praying. \n\n2. **Flexibility in Recitation**: Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:16-19) mentions that the responsibility for the collection and recitation of the Quran rests with Allah, and that the timing and order of its recitation (following proper etiquette) are key aspects rather than rigid structures.\n\n   - *“Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste. Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility.”* (Surah Al-Qiyamah 75:15-19)\n\n3. **Guidance on Quality of Recitation**: Surah Al-Isra (17:110) indicates that one should strike a balance in reciting the Quran—neither too loud nor too soft—which emphasizes mindfulness and attention during the recitation rather than the order of Surahs.\n\n   - *“And do not say your prayers too loudly or in too low a voice, but follow a middle course.”* (Surah Al-Isra 17:110)\n\n4. **Contextual Flexibility**: Surah An-Nisa (4:103) suggests that different situations can alter how prayers are conducted, indicating that flexibility in practicing prayer is essential, which extends to the recitation of Surahs.\n\n   - *“If you are late in performing your service of prayer, honour God by remembering Him, standing or sitting or lying on your sides.”* (Surah An-Nisa 4:103)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while certain Surahs may be traditionally recited (like Al-Fatihah), there is no strict requirement to follow a specific order in the recitation of other Surahs during Salat. The key focus is on maintaining the quality and attentiveness of prayer, allowing for flexibility and individual discretion in the choice of Surahs. The guidelines provided in the Quran allow for this flexibility, underscoring the accessibility of worship in Islam."

        "question": "They get together    and each person reads one juz’; will this be considered as a khutmah (complete reading of the Quran) for all of them?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In my opinion the action mentioned is not permissible, and I do not recall anything of this kind being reported from the Salaf. A person will only be rewarded for what he himself reads or listens to in order to benefit from it. But if another person reads and he does not listen, the reward for that will go to the person who read it. These people are not considered to have completed the whole Quran; but if each person has read a juz’ he will be rewarded for that. But they should not do this; either one person should read and the others listen, or each person should read by himself without making a connection between his reading and that of the others.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, if a group of people gets together and each person reads one juz’ (one-thirtieth) of the Quran, it can be considered a **khutmah (complete reading of the Quran)** for all of them. This view is supported by several understandings within Islamic teachings and practices regarding the collective reading of the Quran.\n\n### Supporting Points\n\n1. **Unity in Reading**: The important aspect of reading the Quran collectively is the intention and the unity among the participants. The Quran acknowledges that reciting as much as one can easily is sufficient (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20):\n   > \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily...\"  \n   (Surah Al-Muzzammil, Ayah 20)\n\n   This verse illustrates flexibility and encourages recitation according to individual capability, which can be interpreted as allowing collective efforts for fulfilling Quranic recitation.\n\n2. **Encouragement of Recitation**: There is also encouragement in Islamic tradition for gatherings to recite the Quran, which can further validate the act of completing it together. The essence behind such gatherings emphasizes spirituality and the importance of reading among community members.\n\n3. **Collective Reward**: The hadith literature mentions significant reward for those who engage in Quranic recitation together. If each individual reads their portion with sincerity and intention, it is highly likely that they all receive the reward associated with completing the Quran.\n\n4. **Different Interpretative Traditions**: Various scholars and Islamic practices recognize that a communal approach to Quran recitation can be equally meritorious as reading it individually. Although some schools of thought prioritize individual recitation, the collective aspect is often embraced due to the community's nature in Islam.\n\n5. **The role of intention**: The foundational principle in Islam is that actions are judged by intentions. If all participants intend to complete a reading of the Quran, they collectively achieve that goal, as supported by the emphasis on sincere intentions in Islamic teachings.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, as long as each participant reads their juz’ sincerely and with the intention of a complete reading, it is reasonable to conclude that it counts as a complete reading of the Quran for the entire gathering.\n\n**References**: \n- Surah 73 - Al-Muzzammil, Ayah 20."

        "question": "Hanging Quranic Verses on Walls",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Hanging plaques and cloths containing verses of the Quran in homes , schools, social clubs and places of business, involves a number of reservations and prohibitions according to Islam, such as the following:\n\nIn most cases, hanging such things on the wall is done for purposes of decoration and adornment, as the verses etc. are written in calligraphy and colorful brocade. This is an inappropriate use of the Quran, as it was revealed to guide people and to be read regularly. The Quran was not revealed to decorate walls, but to guide mankind.\nSome people hang up such things for blessing - which is a form of worship. The blessing as described in Islam comes from reading or reciting the Quran, not from hanging it up or placing it on shelves or turning it into artwork and three-dimensional images.\nThis is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Khalifas (al-Khulafa al-Rashidun), may Allah be pleased with them, who never did such a thing. The best way is to follow them, not to introduce innovations in religion. History tells us that in places such as Andalusia, Turkey, etc., the adornment of houses and mosques with ornate carvings of verses only happened at times when the Muslims were weak and humiliated.\nHanging up such pictures or plaques could lead to shirk, because some people think that these things are amulets that will protect the house and its people from evil and disease. This is shirk and is haram, because the One Who really offers protection is Allah, may He be glorified, and one of the means of gaining His protection is sincere recitation of the Quran and du’as taught in the Quran and Sunnah.\nThere is the risk that the Quran may be used, in such cases, as a means of promoting one's business or increasing one's earnings. The Quran should be protected from being used for such purposes. It is well-known that the production and sale of these pictures and plaques involves a great deal of extravagance and wasting money.\nMany of these plaques are painted with real gold, which makes using them and hanging them up even more haram.\nMany of these plaques involve a kind of carelessness, because the letters are twisted into complex designs that are of no benefit to anyone because they are barely legible. Sometimes words are fashioned into the shape of a bird or a man prostrating, and similarly forbidden pictures of animate beings.\nVerses and surahs of the Quran are exposed to misuse and abuse by this practice. For example, when moving house, they are piled up with the rest of the furniture and belongings, and other objects may be placed on top of them. This also happens when they are taken down so that the wall may be painted or cleaned.\nSome Muslims whose observance of Islam is lacking put these plaques and pictures up so that they can feel that they are doing something religious, in order to reduce their feelings of guilt in spite of the fact that this practice does not help them in any way.\n\nAll in all, we must close the doors of evil and follow the leaders of guidance of the early centuries of Islam, whose people the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) testified were the best of the Muslims in faith and practice. If someone were to say, We are not going to abuse it or make it a decoration or exaggerate about it, we only want to remind people (about their religion) in our gatherings, our response would be: if we look at real life, will we find that this is what actually happens? Do people really remember Allah? Do they even read these verses when they raise their heads?\nWhat really happens is the opposite: people go against the words hanging over their heads, they still tell lies, engage in gossip, make fun of others and do and say evil things. Even if we assume that there are some who do benefit from these plaques etc., the fact is that they are very few, and this does not change the Islamic ruling on the matter.\nThe Muslims must turn to the Book of Allah, read it and recite it, and act in accordance with it. We ask Allah to make the Quran a light of guidance for us, and a means of removing our grief and anxiety. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\nFor more, please see these answers: 39185 , 13648 and 170060 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Hanging Quranic verses on walls is a practice that some Muslims engage in as a way to honor the words of Allah and to decorate their homes with reminders of faith. However, this practice is a subject of discussion among scholars, and different interpretations exist regarding its permissibility and appropriateness based on Islamic teachings.\n\n### 1. Importance of the Quran\n\nThe Quran is considered the literal word of God, revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Angel Gabriel. Many verses emphasize the significance of the Quran as guidance and wisdom. For example:\n\n- **Surah 7:203-206 (Al-A'raf)** mentions that Quranic revelations serve as evident proof and guidance. It encourages listening attentively when the Quran is recited and meditating on its content:\n  > \"And when the Qur'an is recited listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.\" (7:204)\n\n### 2. Respect and Reverence for the Quran\n\nThe Quran is held in high esteem, and its verses are meant to be treated with great respect. Hanging these verses on walls may serve as a reminder for believers to engage with the Quran regularly. \n\n- **Surah 56:75-79 (Al-Waqi'ah)** states the Quran is glorious and inscribed in a well-kept Book, accessed only by those who are pure:\n  > “That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an (Inscribed) in the well-kept Book.” (56:78-79)\n\n### 3. Meditative Engagement\n\nThe Quran encourages its recitation and contemplation. Hanging verses in one's home can stimulate spiritual reflection, prompting one to think about its meanings and application in daily life.\n\n- **Surah 2:144-148 (Al-Baqarah)** points out that believers should strive towards piety and continually seek a connection with God:\n  > \"So strive towards piety and excel the others: God will bring you all together wheresoever you be.\" (2:148)\n\n### 4. Caution Against Irreverence\n\nWhile displaying Quranic verses can be meaningful, it is also essential to avoid actions that might show disrespect. Reciting verses without proper understanding, or placing them in inappropriate locations (like bathrooms), may not be respectful. There is an emphasis on internalizing and understanding the Quran as more important than physical display.\n\n- **Surah 43:34-36 (Az-Zukhruf)** cautions against the vanity of worldly attachments and the distractions that may prevent genuine belief:\n  > \"But all this would have been nothing but the vanity of this world.\" (43:35)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHanging Quranic verses on walls can be seen as a way to honor the text and remind oneself of divine guidance. However, believers should ensure that their practice reflects a proper respect for the Quran and that it leads to greater understanding and adherence to its teachings. Engaging with the Quran is not solely about its decorum in living spaces but primarily about embracing its guidance and applying it in life. Proper etiquette, respect, and understanding are crucial components of this practice, aligning with the Quran's teachings on reflection, reverence, and devotion."

        "question": "Which is better,    to recite Quran from the Mushaf or from memory?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If one is reciting Quran in situations other than in prayer, then reading from the Mushaf is better, because it is more accurate and helps one to remember better. But if reciting from memory is easier and helps one to concentrate more and have better presence of mind (khushoo’), then one should recite from memory.\nIn prayer, however, it is better to recite from memory, because if a person recites from the Mushaf, he will be doing repeated actions such as holding the Mushaf, putting it down, turning its pages and looking at the letters. By doing so he will miss out on putting his right hand over his left hand on his chest when standing during the prayer, or spreading out his arms during rukoo’ and sujood, if he puts the Mushaf under his arm. Hence we think that it is preferable for a person who is praying to recite from memory rather than from the Mushaf.\nWe see some people when they pray behind the imaam, carrying the Mushaf and following the imaam’s recitation. This is something which should not be done, for the reasons we have referred to above, and because they do not need to do anything except follow the imaam.\nHowever, if the imaam does not have such a good memory, and he says to one of the members of the congregation, “Pray behind me, and follow me (my recitation) in the Mushaf, and if I make a mistake, correct me,” then there is nothing wrong with this.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether it is better to recite the Quran from a Mushaf (written form) or from memory (Hifz) does not have a definitive answer that can apply to all circumstances, as both methods hold unique merits and significances in Islamic practice. Below are some of the points supported by relevant Quranic verses:\n\n### Advantages of Reciting from Memory (Hifz):\n1. **Memory is Praised**: The act of memorizing the Quran is greatly valued in Islam. Allah promises assistance in retaining the Quran in the hearts of believers.\n   - **Surah Al-A'la (87:6-10)**: \"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, unless God wills. He knows what is apparent and what is hidden. We shall take you toward ease.\" \n   - This shows that memorization is both encouraged and facilitated by Allah, as it highlights the spiritual connection to the Quran within one's heart.\n\n2. **Intimacy in Recitation**: Reciting from memory allows for a more intimate connection with the words of Allah, as it becomes a personal act of devotion without the physical text in hand.\n   - **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**: \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily.\"\n   - This suggests individual capability plays a role in recitation, allowing for personal connection through memorization.\n\n### Advantages of Reciting from a Mushaf:\n1. **Clarity and Structure**: Reciting from a Mushaf can help ensure the proper pronunciation (Tajweed) and flow of the text, which is essential in transmitting the message correctly.\n   - **Surah Al-Muddaththir (74:56)**: \"But they will not remember except as Allah wills.\"\n   - This verse reinforces the idea that clarity and understanding are important, and having the text can aid in this.\n\n2. **Focus on Reflection**: Reading from the Mushaf allows for reflection and meditation on the verses in a structured manner, facilitating understanding.\n   - **Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206)**: \"...When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence that you may receive mercy...\"\n   - Listening and reflecting with the Quran in hand allows believers to absorb the teachings effectively.\n\n3. **Engaging with the Text**: Having the Mushaf allows for notations, reminders, and additional study, which may not be as easily accomplished when reciting from memory.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUltimately, the best approach may depend on individual circumstances and intentions. If someone has mastered the Quran through Hifz, they may gain immense spiritual rewards and create a personal bond with the text. On the other hand, reading from a Mushaf can offer a structured and reflective experience. It is important to strive towards both methods as much as possible, combining the beauty of memorization and the significance of reading from the written text. \n\nThus, it's not merely a question of which is better in an absolute sense but rather which method enhances the individual's devotion, understanding, and connection to the Quran in their unique context. Encouragement to engage with the Quran in both ways can lead to a deeper spiritual experience."

        "question": "Rulings of al-Madd\r\n    in Qur’aan recitation",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This symbol \"~\" is used to indicate places where a Madd\n    (elongation) that is longer than the regular elongation is required. It is used in places\n    where the Madd is compulsory (Madd laazim), as in the word \"At-Taammah \", where\n    the elongation is six harakaat or counts. One harakah is equal to the time taken to curl\n    or stretch one finger. This symbol is also used for al-Madd al-Muttasal (where a long\n    vowel is followed by a hamzah in one word), such as \"sawaa'un 'alaynaa \", where\n    the Madd is between four and six harakaat. And it is used for al-Madd al-Munfassal, (where\n    one word ends with a long vowel and is immediately followed by a word that starts with a\n    hamzah), as in the phrase \"fee aadhaaninaa waqar \", where the Madd is four or\n    five harakaat.\n    This symbol does not have any effect on the meanings of the words; it is only used to\n    indicate some kinds of Madds or elongations, as explained above. The Madd which is longer\n    than the regular elongation (two harakaat) does not change the meaning when you do it. But\n    we have to follow the Sunnah of recitation, and the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of\n    Allaah be upon him) used to elongate some vowels in his recitation. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Rulings of Al-Madd in Qur’aan Recitation\n\n**Al-Madd** refers to the elongation of the sound during recitation of the Qur'an, and is an essential aspect of Tajweed (the art of Qur'anic recitation). The rules governing al-Madd are derived from the principles laid out in the Uthmanic codex of the Qur'an and are supported by the practice of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). \n\nThere are different types of **Madd** (elongation) in Qur'an recitation, and each has specific rules regarding how long one should prolong the sound. Here, we will discuss three types of al-Madd: **Madd Lazim**, **Madd Mutasil**, and **Madd Muraqabah**, providing the supporting foundation from Qur'anic verses when applicable.\n\n#### 1. Madd Lazim (Essential Elongation)\n\n**Definition:** Madd Lazim occurs when there is a \"Madd\" letter (ا, و, or ي) that is followed by a consonant which includes a specific type of ending. The elongation here is required (6 counts).\n\n**Example in the Qur'an:** There are no specific verses that define Madd Lazim directly, but its importance is illustrated in all verses where it applies, such as in Surah Al-Muddathir (74:1).\n\n- **Surah Al-Muddathir, Ayah 1**: \"يَا أَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ\" \n  - The consecutive alif in \"المُدَّثِّرُ\" indicates that elongation is required here.\n\n#### 2. Madd Mutasil (Connected Elongation)\n\n**Definition:** Madd Mutasil happens when the vowel causes an elongation because it is followed by another vowel in the same word. The elongation can be 4 to 5 counts.\n\n**Example in the Qur'an:** In several verses, Madd Mutasil is observed, showing Allah's willingness for the believers to heed His message.\n\n- **Surah Al-Mujadila, Ayah 13**: \"أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ تَوَالَوْا قَوْمًا غَضِبَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهُمْ\"\n  - The mention of long vowels \"غَضِبَ اللَّهُ\" gives an excellent setting demonstrating where Madd may apply.\n\n#### 3. Madd Muraqabah (Contemplated Elongation)\n\n**Definition:** This elongation occurs in specific scenarios, often needing an additional pronunciation that emphasizes the meaning, generally 2 to 4 counts.\n\n- **Surah Al-Muzzammil, Ayah 4**: \"أَوْ زِدْ عَلَيْهِ وَرَتِّلِ الْقُرْآنَ تَرْتِيلًا\"\n  - The elongation at \"رَتِّلِ\" gives a soft emphasis on the recitation aspects.\n\n#### General Rulings and Recitation\n\nTo properly observe the rules of al-Madd, one must become well-acquainted with the rules of Tajweed, which encompass the right pronunciation of letters, the elongation rules, and applying these rules to various Qur'anic verses. \n\nThe emphasis placed on recitation in Islam can be found in various verses. For example, God commands recitation with clarity:\n\n- **Surah Al-A'la, Ayah 3**: \"وَذَكِّرْهُم بِأَيَّامِ اللَّهِ\" \n  - This stresses the value of clear recitation and remembrance.\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah, Ayah 118**: \"هذا يوم ينفع الصادقين صدقهم\"\n  - The importance of good deeds ties back to recitation and reflection upon God's words.\n\nIn conclusion, the practice of al-Madd in Qur'anic recitation is vital for maintaining the integrity of the text and ensuring that the meanings conveyed are as intended. Students of Islam often spend years mastering these rules to become proficient in their recitation, contributing to the rich tradition of Qur'anic study and spirituality.\n\nNote: The examples of verses provided are intended to illustrate the context for various forms of Madd. Specific recitation manuals and scholars provide more detailed descriptions and rulings on each type."

        "question": "How Was the Order of the Quran Determined?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Order of verses in one Surah\nThe fact there is scholarly consensus, and many texts stating the order of verses in one Surah, that is very well known. The consensus was reported by many scholars, including Al-Zarkashi in al-Burhan and Abu Ja’far, who said: “The order of the verses in their Surahs came about because this is how it was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and there is no dispute among the Muslims with regard to this matter.”\nThe texts regarding this matter include the following:\n\nThe report narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai, Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim from Ibn `Abbas, who said: “I said to ‘Uthman, ‘What made you put al-Anfal which is one of the Mathani, next to Bara-ah [al-Tawbah], which is one of the Mi’in? Why did you not put the line Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim in between them when you put it at the beginning of the rest of al-Sab’ al-Tiwal [the long seven Surahs]?” ‘Uthman said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to receive revelation of Surahs with many verses. When they were revealed, he would call his scribes and tell them, ‘Put these verses in the Surah where such-and-such is mentioned.’ Al-Anfal was one of the first Surahs to be revealed in Madinah, and Bara-ah (al-Tawbah) was one of the last parts of the Quran to be revealed. Its stories were similar to the stories mentioned in al-Anfal, so it was thought that it was part of it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken [i.e., died] without explaining whether it was indeed part of it, so they were put next to one another, and the line Bismillahir Rahman ir’Rahim was not written between them, and it [al-Tawbah] was put among the Sab’ al-Tiwal [seven long Surahs].” (Al-Hakim said: its isnad is sahih, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Al-Mustadrak, 2/330)\nAhmad narrated in al-Musnad (4/218) with a hasan isnad from ‘Uthman ibn Abi’l-‘As that he said: “I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he fixed his gaze on something, then lowered his gaze until he was almost looking at the ground, then he gazed at something. He said, ‘Jibril (peace be upon him) came to me and told me to put this verse in this place in this Surah: “Verily, Allâh enjoins Al-‘Adl (i.e. justice and worshipping none but Allâh Alone Islâmic Monotheism) and Al-Ihsân [i.e. to be patient in performing your duties to Allâh, totally for Allâh’s sake and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet in a perfect manner], and giving (help) to kith and kin (i.e. all that Allâh has ordered you to give them, e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of help), and forbids Al-Fahshâ (i.e. all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false witness, to kill a life without right), and Al-Munkar (i.e. all that is prohibited by Islâmic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every kind of evil deeds), and Al-Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression). He admonishes you, that you may take heed.” [al-Nahl 16:90 – interpretation of the meaning].’”\nAl-Bukhari narrated in al-Sahih (no. 4536) that Ibn Abi Malikah said: “Ibn al-Zubayr said: ‘I said to ‘Uthman, “This verse that is in al-Baqarah (interpretation of the meaning), ‘And those of you who die and leave wives behind them … And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year’s maintenance and residence without turning them out’ [al-Baqarah 2:234-240] has been abrogated by the other, so why are you writing it down?” He said, “Leave it as it is, my nephew, I will not change anything from its place.”’”\nMuslim narrated (no. 1617) that ‘Umar said: “I did not ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about anything more than I asked him about al-Kalalah [those who die leaving neither ascendants nor descendents as heirs], until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said, “Is not ayat al-sayf at the end of Surat al-Nisa enough for you?”\nThere are also the hadiths about the verses at the end of Surat al-Baqarah.\nMuslim narrated (no. 809) from Abu al-Darda that whoever memorizes the first ten verses of Surat al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjal; according to another version, whoever recites the last ten verses will be protected.\n\nThe Prophet’s recitation of various Surahs in the presence of his Companions indicates that the order of their verses is something that was instituted and commanded by him, and that the Companions did not put the verses in a different order from that in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite them. The reports to that effect reach the level of Mutawatir.\nAl-Qadi Abu Bakr said in al-Intisar: \n“The order of the verses is something that is obligatory and binding. Jibril used to say (to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)), ‘Put such and such an verse in such and such a place.’”\nHe also said:\n “What we think is that all of the Quran which Allah revealed and commanded that it should be written down, and which was not abrogated after being revealed, is that which is contained between the covers of the Mus-haf of ‘Uthman, and that there is nothing lacking or added to it. Its order is the same as that commanded by Allah, may He be exalted, and instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Nobody has moved any verse backwards or forwards. The Ummah learned from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the order of the verses of each Surah properly, just as they learned from him the correct pronunciation and recitation.”\nAl-Baghawi said in Sharh al-Sunnah: \n“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to instruct his Companions and teach them what was revealed to him of the Quran in the order in which it appears in our Mus-hafs now, the order which Jibril taught him. When each verse was revealed, Jibril would tell him, this verse is to be written after such and such a verse in Surah such and such. Thus it is clear that the efforts of the Companions were limited solely to gathering the Quran in one place, not to arranging its order. The Quran is written on al-Lawh al-Mahfuz in this order, then Allah sent it down in its entirety to the first heaven, whence it was revealed in stages as it was needed, and the order in which it was revealed is not the order in which it is recited.”\nOrder of Surahs in the Quran\nWith regard to the order of Surahs, was this also instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or was this the ijtihad of the Companions? With regard to this question, there were differences among the scholars. The majority of scholars, including Malik and al-Qadi Abu Bakr, according to one of his two opinions, favoured the second opinion.\nIbn Faris said: \n“There were two aspects to the compilation of the Quran. One was putting the Surahs in a certain order, such as putting al-Sab’ al-Tiwal (the seven long Surahs) first, and following them with the Mi’in, which is what the Companions did. The second aspect is the compilation of the verses within the Surahs. This was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who recited them as he was told to by Jibreel, on the command of his Lord. On this basis, the Salaf differed as to the order in which the Surahs should appear. Some of them put them in order of revelation, which was the mus-haf of ‘Ali, which started with Iqra (al-‘Alaq), then al-Muddaththir, then Nun (al-Qalam), then al-Muzzammil, and so on. The Mus-haf of Ibn Mas’ud started with al-Baqarah, then al-Nisa, then Al ‘Imran, with other major differences. The Mus-haf of Ubayy was similar.”\nAl-Karmani said in al-Burhan: the order of the Surahs as it is now is the same as that in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz which is with Allah. This is the order in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to review the Surahs of the Quran he had received so far with Jibril each year. In the year in which he died, he reviewed it with him twice, and the last verses to be revealed were (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah…’ [al-Baqarah 2:281]. Jibril commanded the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to put this between the verses dealing with riba and those dealing with loans.”\nAl-Zarkashi said in al-Burhan: “The difference between the two views is one of wording. Those who support the second view say that it was taught to them so that they could learn the reasons of Revelation and the sequence of the words. Hence Malik said that they compiled the Quran according to what they had heard from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as well as saying that the order of the Surahs was the product of their ijtihad. He said that the dispute boils down to one question which is: was this a verbal instruction of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or were they merely referring to what he used to do, which would give them room for ijtihad.”\nAl-Bayhaqi said in al-Madkhil: “At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Surahs and verses of the Quran were in this order, except for al-Anfal and Bara-ah (al-Tawbah), as we see from the hadith of ‘Uthman referred to above.”\nIbn ‘Atiyah said: “The order of many of the Surahs was known during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as the seven long Surahs, those that begin with Ha’-Mim, and al-Mufassal. With regard to the others, it may be the case that it was left for the Ummah to determine their order after he died.”\nAbu Ja’far said: “The reports support most of what Ibn ‘Atiyah said, and a little is left which is open to debate, such as the hadith, ‘Recite the two shining ones, al-Baqarah and Al ‘Imran.’” (Reported by Muslim, no. 804)\nAl-Bukhari narrated (no. 4739) that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Bani Israil (al-Isra), al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta-Ha and al-Anbiya, these are among the earliest and most beautiful Surahs and they are my treasures,” (meaning, these are among the earliest I recited).\nAbu Ja’far al-Nahhas al-Mukhtar said that the Surahs were compiled in this order from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) because of the hadith of Wathilah, “In place of the Tawrat I was given the seven long Surahs.” He said: “This hadith indicates that the order of the Quran was taken from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nIbn Hajar said, “the fact that the Surahs, or most of them, are in a given order does not contradict the idea that this was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). What proves that this was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the report narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud from Aws ibn Hudhayfah, who said: ‘We asked the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the morning, “How did you write down the Quran in chapters?” They said, “We wrote it down in chapters of six Surahs, five Surahs, seven Surahs, nine Surahs, eleven Surahs and thirteen Surahs, and the chapter of al-Mufassal, from Qaf until the end. This indicates that the order of the Surahs – as it appears in the Mus-haf now – existed at the time of the Messenger of Allah, or it is possible that what was known in order at that time was Hizb al-Mufassal specifically, which is not the case with the rest.”\n(See al-Itqan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran by al-Suyuti, 1/62-65)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The order of the Quran was determined through a process that involved various stages of revelation, as well as guidelines provided by Allah. The primary basis of the order of the Quran can be understood by examining several key aspects found within its verses.\n\n1. **Gradual Revelation**: One of the most significant factors in the order of the Quran is that it was revealed gradually over a period of approximately 23 years. This is highlighted in Surah Al-Furqan (The Criterion), where Allah addresses the skepticism of the disbelievers regarding the timing of the revelation. The verse states:\n   - “And those who disbelieve say, ‘Why was the Qur'an not revealed to him all at once?’ Thus [We have revealed it] that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have spaced it distinctly.” (Surah Al-Furqan, 25:32)\n\n2. **Preservation of Meaning and Context**: The way the revelations were arranged over time served to maintain the context and meaning relevant to the circumstances faced by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his followers. In Surah Al-Furqan, there's an emphasis that the Quran is a guide, offering responses and wisdom pertinent to the issues at hand. This process reflects the connectedness and deep understanding required to convey the message effectively.\n\n3. **Divine Wisdom in Ordering the Verses**: The arrangement of the Quran into surahs (chapters) and ayahs (verses) reflects a divine wisdom that is beyond mere chronological order. For example, Allah mentions in Surah Ash-Shuraa (The Consultation):\n   - “And We have laid down for you the same system of religion which We enjoined upon Noah and that which We have inspired in you, and that which We enjoined upon Abraham, Moses, and Jesus... so that you should maintain the religion and not be divided therein.” (Surah Ash-Shuraa, 42:13)\n\n4. **Role of the Prophet Muhammad**: The Prophet Muhammad played a fundamental role in conveying the revelations, and it is indicated in the Quran that he was guided on how to recite and convey these verses effectively. For instance, in Surah Al-A'la (The Most High), it is stated:\n   - “We shall make you recite, [O Muhammad], and you will not forget.” (Surah Al-A'la, 87:6)\n\n5. **Final Compilation**: After the death of the Prophet Muhammad, the Quran was compiled into a single book format during the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Uthman. This official compilation followed the existing practices and arrangements as established by the Prophet during his lifetime, which were already in place as divine guidance. The adherent tradition and oral recitation played a critical role in ensuring the order was preserved.\n\n6. **Completeness and Universality**: In the Quran, Allah assures the completeness of the message, inviting believers and disbelievers to examine the text critically. In Surah Al-Furqan, there's an indication that the Quran serves as a definitive guide for humanity:\n   - “And it is He who has sent down to you the Book; in it are verses that are precise [forming the foundation of the Book] and others ambiguous.” (Surah Al-Imran, 3:7)\n\nIn conclusion, the order of the Quran was not arbitrary; it was methodically established with divine guidance over years of revelation, contextually responsive arrangements, and final compilation to preserve its sanctity and message. The Quran's structure serves both functional and purposeful roles, reflecting the wisdom of its divine origin."

        "question": "Verses of Sujud al-Tilawah in the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Sujud in the Quran\nThere are fifteen places in the Quran where we should perform sajdat al-tilawah (prostration of recitation) when reciting them. \n‘Amr ibn al-’As narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited to him fifteen verses in the Quran where one should prostrate, three of which are in al-Mufassal and two in Surat al-Hajj. It was reported by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, al-Hakim and al-Daraqutni, and classed as hasan by al-Mundhiri and al-Nawawi. \nVerses of sujud al-tilawah\nThe fifteen verses of sujud al-tilawah are:\n\nSurely those who are with your Lord (angels) are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him, but they glorify His Praise and prostrate before Him. [al-A'raf 7:206]\nAnd unto Allah (Alone) falls in prostration whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the mornings and in the afternoons. [al-Ra’d 13:15]\nAnd to Allah prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the live moving creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e., they worship their Lord (Allah) with humility]. [al-Nahl 16:49]\nSay (O Muhammad): Believe in it (the Quran) or do not believe (in it). Verily! Those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in humble prostration. [al-Isra 17:107-109]\nWhen the Verses of the Most Beneficent (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping. [Maryam 19:58]\nSee you not that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and al-dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified. And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily! Allah does what He wills. [al-Hajj 22:18]\nO you who believe! Bow down, and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord and do good that you may be successful. [al-Hajj 22:77]\nAnd when it is said to them: Prostrate to the Most Beneficent (Allah)! They say, And what is the Most Beneficent? Shall we fall down in prostration to that which you (O Muhammad) command us? And it increases in them only aversion. [al-Furqan 25:60]\n[As Shaytan has barred them from Allah's Way] so that they do not worship (prostrate before) Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal. [al-Naml 27:25, 26]\nOnly those believe in Our ayat (verses, signs, etc.) who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate, and glorify the Praises of their Lord, and they are not proud. [al-Sajdah 32:15]\nAnd Dawud guessed that We had tried him and he sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allah) in repentance. [Sad 38:24]\nAnd from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate to Him Who created them, if you (really) worship Him. [Fussilat 41:37, 38]\nSo fall down in prostration to Allah, and worship Him (Alone). [al-Najm 53:62]\nAnd when the Quran is recited to them, they fall not prostrate. [al-Inshiqaq 84:21]\nFall prostrate and draw near to Allah! [al-’Alaq 96:19] (See Fiqh al-Sunnah by Sheikh Sayyid Sabiq, 186-188)\n\nScholarly views of the narration of ‘Amr ibn Al-’As about sujud al-tilawah\nAl-Albani said, in Tamam al-Minnah (296):\nOn the contrary, the hadith is not hasan, because it includes two majhul [unknown] narrators. Al-Hafiz said in al-Talkhis, after quoting the opinion of al-Mundhiri and al-Nawawi that it is hasan: ‘Abd al-Haqq and Ibn Qattan classed it as da’if [weak]. It includes ‘Abd-Allah ibn Munayn, who is majhul, and the one who narrated from him is al-Harith ibn Sa’id al-Atqi, who is also unknown. Ibn Makula said: He did not narrate any hadith apart from this one.”\nHence al-Tahawi was of the opinion that there is no second sajdah in Surat al-Hajj, towards the end of the surah. This is also the opinion of Ibn Hazm who said in al-Muhalla:\n“Because it is not narrated in any sahih report that this was the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there is no scholarly consensus to this effect. But it was reported with a sahih isnad that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, his son ‘Abd-Allah and Abu Darda performed sajdah in (the second verse quoted from Surat al-Hajj).”\nThen Ibn Hazm discussed whether the sajdahs for the other verses quoted are prescribed in Islam. He mentioned that the scholars are agreed upon the first ten, that performing sujud when reciting these verses is prescribed.\n Al-Tahawi also reported this consensus in Sharh al-Ma’ani (1/211), but he said that the sajdah in Surat Fussilat was prescribed, instead of the sajdah in Surat Sad. \nBoth scholars narrated ahadith with sahih isnads from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the sajdahs in Sad, al-Najm, al-Inshiqaq and al-’Alaq. These last three are from the Mufassal, which is referred to in the hadith of ‘Amr mentioned above.\nIn conclusion, even though the isnad of the hadith is weak, it is supported by the consensus of the ummah which supports most of it, and by sahih ahadith which support the rest of it, except for the second sajdah in Suat al-Hajj, for which there is no evidence in the Sunnah or in the consensus of the scholars. But some of the Sahabah used to prostrate when reciting it, which could be taken as evidence, especially since no one is known to have disputed with them in this regard.\nTo sum up, the prostration of recitation should be performed when reciting the fifteen verses quoted above. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the Quran, there are several verses that call for *Sujud al-Tilawah*, or prostration of recitation, which is a form of worship performed when certain verses are recited. Below are the verses that warrant the prostration along with their references.\n\n### Verses of Sujud al-Tilawah\n\n1. **Surah Al-A'raf (7:206)**  \n   \"Indeed, those who are near your Lord are not prevented by pride from His worship; they prostrate to Him and worship Him.\"  \n   **Reference:** Al-A'raf, Ayah 206.\n\n2. **Surah Ar-Ra'd (13:15)**  \n   \"And to Allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or by compulsion, and their shadows [as well] at dawn and dusk.\"  \n   **Reference:** Ar-Ra'd, Ayah 15.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Nahl (16:26)**  \n   \"And those who have taken [for protectors] other than Him – Allah will bring them forth to judgment, and they will find judgment from Him impossible.\"  \n   **Reference:** Al-Nahl, Ayah 26.\n\n4. **Surah Al-Isra (17:109)**  \n   \"And they fell upon their faces weeping, and it increased them in humility.\"  \n   **Reference:** Al-Isra, Ayah 109.\n\n5. **Surah Maryam (19:58)**  \n   \"Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy and it is they who are the rightly guided.\"  \n   **Reference:** Maryam, Ayah 58.\n\n6. **Surah Al-Hajj (22:18)**  \n   \"Do you not see that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the birds with wings spread [in flight]? Each of them has known his prayer and his glorification, and Allah is All-Aware of what they do.\"  \n   **Reference:** Al-Hajj, Ayah 18.\n\n7. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:60)**  \n   \"And when it is said to them, 'Prostrate to the Most Merciful,' they say, 'And what is the Most Merciful? Should we prostrate to that which you order us?' And it increases them in aversion.\"  \n   **Reference:** Al-Furqan, Ayah 60.\n\n8. **Surah Al-Sajdah (32:15)**  \n   \"Only they believe in Our verses who, when they are reminded by them, fall down in prostration and exalt the praises of their Lord, and they are not arrogant.\"  \n   **Reference:** Al-Sajdah, Ayah 15.\n\n9. **Surah Sad (38:24)**  \n   \"David was indeed mindful of Allah; he could not stop mentioning Him. He was indeed devoted and favors.\"\n   **Reference:** Sad, Ayah 24.\n\n10. **Surah Fussilat (41:38)**  \n    \"But if they turn away – then say, 'I have warned you of a blast (of punishment) like the blast of the Day of Judgment. When the hearts are at the throats, choking (with anguish).'\"  \n    **Reference:** Fussilat, Ayah 38.\n\n11. **Surah Al-Najm (53:62)**  \n    \"So prostrate to Allah and worship [Him].\"  \n    **Reference:** Al-Najm, Ayah 62.\n\n12. **Surah Inshiqaq (84:21)**  \n    \"And when the Qur'an is recited to them, they do not prostrate.\"  \n    **Reference:** Al-Inshiqaq, Ayah 21. \n\nThese verses exemplify the act of worship through prostration at specific moments of recitation in the Quran. It highlights the importance of humility, reverence, and acknowledgment of God's grandeur as an integral part of Islamic faith and practice.\n\nIn Islamic tradition, prostrating at these verses serves to remind believers of their submission to God and is seen as a moment of spiritual elevation and connection to the divine."

        "question": "What is the ruling    on hanging up aayaat for protection?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The ruling on placing the Mus-haf (copy of the Quran) in cars to ward off the evil eye and for protection from danger is a bidah. The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) never carried the Mus-haf to ward off danger or the evil eye. If it is bidah, then we should remember that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Every bidah is a going-astray and every going-astray will lead to Hell.\n(Telephone conversation with Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen) (al-Bida wal-Muhdathaat wa maa laa aslun lahu, p. 259).\nShaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked the following question: Some people hang up aayaat of the Quran and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the rooms of their homes or in restaurants or offices. In some hospitals and doctors offices they hang the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me [al-Shuara 26:80], and so on. Is this considered to be the use of amulets which is forbidden in shareeah, knowing that the intention behind it is to seek blessings and ward off the shayaateen, or to remind the forgetful and warn the negligent? Is it like using amulets to put the Mus-haf in one's car in order to seek blessings?\nHis Eminence replied as follows:\nIf the intention is as described, to remind people and teach them something beneficial, then there is no harm in that. But if they believe that it is a protection against the shayaateen or jinn, then I know of no basis for this. By the same token, there is no basis for putting the Mus-haf in one's car to protect it, and doing so is not allowed, but if a person puts it in his car so that he can read it sometimes or so that some of his passengers can read it, then this is good and there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the act of hanging up aayaat (verses from the Quran) for protection—commonly referred to as talismans or amulets—has been a subject of differing opinions among scholars and schools of thought. The general consensus is that there is no explicit prohibition in the Quran or Hadith against using these aayaat for protection, provided it does not lead to shirk (associating partners with Allah) or other forms of inappropriate belief.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n1. **Use of Quranic Verses**: The Quran emphasizes that God is the ultimate protector and that believers should seek His aid through sincere prayer and reliance on Him. For example, in Surah Al-Baqarah, Allah says:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255**: *\"Allah! There is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. Neither drowsiness nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth...\"*\n   This verse demonstrates God's power and sovereignty, reminding believers that true protection comes from Him.\n\n2. **Seeking Protection through Prayer**: The Quran encourages the use of prayer (dua) to seek protection from harm. \n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:89**: *\"God does not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He imposes blame upon you for what your hearts have earned. And Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing.\"*\n   This verse signifies the importance of intention and sincerity in seeking God's protection.\n\n3. **Respecting the Boundaries of Faith**: Scholars warn against over-reliance on physical objects—like amulets—without faith in Allah. This aligns with the Hadith that emphasizes tawheed (monotheism):\n   - In Sahih Muslim, it is reported that the Prophets prohibited the use of amulets or charms that are not from Quranic verses or authentic prayers. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said: *\"Whoever wears an amulet has committed shirk.\"* (Sunan Abi Dawood).\n\n4. **Acceptable Use of Quranic Texts**: Many scholars acknowledge that writing or hanging verses of the Quran, especially those known to specifically invoke protection (like Ayat al-Kursi, Surah Al-Falaq and Surah Al-Nas), can be permissible, as they are recitations that call upon Allah for protection:\n   - **Surah Al-Falaq 113:1-5**: *\"Say, 'I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak from the evil of that which He created and from the evil of darkness when it settles and from the evil of the blowers in knots and from the evil of an envier when he envies.'\"*\n   - **Surah Al-Nas 114:1-6**: *\"Say, 'I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind, the Sovereign of mankind. The God of mankind. From the evil of the retreating whisperer - who whispers [evil] in the breasts of mankind - of jinn and mankind.'\"*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ruling on hanging up aayaat for protection is nuanced. While using Quranic verses for protection is generally accepted, it should be done with the understanding and intention that the power and protection come from Allah alone. It's crucial to maintain faith and avoid any practices that may slip into shirk. Seeking knowledge from qualified scholars and adhering to the principles of tawheed is essential for ensuring that any such practices align with Islamic teachings."

But if this is done for\n    the purpose of teaching, we hope that there is nothing wrong with it. If what is meant is\n    that the people gather to recite Qur’aan in order to memorize and learn it, and each\n    one recites whilst the others listen, or each one reads to himself – not in unison\n    with the others – then this is permissible because it was reported that the Messenger\n    of Allaah \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No group of people\n    gathers in one of the houses of Allaah to recite the Book of Allaah and study it together,\n    but tranquillity descends upon them, the angels surround them, mercy comes down upon them,\n    and Allaah mentions them to those who are with Him.” (Reported by Muslim).",

The ruling can vary among different Islamic schools of thought, but generally, it is encouraged, particularly in certain contexts like communal prayers and gatherings. \n\n### Supporting Views and Citations\n\n1. **Encouragement of Recitation**: \n   In Surah Al-Qiyamah (Surah 75), Allah states: \n   > \"Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility.\"  \n   > (Qur'an 75:17-18)  \n   This verse emphasizes that the recitation and the collection of the Qur'an is a divine responsibility, signifying its importance in the lives of believers.\n\n2. **Collective Recitation in Prayer**:\n   Collective recitation of the Qur'an is often seen as part of communal worship.\n   In Surah Al-Mujadila (Surah 58), it states:\n   > \"O you who believe, when you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room; God will give you more room to spread.\"  \n   > (Qur'an 58:11)  \n   This encourages the act of gathering together. Although it doesn’t specifically mention Qur'anic recitation, the context of community and coming together can be extended to collective worship activities.\n\n3. **Listening and Reflecting**:\n   In Surah Al-A'raf (Surah 7), Allah commands:\n   > \"When the Qur'an is recited listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.\"  \n   > (Qur'an 7:204)  \n   This can indicate that the act of listening to the Qur'an being recited, even collectively, is an important and rewarding practice.\n\n4. **Respectful Approach to Recitation**:\n   Surah Al-Muzzammil (Surah 73) gives guidelines on the recitation approach: \n   > \"Recite the Qur'an slowly and distinctly.\"  \n   > (Qur'an 73:4)  \n   This signifies the importance of careful and respectful recitation, which can be practiced collectively without causing any disruption or chaos.\n\n5. **Community and Support**:\n   In Surah Al-Furqan (Surah 25), the phrase:\n   > \"Tell them: 'I do not ask any recompense of you for this other than (urging) whoever likes may take the way to his Lord.'\"  \n   > (Qur'an 25:57)  \n   Highlights that the intent behind sharing the Qur'an can foster a supportive and communal atmosphere where believers can uplift each other.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while there are no explicit verses in the Qur'an that directly address the ruling on collective recitation, the foundational principles of community, worship, and the importance of the Qur'an suggest that it is highly encouraged in Islam. Collective recitation of the Qur'an in communal settings such as mosques, Islamic gatherings, or during prayers is a practice that fosters unity, reflection, and devotion among Muslims. This aligns with various scholarly interpretations and practices within the Islamic tradition."

        "question": "Will a person be\r\n    rewarded for reading Qur’aan even if he does not know the meaning of what he reads?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Holy Qur’aan is blessed, as Allaah says\n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n“(This is) a Book (the Qur’aan) which We have sent down to\n    you, full of blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding\n    may remember.”[Saad 38:29]\nA man will be rewarded for reading it whether he understands its\n    meanings or not… But the believer should not read the Qur’aan without\n    understanding at the time when he is responsible for his actions. If a person wants to\n    learn medicine, for example, and studies medical books, he cannot learn anything from them\n    unless he understands what they mean and it is explained to him. Indeed, he would very\n    keen to understand what they say so that he can put it into practice. So how about the\n    Book of Allaah which is healing for what is in people’s hearts and exhortation for\n    all people? What about a person who reads it and does not understand or ponder its\n    meanings? The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) would not go beyond ten aayaat\n    until they had learnt them and understood the knowledge therein and how to act upon it. A\n    person will be rewarded for reading Qur’aan whether or not he understands it, but he\n    should try his best to find out what it means and to seek this knowledge from scholars who\n    can be trusted. If he cannot easily find a scholar from whom he can learn, he should refer\n    to reliable books of Tafseer such as Tafseer Ibn Jareer, Tafseer Ibn Katheer, and others.\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, a person will be rewarded for reading the Qur'an, even if they do not know the meaning of what they read. The act of reciting the Qur'an is valued in Islam, regardless of one's understanding of its interpretation or meaning. \n\n### Supporting Evidence from the Qur'an:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20)**:\n   - This verse emphasizes that Allah understands the limitations of individuals and encourages them to recite what is easy for them. It states: \n     > \"So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily. He knows some among you will be sick, and some will be travelling over the earth in search of the bounty of God, and some fighting in the way of God. So read as much from it as you can easily, and be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and lend a goodly loan to God. And what you send for yourself of the good, you will find it with God better and greater in reward. So ask for God's forgiveness. Indeed God is forgiving and kind.\"\n   \n   This shows that God does not overburden His followers. The encouragement to recite the Qur'an is a means to draw closer to Him, and the reward is based on the effort, not necessarily on understanding.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Kahf (18:88)**:\n   - This verse indicates that those who believe and perform righteous deeds will have an excellent reward. It states: \n     > \"But he who believes and does the right will have an excellent reward, and we shall make things easy for him.\"\n   \n   While the context involves good deeds, reading the Qur'an is indeed considered a righteous deed, thereby qualifying for reward.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Qasas (28:80)**:\n   - In this surah, Allah encourages His believers that those who believe and perform good actions have better rewards awaiting them. \n     > \"Indeed God's guerdon is better for those who believe and do the right.\"\n   \n   This highlights the emphasis on belief and good actions, with recitation of the Qur'an being a significant form of worship.\n\n4. **Surah Al-Qalam (68:3-4)**:\n   - These verses affirm the high status of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and imply that there is an infinite reward for those who are engaged in reading the Qur'an and following its teachings, which can be extended to believers who engage in recitation:\n     > \"There is surely reward unending for you, For you are verily born of sublime nature.\"\n   \n   This shows the significance of one's sincere efforts in worship and the ensuing rewards.\n\n### Conclusion:\nReciting the Qur'an is an act of devotion that brings reward whether or not one understands the meaning. The emphasis is on the effort put into the act of recitation as a means of connecting with Allah. Therefore, individuals are encouraged to recite the Qur'an to the best of their ability, knowing that their intentions and efforts are recognized and rewarded by Allah."

        "question": "Listening to Quran on car stereo speakers that are by the feet of the passengers",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If the speakers are as you describe, under the feet and shoes of passengers, then tapes of Quran should not be played, because the fact that Quran is being heard from beneath people’s feet or shoes is undoubtedly a kind of disrespect towards the Quran. If a person really must listen to Quran, let him lift the speakers up so that they are not at the same level as people’s feet.",
        "predicted_answer": "Listening to the Quran in a car setting involves considering both the manner in which the Quran is played and the environment in which it is consumed. According to Islamic teachings, the recitation or listening to the Quran is an act of worship and should be approached with respect and reverence.\n\n### Importance of Listening to the Quran\n1. **Respect and Attention**: Surah Al-A'raf emphasizes the need to listen silently when the Quran is recited. It states:\n   > \"When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.\" (Surah Al-A'raf, 7:204)\n\n   This indicates the necessity of attentiveness and respect when engaging with the Quran. While listening in a car may not afford the same quiet atmosphere as in a mosque or home, it is still important to pay attention to the recitation as best as one can under the circumstances.\n\n2. **Environment of Listening**: The environment can play a role in how the Quran is received. If the sound is loud and distracting to the listeners or those around, it might minimize its impact. Surah Al-Isra discusses how people may turn away from the message of the Quran:\n   > “So when you invoke your Lord alone in the Qur'an, they turn their backs and walk away.” (Surah Al-Isra, 17:46)\n\n   This verse suggests that the manner of engagement with the Quran can influence its reception. If the listening environment is filled with noise and distractions, it may lead to disinterest or misunderstanding, which contradicts the spirit of reflection promoted in these verses.\n\n### Recommendations for Listening in a Car:\n- **Volume Control**: The volume should be set at a level where it can be heard clearly without causing discomfort to anyone in the car. Striking a balance is key. The Quran's beauty often lies in its subtlety.\n  \n- **Respect During Recitation**: All passengers should be encouraged to stay respectful and minimize conversation during the recitation, following the guidelines derived from Surah Al-A'raf.\n\n- **Incorporating Reflection**: After listening to a passage, discussing its meaning can enrich the experience. Engagement with the content of the Quran leads to a deeper understanding and appreciation of its message.\n\n- **Intent of Walking Away**: Surah Al-Isra warns against those who neglect or dismiss the message:\n   > “We put covers over their hearts and deafness in their ears…” (Surah Al-Isra, 17:46)\n\n   Thus, ensuring that passengers maintain an attitude of respect and willingness to engage with the message can enhance the experience.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, while playing the Quran in a car—with speakers located near the feet of passengers—might not inherently diminish its sanctity, considerations of volume, attentiveness, and reverence towards its recitation must be prioritized. Both the environment and the attitude of the listeners greatly determine the level of respect afforded to the Quran and the potential impact its message can have. It is suggested to maintain an atmosphere conducive to contemplation and reverence for the Quran."

        "question": "Entering the    bathroom with a necklace with Quranic aayaat",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permitted to enter the bathroom with anything that has aayat from the Quran on it, because this could lead to disrespect of the Word of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Therefore, your wife should remove this necklace before entering the bathroom. Our advice is that women should not wear any jewellery with aayaat or duaas on it, because there are a number of reservations about this practice, of which wearing it when entering the bathroom is just one.",
        "predicted_answer": "Entering a bathroom while wearing a necklace with Quranic verses raises concerns primarily about respect for the Quran and the rules of cleanliness that Islam prescribes. \n\n### Respect for the Quran\n\nIslam places great emphasis on the respect of Quranic verses. They are regarded as sacred words of God, and believers are encouraged to treat them accordingly. This sentiment is supported by verses in the Quran such as:\n\n1. **Surah 56 (Al-Waqi'a), Ayah 77-80**:  \n   \"Indeed, it is a noble Quran, In a well-protected Book. None touch it except the purified.\"  \n   (Surah Al-Waqi'a, 56:77-79).\n\nThese verses urge that only individuals who are in a state of purity should come into contact with the Quran, which suggests that carrying Quranic verses into unclean places such as a bathroom might not be appropriate.\n\n### Cleanliness and Conduct\n\nIslam strongly advocates for cleanliness. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised Muslims on various matters regarding personal hygiene, especially before prayer. For instance:\n\n2. **Surah 5 (Al-Ma'idah), Ayah 6**:  \n   \"O believers, when you stand up for prayer, wash your faces and hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles.\"  \n   (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:6).\n\nThis verse emphasizes the requirement for physical purity before engaging in acts of worship, creating a precedent that implies one should maintain cleanliness in all aspects of life, including when using the bathroom.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the importance of both respect for the Quran and cleanliness as outlined in the Quran and the Sunnah (traditions of the Prophet), it is advisable to avoid wearing a necklace inscribed with Quranic verses while entering a bathroom. This action would align with the broader Islamic values of honoring the sacred text and maintaining personal purity. \n\nIn conclusion, entering a bathroom with Quranic verses on a necklace is generally discouraged due to the necessity of purification and respect for the sacred, as emphasized in **Surah Al-Waqi'a** (56:77-79) and the significance of cleanliness stated in **Surah Al-Ma'idah** (5:6)."

        "question": "The TenCommandments",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Thank you for your question, which shows an interest in the Quran. We are happy to answer your question here.\nThere are in the Quran certain aayaat (verses) which some scholars call the verses of the Ten Commandments, because they include ten important commandments given by Allaah to mankind. These aayaat are to be found in two passages of the Quran.\nThe first is in Soorat al-Anaam, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\nSay: Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty We provide sustenance for you and for them; come not near to al-fawaahish (shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse, etc.), whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand.\nAnd come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he (or she) attains the age of full strength; and give full measure and full weight with justice. We burden not any person, but that which he can bear. And whenever you give your word (i.e., judge between men or give evidence, etc.), say the truth even if a near relative is concerned, and fulfil the Covenant of Allaah. This He commands you, that you may remember.\nAnd, verily, this (i.e., Allaah's commandments mentioned in the above two verses) is my Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become al-muttaqoon (the pious). [al-Anaam 6:151-153]\nThe second passage occurs in Soorat al-Israa, and may be considered as a commentary on the passage quoted above. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\nAnd your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them, but address them in terms of honour.\nAnd lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was small.\nYour Lord knows best what is in your inner-selves. If you are righteous, then, verily, He is ever Most-Forgiving to those who turn unto Him again and again in obedience, and in repentance.\nAnd give to the kindred his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift.\nVerily, spendthrifts are brothers of the shayaateen (devils), and the Shaytaan (Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord.\nAnd if you turn away from them (kindred, poor, wayfarers, etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but if you have no money at the time they ask you for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then, speak unto them a soft kind word (i.e., Allaah will give to me and I will give to you).\nAnd let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, not stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.\nTruly, your Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Verily, He is Ever All-Knower, All-Seer of His slaves.\nAnd kill not your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely the killing of them is a great sin.\nAnd come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).\nAnd do not kill anyone which Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause. And whoever is killed (intentionally with hostility and oppression and not by mistake), We have given his heir the authority [to demand qisaas Law of Equality in punishment or to forgive, or to take Diya (blood money)]. But let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life (i.e., he should not kill except the killer only). Verily, he is helped (by the Islamic law).\nAnd come not near to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength. And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily! The covenant will be questioned about.\nAnd give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good (advantageous) and better in the end.\nAnd follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not or witness not, etc.) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those you will be questioned by Allaah.\nAnd walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth, nor can you attain a stature like that of the mountains in height.\nAll the bad aspects of these (the above mentioned things) are hateful to your Lord.\nThis is part of al-hikmah (wisdom, good manners and high character, etc.) which your Lord has inspired to you (O Muhammad). And set not up with Allaah any other ilaah (god) lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected (from Allaahs mercy). [al-Israa 17:23-39]\nPerhaps after enjoying reading these verses, you will have a better idea of the Quraan than before, and this will be the beginning of a fundamental change in your life, the start of your way to Islam. May Allaah guide and help you always. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.\n.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Ten Commandments, known in Islamic tradition as part of the guidance provided to the followers of previous scriptures, are understood to have a basis in the teachings revealed to Prophet Moses (Musa) in the Torah. While the Qur'an does not present them in a specific list as in the Judeo-Christian tradition, the concepts reflected in the Ten Commandments are echoed throughout the Qur'an. \n\n**1. Belief in One God**: The first commandment emphasizes the belief in one God, which aligns with the Islamic principle of Tawhid (the Oneness of God). \n   - **Qur'an Reference**: “Say, He is Allah, [who is] One.” (Surah Al-Ikhlas 112:1)\n\n**2. Prohibition of Idolatry**: The commandment forbidding the worship of idols is reiterated in the Qur’an.\n   - **Qur'an Reference**: “And your god is one God. There is no deity [worthy of worship] except Him, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.” (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:163)\n\n**3. Honoring Parents**: The importance of treating parents with respect and kindness is emphasized throughout the Qur'an.\n   - **Qur'an Reference**: “And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents.” (Surah Al-Ankabut 29:8)\n\n**4. Prohibition of Murder**: Similar to the commandments against murder, the Qur'an stresses the sanctity of life.\n   - **Qur'an Reference**: “And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right.” (Surah Al-Isra 17:33)\n\n**5. Prohibition of Adultery**: The commandment against adultery is also clearly outlined in the Qur'an. \n   - **Qur'an Reference**: “And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that has certainly committed an offense.” (Surah Al-Isra 17:32)\n\n**6. Prohibition of Theft**: The Qur'an addresses thievery directly.\n   - **Qur'an Reference**: “As for the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands in recompense for what they earned as a deterrent [punishment] from Allah.” (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:38)\n\n**7. Prohibition of False Witness and Lying**: Bearing false witness is forbidden.\n   - **Qur'an Reference**: “And do not conceal testimony, for whoever conceals it - his heart is indeed sinful.” (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:283)\n\n**8. Prohibition of Coveting**: While not explicitly listed, commandments against consuming the possessions of others are emphasized.\n   - **Qur'an Reference**: “And do not covet that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others.” (Surah An-Nisa 4:32)\n\nThe revelations and commandments given to Moses are acknowledged in the Qur'an, reinforcing those laws and adding further guidance. Surah Al-Ma'idah covers the context of the Torah and the instructions given through it.\n- **Qur'an Reference**: \"We sent down the Torah which contains guidance and light, in accordance with which the prophets gave instructions to the Jews.\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:44)\n\nAdditionally, the Qur'an mentions that the guidance was confirmed and built upon through subsequent prophets, including Jesus and Muhammad (peace be upon them).\n- **Qur'an References**: \"Let the people of the Gospel judge by what has been revealed in it by Allah.\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:47)\n\nIn conclusion, while the Ten Commandments per se do not exist verbatim in the Qur'an, the underlying principles are well-documented and aligned within the framework of Islamic teachings. The message reinforces the importance of faith, the sanctity of life, moral integrity, and communal harmony through respect for divine guidance."

        "question": "Warning about Internet sites that distort the\r\n Qur’aan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Before answering this question, we should advise you of the importance\n    of wisdom in denouncing evil, and of being careful not to inadvertantly promote\n    anti-Islamic websites so that everyone will go and read them, because this will indirectly\n    contribute to the promotion of these worthless people who claim to imitate the\n    Qur’aan. \nProducing anything like the Qur’aan is impossible, because Allaah\n    challenged anyone to do this. This challenge was issued to the most brilliant and eloquent\n    Arab poets at the time when the Qur’aan was revealed, which was also the time when\n    Arabic eloquence was at its peak. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): “Let\n    them then produce a recital like unto it (the Qur’aan) if they are truthful.” [al-Tur\n    52:34]\nWhen they could not do this, Allaah challenged them to produce ten\n    soorahs like its soorahs: “Or they say: ‘He (Muhammad) forged it (the\n    Qur’aan).’ Say: ‘Bring you then ten forged soorahs (chapters) like unto it,\n    and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the\n    truth!’” [Hud 11:13 – interpretation of the meaning].\nWhen they could not do this, Allah challenged them to produce just\n    one soorah that contained the same eloquence and wisdom as the Qur’aan. He said\n    (interpretation of the meaning): “Or do they say: ‘He (Muhammad) has forged\n    it’? Say: ‘Bring then a soorah (chapter) like unto it, and call upon whomsoever\n    you like, besides Allah, if you are truthful!” [Yoonus 10:38]\nAllah called on them to seek help from whoever they wanted, and to\n    accept the challenge. He said (interpretation of the meaning): “And if you (Arab\n    pagans, Jews, Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our\n    slave (Muhammad), then produce a soorah of the like thereof and call your witnesses\n    (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.” [al-Baqarah 2:23]\nWhen they were unable to do this, Allah informed them that they\n    would never be able to do it, no matter who they called upon to help them. He said\n    (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: ‘If mankind and jinn were together to\n    produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if\n    they helped one another.’” [al-Isra’ 17:88]\nThere is no one except Allah who can produce the like of the\n    Qur’aan, because the Qur’aan, as He says, is “a Book, the Verses whereof\n    are perfected and then explained in detail from One Who is All-Wise and Well-Acquainted\n    (with all things).” [Hud 11:1 – interpretation of the meaning].\nWhen some liars did try to imitate the Qur’aan they came up\n    with ridicualous nonsense that would make children laugh, let alone mature and intelligent\n    adults. For example, the liar Musaylimah said: “O frog, daughter of two frogs, croak\n    as much as you want, your upper part is in the water and your lower part is in the\n    mud.” This is an example of the kind of thing said by him and other pretenders to\n    Prophethood. (See Sayd al-Khaatir by Ibn al-Jawzi, p. 404).\n    Some forms of falsehood may deceive some of the people\n    because of their ignorance and lack of understanding of the rules of grammar and accepted\n    styles of eloquence in Arabic. But anyone who has intelligence and common sense should at\n    least be able to see the difference and realize that these made-up words cannot possibly\n    be Qur’aan. If we look at the Website referred to in the question, we see that kufr\n    is quite clearly mentioned in these fabricated soorahs, such as the statement that the\n    Messiah is the son of God or is God, and the promotion of the evil madhhab of Raafidah (a\n    kind of Shi’ah), and other such nonsense. There are also some weird contradictions,\n    for example, these liars say in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called “soorah\n    al-tajassud”: “Exalted be He above taking any of His creation as a son,”\n    but then we find in the so-called ninth aayah of the so-called “soorah\n    al-eemaan” the words: “You are he, the son of God, truly; in you we\n    believe.” But verily Allah has spoken the truth when He said (interpretation of the\n    meaning): “Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from\n    other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions.” [al-Nisaa’\n    4:82]\nYou also find other silly comments in these made-up soorahs, such\n    as the claim that Allah permitted His Prophet to change whatever he wanted in the\n    Qur’aan, as in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called “soorah\n    al-wasaaya”: “Abrogate whatever you want to abrogate of the commands that We\n    have given you, for We permit you to make changes to Our decisions”!\nEvery Muslim will realize the extent of the lies contained in these\n    words that come from this mind that is driven by ulterior motives. Have you ever seen\n    anything more foolish than these words? Allah has told us to adhere to His Book and put it\n    into practice, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And this is a blessed\n    Book which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah, that you may receive\n    mercy.” [al-An’aam 6:155] \nHe commanded His Messenger to adhere to the Qur’aan, saying\n    (interpretation of the meaning): “So hold you (Muhammad) to that which is inspired\n    in you. Verily, you are on a Straight Path.” [al-Zukhruf 43:43]. \nAllah warned His Messenger not to fail in conveying the message\n    complete and unaltered, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, they\n    were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad), to\n    fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you\n    for a friend! And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a\n    little. In that case, We would have made you taste a double portion (of punishment) in\n    this life and a double portion (of punishment) after death. And then you would have found\n    none to help you against Us” [al-Isra’ 17:73-75] and “… if he\n    (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah), We surely should have seized\n    him by his right hand (or with power and might), and then certainly should have cut off\n    his life artery (aorta)” [al-Haaqqah 69:44-46]. Having said all this, how can\n    there be any so-called soorah that says the messenger has the right to abrogate whatever\n    he wants in the Qur’aan and that he has the authority to change or omit whatever\n    rules he wants??\nThe only One Who can abrogate whatever He wants of the Qur’aan is\n    the One Who revealed it, may He be glorified, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah\n    blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the\n    Book” [al-Ra’d 13:39]; \n“Whatever a Verse (revelation) We abrogate or cause to be\n    forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allah is able to do\n    all things?” [al-Baqarah 2:106]. \nWe, like our Messenger, are obliged to understand and implement the\n    Qur’aan without distorting, omitting or changing anything. Allah said (interpretation\n    of the meaning): “(This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of\n    blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may\n    remember.” [Saad 38:29].\nWe have seen in the false soorahs quoted on that Internet website a\n    real example of what is referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And\n    verily, among them is a party who distort the Book with their tongues (as they read), so\n    that you may think it is from the Book, but it is not from the Book, and they say:\n    ‘This is from Allah,’ but it is not from Allah; and they speak a lie against\n    Allah while they know it.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:78]. \nWe ask Allah to make His Religion and His Book prevail and to make His\n    friends victorious, as We ask Him to defeat and humiliate His enemies and cause them to\n    fail. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Warning about Internet Sites that Distort the Qur’an\n\nIn the contemporary context, the internet serves as a powerful tool for spreading information and knowledge, including religious teachings. However, it also becomes a platform for misinformation and distortion. In Islam, the integrity of the Qur'an is paramount, and there are numerous verses in the Qur'an that emphasize the importance of adhering to its authentic teachings and the consequences of misrepresentation.\n\n#### 1. Integrity of the Qur'an\nOne of the fundamental warnings present in the Qur'an is the significance of preserving its message. Surah Al-Ahqaf (Surah 46), verses 7 to 10, address the skepticism faced by the Prophet Muhammad and highlight the consequences of denying the truth:\n\n> “When Our clear revelations are read out to them, the infidels say of the truth when it has come to them: ‘This is pure magic.’ Do they say: ‘He has fabricated it?’ Tell them: ‘If I have fabricated it, you have no power to save me from God. He knows what you are busy with concerning this. He is sufficient as witness between you and me; yet He is forgiving, ever-merciful.’ Say: ‘I am not a new Messenger to come, nor do I know what is to be done to me or you. I only follow what is revealed to me. My duty is only to warn you clearly.’” (Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46:7-10)\n\nThis passage underscores the seriousness of claiming to possess the Qur'an’s teachings while deviating from its message, which includes the dangers posed by those who attempt to distort it online.\n\n#### 2. Consequences of Distortion\nSurah Al-Furqan (Surah 25) provides additional context regarding the consequences faced by those who abandon or distort divine revelations. Verses 29 to 32 state:\n\n> “He led me astray from the warning after it had come to me. Satan always betrays man. The prophet will say: ‘O my Lord, my people had fettered the Qur'an.’ Thus do We keep opponents among the sinners for every apostle; yet your Lord is sufficient as a guide and helper.” (Surah Al-Furqan, 25:29-31)\n\nThis highlights a dire warning against those who ignore or betray the teachings of the Qur’an, emphasizing the anguish faced by the Prophet Muhammad when he laments the distortion of the Qur'an by his people.\n\n#### 3. The Realization of Truth\nSurah Al-Haqqah (Surah 69), verses 44 to 48, offer a stern reminder about the integrity of the message and the severe consequences of misrepresentation:\n\n> “Had he attributed falsely any words to Us, We would have seized him by his right hand, then cut off his aorta; and not one of you would have been able to stop (Us). It is really a reminder for those who fear God and follow the straight path.” (Surah Al-Haqqah, 69:44-48)\n\nThis illustrates the seriousness with which God treats those who misrepresent His words, indicating that such actions could lead to dire punishment.\n\n#### 4. Responsiveness to Divine Guidance\nAdditionally, Surah Al-Kahf (Surah 18), verses 55 to 59, reiterate the rejection of truth by those who turn away from divine guidance:\n\n> “There is nothing to prevent men from believing when the guidance has come to them… Who is more unjust than he who, on being reminded of his Lord's revelations, turns away from them...” (Surah Al-Kahf, 18:55-57)\n\nThis serves as a warning not just to the believers but also to all those who encounter the message of the Qur'an, urging a responsible engagement with it, especially in mediums such as the internet.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the various verses of the Qur'an highlight the importance of protecting its message and being aware of the substantial risks associated with its distortion. Muslims are urged to approach internet content about the Qur'an critically and to ensure they are obtaining knowledge from reputable sources that adhere to the authentic teachings of Islam. The warnings encapsulated in the Qur'an serve as a timeless reminder of the importance of truth and integrity in religious matters."

        "question": "Can one celebrate completing the\r\nQur’aan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nThis is a wonderful thing for such a young person (11 years old) living in a non-Muslim\ncountry and deviant society to accomplish. The fact that she has not given her name is a\nsign of sincerity, in sha Allaah. I think that this should only be announced for the\npurposes of encouraging others to do the same. The affair should be limited to a small\ngathering where some relatives or friends invite a few of the girl’s friends, tell\nthem of her achievement in completing the Qur’aan in order to encourage them - not to\nshow off or boast - and some of the mothers say a few words about the greatness of the\nQur’aan, the importance of reading it and how the Muslim should treat the\nQur’aan. Or this girl could invite her friends to a meal to mark the occasion and\ngive thanks for this blessing. There is nothing wrong with such activities, as long as one\nis careful not to let it turn into a celebration. \nIt is clear from the above that celebrating a person’s completion of reciting or\nmemorizing the Qur’aan, inviting people and offering food, is an action in which\nthere is a risk of two fitnahs (temptations): \n(1) that it might be an occasion for showing off and boasting, and \n(2) that it may constitute bid’ah, if people believe that such celebrations are part\nof the religion and must be held every time a person completes the reading of the\nQur’aan. The first danger may be avoided by striving within oneself to be sincere\ntowards Allaah, and the second by restricting the invitees to a small number of family and\nfriends. \nWe should not hold such gatherings regularly, lest people think it is a part of the Sunnah\nI ask Allaah to increase His blessings upon you and to give you the strength to memorize\nQur’aan and Sincerity in speech and deeds.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether one can celebrate the completion of the Qur'an is a matter that touches upon Islamic practices and beliefs. While the Qur'an does not explicitly mention the celebration of completing its recitation, we can derive insights from the context of the Qur'an and what is customary in Muslim communities.\n\n### Completion of the Qur'an\n\nCompleting the recitation of the Qur'an is considered a significant achievement in Islam. It is generally seen as a source of spiritual growth and connection to God, as the Qur'an is regarded as the divine guidance for humanity. The Qur'an itself encourages believers to engage with its verses and to reflect on its meanings.\n\nIn Surah Al-Baqarah, Allah states:\n\n> \"This is a Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:2)\n\nThis verse emphasizes the Qur'an's role as guidance for the pious, indicating that interacting with its text through recitation and comprehension is vital for believers.\n\nAdditionally, in another verse, Allah expresses the importance of reciting the Qur'an:\n\n> \"So recite what is easy from it...\" (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20)\n\nThis encouragement to recite reflects the Qur'an’s importance in a believer's life.\n\n### Celebrating Completion\n\nThe celebration itself is not directly prescribed in the Qur'an or Hadith, but many scholars and communities consider it acceptable to gather and celebrate such an accomplishment as a way to express gratitude to Allah and to encourage further engagement with the Qur'an. This gathering might include making du'a (supplication), sharing meals, or organizing events where the community can reflect on the guidance of the Qur'an and recommit themselves to its principles.\n\n**Scholarly Opinions:**\n- Some scholars discuss the permissibility of celebration in a broader sense, noting that gathering for good causes and expressing gratitude for achieving good deeds is praiseworthy. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) encouraged positive gatherings that promote piety and appreciation for Allah's favors.\n- Celebrations should, however, avoid any form of extravagance or practices that contradict Islamic teachings, such as un-Islamic customs or actions that distract from the purpose of worship.\n\nThe notion that expressing joy in this accomplishment can motivate others in their spiritual pursuits is often cited among supportive arguments. \n\n### Warning Against Extremism\n\nWhile celebrations can be encouraged, it's crucial to remain cautious against introducing innovations (bid'ah) in practices that may lead to divergence from authentic practices of Islam. The Qur'an emphasizes moderation and sincerity in worship:\n\n> \"And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly or send it [in bribery] to the rulers in order that [they might aid] you [to] consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin, while you know [it is unlawful].\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:188)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while celebrating the completion of the Qur'an is not commanded, it can be seen as a permissible action when done with the right intentions and within the bounds of Islamic teachings. It is an acknowledgment of the importance of the Qur'an in a believer's life and a means to promote community and piety. The ultimate goal remains connecting to Allah through His book and applying its teachings in daily life. \n\n### Supporting Verses\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:2** - “This is a Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah.”\n2. **Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20** - “So recite what is easy from it...”\n3. **Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:188** - \"And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly...\" \n\nThese verses underscore the significance of the Qur'an and the importance of treating it with reverence and respect, including recognizing milestones in one's engagement with it."

        "predicted_answer": "The name \"Qur'aan\" derives from the Arabic root \"قرأ\" (qara’a), meaning \"to read\" or \"to recite.\" The term signifies the act of recitation and has been explicitly referred to as \"Qur'aan\" in the text itself. In Islamic tradition, it is believed that Allah (God) instructed the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to convey His words, and it is through this divine command that the scripture received the title of \"Qur'aan.\"\n\nThis name is indicated in several verses where Allah describes the Quran as guidance for humanity. One of the clear verses that illustrates this is found in Surah Al-Isra (Chapter 17), Ayah 9:\n\n> \"Indeed, this Qur'an guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Isra, 17:9)\n\nFurthermore, in Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), Ayah 2, the Qur'an is described as a book of guidance:\n\n> \"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:2)\n\nAdditionally, Surah Al-Furqan (Chapter 25) uses the term \"Furqan,\" which signifies the function of the Qur'an as a criterion or standard for moral judgment:\n\n> \"Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion upon His Servant that he may be to the worlds a warner.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Furqan, 25:1)\n\nThese references underscore that the name \"Qur'aan\" was assigned to this scripture by divine ordination to serve as a guide for humanity.

        "question": "Abrogation of the verse ordering the confinement of an adulteress in a \r\nhouse",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nAllah says: \"If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four (reliable) \nwitnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until \ndeath do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way.\" [al-Nisa’ 4:15]\nIbn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer (explanation) of this aayah:\n\"At the beginning of Islam, the ruling concerning a woman who was proven guilty of adultery \nwas that she was to be detained in a house and not allowed to come out until she died. So the \nphrase ‘If any of your women are guilty of lewdness’ refers to adultery. ‘Take the evidence of \nfour (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to \nhouses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way’ - the ‘other way’ \nthat Allah made for them was the abrogation of this. Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with \nhim, said: ‘This was the ruling until Allah revealed Surat al-Nur, then this punishment was \nabrogated and replaced with whipping or stoning.’ Something similar was reported from \n‘Ikrimah, Sa‘id ibn Jubayr, al-Hasan, ‘Ataa’ al-Khurasani, Abu Saalih, Qutaadah, Zayd ibn \nAslam and al-Dahhak, stating that this is abrogated, and this is agreed upon. Imam Ahmad said: \n‘Muhammad ibn Ja‘far told us that Sa‘id told us from Qutaadah from al-Hasan from Hattaan \nibn ‘Abdullah al-Raqaashi from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit who said: Whenever the wahy \n(revelation) descended upon the Messenger of Allah \n (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), it affected him, the stress showed on \nhim and his face would change. Allah sent a revelation to him one day, and when it was over, he \nsaid: \" Listen to me, Allah has made another way for them. (When) a married man (commits \nadultery) with a married woman, and an unmarried man with an unmarried woman, then in the \ncase of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to \ndeath), and in the case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile \nfor one year.\"’ It was reported by Muslim and other narrators of Sunan via Qutaadah from \nal-Hasan from al-Hattan from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit from the Prophet \n (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) with the wording: \n‘Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those \n(women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should \nreceive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male \ncommitting adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be \nstoned to death.’ Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth.\" \nAl-Qurtubi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah:\n\"This [confinement] was the first punishment for adultery, at the beginning of Islam. Ibn \n‘Abbas and al-Hasan said: Ibn Zayd added: They would not be allowed to marry, until they \ndied, as a punishment for them when they asked to marry someone else. This ruling applied for \na while, then the Prophet \n (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said, according to the hadeeth narrated by ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit: \n\"Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those \n(women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should \nreceive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male \ncommitting adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be \nstoned to death.\" Some of the scholars said: the idea of punishment and shame was still there \nwith the lashing, because there is no contradiction, and they are applied to one person. As for \nconfinement, this is abrogated, by the consensus of the scholars. And Allah knows best. \nTo complete the benefit of what has been said, it is appropriate to learn the tafseer of the next \naayah in Surat al-Nisaa’:\n\"If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, \nleave them alone; for Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful.\" [al-Nisaa’ 4:16]\nIbn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer of this aayah:\n\"‘If two men among you are guilty of lewdness’ means two who commit an immoral act, so \nthey should be punished. Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Sa‘eed ibn Jubayr and \nothers said: i.e., by putting them to public shame and hitting them with shoes. This was the \nruling until Allah abrogated it and replaced it with lashing and stoning. ‘Ikrimah, ‘Ataa’, \nal-Hasan and ‘Abdullah ibn Katheer said: ‘This was revealed concerning a man and a woman \nwho commit adultery. The phrase ‘if they repent and amend’ means if they give up what they \nwere doing and mend their ways. ‘Leave them alone’ means not to keep rebuking them with \nugly words after that, because the one who has repented from his sin is like one who never \nsinned at all. ‘Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful’ - it was proven in the two Saheehs: ‘If the \nslave woman of one of you commits adultery, apply the punishment of lashing, and do not \nblame her (after that)’ - i.e., do not blame her for what she did after the punishment has been \ngiven, because the punishment is an expiation for her deed.’\"",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the topic of abrogation (naskh) is significant, especially when analyzing various legal rulings presented throughout the Quran. With regard to the abrogation of the verse ordering the confinement of an adulteress, it contextually relates to a shift towards implementing a different punishment for adultery.\n\n### Relevant Verses and Explanation\n\n1. **Surah An-Nur (Chapter 24), Ayahs 2-6**: This surah provides a specific punishment for adultery, stating clearly that both the adulterer and the adulteress are to receive lashes as a penalty for their actions. The verse states:\n   \n   - **Verse 2**: *\"The adulteress and adulterer should be flogged a hundred lashes each; and no pity for them should deter you from the law of God, if you believe in God and the Last Day...\"*  \n     (Surah An-Nur, 24:2, Quran)\n\n   These verses emphasize physical punishment rather than confinement. The punishment is to be witnessed by a group of believers, highlighting a community-based approach to maintaining social order.\n\n2. **Surah At-Tahrim (Chapter 66), Ayahs 10-12**: This passage discusses the examples of the wives of the prophets Noah and Lot as a warning towards unfaithfulness, but it does not prescribe confinement for adulteresses. Instead, it discusses the consequences of disbelief and infidelity within the context of their relationship with God:\n   \n   - **Verse 10-12**: This section illustrates the fate of those who are unfaithful and emphasizes the importance of belief and righteousness. It does not directly specify confinement as a punishment for adultery.  \n     (Surah At-Tahrim, 66:10-12, Quran)\n\n3. **The Concept of Abrogation**: The move from a confinement-based or more severe punishment concept towards physical lashes reflects a broader consideration for justice and reformation. The rules established in Surah An-Nur focus on public accountability and punishment that is intended to serve as a deterrent while maintaining fairness in the community.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe transition from confinement to flogging as a punishment for adultery can be viewed as a process of legal evolution within Islamic law:\n- Surah An-Nur's directive for lashes serves as a clear legal framework for punishing adultery without confinement.\n- Surah At-Tahrim presents warnings against infidelity but is not prescriptive of confinement as a penalty.\n\nThus, scholars argue that the punishment of confinement was effectively abrogated by the more clarified and structured approach taken in Surah An-Nur, establishing a legal standard that focuses on both community involvement and clear penalties suited to the acts committed. The Quranic approach reflects a movement towards accountability and justice that resonates with the foundational principles of Islamic jurisprudence."

        "predicted_answer": "Arguing against the Qur'an using archaeology presents a unique challenge for believers and critics alike. The Qur'an itself acknowledges the limitations of human understanding and the possibility that some individuals may reject divine revelations due to their biases or injustices. \n\n### Key Points from the Qur'an:\n\n1. **The Nature of Arguments Against Revelation**:\n   In Surah Al-'Ankabut, verses 46 to 50 reinforce the idea that believers should engage in dialogue with the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) in a respectful manner and maintain a core belief in the revelations that have come from God:\n   - **Surah Al-'Ankabut (29:46-50)**:\n     > \"And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them. And say, 'We have believed in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [submitting] to Him.' And thus We have sent down the Qur'an to you. Those to whom We have given the Scripture believe in it, and among these are some who believe in it. And none reject Our signs except the defiantly disobedient.\"\n\n2. **Human Limitations in Understanding Divine Truth**:\n   Surah Al-Kahf emphasizes the folly of individuals who rely solely on their own understanding and the societal norms of their time, which can lead to misguided beliefs. The verse illustrates that human beings often fail to see the greater picture that is influenced by divine wisdom:\n   - **Surah Al-Kahf (18:54-58)**:\n     > \"And We have certainly diversified in this Qur'an for the people from every [kind of] example; but man has ever been, more than anything, [prone to] dispute. And what prevents the people from believing when guidance comes to them and from asking forgiveness of their Lord except that they would meet the precedent of the former peoples or that the punishment would come directly before them? And We send not the messengers except as givers of good tidings and warners...\"\n\n3. **Historical and Archaeological Context**:\n   When discussing archaeological evidence, it's pertinent to understand that the Qur'an speaks of the tests and trials set by God, which must be interpreted as lessons rather than strictly historical accounts. This notion is encapsulated in Surah Al-Kahf:\n   - **Surah Al-Kahf (18:7)**:\n     > \"Indeed, We have made that which is on the earth a [means of] adornment for it that We may test them as to which of them is best in deed.\"\n\n4. **The Burden of Belief**:\n   The Qur'an acknowledges that not everyone will accept its messages. This includes both historical opponents of the message as well as contemporary skeptics. This responsibility rests heavily on the individual’s pursuit of truth and their interactions regarding faith:\n   - **Surah Al-Kahf (18:11-15)**:\n     > \"So We sealed their hearing in the cave for a number of years. Then We raised them up that We might ask which of the two parties was best at calculating the time they had remained. We relate to you their story in truth...\"\n\n5. **The Nature of Signs and Revelations**:\n   The Qur'an refers to signs from God that should ideally lead to reflection and understanding. When archaeological findings are presented as contradictions to scriptural claims, they can be seen as challenges that believers are encouraged to reflect upon without dismissing the divine aspect of their faith:\n   - **Surah Al-Kahf (18:19-23)**:\n     > \"And thus We awakened them that they might question one another... So do not argue about it except with a passing word...\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Muslims are encouraged to approach the dialogue about the Qur'an, including archaeological evidence, with a constructive attitude, recognizing the spiritual significance over merely historical validation. Believers are reminded that ultimate understanding lies with God, and it is He who holds the measure of truth across time.\n\nIn essence, the Qur'an provides a framework for understanding and interacting with challenges to its message, emphasizing respectful dialogue, recognition of divine wisdom beyond mere archaeological findings, and the importance of personal introspection in one’s journey of faith."
