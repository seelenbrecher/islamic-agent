        "question": "Rulings on Conservatorship and Bankruptcy",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The bankrupt (Muflis) is the one who has debts that are greater than the wealth he owns.\nIf the creditors ask the court to establish conservatorship (Hajr) and divide among them the wealth that the debtor has, the judge must respond to that.\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said, explaining the rulings on conservatorship and bankruptcy:\n“1. What is meant by conservatorship in Shari`ah is preventing a person from disposing of his wealth.\nThe evidence for that in the Quran is the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not give the weak-minded your property, which Allah has made a means of sustenance for you, but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness.\nAnd test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age. Then if you perceive in them sound judgement, release their property to them.} [An-Nisa’ 4:5-6]\nThese two verses indicate that conservatorship should be imposed in the case of one who is weak-minded and the orphan to prevent them having access to their wealth, lest they mishandle it and lose it. The wealth should not be given to such a person until after it is established that he is mature and competent. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) imposed conservatorship on some of the Companions for the purpose of ensuring that the debt they owed to people would be paid off .\n2. Conservatorship is of two types:\n\nThe first type: conservatorship imposed on a person because he owes something to others, such as conservatorship imposed on a bankrupt person because of what he owes to his creditors.\nThe second type: conservatorship imposed on a person because that is in his best interests, lest he squander his wealth or mishandle it, such as conservatorship in the case of a minor, a weak-minded person and one who is insane.\n\nIn the first case, which is conservatorship imposed on a person because he owes something to others, what is meant in this case is conservatorship imposed on one who is bankrupt. The bankrupt person is one who owes a debt that has now become due, but the wealth that he has is not sufficient to pay it off. He should be prevented from disposing of his wealth, so that he does not harm the creditors.\nAs for the debtor who is in financial difficulty and is not able to pay off anything of his debt , he is not to be asked for it, and he should be given more time, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if someone is in hardship, then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease.} [Al-Baqarah 2:280]\nAs for the one who is able to pay off his debt, it is not permissible to impose conservatorship on him, because there is no need for that. Rather he should be instructed to pay off his debt when the creditors ask him to do so, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “For a rich man to delay repayment is wrongdoing.” In other words, if one who can afford it is taking too long to pay off his debt, he is wronging the creditors, because he is withholding payment that he is obliged to make to people who are entitled to it. So if he refuses to pay off his debts, he should be imprisoned. Shaykh Taqiy Ad-Din Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever is able to pay off his debt but refuses to do so should be forced to pay it off by means of beating and imprisonment. This was stated by the leading scholars among the companions of Malik, Ahmad, Ash-Shafi`i and others. He said: And I do not know of any difference of scholarly opinion concerning that.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “For a rich man to delay repayment is wrongdoing, and it is permissible to speak ill of him and punish him.” (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and others)\nWhat is meant by speaking ill of him is complaining about him, and what is meant by punishing him is detaining him. The one who takes too long to pay off what he owes deserves to be punished by detention or otherwise, and that should be done repeatedly until he pays off what he owes. If he persists in taking too long to pay his debt, then the judge should intervene to sell his property and pay off his debts from the proceeds, because the judge will be playing the role of the one who is refusing to pay. That will also serve the purpose of alleviating harm from the creditors. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harm nor reciprocating harm.”\n3. From the above, it becomes clear that in the case of debt, there are two scenarios:\n\nThe first scenario: the debt has not yet become due. In this case, the debtor is not to be asked to pay it back until it becomes due, and he does not have to pay it before it becomes due. If the wealth he has is less than what he owes that has not yet become due, then he is not to be subjected to conservatorship because of that, and he is not to be prevented from disposing of his wealth.\nThe second scenario: the debt is now due. In that case, there are two possibilities:\n\nThe first possibility is that the wealth he has is greater than the debt he owes. In this case, he is not to be subjected to conservatorship regarding his wealth, but he should be instructed to pay off the debt if the creditor asks for it. If he refuses to do that, then he should be detained and punished until he pays off what he owes. If he puts up with detention and punishment, and refuses to pay off the debt, then the judge should intervene to pay off his debt from his wealth, selling whatever he needs to sell in order to do that.\nThe second possibility is that the wealth he has is less than the debt he owes. In this case, he should be subjected to conservatorship and prevented from disposing of his wealth, if he has creditors who ask for that, lest he harm them. That is because of the Hadith of Ka‘b ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) imposed conservatorship on Mu‘adh (may Allah be pleased with him) and sold his property. Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni and by Al-Hakim, who classed it as authentic. Ibn As-Salah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is a proven Hadith. If he is subjected to conservatorship in this case, then that should be announced and it should be made known to people that conservatorship has been imposed on him, lest they be deceived by him and do business with him, then end up losing their wealth.\n4. There are five rulings having to do with imposing conservatorship on someone.\n\nThe first ruling is that the rights of the creditors are connected to his wealth that existed before conservatorship was imposed and to any wealth that he acquired after it was imposed. So the wealth that he acquired later is subject to the conservatorship, just like the wealth that he owned before that. Thus he will have no authority to dispose of the wealth that he acquired after conservatorship was imposed in any way whatsoever. Even the wealth that he acquired before it was imposed cannot be disposed of in any way that harms his creditors.\n\nImam Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf what he owes of debts is equal to or more than what he has of wealth, then any donation he makes is not valid if he donates it in a way that harms his creditors, regardless of whether the judge has imposed conservatorship on him or not. This is the view of Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) and it is the view favoured by our Shaykh – meaning Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). He said: And it is the correct view, and no other view is appropriate according to the general guidelines of the [Hanbali] Madhhab. In fact, this is in accordance with the teachings and general guidelines of Shari`ah, because the rights of the creditors are connected to his wealth, therefore the judge has the right to impose conservatorship on him. Were it not for the fact that the creditors’ rights are connected to his wealth, then the judge could not impose conservatorship on him. Therefore he is like one who is terminally ill; allowing this debtor to donate his wealth would mean that the creditors would lose what is rightfully theirs, and Shari`ah cannot approve of such a thing. Rather Shari`ah emphasises the importance of protecting the rights of those who have rights by all possible means, and bars any means that could lead to the loss of their rights. End quote.\n\nThe second ruling is that if someone finds his exact wealth with the debtor that he sold to him or loaned to him or rented to him before conservatorship was imposed on him, then he has the right to take it back from the one who is bankrupt, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever finds his own goods with one who has become bankrupt, has more right to them [than other creditors].” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). The jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) stipulated six conditions in order for the one who finds his property with one who is bankrupt and has had conservatorship imposed on him to take it back:\n\n\nThe bankrupt person should still be alive in order for him to take his property back from him, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud  (may Allah have mercy on him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If [the debtor] has died, then the owner of the goods becomes equal to all other creditors.”\nThe bankrupt person should still owe him the price in full. If the creditor has received anything of its price, he is not entitled to take back the goods.\nThe goods should be fully in the possession of the bankrupt person. If the creditor only finds some of them, he cannot take them back, because he has not found his exact property; rather he has only found some of it.\nThe goods should be in the same condition as when they were sold, and none of their characteristics should have changed.\nThe goods should not be connected to the rights of someone else, such as if the bankrupt person gave them in pledge as collateral, and the like.\nThe goods should not have increased in size, such as growing fat [in the case of livestock].\n\nIf all these conditions are fulfilled, then it is permissible for the owner of the goods to take them away, if it has become known that the one who has them has become bankrupt, because of the hadith quoted above.\n\nThe third ruling is that the creditors should stop demanding repayment from him after conservatorship is imposed on him, until after it is lifted. So whoever sells something to him or lends something to him during this period should ask him to pay him or return it after the conservatorship is lifted.\nThe fourth ruling is that the judge may sell his property and divide its price commensurate with the size of the debts that are currently due, because this is the purpose of imposing conservatorship on him. Delaying that is wronging the creditors. However, the judge should leave for the bankrupt person whatever he needs of shelter and sustenance, and so on.\n\nAs for any debt that is not yet due, it does not become due when the person declares bankruptcy, and that does not impact the currently-due debts, because the deferral of time for payment is the right of the bankrupt individual, and that right, like all others, cannot be waived. It remains something that the bankrupt person owes. Then after distributing his wealth to those creditors whose payment is currently due, once he has paid them off and none of those currently-due debts remain, the conservatorship should be lifted automatically, without any need for a judicial ruling, because the reason for it no longer applies. If he still owes anything of the debts that are currently due, then the conservatorship is not to be lifted from him except by a judicial ruling, because the judge is the one who ruled that he was to be subject to conservatorship, so he is the one who should rule that the conservatorship is to be lifted.\" (Al-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi  2/89-95)\nIf any debts remain unpaid, then they are still owed by the one who is bankrupt, until Allah, may He be Exalted, blesses him with wealth, whereupon he must repay these outstanding debts.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Rulings on Conservatorship and Bankruptcy in Islam\n\nIslamic teachings provide various guidelines concerning financial dealings, conservatorship, and bankruptcy. These are critical for maintaining justice, fairness, and social welfare. Below are some fundamental concepts derived from the Quran that pertain to these issues.\n\n#### 1. **Debt and Financial Responsibility**\n\nThe Quran emphasizes the importance of writing down debts and agreements to prevent disputes and misunderstandings. This is highlighted in Surah Al-Baqarah:\n\n> **\"O believers, when you negotiate a debt for a fixed term, draw up an agreement in writing.\"**  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 282)\n\nThis verse underlines that all financial transactions, especially loans, should be documented to ensure clarity and accountability. It states that both parties must fulfill their obligations faithfully, emphasizing the need to avoid oppression and injustice in financial dealings:\n\n> **\"Oppress none and no one will oppress you.\"**  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 279)\n\n#### 2. **Treatment of Debtors**\n\nIslam encourages compassion towards those in debt, permitting leniency if the debtor is in a tough situation. The Quran states:\n\n> **\"If a debtor is in want, give him time until his circumstances improve; but if you forego (the debt) as charity, that will be to your good.\"**  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 280)\n\nThis suggests that changing circumstances should be taken into account concerning debt repayment, and creditors are encouraged to act charitably by forgiving debts to alleviate the hardship faced by the debtor.\n\n#### 3. **Conservatorship**\n\nIn various instances, the Quran addresses responsibilities toward dependents and orphans, guiding guardians on how to manage their affairs. Guardians are urged to act in the best interest of those they represent, particularly when it comes to safeguarding their assets:\n\n> **\"Those who devour the possessions of the orphans unjustly devour only fire, and will surely burn in Hell.\"**  \n> (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 10)\n\nThe focus here is on protecting the vulnerable and fulfilling caretaking obligations responsibly.\n\n#### 4. **Bankruptcy and Economic Hardship**\n\nWhen someone finds themselves in financial distress, the Quran advises patience and understanding. The concept of giving someone the chance to recover from financial difficulties without rushing to punish them is significant:\n\n> **\"If the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm, or unable to explain, let the guardian explain judiciously.\"**  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 282)\n\nThis provision emphasizes that guardians should assess the situation carefully and respond with wisdom, indicating that financial hardship should be handled judiciously, allowing the person the dignity to manage their affairs.\n\n#### 5. **Importance of Fairness in Financial Transactions**\n\nThe Quran encourages fairness and clear equity in all dealings, especially regarding contracts and transactions. For instance:\n\n> **\"... this is more equitable in the eyes of God, and better as evidence and best for avoiding doubt.\"**  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 282)\n\nFairness extends beyond the individual to encompass the community and economic structures, thereby promoting social justice.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIslamic teachings about conservatorship and bankruptcy are grounded in principles of justice, compassion, fairness, and accountability. The significance of written agreements, the humane treatment of debtors, and the responsibilities of guardians reflect the broader Islamic ethos of safeguarding the rights and welfare of all individuals, particularly the vulnerable members of society. These principles promote stability and harmony within the community, aligning individual behavior with collective responsibility and ethical governance."

        "question": "Recommended Recitation In the Two Sunnah Rak‘ahs Of Fajr and Maghrib",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What to recite in Sunnahs of Fajr and Maghrib?\nYes, it is recommended to recite Surat al-Kafirun and Surat al-Ikhlas in the two Sunnah rak‘ahs of Fajr and Maghrib. This is proven in the sahih Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recited in the two Sunnah rak‘ahs of Fajr {Qul ya ayyuha’l-kafirun (Say, \"O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] and {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah, [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112].\nIbn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I watched the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) twenty times reciting in the two rak‘ahs after Maghrib and in the two rak‘ahs before Fajr, {Qul ya ayyuha’l-kafirun (Say, \"O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] and {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah, [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112]. (Narrated by al-Nasai, 992)\nAn-Nawawi said in al-Majmu‘ (3/385): \n“Its isnad is jayyid. It was classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (3328) and by Shaykh Ahmad Shakir in Tahqiq al-Musnad (8/89).”\nAl-Mubarakfuri said in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (2/418):\n“That is, in the first rak‘ah of each of them he would recite {Qul ya ayyuha’l-kafirun (Say, O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] and in the second {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah , [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112].”\nThe scholars have stated that it is recommended to recite these two surahs in the Sunnah prayers of Fajr and Maghrib, in accordance with these hadiths. (See: al-Mughni (1/435); Mughni al-Muhtaj (1/464); al-Fatawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra (1/192); al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (27/159)\nWhy should we recite Surat al-Kafirun and Surat al-Ikhlas in Fajr and Maghrib Sunnah prayers?\nWith regard to the wisdom behind reciting these two surahs, that is because they include all three types of Tawhid . The surah {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah, [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112] refers to tawhid ar-rububiyyah (oneness of divine Lordship ) and tawhid al-asma wa’s-sifat (oneness of the divine names and attributes ), for it affirms that Allah, may He be exalted, is one God and denies that He has any son, father or peer, and that in addition to that, He is as-Samad, in Whom are combined all attributes of perfection.\nAnd the surah {Qul ya ayyuhu’l-kafirun (Say, O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] refers to tawhid al-‘ibadah (oneness of worship), which means that one should not worship anyone or anything except Allah, and should not associate anyone with Him in worship. Hence the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to start the day with them in the Sunnah prayer of Fajr , and he would end the day with them in the Sunnah prayer of Maghrib. In as-Sunan, it is narrated that he used to recite these surahs in Witr, so they were also a conclusion to the deeds of the night, just as they were a conclusion to the deeds of the day.” (This was stated by Ibn al-Qayyim in Badai‘ al-Fawaid, 1/145-146)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the Fajr and Maghrib prayers are two of the five daily prayers that hold special significance. Each of these prayers has accompanying Sunnah (voluntary) rak‘ahs, where certain Surahs from the Quran are recommended for recitation. \n\n### Recommended Recitation in the Two Sunnah Rak‘ahs of Fajr\n\nFor the two Sunnah rak‘ahs of the Fajr prayer, it is generally recommended to recite **Surah Al-Fatiha** followed by **Surah Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112)**. In addition, some traditions suggest reciting **Surah Al-Fajr (Chapter 89)**, as it is particularly relevant to the dawn prayer.\n\n- **Surah Al-Fatiha**: This is recited in every rak‘ah of the prayer.\n- **Surah Al-Ikhlas (112:1-4)**: \"Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent.'\" \n- **Surah Al-Fajr (89:1-5)**: Although not traditionally specified, its relevance to the Fajr prayer can be derived from its association with the dawn and its reflections.\n\n  **Citations:**\n  - Surah Al-Ikhlas: Chapter 112, Ayahs 1-4\n  - Surah Al-Fajr: Chapter 89, Ayahs 1-5\n\n### Recommended Recitation in the Two Sunnah Rak‘ahs of Maghrib\n\nFor the two Sunnah rak‘ahs following the Maghrib prayer, **Surah Al-Fatiha** is likewise recited, but it is also common to recite **Surah Al-Ikhlas** again or to follow it with **Surah Al-Mulk (Chapter 67)**, as many narrations recommend reciting it before sleeping, indicating its importance.\n\n- **Surah Al-Ikhlas (112:1-4)**: Same as mentioned above.\n- **Surah Al-Mulk (67:1-2)**: \"Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all things competent. [It is He who] created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed— and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving.\"\n\n  **Citations:**\n  - Surah Al-Ikhlas: Chapter 112, Ayahs 1-4\n  - Surah Al-Mulk: Chapter 67, Ayahs 1-2\n\n### Summary of Verses and Their Contexts\n\n1. **Surah Al-Fajr (89:1-5)** emphasizes witness to the dawn and is a reflection of God's creation, encouraging mindfulness of the dawn time:\n   - \"I CALL TO witness the dawn and the Ten Nights...\" (89:1-5)\n\n2. **Surah Al-Isra (17:78-82)** highlights the special nature of the prayer at dawn:\n   - \"...and the recitation at dawn. Indeed the Recitation at dawn is palpably evident.\" (17:78)\n   \n3. **Surah Al-Ikhlas (112:1-4)** affirms the concept of monotheism:\n   - \"Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One...'\" (112:1-4)\n\n4. **Surah Al-Mulk (67:1-2)** discusses the creation of life and death, reminding of God's power and purpose behind His creation:\n   - “Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion...\" (67:1-2)\n\nThese Surahs form part of the rich tradition of Quranic recitation in Sunnah prayers, underscoring the importance of mindfulness during these times of worship."

        "question": "Difference between Shari’ah, Fiqh and Usul Al-Fiqh",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is Shari`ah?\nIn linguistic terms, Shari`ah refers to a water source, which is the source to which people who want to drink come, so they drink from it and fill their buckets, and perhaps bring their animals to drink from it as well.\nThe Arabs do not call a water source Shari`ah unless the water is flowing without interruption, and is visible and can be seen. (Lisan al-‘Arab (8/175)\nIn Shar‘i terminology, Shari`ah refers to the entire religion (Islam), which Allah has chosen for His slaves to bring them forth thereby from the depths of darkness into the light. It is what He has prescribed for them and what He has explained to them of commands and prohibitions, halal and haram.\nWhoever follows the Shari`ah of Allah, regarding as permissible (halal) that which He has permitted and regarding as forbidden (haram) that which He has prohibited, will triumph.\nWhoever goes against the Shari`ah (laws) of Allah has exposed himself to divine vengeance, wrath and punishment.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Then We put you, [O Muhammad], on an ordained way [Shari`ah] concerning the matter [of religion]; so follow it and do not follow the inclinations of those who do not know.” [al-Jathiyah 45:18]\nWhat does Fiqh mean?\nIn linguistic terms, fiqh means understanding. It may be said that so-and-so has been given fiqh fi’d-din, meaning understanding of the religion. Another example is the du‘a of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for Ibn 'Abbas: “Allahumma faqqihhu fi’d-din (O Allah, give him understanding of the religion).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (143) and Muslim (2477)   (Tahdhib al-Lughah (5/263)\nIn Shar‘i terminology, fiqh refers to knowledge of the practical, minor Shar‘i rulings which are derived from detailed evidence and proof. Al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (1/13)\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The definition of fiqh is: knowledge of the rulings of Shari`ah as derived from the Quran and the words of the one who was sent with it (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), for these rulings can only be taken from him.\nWhat is implied by this definition is: knowledge of the rulings of the Quran, and what abrogates and what is abrogated of it (an-nasikh wa’l-mansukh); and knowledge of the rulings in the hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), what abrogates and what is abrogated of it, and what is soundly narrated of it and what is not; and knowledge of the matters concerning which there was consensus among the scholars and what they differed about; and knowledge of how to refer differences of opinion to the Quran and Sunnah of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is what is meant by having knowledge of the rulings of Shari`ah.” (Al-Ihkam fi Usul al-Ahkam (5/127)\nIbn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Fiqh is understanding of the texts, Quranic verses and hadiths, and knowing how to derive rulings from them.” (Sharh Akhsar al-Mukhtasarat (1/2)\nWhat is Usul al-Fiqh?\nThe word asl (pl. usul) refers to the origin of a thing and what it is based on. Hence the father is the origin of the child, and the river is the origin of the channel. (Al-Misbah al-Munir (1/16)\nUsul al-Fiqh is knowledge of Shar‘i evidence and the way in which that evidence is interpreted in order to reach a ruling, in general terms or in detail. (Sharh Mukhtasar ar-Rawdah (1/106)\nIbn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Usul al-Fiqh may be defined in two ways:\n\nFirstly, on the basis of the two words that make up the phrase, namely the word usul and the word fiqh.\n\nUsul is the plural of asl, which is the basis on which something else is built, such as the foundation of a wall (asl al-jidar), or the trunk of a tree (asl ash-shajarah) from which the branches stem. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Have you not considered how Allah presents an example, [making] a good word like a good tree, whose root [asl] is firmly fixed and its branches [high] in the sky?” [Ibrahim 14:24].\nIn linguistic terms, fiqh means understanding; in Shar‘i terminology it refers to knowledge of the practical Shar‘i rulings, with detailed evidence.\nKnowledge may be definitive or speculative, because Shar‘i rulings may be either definitive (yaqini) or speculative (zanni), as is the case in many issues of fiqh.\nWhat we mean by the Shar‘i rulings (conclusions) is the rulings that are learned from the Shar‘i texts, such as the obligations and prohibitions. That excludes rulings (conclusions) derived by means of reasoning, such as knowing that the whole is greater than its parts, or regular rulings (conclusions), such as knowing that dew will come down on a winter’s night if the sky is clear.\nWhat we mean by practical is that which does not have to do with beliefs, such as prayer and zakah. That excludes anything that has to do with beliefs (‘aqidah), such as the Oneness of Allah (Tawhid) and knowledge of the divine names and attributes. Such topics are not called fiqh in Shar‘i terminology.\nWhat we mean by detailed evidence is evidence of fiqh that has to do with detailed issues of fiqh. This excludes Usul al-Fiqh, because discussing issues of Usul al-Fiqh is done on the basis of the general evidence of fiqh.\n\nSecondly, on the basis of the phrase (the two words together, Usul al-Fiqh) that forms the name of this branch of knowledge, it is defined as the branch of knowledge that deals with the general evidence of fiqh and how to make use of it, and the situation of the one who engages in this process (which is called ijtihad).\n\nWhat we mean by general is the general principle, such as when the scholars said that a command means that something is obligatory, a prohibition means that something is haram, and the soundness of a report means that it has authority. This excludes detailed evidence, which is not discussed within the framework of Usul al-Fiqh except by way of explaining a general rule.\nWhat we mean by how to benefit from it is knowing how to derive rulings from the evidence by studying what the words of the text mean, and whether the meaning is general or specific, applicable with no restrictions or subject to some restrictions, what abrogates and what is abrogated, and so on. This is done by understanding all of the evidence of fiqh from which rulings are derived.\nWhat we mean by the situation of the one who engages in this process is trying to find out his situation (and whether he is qualified), because he is the one who is engaging in this process (ijtihad), as he himself derives rulings through his efforts based on the evidence, as he has reached the level of ijtihad (having the ability to work out rulings based on the evidence). Knowing the definition of the mujtahid, the conditions and rulings on ijtihad, and so on, are matters that are discussed in the field of Usul al-Fiqh.\nThe benefit of Usul al-Fiqh is that it enables a person to attain the ability to derive Shar‘i rulings from the evidence by means of a sound process.\nThe first one to write about Usul al-Fiqh as an independent branch of knowledge was Imam ash-Shafi‘i, Muhammad ibn Idris (may Allah have mercy on him); then he was followed in that by  scholars who wrote various books on this topic.

        "predicted_answer": "The concepts of Shari’ah, Fiqh, and Usul al-Fiqh are fundamental to Islamic jurisprudence, and understanding their differences is imperative for both theoretical knowledge and practical application in Muslim life. Below are detailed definitions and explanations of these terms, supported by relevant verses from the Qur'an.\n\n### 1. Shari’ah\n\n**Definition:**\nShari’ah (Arabic: شريعة) refers to the divine law as revealed in the Qur'an and Hadith. It encompasses all that is required and prohibited, serving as a comprehensive ethical system governing all aspects of a Muslim's life, from personal conduct to societal laws.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:48): \"And if We had willed, We could have made you one nation, but (We made you) that We might test you in what He has given you; so race to good deeds. To Allah is your return all together, and He will inform you concerning that in which you used to differ.\"\n- Surah Al-Jathiyah (45:18): \"Then We put you on an ordained way concerning the matter. So follow it, and do not follow the desires of those who do not know.\"\n\nThese verses illustrate that the Shari’ah is a comprehensive framework that guides believers to righteousness and emphasizes adherence to divine command.\n\n### 2. Fiqh\n\n**Definition:**\nFiqh (Arabic: فقه) translates to \"understanding\" and refers to the human interpretation and application of Shari’ah. It involves deriving legal rulings (ahkam) from the sources of Islamic law (the Qur'an, Hadith, consensus, and analogy). Fiqh accounts for the changing circumstances and contexts within which Muslims find themselves.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- Surah Al-Fussilat (41:3): \"A Book whose verses have been distinguished and explained, a lucid discourse for people who understand, announcing happy news and warnings.\"\n  \nThis verse indicates that the Qur'an is not only a directive but is also detailed and clear, laying the groundwork for deeper understanding and interpretation by scholars, which is the essence of Fiqh.\n\n### 3. Usul al-Fiqh\n\n**Definition:**\nUsul al-Fiqh (Arabic: أصول الفقه) refers to the principles and methodologies that govern the derivation of legal rulings within Fiqh. It outlines the various sources of Islamic law and the methods used to interpret them, such as the Qur'an, Hadith, consensus (ijma), and analogy (qiyas).\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- Surah Al-Fussilat (41:44): \"Nothing is said to you which had not been said to other apostles before you. Surely your Lord is the lord of forgiveness, but also the lord of severe retribution.\"\n  \nThis verse suggests the importance of understanding previous scriptures and legal traditions, an aspect pivotal to Usul al-Fiqh, as it enables scholars to contextualize and apply rules based on both current needs and historical precedents.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n\n1. **Shari’ah**: The divine, absolute law as prescribed by Allah, encompassing the moral framework and guiding principles for Muslim life.\n2. **Fiqh**: The human endeavor to interpret, apply, and articulate the moral and legal rulings contained within Shari’ah, factoring in context and circumstances.\n3. **Usul al-Fiqh**: The foundational principles and methodologies for understanding and deriving rules in Fiqh, including the sources of law and their interpretations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while Shari’ah represents the divine legal framework provided by Allah, Fiqh is the scholars' interpretation and application of those laws, and Usul al-Fiqh serves as the guiding principles for deriving legal rulings. Each plays a critical role in how Muslims approach their faith and live their lives, ensuring a balance between divine commandments and human understanding amid ever-changing societal contexts."

        "question": "Scholarly consensus (ijmaa‘) as binding proof and the first consensus that occurred in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nConsensus (ijmaa‘) is one of the important sources of legislation that must be followed.\nThere are several definitions of consensus (ijmaa‘); the favoured view is that of as-Subki (may Allah have mercy on him), who defined it as follows: It is when there is unanimous agreement among the scholars of the ummah after the death of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), during any era, on some particular matter.\nEnd quote from Jam‘ al-Jaami‘, annotated by Wali ad-Deen al-‘Iraaqi, which is known also known as al-Ghayth al-Haami‘, p. 485\nThere is a great deal of definitive evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah for the fact that consensus constitutes binding proof. We have explained some of it previously in the answer to question no. 201682 .\nFor example, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:115].\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever goes against it – that is, consensus – after coming to know of it, or after proof has been established on the basis of consensus, is deserving of the warning mentioned in the verse.\nEnd quote from Maraatib al-Ijmaa‘ by Ibn Hazm, p. 7.\nAl-Qaadi Abu Ya‘la (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Consensus constitutes binding proof with which one should comply and it is haraam to go against it; it is not possible for the ummah to agree on error.\nEnd quote from al-‘Uddah fi Usool al-Fiqh (4/1058).\nSecondly:\nWe have not come across anyone who mentioned the first consensus that occurred in Islam, or the first one to narrate such a thing.\nWe have stated above that consensus is when the scholars agree on a particular issue after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nHowever, during his lifetime (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), consensus did not constitute proof.\nAl-Aamidi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The consensus of those who were alive at the time of revelation did not constitute proof at the time of revelation, according to consensus; rather consensus became binding proof after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nEnd quote from al-Ahkaam by al-Aamidi (1/109).\nBased on that, it may be said that the first consensus that occurred after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) on the necessity of appointing a caliph, after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Therefore the Muhaajireen and Ansaar met in the saqeefah of Banu Saa‘idah for that purpose, before the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was buried, then they agreed to appoint Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) as caliph.\nAmong the first examples of consensus after that was the agreement of the Sahaabah on fighting the apostates, after some initial objection on the part of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), but then Allah opened his heart and caused him to feel at ease with the decision of Abu Bakr, and the Sahaabah agreed on that, without any dissent.\nImam Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, praised the Muhaajireen and Ansaar, and the earliest Muslims; the Qur’an speaks highly of the Muhaajireen and Ansaar in many places, and praises those who were present at Bay‘at ar-Ridwaan [when the Muslims affirmed their allegiance to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at al-Hudaybiyyah]. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Certainly was Allah pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, [O Muhammad], under the tree”\n[al-Fat-h 48:18].\nThese people whom Allah praised agreed to appoint Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) as their leader; they called him Khaleefat Rasool-Allah (the Successor to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), and swore allegiance to him, rallying behind him and affirming his virtue, for he was the best of the Sahaabah in the qualities that are required for a person to be a leader, such as knowledge, asceticism, wisdom, leadership abilities, and so on.\nEnd quote from al-Ibaanah fi Usool ad-Diyaanah, p. 66\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What confirms the fact that Abu Bakr’s appointment as caliph was based on a strong foundation is the fact that all the Muslims rallied behind him and accepted his leadership.… Later on, we see that ‘Ali and al-‘Abbaas swore allegiance to him and agreed to accept his leadership. Therefore his leadership, after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), was based on the consensus of the Muslims.\nIt is not appropriate for anyone to say that what was in the hearts of ‘Ali and al-‘Abbaas [concerning the appointment of Abu Bakr as caliph] was something other than what they showed. If that argument was valid, then it would be almost impossible to establish consensus. The same argument could be used with regard to any consensus of the Muslims, but that would lead to the invalidation of the idea of consensus as binding proof, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has not obliged us to know what is hidden in people’s minds when it comes to the matter of consensus; rather He has obliged us to go by what people appear to be. Therefore consensus and agreement on the appointment of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq as caliph did indeed occur.\nEnd quote from al-Ibaanah, p. 66\nImam Abu ‘Uthmaan as-Saabooni (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars of hadith confirmed the validity of Abu Bakr’s appointment as caliph after the death of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because he was chosen by the Sahaabah; they were unanimously agreed on that and they all said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was pleased that he should lead us in our religious matters (prayers), therefore we are pleased for him to lead us in our worldly matters. In other words, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed him to lead the people in the obligatory prayers when he was sick, which is their religious affairs, so we accept him as the successor of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to our worldly affairs.\nWhen they said, The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put you ahead of us, so how could we put you back? What they meant was: the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put you ahead to lead us in prayer when he was sick, and we prayed behind you on his orders, so how could we put you back after he put you forward?\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke highly of Abu Bakr when he was alive, which indicated to the Sahaabah that he was the most deserving of being appointed caliph after him. Hence they agreed to rally behind him, and that was to their own benefit, and they gained honour and victory through him.\nEnd quote from ‘Aqeedat as-Salaf wa As-haab al-Hadith, p. 290.\nWe shall mention here the story of how ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) swore allegiance to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq on the first day.\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Haafiz Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi said: Abu’l-Hasan ‘Ali ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Haafiz al-Isfaraayeeni informed us: Abu ‘Ali al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali al-Haafiz told us: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Is-haaq ibn Khuzaymah and Ibraaheem ibn Abi Taalib told us: Bandaar ibn Bashaar told us: Abu Hishaam al-Makhzoomi told us: Wuhayb told us: Dawood ibn Abi Hind told us: Abu Nadrah told us, from Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri, who said:\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed away and the people, including Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, gathered in the house of Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah.\nThe spokesman of the Ansaar stood up and said: Do you know that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was one of the Muhaajireen, and his successor is one of the Muhaajireen, and we are the Ansaar (helpers) of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and we will be the Ansaar (helpers) of his successor as we were his helpers?\n‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab stood up and said Your spokesman has spoken the truth. If you had said something other than this, we would not have accepted that. And he took the hand of Abu Bakr and said: This is the right man, so swear allegiance to him. ‘Umar swore allegiance to him, and the Muhaajireen and Ansaar swore allegiance to him.\nThen Abu Bakr ascended the minbar and looked at the people, and he did not see az-Zubayr.\nSo he called for az-Zubayr, and he came.\nAbu Bakr said: (You are) the son of the paternal aunt of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his disciple; do you want to cause division among the Muslims?\nHe said: There is nothing to worry about, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. Then he stood up and swore allegiance to him.\nThen Abu Bakr looked at the people, and he did not see ‘Ali, so he called ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib and he came.\nAbu Bakr said: (You are) the son of the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his son-in-law; do you want to cause division among the Muslims?\nHe said: There is nothing to worry about, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. Then he stood up and swore allegiance to him.\nAbu ‘Ali al-Haafiz said: I heard Muhammad ibn Is-haaq ibn Khuzaymah say: Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj came to me and asked me about this hadith, so I wrote it down for him on a piece of paper and I read it to him. This hadith is worth a badanah (a valuable camel); indeed it is worth a badrah (sack of money)!\nEnd quote from al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah by Ibn Katheer (5/269).\nA badrah is a big sack full of money; it was said that it is one thousand or ten thousand dirhams, or seven thousand dinars.\nAl-Mu‘jam al-Waseet (p. 43); al-Qaamoos al-Muheet (p. 444).\nThen Ibn Katheer narrated a report about another oath of allegiance that ‘Ali swore after the death of Faatimah (ma y Allah be pleased with her). He said: This oath of allegiance that was sworn by ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) after the death of Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) was in confirmation of the reconciliation between them and it was secondary to the oath of allegiance mentioned above, that was sworn on the day of as-saqeefah, as was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah and classed as saheeh by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj. ‘Ali did not keep his distance from Abu Bakr, during these six months; rather he used to pray behind him, and he was present when Abu Bakr used to meet with some of the senior Sahaabah in order to seek their advice concerning some issues; he was also willing to ride with him on a campaign to Dhu’l-Qassah.\nIn Saheeh al-Bukhaari it says that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed ‘Asr a few days after the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, then he went out of the mosque and found al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali playing with some boys. He carried him on his shoulder and started saying: May my father be sacrificed for the one who looks like the Prophet and does not look like ‘Ali! And ‘Ali smiled (at this joke).\nBut when this second oath of allegiance occurred, some narrators thought that ‘Ali had not sworn allegiance (to Abu Bakr) before that, so they denied that (the first oath of allegiance) had happened. But if someone confirms that something happens, that takes precedence over the report of someone who says that it did not happen, as we have mentioned and explained above. And Allah knows best.\nEnd quote from al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah (5/307)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Scholarly consensus (ijmaa‘) in Islamic jurisprudence is a significant source of authority that serves to unify legal opinions among scholars. It is grounded on the notion that the collective agreement of scholars, especially those of the early generations, holds a distinct weight when deriving rulings or confirming existing legal positions.\n\n### Definition and Importance of Ijmaa‘\n\nIjmaa‘ is defined as the consensus of Islamic scholars on a particular issue following the death of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This concept is significant because it reflects a collective understanding of the Islamic community and helps ensure that interpretations evolve in harmony with the core teachings of Islam.\n\n### Evidence from the Quran and Hadith\n\nWhile the Quran does not explicitly mention ijmaa‘ as a source of law, it emphasizes the necessity of unity among believers and seeking knowledge and guidance through established channels:\n\n1. **Surah Ash-Shuraa (42:10-14)** highlights the importance of consensus and reiterates that matters of disagreement ultimately rest with God. The verse states:\n   > \"In whatever matter you disagree the ultimate judgement rests with God...\" (Ash-Shuraa, Ayah 10).\n   \n   It underscores the collective role of scholars in discerning issues, implying that their agreement (ijmaa‘) is vital to following divine guidance.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Bayyinah (98:4)** discusses that the people of the Book were not divided until after the clear proof came to them, illustrating that a unified response to divine revelation is necessary. It reads:\n   > \"The people of the Book were not divided among themselves till after the clear proof had come to them.\" (Al-Bayyinah, Ayah 4).\n   \n   This indicates the significance of unity and agreement in faith matters.\n\n### The First Consensus in Islam\n\nThe first major consensus (ijmaa‘) that is often cited in Islamic history occurred shortly after the death of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) regarding the compilation of the Quran. During the caliphate of Abu Bakr (RA), following the Battle of Yamama, many of the memorizers of the Quran were killed. Concerned about preserving the Quran, Abu Bakr convened a group led by Zaid bin Thabit (RA), who was one of the scribes of the Prophet. They ultimately agreed to compile the verses into a single book.\n\nFurthermore, another notable early ijmaa‘ can be seen during the time of Umar ibn Al-Khattab (RA) when he instituted the practice of tarawih prayers in congregation during Ramadan, which also garnered support and acceptance from the Companions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIjmaa‘ remains a pivotal aspect of Islamic jurisprudence, reinforcing the importance of collective reasoning in the interpretation and implementation of Islamic teachings. It is derived from the foundational texts and established practices among the companions of the Prophet. The practice of ijmaa‘ helps maintain unity within the Muslim community and ensures a consistent approach to Islamic governance and legal matters.\n\n### References\n\n1. Surah Al-Bayyinah (98:4)\n2.

        "question": "What Is Ijma` and What Are Its Types?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is ijma’?\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“In linguistic terms, ijma` means resolve and agreement. \nIn Shar‘i terms, ijma` means the agreement of the mujtahids of this ummah after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a shar‘i ruling . \nBy saying “agreement” we exclude differences of opinion; if there is a difference of opinion, even from one person, then we cannot say that there is ijma`. \nBy saying “the mujtahids” we exclude the common folk and those who follow or imitate scholars; it does not matter whether they agree or disagree. \nBy saying “this ummah” we exclude the consensus of others, which carries no weight. \nBy saying “after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)” we exclude their agreement at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); ijma` or consensus at that time does not count as evidence, because evidence is established by the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), whether in word or deed or by approval. Hence if a Sahabi says “We used to do” or that they (i.e., people) used to do such and such at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), this is indicative of the approval of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), according to consensus. \nBy saying “on a shar‘i ruling”, we exclude their agreement on a rational or human ruling, which has nothing to do with the matter under discussion, because we are talking about looking for ijma` as one of the kinds of shar‘i evidence. \nEvidence for the authority of ijma`\nIjma` counts as evidence on the basis of a number of pieces of evidence, including the following: \n\nThe verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Thus We have made you (Muslims), a Wasat (just) (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind” [al-Baqarah 2:143].  The words “witnesses over mankind” include testifying about their deeds and judging their deeds, and the words of the witness may be accepted.\nThe verse in which Allah, says (interpretation of the meaning): “(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves” [an-Nisa 4:59] indicate that whatever they agreed upon is sound and correct.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “My ummah will not unanimously agree on misguidance.”\nWe say: If the ummah unanimously agrees on something, it must be either true or false. If it is true, then it is proof. If it is false, how can this ummah, which is the dearest of nations to Allah since the time of its Prophet until the onset of the Hour, agree on something false with which Allah is not pleased? This is quite impossible.\n\nTypes of ijma`  \nIjma` is of two types: definitive and presumptive. \n\nDefinitive is that which is well known and well established, such as consensus that the five daily prayers are obligatory and that zina (fornication, adultery) is haram. No one can deny that this type of ijma` is proven and established, or that it constitutes proof in and of itself, or that the one who rejects it becomes a kafir, unless he is ignorant and may be excused for his ignorance.\nPresumptive is that which can only be known by means of research and study, where the scholars may differ as to whether there is ijma` (on a particular issue) or not. The most correct scholarly opinion concerning that is the view of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, when he said in al-‘Aqidah al-Wasitiyyah: The type of ijma` that is to be accepted is that of the righteous early generations (as-salaf as-salih), because after their time there was a great deal of disagreement and the ummah spread far and wide. End quote.\n\nIt should be noted that the ummah cannot agree on something that is contrary to an unabrogated, clear, sahih text, because it can only agree on what is true. If you see consensus that you think is contrary to that, then it must be one of the following: either the evidence is not clear, or it is not sahih, or it is abrogated, or there is a difference of opinion concerning the matter of which you were not aware. \nWhat are the conditions of ijma`? \nThere are certain conditions for ijma`, such as: \n\nIt should be soundly proven in the sense that it is either well known among the scholars or transmitted by a trustworthy narrator who has read widely.\nIt should not have been preceded by a well-known difference of opinion. If that was the case, then there is no ijma`, because scholarly opinions are not invalidated by the death of their authors.\n\nIjma` does not cancel out a previous difference of opinion; rather it prevents differences of opinion from arising. \nThis is the most correct view, because of the strength of its argument. \nAnd it was said that the second condition is not stipulated, so it is valid in a later period for there to be consensus on one of the previous opinions and for that to serve as proof for those who come afterwards. \nAccording to the majority, it is not essential that those who unanimously agree all die when still holding this view for  ijma` to be established; rather ijma` is established as soon as they (the scholars of a particular era) agree, and it is not permissible for them or anyone else to go against it after that, because the condition for the establishment of ijma` do not include any stipulation that the era (of the scholars who reached this consensus) should have come to an end with their passing. As ijma` is established at the moment they agree (on a particular issue), there is nothing that could cancel it out. \nIf one of the mujtahids (scholars) says or does something and that becomes well known among the mujtahids, and they do not denounce it even though they are able to do so, then it is said that there is ijma`. It was said that this establishes that there is ijma`; others said that it may be regarded as proof but not ijma`; and others said that it is neither ijma` nor proof. And it was said that if they all passed away before denouncing it then it is ijma`, because their silence until the time of their death, even though they were able to denounce it, constitutes proof of their agreement. This is the view that is most likely to be correct.” (Al-Usul min ‘Ilm al-Usul, 62-64) \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "**Ijma` in Islamic Jurisprudence**\n\nIjma`, or consensus, is one of the fundamental sources of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and refers to the unanimous agreement of qualified scholars (fuqaha) on a particular legal ruling following the era of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). In the context of Islamic legal theory, ijma` serves as a secondary source of law after the Quran and the Sunnah (traditions of the Prophet). The concept is based on the belief that Allah’s guidance is reflected through the collective reasoning and scholarly consensus among the ummah (Muslim community) on issues not explicitly covered in holy texts.\n\n### Types of Ijma`\n\nIjma` can be categorized into several types, primarily based on the conditions under which it is established:\n\n1. **Ijma` of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet)**:  \nThis form of ijma` relates to the consensus reached among the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad on specific issues during their time. The actions and decisions taken by the Sahabah are regarded as a strong source of Islamic law. For example, the integration of previous religious laws or practices into Islam reflects their consensus. When certain matters arose, they would discuss and arrive at collective decisions, which are respected by later generations of scholars.\n\n2. **Ijma` of the Fuqaha (Islamic Jurists)**:  \nThis type of ijma` is established by later scholars who have the expertise in providing jurisprudential opinions based on Quranic verses and prophetic traditions. This form of consensus can emerge through scholarly discussions and published legal opinions regarding new situations faced by the community.\n\n3. **Ijma` of the Ummah**:  \nThis is a broader consensus involving the entire Muslim community on certain theological or legislative issues. It emphasizes that the collective agreement of the Muslims can also be a source of law, provided that it reflects a deep understanding of Islamic teachings.\n\n4. **Temporary Ijma`**:  \nSuch ijma` may occur on issues that can change with time or context. For example, a consensus reached on a certain issue based on specific circumstances that may evolve over time reflects how ijma` can be adapted to social changes.\n\n5. **Permanent Ijma`**:  \nThis type refers to consensus that is firmly established and regarded as unchangeable across generations. These rulings are seen as firmly embedded in Islamic tradition and are rarely revisited.\n\n### Supporting Verses from the Quran\n\nWhile the Quran does not directly address the concept of ijma`, its principles can be inferred from the emphasis on community coherence and collective action in Islam. For instance, in **Surah Al-Jumu'ah (62:9)**, the call for community gathering underscores the importance of unity among Muslims:\n\n- **Surah 62 - Al-Jumu'ah (Ayah 9):** \n  \"O you who believe, when the call to prayer is made on the day of congregation, hasten to remember Allah, putting aside your business. This is better for you if you only knew.\"\n\nThis verse highlights the importance of communal worship and decision-making in Islam, indirectly supporting the notion of ijma`. While specific verses explicitly stating ijma` are lacking, the concept finds support in the collective ethos present in the Quran and the Sunnah, as well as the tradition of the Prophet Muhammad advocating for mutual consultation (Shura).\n\nMoreover, consensus is also linked with the significance of following the path of the early community, which is reflected in numerous accounts where the companions sought expert advice and opinions, demonstrating a practical application of ijma`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIjma` is a vital component of Islamic jurisprudence, enriching the Muslim legal system by providing a framework for unified legal principles and practices. Its types reflect the diverse methodologies by which scholars adapt and contextualize Islamic teachings for contemporary issues, ensuring that the principles of Islam remain relevant and just. The references to community coherence, unity in worship, and consultation in the Quran and Sunnah further support the legitimacy and necessity of ijma` in Islam."

        "question": "Is it mustahabb to wash the hands with soap?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIslamic sharee‘ah is a flexible way that is based on general principles and holistic foundations governing human conduct. At the same time it allows room for new developments that occur with changes in time and place. For example, it does not put undue restrictions on people with regard to customs and purely worldly actions; rather it gives them the freedom to act in accordance with what is appropriate to their desires and interests, and what will benefit them, so long as any given custom is not contrary to the text of the Qur’an or Sunnah. This is the meaning of what was affirmed by the fuqaha’ and scholars of usool when they said: The basic principle with regard to customs is that they are permissible and are allowed. \nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with the Muslim benefiting from what has been invented or discovered in modern times, such as cars, airplanes and electricity… and modern means of cleaning the body or clothes. \nThe Muslim is not required to go back to riding camels or using the kind of cleaning agents that were used by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because these are not worship in which he is required to follow the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); rather these are customs and traditions. \nAsh-Shaatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWith regard to customs, the Lawgiver focused on the idea of achieving a given purpose, not on a literal following of a shar‘i text, unlike acts of worship which must be based on a shar‘i text.\nEnd quote from al-Muwaafaqaat, 2/523 \nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) encouraged cleanliness and that which will protect good health in general terms, and for that purpose he used the means and things that were available at his time (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). If something new is introduced and it leads to the same purpose (i.e., cleanliness and maintenance of good health) without causing any harm, then there is nothing wrong with the Muslim using it and benefiting from it. \nIn Islam there are many teachings that are indicative of paying attention to cleanliness of the body, clothing and place where one is. To confirm that, it is sufficient to note that wudoo’ – which involves washing the hands, mouth, nose, and face – is one of the conditions of prayer, which is the foundation of the faith, being valid. \nUsing cleaning agents with water was not widely practised at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) because of the scarcity of these cleaning agents and the scarcity of water itself. \nYet despite that it is proven in the Sunnah that lote leaves may be used in some cases where ghusl is done that require extra attention to care and cleaning, such as washing the deceased prior to burial, ghusl for a woman whose period has ended, and ghusl for the kaafir who becomes Muslim. The fuqaha’ also mentioned using saltwort as well for the purpose of cleaning and bathing. \nSaltwort (salsola) is a plant that grows in sandy ground; it or its ash is used for washing clothes and hands.\nAl-Mu‘jam al-Waseet, 1/91 \nWith regard to lotus, this is a plant that grows on water. Its fruit is the lotus fruit (nabq) and its leaves are used for washing. See: Lisaan al-‘Arab, 4/354 \nIt was narrated that Umm ‘Atiyyah al-Ansaariyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) entered upon us when his daughter died and said: “Wash her three times, or five, or more than that, if you see fit, with water and lotus leaves, and put camphor in the last time, or a little camphor”.\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 1253; Muslim, 939 \nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThis indicates that it is mustahabb or encouraged to use lotus leaves when washing the deceased. There is unanimous agreement that it is mustahabb.\nEnd quote from Sharh Muslim, 7/3 \nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nAl-Maymooni said: I read to Ibn Hanbal: Is it acceptable for the woman whose menses has ended to do ghusl using only water? \nHe dictated to me: If she cannot find anything but water on its own, then she should do ghusl with it. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your water and your lotus leaves,” and this is more than ghusl in the case of janaabah. \nI said: What if she did ghusl using water only, then she found (lotus leaves)? \nHe said: I prefer that she should repeat it, because of what he said.\nEnd quote from Fath al-Baari, 1/471-472 \nIt was narrated from Qaasim ibn ‘Aasim (may Allah be pleased with him) that he became Muslim, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed him to do ghusl using water and lotus leaves.\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi, 605. He said: It is hasan. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi. \nIt is obvious that using lotus leaves when doing ghusl does not come under the heading of acts of worship; rather it is the matter of customs that change with time and place. Whoever uses any cleansing material in the place of lotus leaves has fulfilled the spirit of the Sunnah and has fulfilled the purpose for which the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed people to do ghusl with lotus leaves. \nOn our website, in a number of answers, we have explained that it is not mustahabb to imitate the actions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he did on the grounds that they were customs or personal habits or preferences, and doing so does not bring any greater reward than other customary matters. Rather reward is attained by adhering to Sunnahs of worship and related matters. \nShaykh Dr. Muhammad al-Ashqar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe ruling on these matters of custom and similar issues is that they are indicative of something being permissible, and no more, except in two cases: \n1.Where there is a report of words enjoining or encouraging something, in which case it seems that it is something prescribed in Islam\n2.Where it seems that it is connected to Islam by circumstantial evidence other than words, such as placing the deceased in his grave facing towards the qiblah. That is obviously connected to something that is prescribed in Islam.\nEnd quote from Af‘aal ar-Rasool, 1/237 \nSee also the answer to question no. 69822 \nSecondly: \nWith regard to what you mentioned about not owning a lot of clothes, what is required of the Muslim with regard to food, drink and clothing, and the house in which he lives and the furniture on which he sits, and other such matters, is that he should not go beyond what he needs. So what he has of clothing and furnishings should be in accordance with what he needs and no more than that. If it is more than what he needs, then he comes under the heading of extravagance which is condemned in Islam. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not Al-Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance)”\n[al-An‘aam 6:141]. \nAs-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nExtravagance may mean having more than is sufficient and consuming too much of food that is harmful to the body; or it may mean going to excess in luxury in food, drink and clothing; or it may mean overlooking what is halaal and favouring what is haraam. \n“certainly He (Allah) likes not Al-Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance)” means that Allah hates extravagance and it is harmful to the individual’s body and livelihood, because he may end up being unable to meet his financial obligations. This verse commands us to consume food and drink and it forbids us to neglect them or be extravagant with them. End quote. \nTafseer as-Sa‘di, p. 311 \nIbn Maajah (3605) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Eat and drink, give charity and wear clothes, so long as that does not involve any extravagance or vanity.”\nClassed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the question of whether it is mustahabb (recommended) to wash the hands with soap in Islam, we will look at the relevant Islamic teachings and texts.\n\n### Importance of Cleansing in Islam\n\nThe importance of washing and the general principle of cleanliness is emphasized in various parts of the Qur'an. The main teaching concerning washing before prayer (Salah) is found in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:6):\n\n**Qur'an 5:6**:\n\"O you who believe, when you stand up for the service of prayer, wash your faces and hands up to the elbows, and also wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles.” \n\nThis verse stipulates the washing of hands, along with other body parts, when preparing for prayer, which underscores the significance of cleanliness in worship.\n\n### Further Explanation\n\nIn the context of this verse, washing hands is not merely about rinsing them with water but encompasses the concept of physical cleanliness before engaging in acts of worship. The use of soap, which enhances cleanliness, can be reasonably inferred as supported under this teaching. While the specific mention of soap is not present in the Qur'an, enhancing cleanliness aligns with the broader intent of the guidance provided.\n\n### Importance of Cleanliness in Daily Life\n\nMoreover, Islam stresses the importance of cleanliness in daily activities. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:222), God says:\n\n**Qur'an 2:222**:\n\"Indeed, Allah loves those who are pure and clean.\"\n\nThis statement not only supports the idea that cleanliness is valued in various aspects of life but also suggests that actions contributing to cleanliness, such as washing hands with soap, can be seen as commendable and aligned with Islamic values.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while the Qur'an does not explicitly state that washing hands with soap is mustahabb, the emphasis on cleanliness in both spiritual practice and daily life supports the notion that using soap is beneficial and recommended. Therefore, using soap to wash hands before prayer, in line with the teachings of Islam, can be seen as a way to embody the spirit of cleanliness that the faith encourages.\n\n### References:\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:6**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:222** \n\nUnderstanding these principles reveals a comprehensive expectation of hygiene and cleanliness essential in Islamic practice."

        "question": "If her guardian refuses to give her in marriage to a man who is already married and has children, is he unjustly preventing her from getting married?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If this man is good in terms of\nreligious commitment and character, and you want to marry him, then tell him to\napproach your guardian (wali), and tell your guardian\nabout his good qualities and that you accept him. If your father agrees to\naccept him as a husband for you, then praise be to\nAllah. If he refuses and gives an acceptable reason for that, then it is not\npermissible for you to try to marry him through the imam of the mosque or\nanyone else, because there is saheeh evidence that\nthe approval of the guardian is a condition of marriage being valid and that it\nis not permissible to overlook him so long as he is not unjustly preventing\nmarriage. Unjust prevention of marriage means preventing a woman from marrying\na compatible man of whom she approves.\nFor example, the Prophet (blessings and\npeace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage except with a\nguardian.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2085; at-Tirmidhi, 1101; Ibn Maajah, 1881, from Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be\nupon him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the permission of her\nguardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her\nmarriage is invalid.”\nNarrated by Ahmad, 24417; Abu Dawood, 2083; at-Tirmidhi. 1102.\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani\nin Saheeh al-Jaami‘,\n2709\nIf it is proven that marriage has been\nunjustly prevented, guardianship passes to the next closest male relative (on\nthe father’s side), such as the (paternal) grandfather, then the brother,\nbrother’s son, paternal uncle and so on. If none of these relatives are present\nor they refuse to give the woman in marriage, then she may be given in marriage\nby the Muslim judge if there is one, otherwise the imam of the mosque or a\nMuslim of similar standing may give her in marriage.\nBut if the guardian refuses to give a\ngirl in marriage to a married man who has children, this is not regarded as\nunjustly preventing marriage, because he thinks that it is not appropriate for\nher or he fears that she may suffer in this marriage, or he fears that there\nmay be problems between her and the first wife, as happens in many cases of\nplural marriage, many of which end in failure and termination of married life.\nThe guardian has to look at what is in\nthe best interests of the female relative under his guardianship. In most cases\nhe is better able than she is to let reason and wisdom prevail over emotion,\nhence Islam has given him this duty.\nAn-Nasaa’i\n(3221) narrated that Buraydah said: Abu Bakr and ‘Umar both proposed\nmarriage to Faatimah, but the Messenger of Allah\n(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “She is too young.” Then ‘Ali\nproposed to her and he gave her in marriage to him. This hadeeth\nwas classed as saheeh by al-Albaani\nin Saheeh an-Nasaa’i.\nAs-Sindi said\nin his commentary on an-Nasaa’i: The words “Then ‘Ali\nproposed to her” indicate that happened straight afterwards without any delay,\nas is indicated by the word fa (translated\nhere as “then”). Thus it is known that the Prophet (blessings and peaces of Allah be upon him) thought that she was too young\nfor them (i.e., Abu Bakr and ‘Umar)\nbut that did not apply in ‘Ali’s case. This indicates that being of the same\nage or close in age is something to be paid attention to because it is more\nlikely to lead to harmony. End quote.\nThus it is known that it is possible to\nreject a man who is of good character and religiously committed, if the\nguardian thinks that his daughter is not suitable for him in terms of age or if\nhe fears that she may suffer in the marriage, or that she may have troubles\nwith the co-wife, or he hopes that she may receive a proposal from someone who\nis more suitable for her.\nIt says in Asna’l-Mataalib\n(3/108): It says in al-Ihya’: just as it is mustahabb to marry a virgin, it is mustahabb\nnot to give one’s daughter in marriage except to a virgin who has never been\nmarried, because people usually feel more at ease with the first spouse. End\nquote.\nSo do not object to your parents if they\nreject this suitor, because they have more insight into married life than you\nand they are the keenest of people to get what is good for you. Their opinion\nis based on experience and reasoning, not emotion, and perhaps Allah will bless\nyou with something good by virtue of your obeying your parents.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is not only a personal choice but also involves a familial and societal aspect, particularly concerning consent from guardians or family members. When addressing whether a guardian is being unjust by refusing to wed a woman to a man who is already married and has children, the discussion must consider several Quranic principles and verses.\n\n### Context of Marriage in Islam\n\n1. **The Role of Guardianship**:\n   The Quran emphasizes the rights and responsibilities of guardians and the importance of family in the marriage process. According to Surah An-Nisa (Chapter 4), marrying without the consent of a guardian can invoke concerns about family welfare and ethical conduct.\n\n2. **Conditions for Marriage**:\n   Surah An-Nisa (4:24) specifies that \"forbidden are married women unless they are captives (of war)\" (Quran 4:24). This verse defines the permissibility of marrying women already in marriages, making it clear that such unions are generally not acceptable unless under specific circumstances. Thus, a guardian who refuses a marriage to a married man is adhering to Islamic regulations.\n\n3. **Equity in Marriage**:\n   There is a moral imperative in Islam addressing equity and fairness from both parties in a marriage. For instance, Surah An-Nisa (4:3) states that if a man fears he cannot be equitable to multiple wives, he should marry only one (Quran 4:3). This highlights the importance of fairness in marital relationships and reflects on a guardian's responsibility to protect the potential bride from unfair situations.\n\n### Analysis of Injustice\n\n1. **Guardianship Responsibilities**: \n   A guardian's role is to act in the best interests of the woman. If the guardian believes that marrying a man who is already married may not provide a favorable or equitable environment or cause harm to the woman's dignity and rights, their refusal is justified (Quran 4:3).\n\n2. **Parental and Familial Consent**: \n   The Quran emphasizes the importance of families in the consent process. For example, Surah An-Nisa (4:25) encourages marrying women with the consent of their families (Quran 4:25). Should a guardian have serious reservations based on the man's existing commitments and the potential complications in the woman's life, these concerns should be respected.\n\n3. **Potential for Unjust Treatment**:\n   Additionally, the Quran warns against scenarios that could lead to injustice or unfair treatment. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:230) indicates the complexities involved in marital relations, especially concerning divorce and remarriage (Quran 2:230). A guardian might consider how a second marriage could impact the woman positively or negatively before giving consent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the scriptural bases regarding the conditions of marriage and the protections afforded to women in Islam, if a guardian refuses to allow a woman to marry a man who is already married and has children, this decision does not inherently constitute injustice. Rather, it aligns with the Islamic principles surrounding guardianship, consent, and the equitable treatment of women. In this context, the guardian's refusal could be considered a protective measure rather than a form of oppression, as outlined by the teachings of the Quran. \n\n### Supporting Verses\n1. **Surah An-Nisa (4:24)** - \"Also forbidden are married women unless they are captives (of war). Such is the decree of God.\"\n2. **Surah An-Nisa (4:3)** - \"If you fear you cannot treat so many with equity, marry only one.\"\n3. **Surah An-Nisa (4:25)** - \"Marry them with the consent of their people and give them an appropriate dowry.\"\n4. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:230)** - \"When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honorably or let them go with honor.\""

        "question": "Words and deeds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) before his mission began",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) before his mission began are outside of the legislative Sunnah, and that we are not required to follow him or take him as an example in that regard, except in cases where sharee’ah – after his mission began – affirmed that something was prescribed or Islamically acceptable, either by way of being obligatory or mustahabb, such as fulfilling promises, helping the destitute, honouring guests, helping people when calamity strikes and so on. In that case we are obliged to follow his example, because it became a law for us after his Prophethood began, and not just because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did it before he was a Prophet. Based on this, there are some actions that he did before his mission began that we are not obliged to follow, either because there is no proof that it is prescribed for us or because there are reports to show that it was abrogated after his mission began. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The things that happened before Prophethood are not mentioned as things to be followed or that are legislated, as is the case with his actions after Prophethood, because the Muslims are unanimously agreed that what is obligatory with regard to believing in him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and following what he brought, is that which has to do with what happened after he became the Prophet. \nHence whoever stays away from Jumu’ah prayer and prayers in congregation, and lives alone in caves and mountains, where there is no Jumu’ah or prayer in congregation, and claims to be following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) because he was used to worship alone in the cave of Hira’ before his Prophethood, thus forsaking the acts of worship that were prescribed and enjoined by Allah and His Messenger, and following the example of what he used to do before Prophethood, is wrong. That is because, after Allah honoured him with Prophethood, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) no longer did what he used to do before that, of worshipping alone in the cave of Hira and so on.  \nNone of his Sahaabah after him went to the Cave of Hira’, and they did not stay away from Jumu’ah prayer or prayers in congregation in isolated places, and none of them observed any kind of forty-day retreat, as some of the later Muslims did. Rather they worshipped Allah by means of the prescribed acts of worship that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordained for them. End quote from Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (18/10). \nWith regard to the muhaddithoon (scholars of hadeeth), they paid attention to what was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at all times, even if it was before his mission began. That is part of the Sunnah according to the definition of the muhaddithoon, who regard everything that was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as Sunnah, so they narrated it in their books on that basis. \nSee: Af’aal al-Rasool sall-Allahu ‘alayhi wa sallam wa Dalaalatuhaa ‘ala al-Ahkaam, by Dr. Muhammad al-‘Aroosi (149). \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Before the mission of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) began, his character and actions were of utmost importance and played a significant role in preparing him for the responsibilities of prophethood. Here are some key aspects of his words and deeds before his mission, along with relevant citations from the Qur'an. \n\n### Words and Deeds Characterizing the Prophet Before His Mission\n\n1. **Honesty and Trustworthiness**: \n   - The Prophet Muhammad was known for his honesty, earning the title \"Al-Amin\" (the Trustworthy) even before he received revelation. His integrity was well-recognized by his community, which is evident from various historical accounts.\n   - While the Qur'an mainly discusses his role as a messenger, it also emphasizes qualities that define good character. For instance, Surah Al-Anfal highlights the importance of trustworthiness and guidance in community affairs.\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Anfal (8:27) - \"O you who have believed, do not betray Allah and the Messenger or betray your trusts while you know [the consequence].\"\n\n2. **Reputation as a Moral Example**: \n   - His behavior was exemplary—he acted justly, treated people kindly, and stood against corruption and injustice long before the advent of Islam. His character set the groundwork for the following revelations and leadership roles he would take on.\n   - This moral grounding is often reiterated in how messengers are portrayed within the Qur'an.\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Ahzab (33:21) - \"Indeed in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example...\"\n\n3. **Indication of Prophethood**:\n   - The Prophet's life was marked by signs that indicated his future role as a prophet. His sincere contemplation and prayer indicated his depth of spiritual awareness and yearning for truth. This period of reflection is crucial before receiving divine revelation.\n   - This idea is underscored in Surah Al-Hajj, which speaks of God's choice of messengers.\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Hajj (22:75) - \"God chooses messengers from the angels and from the people...\"\n\n4. **Connection to Previous Prophets**:\n   - The Qur'an often connects the Prophet Muhammad with earlier prophets, emphasizing the continuity of the message of monotheism. His understanding of previous revelations was critical to his role as a prophet.\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-A'raf (7:157) - \"Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel...\"\n\n5. **Resilience and Patience**:\n   - The trials faced by the Prophet before the advent of his mission are essential. His experience with family and societal pressures provided him with the resilience necessary for bearing the burdens of not just being a prophet but also a leader.\n   - His patience and steadfastness in the face of difficulty is recognized in the Qur'an.\n   - **Citation**: Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:227) - \"Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds and remember Allah often and defend themselves after they have been wronged...\"\n\n6. **Worship and Reflection**:\n   - During this time, he also engaged in prayer and worship at the Kaaba, reflecting on the themes of monotheism that permeated his environment, leading to a deep spiritual understanding.\n   - The significance of devotion and worship is acknowledged throughout the Qur'an as necessary for all believers, and was especially relevant as a precursor to divine guidance.\n   - **Citation**: Surah Al-Isra (17:23) - \"And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment...\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe period leading up to his prophetic mission was characterized by a life of deep moral standing, trustworthiness, and contemplation of the divine truths that would later manifest in the revelations from Allah. His exemplary character laid a strong foundation that garnered respect and credibility from those around him, essential for the mission he would undertake as the last prophet. The Qur'an reflects these aspects beautifully, not only to illuminate his preparation for prophethood but also to establish his role as a model for all believers."

        "question": "What is the ruling on voice-acting on the radio?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      There are previous answers\n      dealing with acting and what is connected to it. Please see\n      the answers to questions no. 10836 and \n\t\t22442. \n    \n\n      In the answer to question no.\n      14488 there is a fatwa\n      of the Standing Committee which states that it is haraam to\n      act the part of any of the Companions of the Prophet\n      (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in movies, plays\n      and so on. \n    \n\n      In those answers it also\n      says:\n    \n\n      1.\n    \n\n      There is no difference between\n      voice acting and acting that is seen. \n    \n\n      2.\n    \n\n      There is no difference of\n      opinion among the scholars that acting which involves\n      indecency, free mixing or any haraam content or actions is\n      haraam. \n    \n\n      3.\n    \n\n      None of the scholars permit\n      acting in general terms; rather they have stipulated\n      conditions and guidelines. \n    \n\n      4.\n    \n\n      It is not appropriate to do a\n      great deal of permissible acting -- according to those who\n      say that it is permissible -- even if that is for the sake of\n      calling people to Allah. \n    \n\n      After searching a great deal, we\n      did not find any fatwa by any of our senior scholars that\n      speaks specifically of voice acting. What seems to be the\n      case is that there is no difference between voice acting on\n      the radio and acting that is seen, as it is all acting,\n      whether the view is that it is permissible or that it is\n      forbidden. But there is no doubt that acting that is seen is\n      more serious in terms of fitnah and causes more corruption,\n      because temptation caused by a living, visible image is not\n      the same as temptation caused by a voice that is merely\n      heard. But we are speaking of acting in and of itself,\n      regardless of what other things may accompany\n      it. \n    \n\n      And Allah knows\n      best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether voice-acting on the radio is permissible in Islam is not directly addressed in the Quran, but we can derive insights from relevant verses and established Islamic principles concerning speech, truthfulness, and the impact of sound.\n\n1. **Moderation in Speech**: Surah 31 (Luqman), Ayah 19 says: \n   \"Be moderate in your bearing, and keep your voice low. Surely the most repulsive voice is the donkey's.\"\n   - This verse emphasizes the importance of speaking moderately and the quality of one’s voice. While voice-acting can be expressive and engaging, it is crucial to consider whether the content adheres to goodness and moderation, as excessive or inappropriate speech can lead to undesired outcomes.\n\n2. **Purpose and Content**: The character of the speech or message being conveyed in voice-acting is significant. Surah 49 (Al-Hujurat), Ayah 2 states:\n   \"O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, and do not speak loudly to him as you do with one another lest your deeds are nullified unconsciously.\"\n   - This verse informs us about the necessity of respect in communication, especially in relation to important figures. If voice acting contains disrespectful or mocking content, it could be questioned in terms of its permissibility.\n\n3. **Truthfulness and Avoiding Falsehood**: Surah 16 (An-Nahl), Ayah 116 warns against uttering lies: \n   \"Do not utter the lies your tongues make up: 'This is lawful, and this is forbidden,' in order to impute lies to God.\"\n   - Voice-acting that promotes falsehood or misinformation would contradict Islamic principles, as it misleads the audience.\n\n4. **Impacts of Sound**: Surah 78 (An-Naba), Ayah 35-39 conveys a significant environment of accountability where speaking statements of right is highlighted. \n   \"None will speak except who is permitted by Ar-Rahman and says what is right.\"\n   - This indicates that whatever is expressed, including through voice-acting, is held to scrutiny, establishing another layer of understanding regarding the implications of voice in Islam.\n\n5. **Spreading Goodness**: If voice-acting is used as a medium to educate, inspire, or uphold moral values, it can fit well within the Islamic paradigm of beneficial speech. Encouraging righteous behavior through medium can be a form of 'Amr bil Ma'ruf wa Nahyi an al-Munkar' (enjoining good and forbidding what is wrong).\n\nIn summary, while the Quran does not specifically address the permissibility of voice-acting on the radio, the content and manner of speech are crucial determinants. If the voice-acting promotes Islamic values and respectful communication while avoiding falsehood and harmful content, it could be deemed permissible. However, if it contains anything contrary to these principles, then it would be advisable to refrain. Always consider the context and the messages being conveyed through voice-acting and align them with Islamic teachings."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The ahaadeeth which must be accepted and taken as evidence \n    are the acceptable ahaadeeth: those which are saheeh or hasan.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, ahadeeth (plural of hadeeth) are the recorded sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). These narrations serve as vital sources of guidance in Islamic law (Sharia) alongside the Qur'an. The ahadeeth can be classified into several categories based on their authenticity, the chain of transmission (isnad), and their content. To answer your question about what ahadeeth may be used as Shar’i evidence, I will elaborate on the types of ahadeeth that are deemed acceptable and important for juristic purposes.\n\n### Categories of Ahadeeth:\n1. **Sahih (Authentic)**:\n   These ahadeeth have a continuous chain of reliable narrators and conform to Islamic teachings. They are widely accepted and used for deriving legal rulings. The most well-known collections of sahih ahadeeth include Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim.\n\n   **Example**: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said: \"Actions are judged by intentions\" (Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 1).\n\n2. **Hasan (Good)**:\n   Ahadeeth that are slightly less rigorously authenticated than sahih but are still considered reliable. They may come from narrators who are trustworthy but whose memories were not as strong.\n\n   **Example**: An example is the hadeeth where the Prophet (peace be upon him) says: \"Verily, Allah is Beautiful and loves beauty\" (Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 2246). \n\n3. **Da'if (Weak)**:\n   These ahadeeth lack strong chains of transmission. While they cannot be used for legal rulings, they may be employed for encouraging good deeds or in other non-legal contexts, provided that they do not contradict stronger narrations.\n\n4. **Mawdu' (Fabricated)**:\n   These are ahadeeth that have been knowingly fabricated and falsely attributed to the Prophet. They are entirely rejected and do not hold any legal weight.\n\n### Qur'anic Support and Ahaadeeth Use\nThe Qur'an emphasizes the importance of obedience to the Prophet Muhammad and the necessity of his teachings in guiding believers. Relevant verses include:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:92)**: \"Obey God and the Apostle, and beware. If you turn away, remember that the duty of Our Apostle is to give you a clear warning.\"\n  \n- **Surah An-Anfal (8:20)**: \"O you who have believed, obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from him while you hear.\"\n\nThese verses underline the need to follow the Prophet’s guidance, which is articulated through ahadeeth. \n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, authentic (Sahih) and good (Hasan) ahadeeth serve as crucial sources of shar’i evidence in Islamic jurisprudence. They provide context, clarify legal rulings, and elaborate on Qur'anic injunctions. Weak ahadeeth may be referenced in non-legislative contexts, whereas fabricated ahadeeth should be avoided entirely. The Qur’an itself supports the use of the hadith as a vital aspect of Islamic teachings, emphasizing obedience to the Prophet and adherence to the divine guidance. \n\nFor more details on specific ahadeeth and their classifications, the traditional collections like Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim are recommended resources."

        "question": "Religious titles in Islam and Christianity",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The religion which Allaah has chosen is the religion of Tawheed, Islam, for which He sent the Messengers and revealed the Books. It is by His grace towards His slaves that He has preserved this religion and decreed that it will survive and continue and its basic principles will be preserved through the sincere and devout scholars who are entrusted with the Revelation and who bear that trust and deliver it as enjoined by their Lord.  \nAmong previous nations in history there has been distortion and changing of the contents of the messages of the Prophets to a great extent, because most of their scholars betrayed the trust and sold the covenant of Allaah for a small price. They were misled by their whims and desires and by the shaytaan, and they introduced into the religion things for which Allaah gave no permission. One of the most serious ways in which they distorted the message of the Prophets was by introducing the principle of al-waasitah (mediation) between Allaah and His creation, between the almighty Lord and His slaves, thus aiming to protect the thrones of the tyrants who oppressed the people thereby and held their destiny in their hands, through the body that spoke in the name of “heaven”. They invented names and titles for this organization and classified them in varying degrees and levels, where the clergyman could progress through the ranks that had been invented in the name of “the Lord” until he reached the position of acting as the deputy of “God” as the “high priest” or “pope”. \nThe English historian Wills said in his book, Milestones of Human History (3/270):  \nBut even though the fully-developed Christianity of the fourth century preserved the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels as its foundation, it was in essence a sacerdotal religion of the type that had been familiar to people for thousands of years. The altar was the focus of its elaborate rituals and the essential act of worship was the sacrifice consecrated by the priest for the Mass, and it had a structure that quickly formed, composed of the deacons, priests and bishops. End quote. \nThis body developed its authority and its method of organization from the political hierarchy of the Roman Empire as Shaykh Safar al-Hawaali said in his book al-‘Ulmaaniyyah (79): \nThe presence of priests and monks within the Roman Empire helped to support their position and reinforce it, because they copied from the political system and hierarchy of the state the idea of creating a priestly system and hierarchy. Just as the state system resembled a pyramid with the emperor at the top and the troops at the bottom, the church system also resembled a pyramid, with the pope at the top and the priests at the bottom. As a result of the principle of separating church and state, the empire took care of sponsoring the church hierarchy, and did not find anything in it that contradicted or opposed the state hierarchy. Thus it was settled and became strong. End quote. \nBut in the sharee’ah of Islam that was divinely protected, you do not find the kind of class system that could reinforce tyranny and oppression, and you can only find texts which speak of equality among all people and state that the best of them are those who are most pious and closest to Allaah and who follow His laws most closely. \nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At‑Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]”\n[al-Hujuraat 49:13] \n“And for all, there will be degrees according to that which they did, that He (Allaah) may recompense them in full for their deeds. And they will not be wronged”\n[al-Ahqaaf 46:19]\nHence the essence of Islamic sharee’ah is based on cancelling out the mediation of bandits who come between the people and Allaah in the name of “mediation” or “intercession”. Islam attributes this attitude to the mushrikeen who fought the message of Tawheed, of whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And they worship besides Allaah things that harm them not, nor profit them, and they say: ‘These are our intercessors with Allaah.’ Say: ‘Do you inform Allaah of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?’ Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they associate as partners (with Him)!”\n[Yoonus 10:18]\nThe guided French scholar Naasir al-Deen Dinet said: \nThe issue of mediation was one of the major issues in which Islam superseded all other religions, because there is no intermediary between Allaah and His slave. There are no priests or monks in Islam; these intermediaries are the cause of all evil in other religions and that is indeed the case no matter what their beliefs and no matter how sincere they are and how good their intentions. The Messiah himself understood that. Did he not drive the sellers out of the temple? But his followers do not act as he did, and today if Jesus were to return how many like the sellers in the temple would he drive out?  End quote from al-‘Ulmaaniyyah (p. 81). \nAs for the status of the fuqaha’ and scholars in Islam, it is purely academic, i.e., whether a person has enough knowledge to qualify him to talk about religion is based on his studies and academic qualifications and what he has learned from universities, study circles and books. It has nothing to do with any religious hierarchical body or priestly rituals that give them authority in the name of the Lord. Rather it is a level of specialized knowledge – as in any other field of knowledge studied by specialists. They may be correct or incorrect, and they are subject to criticism on the basis of evidence. None of them has any authority or power to declare things halaal or haraam, or to issue commands and prohibitions, except the Lord of the Worlds. They are no more than conveyors of His laws, and teachers who tell the people of what was revealed from the Lord of the Worlds. Moreover, as we have pointed out, they are not infallible in their understanding of the message brought by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or in the way they preserve it and convey it. Rather the infallible ruling, which Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it (cf. Fussilat 41:42), and which is to be referred to in the case of a dispute, is the Revelation of Allaah, may He be exalted: His Holy Book and what is narrated in saheeh reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then that on which there is consensus among the ummah, for his ummah cannot agree on misguidance. \nThe titles and names that the scholars bestow on some of them, or that the people bestow on them, are only referring to the level of knowledge that a person acquires of the rulings of sharee’ah. There may also be a kind of distinguishing the type of knowledge in which a person has specialized, such as faqeeh and mufti for those who have specialized in fiqh and issuing fatwas, respectively, or mufassir for the one who has specialized in tafseer or commentary on the Book of Allaah, or muhaddith and hafiz for those who have specialized in the study of hadeeth. \nThe scholar may also be given titles of praise for his vast knowledge and learning, such as Shaykh al-Islam or ‘Allaamah or Imam and other such titles which ascribe knowledge and learning to those who are entitled to them. In no way are they meant as indicators of priestly status that has been earned in a gradual manner through stages of devotion and monasticism.  \nEven describing the academic level by using these titles is not something precise, such that the one who reaches a certain level will be called by a different name than someone who has reached a lower level. Rather they are relative descriptions and do not refer to precise distinctions between one level and another, and they are not indicative of different levels of knowledge, rather they point to general praise or particular specializations. \nThere is no precise difference between the titles of imam, ‘aalim and Shaykh and it is not permissible for anyone to understand their usage in books or by scholars in terms of the innovations of other nations with regard to clergymen and priests. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In both Islam and Christianity, religious titles hold significant meaning, reflecting the beliefs and structures within each faith. Below, I will explore the titles associated with each tradition, drawing on relevant Quranic verses to highlight Islamic perspectives.\n\n### 1. **Titles in Christianity**\n\nIn Christianity, significant titles for Jesus Christ include:\n- **The Son of God**: This title emphasizes the divine nature of Jesus and His unique relationship with God the Father.\n- **Messiah / Christ**: This title, derived from the Hebrew word \"Mashiach,\" meaning \"anointed one,\" refers to Jesus’s role as the promised deliverer.\n- **Savior**: This title reflects the belief that Jesus died to save humanity from sin.\n\n#### Supporting Verses:\n- The concept of Jesus as \"the Son of God\" is emphasized in various Christian texts but is directly contested in the Quran. \n    - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:72-75)**: “They are surely infidels who say: 'God is the Christ, son of Mary...'” (5:72)\n  \n### 2. **Titles in Islam**\n\nIn Islam, the Prophet Muhammad is frequently referred to by several titles that encapsulate his role and mission:\n- **The Messenger of God (Rasulullah)**: This title signifies his role as the prophet sent by Allah to convey His message.\n- **The Seal of the Prophets (Khatam an-Nabiyyin)**: Emphasizes that he is the last in a line of prophets that includes figures such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.\n- **The Prophet (Nabi)**: This title encompasses his role as a prophet for the Muslim community, delivering revelations from God.\n\n#### Supporting Verses:\n1. **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:67)**: \"O Messenger! Deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord. And if you do not, you have not delivered His message. And Allah will protect you from the people...\"\n  \n2. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:40)**: \"Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets. And Allah has full knowledge of all things.\"\n  \n3. **Surah Al-Hajj (22:78)**: \"...He has chosen you and laid no hardship on you in the way of faith, the faith of your forbear Abraham.\"\n\n### 3. **Common Ground and Distinctive Differences**\n\nWhile both traditions designate titles to signify important theological beliefs, there are notable differences in interpretation:\n- Christian titles for Jesus emphasize His divine nature and His role in salvation. The Quran, however, clarifies that Jesus is a revered prophet and servant of God, but not divine.\n- The Quran addresses the relationship between Jesus and God, emphasizing oneness. For example, **Surah Al-Nisa (4:171)** states, “O people of the Book, do not be fanatical in your faith... The Messiah who is Jesus, son of Mary, was only an apostle of God...”\n\n### 4. **Attention to Followers of the Book**\n\nIslam acknowledges the previous scriptures of Christianity and Judaism (the Torah and the Gospel), affirming that people should follow them if they seek righteousness. However, it also posits that ultimate truth is found in the Quran. In **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:111-115)**, the text discusses the claims of different sects, emphasizing that adherence to God's guidance is essential.\n\n#### Supporting Verses:\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:136)**: \"Say, 'We believe in Allah and what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants, and what was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord.'\"\n  \n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:68)**: \"Say to the People of the Book, 'You have no ground (for argument) until you follow the Torah and the Gospel and what has been revealed to you by your Lord.'\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, religious titles in both Islam and Christianity serve to define spiritual understandings, convey theological concepts, and express the respective faiths’ unique perspectives on divinity and prophecy. The titles serve both to unify followers within each religion and to delineate distinctions between their beliefs, particularly concerning the nature of Jesus Christ and the finality of the prophetic message. The Quranic verses provide insight into Islamic views, emphasizing the importance of oneness in God and the acknowledgment of prophets without attributing divinity to them."

        "question": "Our attitude towards the differences of opinion among the imams with regard to covering the face",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nAt the time of the Revelation, the Muslims learned the rulings of Islam from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) through the verses of the Holy Qur’aan and the ahaadeeth of his Sunnah. Hence there were no differences of opinion among them except with regard to some minor issues. If that happened, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would explain to them what was correct. \nWhen the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died and the Sahaabah spread out to various regions to teach the people Islam, there appeared some differences with regard to some matters of fiqh which arose at different times and in different places. These differences were due to a number of reasons, which we will sum up here from the words of the scholars: \n1-The evidence had not reached the one who held a different opinion, and he made a mistake in forming his opinion.\n2-The hadeeth had reached the scholar, but he did not regard the transmitter as trustworthy, and he thought that it went against something that was stronger, so he followed that which he thought was stronger than it.\n3-The hadeeth had reached him but he forgot it.\n4-The hadeeth had reached him but he understood it in a way other than the intended meaning.\n5-The hadeeth reached him but it was abrogated, and he did not know the abrogating text.\n6-He thought that it contradicted something that was stronger than it, whether that was a text or scholarly consensus (ijmaa’)\n7-The scholar used a weak hadeeth as the basis for his ruling, or he derived the ruling by means of weak arguments.\nFor a detailed discussion of these reasons and others, see  Raf’ al-Malaam ‘an al-A’immati’l-A’laam by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, and al-Khilaaf bayna al-‘Ulama’: Asbaabuhu wa Mawqifuna minhu by Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen. \nWe think that what we have mentioned about the reasons for differences among the scholars i.e., with regard to matters of fiqh, will be clear to you, in sha Allaah. \nSecondly: \nWhat should the Muslim’s attitude be towards differences that arise between the scholars? In other words, which scholarly opinion should the Muslim follow in matters where they differed? The answer depends: \n1 – If the Muslim is one who has studied shar’i knowledge and learned its basic principles and minor issues, and he can distinguish right from wrong with regard to scholarly views, then he has to follow that which he thinks is correct and ignore that which he thinks is wrong. \n2 – If he is one of the rank and file, or has not studied shar’i knowledge, and thus cannot distinguish between right and wrong with regard to scholarly views, then he must follow the fatwa of a scholar whose knowledge he trusts and who he believes to be trustworthy and religiously committed, whether he is from his own country or another country, and differences between scholars will not matter after that. He does not have to change what he is doing because he hears another scholar issuing a fatwa that differs from the one he is following, unless he realizes that what he learned later on is the correct view, on the basis of his confidence in the religious commitment and knowledge of the second Shaykh. \nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nThe one who has knowledge of evidence is required to follow the evidence, even if it goes against some of the imams, if it does not go against the consensus of the ummah. \nThe one who does not have any knowledge should ask the scholars, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  “So ask  of those who know the Scripture, if you know not” [al-Nahl 16:43]. He should ask one who he thinks has more knowledge and is more religiously committed, but that does not mean that doing so obligatory, because the one who is better may make a mistake with regard to a particular issue, and the one who is regarded as less knowledgeable may be right with regard to it. But priority should be given to following the one who is more knowledgeable and more religiously committed. \nSee also the answers to questions no. 8294 and 10645. \nThirdly: \nIf you ask about our view on the issue of covering the face, the most correct scholarly view in our opinion is that it is obligatory to cover the face in front of non-mahram men. There is a great deal of evidence and scholarly views concerning that, as among the Maalikis. Many of them said that it is not permissible for a woman to uncover her face in front of non-mahram men, not because it is ‘awrah but because uncovering it runs the risk of fitnah. But some of them think that it is ‘awrah. Hence women, in their view, are forbidden to go out in front of non-mahram men with their faces uncovered. \nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen”\n[al-Ahzaab 33:53]\nal-Qaadi Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maaliki (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nThe entire woman is ‘awrah, her body and her voice, so it is not permissible to uncover that except in cases of necessity, such as when testimony is given against her, or medical treatment, or asking her about her health issues. End quote. \nAhkaam al-Qur’aan by Ibn al-‘Arabi (3/1578, 1579). \nAl-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him), who is also Maaliki, said: \nThis verse indicates that Allaah has given permission to ask of them from behind a screen if there is some need, or when they ask a question about something. That includes all women. Because it is a basic shar’i principle that the entire woman is ‘awrah, her body and her voice – as stated above –it is not permissible to uncover that except in cases of necessity such as when testimony is given against her, or medical treatment, or asking her about her health issues. End quote. \nIn al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam al-Qur’aan (14/227) it says: \nFor more information on the views of Maaliki fuqaha’ concerning the obligation for women to cover their faces, see: al-Ma’yaar al-Mu’arrab by al-Wanshireesi (10/165 and 11/226 and 229), Mawaahib al-Jaleel by al-Hattaab (3/141), al-Dhakheerah by al-Quraafi (3/307) and Haashiyat al-Dasooqi ‘ala al-Sharh al-Kabeer (2/55). \nWe have discussed this issue and its evidence in more than one answer on this site. Please see the answers to questions no. 11774, 12525, 13998, 21134 and 21536. \nFourthly: \nWith regard to what you mention about the laws in your country forbidding women to cover their faces, that is something that makes us feel very sad, to hear that covering and chastity are being opposed and wanton display and unveiling are being encouraged everywhere, especially when that happens in a country that is supposed to be Muslim. \nIf the laws forbid women to cover, and you fear persecution because of covering your faces, then there is no sin on you if you do not do it in that case, so long as that is based on necessity. So a woman should not go out of her house with her face uncovered except in cases of necessity. If she can break the law and put up with a little bit of hassle, let her do so for there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. \nSee also the answer to question no. 2198 and 45672. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Attitude Towards Differences of Opinion Among the Imams Regarding Covering the Face in Islam\n\nIn Islam, the topic of covering the face, or hijab, evokes a diversity of opinions among scholars and imams. This variety stems from interpretations of the Quran and Hadith, as well as differing contexts and cultural practices. The attitudes we adopt towards these differences can be grounded in several Quranic principles.\n\n#### 1. **Respect for Diversity of Opinion**\nIslam values the diversity of scholarly interpretation. In **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:143-147)**, we find Allah stating that He has made the believers a \"temperate people\" (ummatan wasatan) and that they are to act as witnesses over others. This indicates a recognition that different perspectives exist even when following the same faith. \n\n> \"And thus have We made you a just (balanced) nation that you will be witnesses over the people...\" (_Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:143_).\n\nThis verse suggests that differing opinions, when grounded in the pursuit of truth and submission to God, should not be a source of division among believers but rather a reason for enrichment in understanding.\n\n#### 2. **Unity in Faith and Action**\nWhile respecting differences, **Surah Ali 'Imran (3:105-109)** cautions against disunity among believers. It states that those who become disunited and differ among themselves face severe consequences. Thus, it is essential to engage in respectful dialogue surrounding differences in opinion, including matters such as hijab.\n\n> \"So do not be like those who became divided and disagreed after clear proofs had come to them...\" (_Surah Ali 'Imran, 3:105_).\n\n#### 3. **Piety and Good Deeds**\nAnother key principle is stressed in **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2)**, which emphasizes cooperation in good deeds and piety while refraining from hostility. Regardless of how one interprets the requirement of covering the face, the focus should remain on assisting one another in what is good.\n\n> \"And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression...\" (_Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:2_).\n\nThis suggests that discussions about hijab should be rooted in fostering environments of support and moral behavior rather than confrontation.\n\n#### 4. **Obedience and Surrender to God’s Commands**\nIn **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:32-36)**, there is an instruction directed at the wives of the Prophet, highlighting the importance of adherence to divine guidelines. While these verses are specifically about the wives of the Prophet, the broader concept of obedience to God's directives applies universally. This underscores the need for believers to seek out and adhere to teachings derived from the Quran and authentic Hadith, while still engaging with differing scholarly interpretations with respect.\n\n> \"No believing men and believing women have any choice in the matter when God and His Messenger have decreed a matter...\" (_Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:36_).\n\n#### 5. **Encouragement of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Good**\nAdditionally, there is a call in **Surah Al-Imran (3:104)** for a group among the believers to call to the good, enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong. This suggests that believers should seek knowledge about various perspectives and approach discussions on matters like hijab with an intent to educate, share, and promote righteousness.\n\n> \"And let there be [arising] from you a group inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong...\" (_Surah Ali 'Imran, 3:104_).\n\n### Conclusion\nWhen considering the differences of opinion among imams regarding covering the face, it is crucial to maintain an attitude of respect, engage in understanding, and prioritize the principles of piety and cooperation in goodness. The Quran encourages believers to seek knowledge and understand diverse interpretations while emphasizing the importance of unity and common good. Ultimately, obedience to God’s commands remains at the center of these discussions, which should be approached with kindness, openness, and a willingness to seek the truth together."
