        "question": "Is it permissible for the mother to take some of the wealth of her children who are in her custody?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that the mother who has custody of her children does not have the right to take anything from her children’s maintenance money in return for taking care of them; rather she is entrusted with the money that is sent for her children’s maintenance and is expected to dispose of it according to what is in their best interests.\nAd-Dardir al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said: She does not have the right to spend any of her child’s maintenance money on herself in return for taking care of the child. End quote from Bulghat as-Salik li Aqrab al-Masalik (2/765).\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible for the father and mother to take from their children’s wealth for their needs, so long as it does not harm the children.\nIt was narrated from ‘A’ishah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “A man’s son is part of his earnings, among the best of his earnings, so you may take from their wealth.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3529); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIbn al-Amir as-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is soundly narrated from Abu’z-Zubayr that he heard Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah say: The father and mother may take from their child’s wealth without his permission.\nEnd quote from Risalah Latifah fi Sharh Hadith Anta wa Maluka li Abik (p. 24). The report was narrated by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla with his isnad (6/385).\nIt was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your children are a gift from Allah to you, {He gives to whom He wills female [children], and He gives to whom He wills males} [al-Shoora 42:49]. They and their wealth are yours if you need it.” Narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (3123), who said: It is sahih according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim. Also narrated by al-Bayhaqi in al-Kubra (15745). Classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (2564). See the commentary of Shu‘ayb al-Arna’ut et al. on Sunan Ibn Majah, hadith no. 2137.\nAs-Sawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that it is permissible for the mother to take from her child’s wealth, if she is in difficulty, and she does not regard it as being in return for looking after the child:\nShe does not have the right to spend on herself in return for looking after the child.\nBut if it is for another reason – meaning that she takes it for a reason other than looking after the child – and is in difficulty, then she may spend on herself from the child’s wealth, whether what she takes is less than the going rate for looking after the child or more than that, because she is entitled to maintenance even if she does not look after the child.\nEnd quote from Hashiyat as-Sawi ‘ala ash-Sharh as-Saghir (2/765).\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: The father has the right to take from his child’s wealth so long as it will not harm the child or take what the child needs, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of what you consume is your earnings, and your children are among your earnings.” And he said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” This undoubtedly refers to the father’s rights, but it also includes the mother’s rights, because she is like the father according to the correct view. So she may take from her child’s wealth that which will benefit her and meet her needs, so long as that will not be detrimental to the child and what she takes is not needed by him.\nEnd quote from al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan.\nBased on the above:\nIt is permissible for you to take from your children’s wealth to pay for medical treatment, on condition that that will not harm the children. In other words, that should only be after ensuring that the children have enough.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the issue of whether a mother can take some of her children's wealth while they are in her custody involves several considerations rooted in the principles of justice, fairness, and caretaking as laid out in the Qur'an.\n\nThe general principle regarding the wealth of children, particularly orphans, is that their wealth must be protected and not unjustly consumed. The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of guardians protecting the interests of minors (who are unable to manage their wealth) rather than misappropriating it.\n\n### Key Verses and Their Implications\n\n1. **Surah An-Nisa (4:6)**:\n   > \"And test (and try) the orphans until they are of marriageable age. If you find they have acquired sound judgement, then hand over their property to them; but devour not their wealth, nor use it up hastily out of fear that soon they will grow up (and demand it). And (the guardian) who is rich should abstain from spending much (of their wealth); and he who is poor should use only as much as is fair.\"\n   \n   This verse highlights that guardians must avoid consuming the wealth of orphans unless absolutely necessary. For a mother to take from her children's wealth, she must act justly and in their best interest. If she is in need, the Qur'an permits her to use their wealth, but emphasizes fairness and moderation.\n\n2. **Surah An-Nisa (4:10)**:\n   > \"Those who devour the possessions of the orphans unjustly devour only fire, and will surely burn in Hell.\"\n   \n   This verse serves as a strong warning against the wrongful appropriation of orphans' property. It implies that the consequences for unjust actions are severe, indicating that any mother (or guardian) taking from their child's wealth must do so with great care and accountability.\n\n3. **Surah An-Nisa (4:8)**:\n   > \"And when the relatives and orphans and the needy collect at the time of the division (of property) provide for them too, and talk kindly to them.\"\n   \n   This verse emphasizes the need to be kind and provide for orphans and relatives appropriately. A mother must consider their welfare and prioritize their rightful needs.\n\n4. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233)**:\n   > \"The mothers should suckle their babies for a period of two years for those (fathers) who wish that they should complete the suckling, in which case they should feed them and clothe them in a befitting way; but no soul should be compelled beyond capacity.\"\n   \n   While not directly related to wealth, this verse underscores that a mother is responsible for the care of her children and must provide for them fairly. In doing so, if a mother needs to use from their wealth because she is in need, it should still be for their well-being and not for personal gain.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom these teachings, it can be inferred that a mother may take some of her children's wealth only if it is for legitimate needs and is done with caution and in their interest. The overarching principle in Islamic law is protection from exploitation and ensuring equitable treatment of orphans and children. If a mother is financially stable, she is encouraged to refrain from touching the wealth of her children altogether. If financial support is necessary, it should be done justly and within reasonable limits, ensuring that the children’s interest is paramount."

        "question": "My sister is suffering because of her husband; can I advise her to seek a divorce?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the situation is as described in the question, undoubtedly this is one of the troubles of life. It is not appropriate for a man whom Allah has enjoined to be in charge of his household, spend on them and shoulder the responsibility of raising his children to be like this. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care. A woman is in a position of responsibility over her husband’s house and children and is answerable for those under her care. Indeed, each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2278).\nIt is well known that the woman has the right to ask for divorce (talaq) or khul‘ if there is a reason for that. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I do not find any fault with Thaabit ibn Qays in his character or his religious commitment, but I do not want to commit any act of disbelief after becoming a Muslim.” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to her, “Will you give back his garden [that he had given to her as the mahr]?” She said, “Yes.” So the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Thaabit: “Take back your garden, and divorce her.” \nWhat is meant by her words “but I do not want to commit any act of disbelief after becoming a Muslim” is: I do not want to do any actions that are contrary to the rulings of Islam, such as despising my husband, disobeying him, not fulfilling his rights, and so on.\nSee: Fath al-Bari (9/400).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining what justifies seeking khul‘:\nIf the woman dislikes her husband’s characteristics, such as if he is harsh, strict, short-tempered, filled with anger, criticizes the slightest action and rebukes her for the slightest shortcoming, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nSecondly: if she dislikes his appearance, such as a flaw, a defect, or a deficiency in his senses, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nThirdly: if he is lacking in religious commitment, such as if he does not pray or is careless about attending prayers in congregation, or he breaks the fast of Ramadan with no excuse, or he goes to places where haram activities take place, such as zina, drinking, listening to music and entertainment, and the like, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nFourthly: If he deprives her of her rights, such as maintenance, clothing or essential needs, when he is able to provide those things, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nFifthly: If he does not give her her right to regular intimacy in a way that will keep her chaste because he is impotent, or has no interest in her, or he prefers someone else, or he is not fair in sharing his time [among co-wives], then she has the right to seek khul‘. And Allah knows best. End quote.\nSee also the answer to question no. 1859 .\nSecondly:\nAs your sister is the one who is in charge, and she knows her husband’s condition better than anyone, she is the one who should decide whether it is better to stay with him for the sake of the children despite these annoyances, because the presence of the father and the sense of family unity has a positive psychological impact on the children, gives them a good social standing and it helps in giving them a good upbringing, and in many cases it is better than separation.\nWe should also note that our advice should differ, depending on whether the couple have children or not. Making sacrifices for the sake of the children’s safety, their social standing, their psychological wellbeing and sense of family is worth patience and sacrifice.\nShe should also persist in calling upon Allah, asking Him to rectify his condition, and she should ask sincere and knowledgeable people to advise him. For hearts fluctuate, and they are in the hand of Allah. How many people have come back to their senses and settled down after having gone astray and misbehaved.\nIf there is anyone among his family and relatives who is rational and mature in thinking, and is held in high esteem by him and can influence him, then she can seek his help to influence him and tell him about his situation, if there is the hope that this will help to rectify his condition.\nWhat appears to us to be the case is that if your sister shows patience, which is indicative of her rational mind and far-sightedness, no one should interfere by advising her to leave him, which could cause greater harm than the harm that results from her staying with this husband despite the problems he has.\nBut if she fears for her life, her faith or her children, then let her do that; there is nothing wrong with her seeking separation from him in that case.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In advising your sister regarding her situation with her husband, it is crucial to emphasize the Islamic perspective on marriage, rights, and divorce. The Quran outlines both the sanctity of marriage and the conditions under which divorce can occur. \n\n1. **Divorce as a Last Resort:** The Quran acknowledges that if conflicts cannot be resolved, divorce may be an option. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:229) states, “Divorce is (revocable) two times. After that, either keep (the wives) in a good manner or part with them in a good manner.” This emphasizes that while divorce is permissible, it should be approached with caution and done in a respectful manner.\n\n2. **Rights of Women in Marriage:** Surah Al-Baqarah (2:228) asserts, “Women have rights similar to those of men over them in a just manner, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them.” This indicates that in a marriage, both partners have rights and responsibilities. If your sister is suffering due to her husband's behavior, her well-being should be prioritized.\n\n3. **Possibility of Reconciliation and Support:** Surah At-Talaq (65:6-7) instructs that divorced women must be housed and treated well, suggesting that compassion should drive the process of separation. It states, “House the (divorced) women where you live according to your means; but do not harass them so as to reduce them to straitened circumstances.” If the marriage is marked by hardship or oppression, it may be wise for her to consider her options carefully, including the choice to seek a divorce if reconciliation is impossible.\n\n4. **Contextual Clarity in Divorce:** The Quran also stipulates that if the couple cannot live within the bounds set by God, they may consider divorce. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:229) mentions, “If you fear you cannot maintain the bounds fixed by God, there will be no blame on either if the woman redeems herself.” This highlights that if the relationship is causing lasting harm or conflict, divorce may not only be permitted but advisable.\n\n5. **Encouragement for Personal Well-being:** If your sister is suffering, advising her to seek a divorce could be warranted, particularly if her husband is abusive or neglectful. Surah Al-Mujadila (58:1) reflects how God hears the grievances of those who are wronged, reinforcing the importance of addressing injustice in marital relations.\n\nIn conclusion, while Islam encourages reconciliation and the preservation of marriage wherever possible, it also recognizes the importance of individual dignity and wellbeing. Given your sister's suffering, it may be appropriate to advise her to consider divorce, especially if other means of reconciliation have failed or are not feasible. It's important she discusses her circumstances with a qualified spiritual advisor or counselor to navigate her decision thoughtfully and judiciously."

        "question": "Wife refusing to fulfil her duties towards her husband because he is not spending on her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is obligatory for a man to spend on his wife, and your father did spend on her when he was able to, for twenty years, as you explained in your question.\nAccording to Islamic teachings, your father is still regarded as spending on your mother, because spending on her has nothing to do with the issue of where he is getting the money from that he spends on her.\nThe other issue is that the sons’ spending on their mother is to be regarded as being like the father spending on her, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” Ahmad (6902); classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa’ (1625).\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best food that you eat is what you earn by your own hands, and your children are part of your earnings.” At-Tirmidhi (1358); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The father is obliged to spend on his wife, if her children cannot take care of her. But if her children are covering her expenses and they have been covering all her needs, then that is sufficient, because the children are his children too, and his rights over them are great. The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” So if they are covering their mother’s needs and spending on her, that is sufficient, praise be to Allah.\nBut if they are not covering her needs, and she is asking for maintenance, she has a choice: if she wishes, she may be patient, or if she wishes, she may say: Divorce me. She may ask for divorce if she cannot be patient, otherwise she should be patient. If her children spend on her and cover her needs, praise be to Allah, and there is no blame on the husband… If his children spend on her, then she has no right to complain or ask her husband to spend on her, because his children’s spending on her is like his spending on her. If they spend on her what is sufficient for her needs, praise be to Allah. If they do not spend on her and he does not spend on her either, then she may ask for divorce. (From the shaykh’s website.)\nBased on that, so long as you and your brother are spending on her and covering her needs, she has no right after that to ask for more maintenance from your father, and he is entitled to all his rights over her in full.\nOnce this is established, then it becomes clear that your mother’s refusing intimacy on the grounds that the father is not spending on her is not permissible, and as a result she is regarded as defiantly disobedient and is sinning.\nShe must fear Allah, for this is a grievous sin. It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as is stated in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses to come, the angels will curse her until morning.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (3065).\nAccording to another hadith, “There is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is in heaven will be angry with her, until he is pleased with her.” Narrated by Muslim (1436).\nSecondly:\nFrom your question, it seems that your father was not falling short with regard to your mother’s rights or your rights when he was able to spend on you. When his circumstances changed and he was no longer able to spend, your mother forgot his kindness. This is ingratitude towards the husband concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned the woman who does that of Hell. According to the hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I was shown Hell, and I saw that most of its inhabitants are women who are ungrateful (yakfurna).” It was said: Do they disbelieve (yakfurna) in Allah? He said: “They are ungrateful (yakfurna) to their husbands and are ungrateful for kind treatment. If you show kindness to one of them for a lifetime, then she sees something from you, she says: I have never seen anything good from you.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (29).\nIbn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This refers to the husband. Allah enjoined His Messenger to show gratitude for blessings. It says in the hadith: “He does not thank Allah who does not thank people.” Gratitude for the kindness of the husband comes under the heading of gratitude for the blessings of Allah, because every favour the husband does to his family is a blessing from Allah that He caused to come at his hands.\"(Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari by Ibn Battal (1/89).\nWhat the hadith means is that they are denying kind treatment… This indicates that the one who denies the kindness of the one who was kind to him is blameworthy. Al-Karmani said: That is, you [women] deny the kind treatment of the husband and think little of whatever he gives you. We may understand from the warning of hellfire for being ungrateful and cursing a great deal that these are major sins. See: Sharh Ibn Majah by as-Suyuti, et al. (p. 289).\nHence it is important to advise your mother regarding this matter, and tell her that showing kindness to her husband is one of the means of a woman attaining the pleasure of Allah, and is one of the means of her attaining happiness in this world and the hereafter.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the issue of a wife refusing to fulfill her duties towards her husband because he is not spending on her, it's essential to consider the guidelines set forth in the Qur'an regarding marital responsibilities and the importance of mutual rights and duties.\n\n### 1. **Financial Responsibilities in Marriage**\nFirstly, it is emphasized in the Qur'an that husbands have a duty to provide for their wives. This is articulated in various verses, such as:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233):** “Mothers may breastfeed their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period]. Upon the father is their portion according to what is acceptable, and upon the mother is their provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable...” (2:233).\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:236):** “There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry; but then provide adequately for them, the affluent according to their means, the poor in accordance with theirs as is befitting. This is surely the duty of those who do good” (2:236).\n\n### 2. **Ease after Hardship**\nThe theme of being considerate of one another's circumstances is prevalent in the Qur'an. Allah promises ease after hardship, which can apply to both spouses in times of financial distress.\n\n- **Surah At-Talaq (65:7):** “Let the man of means spend according to his means, and he whose means are limited, should spend of what God has given him. God does not burden a soul beyond what He has given it” (65:7).\n\nThis verse stipulates that while men are responsible for providing, they should do so within their capacity, and wives should not be overly demanding if the husband is genuinely experiencing financial difficulties.\n\n### 3. **Wifely Duties and Mutual Support**\nThe dynamics of marital responsibilities are reciprocal. While husbands are tasked with financial support, wives are expected to contribute in various ways, including emotional support and fulfilling their duties.\n\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49):** “O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' of them. But provide suitably for them, and let them go with honour” (33:49).\n\nHere, the Qur'an places importance on treating spouses with respect and dignity, ensuring that both partners honor their commitments.\n\n### 4. **The Importance of Communication**\nIt is essential for both husband and wife to communicate openly about their expectations and grievances. A refusal to engage in marital responsibilities can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. The Qur'an supports resolving issues amicably.\n\n- **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:1):** \"God certainly heard what the woman who argued with you about her husband, said, and complained to God; and God heard your interrogation. Verily God hears all, and sees everything” (58:1).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn situations where a wife refuses to fulfill her duties due to the husband not spending on her, both parties should seek to understand each other's positions. The husband must strive to meet his financial obligations within his means, while the wife should be patient and seek to communicate her needs rather than refusing her responsibilities outright. Mutual respect, communication, and understanding are crucial in addressing such conflicts, according to the principles laid out in the Qur'an. Ultimately, both husband and wife are encouraged to embody piety and maintain their roles as supportive partners to one another."

        "question": "What is the ruling on using an artificial womb to have children?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the wife is not able to get pregnant in the natural manner, there is nothing wrong with using artificial insemination or what is known as “test-tube babies”. This refers to fertilising the egg in a test tube, then implanting it in the wife’s uterus. That is subject to the condition that the sperm and egg come from the husband and wife respectively, and the fertilised egg is not implanted in the womb of another woman (surrogate pregnancy).\nIt says in a statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council during its seventh session in 1404 AH:\n“The third method is that in which the semen and egg from a man and woman who are married to one another are taken and fertilisation occurs externally, in a test tube, then the fertilised egg is implanted in the uterus of the wife, from whom the egg was taken. This method is acceptable in principle from an Islamic perspective, but it is not completely free of problems that could give rise to doubts concerning the procedure and the circumstances in which it is done. So it should not be resorted to except in cases of extreme necessity, after all the conditions referred to above are met.”\nThese conditions include:\n“C. In the case where uncovering the ‘awrah of the woman is permitted for a legitimate reason in front of someone with whom sexual intercourse is not permissible, the one who is providing treatment should be a Muslim woman, if possible. Otherwise, it should be a non-Muslim woman; if that is not possible then it should be a trustworthy male Muslim doctor; and if that is not possible, it may be a non-Muslim male. This is the order of preference.\nIt is not permissible for the treatment provider to be alone with the woman whom he is treating; rather her husband or another woman should also be present.\nThe Council has affirmed that the need of a married woman who cannot have children and the need of the husband to have children are regarded as legitimate needs that make it permissible to treat the woman in a permissible manner, using one of the methods of artificial insemination.\"(Qararat al-Majma‘ al-Fiqhi bi Makkah al-Mukarramah, p. 149).\nSecondly:\nIf it is not possible to implant the fertilised egg in the uterus of the wife because she is suffering from uterine cancer, for example, then there comes to mind the idea of an artificial womb.\nDr. Muhammad ibn Ha’il al-Madhaji said: The idea [of the artificial womb] may be summed up as allowing the fertilised human egg to settle in an artificial womb by re-creating the natural environment of the woman’s uterus in a plastic incubator to enable the foetus to go through all the stages of development until it reaches the point of birth, whereby the foetus is placed in artificial fluid and its blood is supplied with oxygen. The foetus remains in that incubator, which guarantees all that is required for life and survival outside the uterus, until it is fully developed and the time comes for it to emerge.\"(Ahkam an-Nawazil fi’l-Injab, p. 587).\nHe researched the ruling on this issue and mentioned different scholarly views, noting that most contemporary scholars who researched this issue were of the view that it is permissible. He quoted the evidence given by the two groups, and reached the following conclusions:\n1.. This idea is something that could never happen, because it is not possible to produce an environment that may be described as “a safe repository” (al-Mu’minun 23:13) like the natural womb, for the foetus to grow in. Even if science were able to produce such a thing, it is unlikely that the foetus would be safe and free from harm.\n2.. The view that it is haram is more likely to be correct, because it is contrary to the natural way that has been decreed by Allah, and there is great potential for harm.\nThe doctor mentioned that the goat foetuses that were subjected to experiments of this nature died a few days after birth, even though they grew in their mothers’ wombs except for the last three weeks before birth.\nSee: Ahkam an-Nawazil fi’l-Injab, p. 862.\nConclusion:\nThis method has not yet been proven to have been tried on humans as far as we know, let alone having been proven to be free of harm.\nWhat appears to be the case is that if it is proven to have been tried on humans, then in order for it to be permissible, the following conditions must be met:\n1.. It must meet the conditions of artificial insemination referred to above.\n2.. The tissues that are used to create the artificial womb must be permissible tissues and not haram; they should not be taken from anyone other than the husband and wife.\n3.. The procedure must be free of anything that could harm the foetus.\n4.. It should be not possible to implant the fertilised egg in the wife’s womb.\nWe re-affirm that surrogate pregnancy is haram, as stated previously in the answer to question no. 22126 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The use of artificial wombs for having children raises complex ethical, religious, and medical considerations in the context of Islamic teachings. While the Quran does not specifically address the concept of artificial wombs, we can explore relevant principles and verses that guide the discussion on reproductive technologies in Islam.\n\n### 1. The Miracle of Creation\nIslamic belief emphasizes that the creation of life is a divine process involving God's will. In Surah Al-Qiyamah (The Resurrection), Allah describes the embryonic development process: “Was he not an emitted drop of semen, then formed into an embryo? Then He fashioned, shaped and proportioned and assigned it sexes, male and female. Cannot such as He bring the dead to life?” (Al-Qiyamah, 75:37-40). This affirms that human life development is fundamentally a divine act, underscoring the sanctity of the natural reproductive process.\n\n### 2. The Purpose of Parenthood\nAccording to Islamic teachings, the purpose of having children is not merely biological but also social and spiritual. Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow) emphasizes the importance of upbringing children within the framework of Islamic ethics: “The mothers should suckle their babies for a period of two years for those (fathers) who wish that they should complete the suckling...” (Al-Baqarah, 2:233). This verse highlights the significance of nurturing and the responsibilities of parents toward their children.\n\n### 3. Ethical Considerations\nThe introduction of artificial wombs raises ethical questions about the nature of family, lineage, and the nurturing process. Islamic law, or Sharia, emphasizes that lineage should be clear and that children should be born within a marriage. Any reproductive technology must adhere to Islamic principles regarding lineage, legitimacy, and family structure.\n\n### 4. Preservation of Family\nReproductive technologies must not disrupt the sanctity of marriage or familial relationships. Surah An-Nisa (The Women) discusses the importance of maintaining justice and the well-being of children, stressing the need for parents to be responsible caretakers: “Let people fear the day when they leave small children behind them unprovided...” (An-Nisa, 4:9). Therefore, any application of artificial womb technologies must ensure that family structures remain intact and that the welfare of children is prioritized.\n\n### 5. Medical and Social Implications\nThe use of artificial wombs may also have health implications and pose potential risks that Islam teaches must be carefully considered. The Quran repeatedly emphasizes the value of preserving life and health. The consequences of woman and child welfare should be a cornerstone of any decision regarding artificial wombs.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the Quran does not directly speak to artificial womb technology, it offers guidance on the sanctity of creation, the responsibilities of parenthood, and the importance of ethical considerations in family and social structures. Any decision regarding the use of such technology in an Islamic context would require careful consideration by scholars, taking into account the well-being of the child, the preservation of family integrity, and alignment with Islamic principles. As the field continues to evolve, ongoing dialogue among scholars and practitioners will be essential to navigate these issues within the framework of Islamic ethics."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah indicates that it is prescribed to get married , and that it is one of the Sunnahs of the Messengers . By getting married a person can, with the help of Allah, overcome many of the traps of evil, for marriage helps him to lower his gaze and guard his chastity. \nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in the Hadith, “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married , for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity…” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) \nAl-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Al-Mustadrak from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whomever Allah blesses with a righteous wife, He has helped him with half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.” \nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Shu`ab Al-Iman from Al-Raqashi (may Allah have mercy on him): “When a person gets married he has completed half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.” Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said of these two Hadiths in Sahih At-Targhib wat-Tarhib (1916): “(They are) sound.” \nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Is Marriage Half of the Religion?\n\nThe idea that \"marriage is half of the religion\" (Nikaah is half of Deen) is often attributed to a saying of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). While this saying is not explicitly found in the Quran, it reflects the importance of marriage in Islamic teachings. \n\nIslam places a strong emphasis on marriage as a significant aspect of one's life and religious obligations. The prophet’s saying highlights the role of marriage in fostering family, community, and moral values while fulfilling religious duties.\n\n### Supporting Points\n\n1. **Fulfillment of Religious Duties**: \n   Marriage in Islam is seen not only as a social contract but also as a means of fulfilling one's religious obligations. The Quran and Hadith often emphasize the importance of maintaining a righteous family structure and ensuring a healthy environment for the upbringing of children.\n\n2. **Companionship and Love**: \n   The Quran mentions the relationship between spouses as one of love and mercy. Allah says in Surah Ar-Rum (30:21):\n   > \"And of His signs is that He created for you from your own selves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed, in that are signs for a people who give thought.\"  \n   (Surah Ar-Rum, Ayah 21)\n\n3. **Social Responsibility**: \n   Marriage plays a crucial role in society, as it establishes families, which are the fundamental units of a community. This community-building aspect is essential in Islam, as mentioned in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:32):\n   > \"Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely...\"  \n   (Surah Al-Ma'idah, Ayah 32)\n\n4. **Encouragement of Marriage**: \n   The Hadith literature supports the necessity of marriage. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) encouraged marriage, stating that it helps control desires and promotes moral behavior. He said:\n   > \"O young people, whoever among you can marry, should marry, for it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty. And whoever is not able to should fast, for it is a shield (against sin).\"  \n   (Narrated in Sahih Al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim)\n\n5. **Piety and Righteousness**:\n   The Quran emphasizes kindness and piety in marriage, such as in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:236-237):\n   > \"And if you divorce them before you have touched them, and you have specified for them an obligation, then there is no blame upon you for what you might impose upon them. And if you have touched them and you have specified for them an obligation, then the burden is on the husband...\"  \n   (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 236-237)\n   This verse comes after explaining divorce but is part of a broader discussion on the responsibilities and ethics surrounding marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, while the phrase \"marriage is half of the religion\" is an interpretation spanning various Islamic teachings, the understanding that it occupies an integral role in the pursuit of piety, community welfare, and individual dignity is deeply rooted in the Quran and the Sunnah. Thus, marriage can be seen as a foundational pillar that supports many other aspects of Islamic life."

        "question": "What is the ruling on taking from the husband’s wealth without his knowledge to buy a house for the family?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nA house is something essential for humans, and if the father has provided accommodation for his wife and children to live in like that of their peers, then he is not obliged to do anything further from an Islamic point of view, unless he wants to buy a bigger house for them, if he can afford that. This is something that is recommended and encouraged according to Islamic teachings. It was narrated that Nafi‘ ibn ‘Abd al-Harith (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Part of a man’s happiness is a good neighbour, a comfortable means of transportation and a spacious house.” Narrated by Ahmad (15409); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘ (3029).\nSo long as he is providing them with accommodation that is appropriate for them, even if that is by renting, or it is something granted by the government for them to live in, then the requirement is met, and owning the house one lives in is not a necessity or urgent need, so long as accommodation is available to him by renting or as a gift or loan.\nSecondly:\nIf the husband is spending on obligatory maintenance such as accommodation, clothing, food and drink, within reasonable limits, then it is not permissible for his wife to take anything from his money, because it is haram to take a person’s wealth without his willing consent, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent} [an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Let the one who is present convey it to the one who is absent.” Al-Bukhari (67).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take a man’s wealth except with his willing consent.” Ahmad (20172); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (1495).\nBased on the above:\nWhat your mother collected from your father’s money and bought land with it does not come under the heading of wealth that it is permissible to take without the husband’s knowledge, because the wealth that it is permissible for a wife to take without the knowledge of her husband is limited to when he is failing to provide basic necessities.\nBut as this has already happened, it is essential to tell the father and put this land in his name and under his possession, if the father is still alive.\nIf it was bought in your mother’s name or in the name of one of you, then that must be changed, even if that is by means of a sale to the father.\nIf your father has passed on, then the house becomes part of his estate which is to be divided among the heirs, unless you all agree on something specific with the consent of all the heirs.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the ruling on taking from a husband's wealth without his knowledge to buy a house for the family involves important ethical and legal considerations. The fundamental principle is that wealth and property should be managed with fairness, mutual consent, and transparency between spouses.\n\n### Prohibition Against Usurpation of Wealth\n\nOne of the key verses in the Quran that stresses the importance of not unjustly taking the wealth of others is found in Surah An-Nisa (Surah 4), which states:\n\n> \"O believers, you should not usurp unjustly the wealth of each other, but trade by mutual consent; and do not destroy yourselves. God is merciful to you.\"  \n> (Surah An-Nisa, 4:29)\n\nThis verse highlights the necessity of mutual consent in financial matters, thus implying that taking money without consent—be it from one's husband or anyone else—can be deemed as unjust or usurpation.\n\n### The Issue of Mutual Consent\n\nIn Islam, mutual consent is a fundamental basis for any financial transaction, including that which involves the household or family finances. The Quran emphasizes this aspect, indicating that both parties should agree on financial matters, ensuring fairness and transparency. For instance, in the context of marriage and finance, it is stated:\n\n> \"And give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower. It will not be sinful if you agree to something (else) by mutual consent after having settled the dowry.\"  \n> (Surah An-Nisa, 4:24)\n\nThis concept of mutual consent extends beyond dower to other financial dealings within the household.\n\n### Financial Responsibility and Provisioning\n\nMoreover, the Quran advises on financial responsibility towards family members. For example, it mentions how a husband should provide for his wife:\n\n> \"House the (divorced) women where you live, according to your means...\"  \n> (Surah At-Talaq, 65:6)\n\nThis underscores the duty of the husband to provide adequate living conditions. For a wife to take from her husband's wealth without his knowledge would not align with this principle of openness and fairness that Islam advocates.\n\n### The Consequences of Injustice\n\nThe Quran warns against actions that involve deception or injustice, stating:\n\n> \"...if someone does so through oppression or injustice, We shall cast him into Hell: This is how (the Law of) God works inevitably.\"  \n> (Surah An-Nisa, 4:30)\n\nThis verse serves as a stern reminder of the spiritual and moral consequences of unjust actions, including taking wealth without permission.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, taking from the husband's wealth without his knowledge to buy a house for the family is not permissible in Islam due to the principles of mutual consent and fairness. A wife may, however, discuss and negotiate financial matters with her husband openly, ensuring that both partners are in agreement regarding substantial financial decisions. If the need for financial assistance arises, transparent communication is vital, and both parties should work together to achieve their home-related goals while adhering to the principles set forth in the Quran. Thus, the ruling aligns with the broader ethical teachings of Islam that promote honesty, justice, and mutual respect within marital relationships. \n\n**Relevant Verses:**  \n- Surah An-Nisa, 4:29  \n- Surah An-Nisa, 4:24  \n- Surah At-Talaq, 65:6  \n- Surah An-Nisa, 4:30"

        "question": "Parents Making Marriage Difficult",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat we see for you, honorable questioner, is that it is necessary to confront your parents - no matter the cost - with the fact that you are not convinced by their refusal, and that you are not prepared to wait for a long time, as you might miss the opportunity and the man your parents are waiting for may not come. The reason for their refusal is not legitimate, as looking down upon non-Arabs is a form of pre-Islamic tribalism that Islam has warned against. Allah Almighty says (interpretation of the meaning): O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted. [Quran 49:13].\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) set religion and character as the criteria for accepting a spouse. Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"If someone with whose religion and character you are satisfied asks for your daughter in marriage, comply with his request. If you do not do so, there will be temptation on Earth and extensive corruption.\" [At-Tirmidhi 1084, Al-Albani classified it as sound in \"Sahih at-Tirmidhi\"].\nLet the confrontation be in a wise manner, perhaps through a detailed and impactful letter you write to him (your father), while persistently supplicating to Allah to soften his heart and guide him to the right path.\nSecondly:\nThere is no fault on you at all for your eagerness to marry. It is incumbent upon the families of every man and woman who desire to marry to assist them in this matter as much as they can. A woman needs this assistance more than a man; because the decision is not in her hands, as she cannot, according to custom and tradition, propose to a man, even though it is permissible from a Shariah perspective. Since a woman is sought after and cannot be the seeker, she needs her family's help to enable her social availability. For example, her brother could recommend her to his friends whose religion and character he is satisfied with, and her mother could suggest her to her acquaintances who have sons suitable for marriage, and so on.\n`Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) proposed his daughter Hafsah for marriage after her husband died, offering her to `Uthman and Abu Bakr, then the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) married her, as in Sahih Al-Bukhari (4005).\nAnd `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) offered his daughter Umm Kulthum to `Umar ibn Al-Khattab, and he married her.\nThirdly:\nWe do not recommend marriage through internet sites, as there are many undesirable individuals there, and it is easy to deceive people through these sites. On the internet, a person can pretend to be ideal, and it is very difficult to know the truth of the matter. It might be the opposite of what you imagine. Therefore, we must restrain our emotions with the bridle of reason, unlike marriages based on real-life acquaintances.\nFourthly:\nRegarding your request for advice for your mother on the subject - which is the focus of your question - we in turn direct this message to your honorable mother, may Allah make her one of the keys to goodness.\nHonorable Mother...\nPeace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allah.\nOur honorable mother, one of the greatest responsibilities that Allah will question parents about, and which they are obligated towards their children, especially daughters, is facilitating their marriage. Delaying it for an illegitimate reason is non-compliance with the command of Allah Almighty who says (Interpretation of the meaning): And marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves. [Quran 24:32]; meaning facilitate the marriage of those who are not married and marry them off. The commentators said: The verse commands guardians to marry off their daughters and not to leave them single - unmarried - because that is more chaste for them. So, we must comply with the command of Allah.\nKnow that looking at people based on nationality or ethnicity is due to customs dominating people's minds more than Shariah and reason.\nAnd all the good is in following the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him): \"If someone with whose religion and character you are satisfied asks for your daughter in marriage, comply with his request. If you do not do so, there will be temptation on Earth and extensive corruption.\" Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (1048) and others, and Al-Albani classified it as good.\nHow many a girl whose family refused to marry her off, and she became the temptation that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) warned against. So, be keen to marry her to the one she desires, if he is someone whose religion and character are satisfactory, and do not pay attention to customs that erode society. And may Allah take care of you.\nThe pre-Islamic customs that look at people based on nationality or ethnicity are ignorant customs with no basis in the religion of Allah; rather, Islam came to purify souls from them. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Indeed, Allah has removed from you the pride of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic tribalism) and boasting about one's lineage. [A person is either] a pious believer or a miserable sinner. All of you are children of Adam, and Adam was created from dust.\" Narrated by Abu Dawud (5116) and others, and Al-Albani classified it as good.\nIf anyone should be strict about such matters and refuse to marry his daughter to someone who is not from his people or skin color, then this should be discarded from the wise consideration (especially) in Western countries, where Muslims live as minorities, and the choices from \"nationalities\" are greatly reduced, and people's circumstances are constrained. Rather, Muslims in such countries should be more united than their normal circumstances in their home countries.\nMay Allah guide us and you to what is good for Muslims, and improve the conditions of Muslims, their homes, and their offspring.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "When addressing the subject of parents making marriage difficult, it is essential to consider the broader Islamic teachings concerning marriage, family, and the rights and responsibilities of individuals. The Quran provides guidance on these matters by emphasizing the importance of mutual consent, respect, and the avoidance of harassment or undue pressure in marital relationships. Here are various Quranic verses that speak to these themes:\n\n### 1. **Mutual Consent and Respect in Marriage**\nMarriage in Islam is based on mutual consent between both parties involved, as indicated in several verses. For example:\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:22-24)**: \n  > \"And do not wed the women your fathers had wed. What happened in the past is now past: It was lewd and abhorrent, and only the way of evil... Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery. Then give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower.\"\n  \n  This verse emphasizes that marriage should be entered into based on the desire of both individuals involved, and the importance of giving them their rightful dowry.\n\n### 2. **Rights of the Divorced**\nWhen discussing marriage and divorce, it is crucial to highlight the rights of individuals within those contexts. After divorce, individuals have rights that must be respected and upheld:\n\n- **Surah At-Talaq (65:6-7)**: \n  > \"House the (divorced) women where you live, according to your means; but do not harass them so as to reduce them to straitened circumstances.\"\n\n  This verse stipulates that divorced women should be treated with respect and dignity, and there should be no harassment associated with the process.\n\n### 3. **Role of Parents**\nWhile parents play a significant role in the lives and decisions of their children, including marriage, they must not impose their wishes to the detriment of their children's well-being. The Quran encourages parents to offer guidance without coercion:\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:19)**: \n  > \"O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion. And do not make difficulties for them in order to take back part of what you gave them.\"\n\n  This highlights the importance of mutual respect and the wrongness of coercion, underscoring that women should not be compelled into undesirable situations.\n\n### 4. **Independence and Choice**\nIn Islam, individuals have the right to choose their spouses without undue pressure, reflecting the values of equity and justice:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:232)**:\n  > \"When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably.\"\n\n  This verse not only emphasizes the right of divorced women to remarry but also highlights that decisions surrounding marriage should be taken honorably and with consent.\n\n### 5. **Avoidance of Pressure and Coercion**\nParents should recognize the emotional and psychological aspects of marriage and aim to provide support rather than exert pressure on their children:\n\n- **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:2-5)**: \n  > \"Those who call their wives their mothers then revoke what they had said, should free a slave before having physical contact... But God is forbearing and forgiving.\"\n\n  Although this verse pertains to specific laws regarding marriage, it reflects on the grave implications of words and actions in the marital context and highlights the importance of honoring and respecting marital relationships.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the Quran emphasizes the fundamental values of mutual consent, respect, and the avoidance of coercion in marriage. Parents should act as supportive guides rather than imposing obstacles that could lead to difficulties. The principles outlined in the Quran advocate for fair treatment, mutual respect, and honoring the desires of individuals in the context of marriage. This guidance serves as a framework for resolving conflicts regarding marriage, ensuring that the rights and needs of all involved parties are acknowledged and respected."

        "question": "Is It Prohibited in Islam to Not Get Married?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is marriage compulsory in Islam?\nYou should note that people are not equal in the matter of marriage. They share the fundamental principle that marriage is prescribed, which is from the guidance and practice of the Prophet, peace be upon him. Then, its importance varies in some cases more than others.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWith regard to marriage , people are of three types: \n\nSome fear that they may commit prohibited things if they do not get married. Such a person is obliged to get married, according to the majority of jurists, because he has to keep himself chaste and protect himself against engaging in prohibited actions, and the way to do that is getting married. \nFor some, marriage is recommended. This is the one who feels desire but there is no danger of his committing prohibited things. It is better for him to get married than to devote himself to optional acts of worship. This is the view of Ashab Ar-Ra`y and it is the view  and practice of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). \n\nIbn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If I only had ten days to live and I knew that I would die at the end of them, and I had any desire to get married, I would get married, for fear of Fitnah (temptation). \nSa`id ibn Jubayr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said to me: “Have you gotten married?”  \nI said: “No.” He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Get married, for the best of this Ummah are the ones with the most wives.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5069) \nIbrahim ibn Maysarah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Tawus said to me: “Either get married, or I will say to you what `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said to Abu Az-Zawa’id (may Allah have mercy on him): Nothing is keeping you from getting married except impotence or immorality.”  \n\nThose who have no desire, either because they were not created with any desire, such as one who is impotent, or they had desire but it has disappeared due to old age, sickness and so on. There are two opinions: \n\n\nIt is recommended to get married because of the general meaning of what we have discussed.\nIt is better for him to remain single because he cannot achieve the purpose of marriage, and he would be preventing his wife from becoming chaste by marrying someone else. Also, he would be harming her by keeping her for himself, and he is exposing himself to obligations and duties that perhaps he cannot fulfil, and he is distracting himself from seeking knowledge and worship with something that is of no benefit to him.\n\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The apparent meaning of the words of Ahmad is that there is no difference between the one who can afford it and the one who cannot. He said: a man should get married and if he can afford to spend he should spend, and if he cannot then he should be patient.  \nThis applies to one who is able to get married. As for the one who cannot, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His Bounty” [An-Nur 24:33].” (Al-Mughni, 9/341-344) \nReasons why marriage is so important\nAt this point, we would like to ask you about the reason for this aversion to marriage. \n\nIf you think that not getting married is an act of worship by means of which you can draw closer to the Lord of the Worlds, and you think that if you avoid marriage this will raise you in status before Allah, you are mistaken and there is the fear that you may be sinning. \n\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Three people came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asking about the worship of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When they were told, it was as if they regarded it as too little. They said: Who are we in comparison to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Allah has forgiven his past and future sins. One of them said: As for me, I will pray all night forever. Another said: I shall fast all my life and never break my fast. Another said: I shall keep away from women and never get married. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and said: “Are you the ones who said such and such? By Allah, I am the one who fears Allah the most among you and I am the most pious , but I fast and I break my fast, I pray and I sleep, and I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5063, and Muslim, 1401)\n\nIf you do not want to get married because you have no sexual desire, or you think that you are not able to fulfil the duties of marriage, and you are afraid of falling short in meeting a wife`s needs, I say to you: In that case there is no sin on you if you do not get married, but do not rely on your thoughts and notions. Rather you should consult a specialist doctor and ask him for advice, for he is most able to diagnose your condition, and he may have some advice for treatment that has never crossed your mind. So do not hesitate to visit him and do not let shyness stop you, for matters of medical treatment are not the place for shyness. \nIf you say that you are afraid because you are poor and do not have enough wealth to look after a family, I say to you: Try your best to earn a living and be content and think positively of Allah, for He has promised on the lips of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that He will help the one who wants to be chaste and seeks that which is halal by getting married. \n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whom Allah is bound to help: the Mujahid who strives (in Jihad) for the sake of Allah, the Mukatib (a slave who has made a contract of manumission with his master) who wants to pay off his manumission, and a man who gets married, seeking to remain chaste.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (1655), classed as sound by Al-Albani in Saheeh At-Tirmidhi)  \n\nIf you have something that you want to achieve – such as a certificate, a position, a project and so on – and you say that you want to achieve that first, then you will get married, we say to you: Why are you ignoring marriage for that reason? \n\nMarriage has never been a barrier to achieving things, rather in most cases it is a support and a help. That is just the whisperings of the satan, which he has instilled in the minds of many young men so that it has become prevalent in our culture and society, and you hear many of those who have delayed their own marriages or the marriages of their sons and daughters saying such things, and our society has become burdened with problems resulting from large numbers of single men and women, and the delay of marriage. However, despite that we have not seen any achievement, development or progress, whereas the first generation of Muslims used to hasten to do good and they did not delay marriage, and their achievements were the greatest and most complete of achievements. \nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (20/421): \n“What is required is to hasten to get married, and no young man or young woman should delay marriage for the sake of studies, because marriage does not prevent any such thing. It is possible for a young man to get married in order to protect his religious commitment and morals, and enable him to lower his gaze . Marriage serves many purposes, especially in this day and age. Because delaying it is harmful for both young women and young men, every young man and every young woman should hasten to get married if there is a man who is compatible with the woman, and if a man can find the right woman.”\n\nOver and above all that, how about if you realise that marriage will protect half of your religion? \n\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whomever Allah has blessed with a righteous wife, He has helped him with half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.” (Narrated by Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak, 2/175), At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat, 1/294) and Al-Bayhaqi in Shu`ab Al-Iman, 4/382) Al-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This is a Hadith with an authentic Isnad (chain of narrators), although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not narrate it.” Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Talkhis: it is authentic. It was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib, 2/192)\n\nHow about if you realise that by getting married, you will have followed the advice of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said:  “O young men, whoever among you can afford it , let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one`s chastity.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5065, and Muslim, 1400)\nHow about if you realise that by producing a righteous child, you will have ongoing charity (Sadaqah Jariyah), if you raise him with good morals and upon faith, and you will be rewarded for your marriage if you seek reward with Allah for that . \nBy getting married, you will be protecting yourself, lowering your gaze , and closing the door to one of the greatest means by which the devil deceives people. You may not feel the seriousness of that now, but Fitnah (temptation) may come from places a person does not realise, so you should be keen to close the door before it is opened without you realising it.\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have not left after me any Fitnah more harmful to men than women.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5096, and Muslim, 2741).\n\nMarriage is a source of tranquillity and peace, and it is the best of the pleasures of this world. In it, is that which Allah has made a sign for His slaves, and He has mentioned it in His Book so that they may think and ponder the greatness of His Might, may He be glorified and exalted. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.” [Ar-Rum 30:21]\nCan there be any hesitation after this? \nBe resolved and put your trust in Allah, and Allah will help you, and will provide you with a righteous wife who will help you to obey your Lord and He will bless you with righteous offspring who will be a stored treasure for you with Allah in the Hereafter. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is encouraged, and while it is not explicitly stated that it is prohibited to not get married, the religion emphasizes the importance and benefits of marriage throughout various texts. Below are several key points supported by Quranic verses.\n\n### 1. Encouragement of Marriage\nThe Quran encourages marriage as a means of safeguarding oneself from sin and providing a lawful way to express human desires. This is highlighted in *Surah An-Nisa (4:24)*, which speaks about the importance of seeking marriage over unlawful relationships.\n\n- **Verse**: \"Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery...\" \n- **Reference**: Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 24.\n\n### 2. Marriage as a Sunnah (Tradition of the Prophet)\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized marriage as a Sunnah (tradition) that should be followed by Muslims. He stated in Hadiths (not direct Quranic verses) that \"Marriage is part of my tradition; he who turns away from my tradition is not of me.\" This statement emphasizes the significance of marriage in the life of a Muslim.\n\n### 3. Support in Avoidance of Sin\n*Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221-225)* reflects on the virtue of marriage as a protective measure against sinful actions. The encouragement to marry is indicative of its importance in maintaining a community of believers who are committed to righteousness.\n\n- **Verse**: \"Women are like fields for you; so seed them as you intend...\"\n- **Reference**: Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 223.\n\n### 4. Responsibility Towards Family\nIn *Surah At-Tahrim (66:6)*, believers are instructed to protect their families and themselves from Hellfire. This can imply that fulfilling the obligations of marriage and family is line with these directives.\n\n- **Verse**: \"O you who believe, save yourselves and your families from the Fire...\"\n- **Reference**: Surah At-Tahrim, Ayah 6.\n\n### 5. Acknowledging Human Weakness\n*Surah An-Nisa (4:28)* acknowledges human weaknesses, indicating that Allah understands the desires and difficulties faced in life. He provides allowances and guidance regarding marriage, understanding the need for companionship.\n\n- **Verse**: \"...God wishes to lighten your burden, for man was created weak.\"\n- **Reference**: Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 28.\n\n### 6. The Countless Benefits of Marriage\nMarriage is recognized for fostering love, compassion, and tranquility, as it is stated in *Surah Ar-Rum (30:21)*, which describes one of the purposes of marriage is to find serenity between partners.\n\n- **Verse**: \"And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find rest in them...\"\n- **Reference**: Surah Ar-Rum, Ayah 21.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile there is no explicit prohibition against remaining unmarried in Islam, the teachings of the Quran and the Sunnah strongly endorse marriage for its spiritual, social, and emotional benefits. It is viewed as a means to fulfill one's desires lawfully, ensure the development of society, and strengthen community ties.\n\nThus, while not getting married is not outright forbidden, it is generally encouraged to marry to live a life that aligns with Islamic teachings on family, morality, and community. The overall message is one of encouragement towards marriage and the good it brings to individuals and society as a whole."

        "question": "What is the ruling on repeating the marriage contract if it was done over the Internet?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the marriage contract that was done over the Internet met all the necessary conditions, then it is a valid marriage. It is valid to do the marriage contract over the Internet so long as it meets all the necessary conditions. The senior scholars have issued fatwas stating that a marriage contract done over the telephone is valid, if we have verified the identity of the parties to the marriage contract and it fulfils the necessary conditions, namely the consent of the woman’s guardian (wali), two witnesses, and the proposal and acceptance. If a marriage contract done in this way is valid, then if it is done over the Internet, in which it is possible to verify the voice and the image directly, it is more appropriate that it should be valid.\nSee the fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz in question no. 2201 , and also question no. 297344 .\nSecondly:\nIf the first marriage contract met the necessary conditions, then repeating it a second time will not invalidate the first marriage contract; rather it is by way of confirming it in front of the family, or for the purpose of documenting the first marriage contract. So the rulings on marriage will apply from the time of the first contract. Hence it is not valid to impose new conditions in it, or to stipulate a mahr (dowry) other than that which was agreed upon in the first contract. But if the first marriage contract did not meet the necessary conditions, then it is deemed invalid and a new marriage contract must be done with a new mahr, and it is permissible to stipulate new conditions in it.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether the marriage contract (Nikkah) needs to be repeated if it was performed over the Internet hinges on various factors, including the particulars of that contract, the presence of witnesses, and adherence to Islamic marital requirements.\n\n### Validity of the Marriage Contract Over the Internet\n\n1. **Concept of Marriage in Islam**: Marriage in Islam involves a contract that needs to be entered into with the intentions of both parties, acceptance (Ijab and Qabul), and the presence of witnesses. The foundational requirement is that there is mutual consent between the two parties intending to marry.\n\n2. **Ijab and Qabul**: These terms refer to the offer and acceptance that define a marriage contract. Both the husband and wife must verbally express their acceptance of the marriage in a clear manner. This requirement can, in principle, be achieved over digital platforms, provided both parties express their consent clearly.\n\n3. **Presence of Witnesses**: According to Islamic jurisprudence, the presence of at least two witnesses is a fundamental requirement for the validity of a marriage contract. If this was possible during the online contract (for instance, through a video call where witnesses were present), then the marriage could be deemed valid.\n\n### Supporting Islamic Principles\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:232)**: \"When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably.\" This verse emphasizes the importance of maintaining honorable agreements and the sanctity of marriage.\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233)**: \"Mothers may suckle their children two complete breast-feeding periods for whoever wishes to complete the nursing.\" While this verse speaks to the rights and responsibilities after marriage, it underscores the seriousness of the marital commitment.\n\n- **Surah At-Talaq (65:1)**: \"O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their appointed period...\" This verse indicates that marriage and divorce are serious matters bound by specific instructions and should be taken with care.\n\n### Conclusion: Need for Repeating the Contract\n\nIf the marriage contract was validly done over the Internet, with clear consent and the presence of witnesses (even virtual ones), there may not be a need to repeat the marriage contract. However, if there is any doubt regarding the validity of the witnesses or the clarity of consent, it may be advisable to renew the contract to ensure peace of mind and adherence to Islamic guidelines.\n\nConsulting a knowledgeable scholar or local authority for further advice in such cases is also highly recommended, as they will take into account the specific circumstances surrounding the marriage.\n\nFor any issues related to validity or further clarifications, local Islamic authorities or knowledgeable scholars are the best resources to consult regarding individual circumstances."

        "question": "Ruling on vasectomy and reversal thereof",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: it is not permissible for a man or woman to undergo any surgical or other procedure that will permanently prevent them from having children.\nOne of these means that is forbidden is vasectomy, which is a surgical procedure in which the vas deferens (the two channels through which sperm travels to the bladder and then to the penis) is cut.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council: It is haram to permanently remove the ability to produce offspring for a man or a woman, which is what is known as sterilization, so long as there is no necessary reason, according to Islamic standards, for doing that.\nThis has been explained previously in the answers to questions no. 111969 and 47196 .\nSecondly: With regard to reversing the vasectomy, this is a matter concerning which one must refer to medical specialists. If the doctors determine that there is no harm that would result from that, then you must undergo this procedure and restore the vas deferens to its natural state.\nBut if that is not possible, or it will result in harm, then you do not have to do anything, because harm cannot be removed by further harm.\nAs you did that as a result of ignorance of the ruling, then Allah, may He be exalted, will pardon you and there is no sin on you. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but [only for] what your hearts intended} [al-Ahzaab 33:5].\nAnd you did not deliberately intend to commit sin.",
        "predicted_answer": "The ruling on vasectomy and its reversal in Islam is not explicitly detailed in the Quran; however, Islamic jurisprudence does provide guidance on issues related to family planning and reproductive health through interpretations based on the texts. Below is a thorough examination of the topic alongside supporting references from the Quran and general Islamic principles.\n\n### Permissibility of Vasectomy\n\n1. **Control Over Reproduction:**\n   - In Islam, while procreation is encouraged, there is recognition of the responsibility that comes with it. Family planning can be deemed permissible if there are legitimate reasons. This is supported by the idea that maintaining a balance and considering the welfare of existing children and family resources is essential.\n   - The Quran gives recognition to matters of family and the implications of parenting in a responsible manner. While the following verses do not directly mention contraception, they emphasize the need for care and consideration in family matters:\n     - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:233:** \"Fathers may provide for their children according to what is acceptable, and the same applies to the mothers as well.\" This indicates the importance of being able to provide adequately for the family, which can justify family planning methods if they ensure the welfare of the family.\n\n2. **Reasons for Utmost Need:**\n   - In Islamic discourse, there are various reasons that could justify the choice of sterilization, including health issues, financial constraints, or other personal circumstances that warrant such a decision.\n   - The principle of necessity, as expressed in Islamic law (fiqh), allows for exceptions to be made in cases of dire need. The Quran emphasizes God’s mercy and forgiveness towards people considering their intentions and circumstances.\n\n### Ruling on Reversal of Vasectomy\n\nThe reversal of a vasectomy may not be predominantly discussed in Islamic texts, but the perspective on medical interventions generally follows similar guidelines:\n\n1. **Reversibility:**\n   - The act of reversing a medical procedure, including a vasectomy, could be permissible if the individual desires to have more children later. The principle of seeking what is beneficial for one’s family aligns with Islamic values of procreation.\n   - Although not explicitly detailed in the Quran, the concept can be derived from the understanding of the need for respect for one’s desires and reproductive choices.\n\n2. **Consideration of Medical Advice:**\n   - Consulting knowledgeable healthcare professionals is encouraged in Islam. Thus, if a vasectomy reversal would be deemed medically sound and beneficial by a qualified professional, it aligns with Islamic guidance to seek knowledge and act upon it in matters concerning health.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while there are no specific Quranic verses that explicitly mention vasectomy or its reversal, Islamic jurisprudence tends to support the idea of family planning when done with valid reasons. The key verses related to family welfare and responsibility, namely **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:233**, can thus be interpreted as supportive of responsible reproductive choices. Ultimately, the decision should be made with careful consideration of one’s circumstances, the potential impact on existing and future children, and in consultation with knowledgeable individuals, both medical professionals and religious scholars. \n\nFor any serious decisions regarding such matters, it is advisable to seek personalized guidance from qualified scholars who may consider the nuances of individual cases."

        "question": "How can the second wife prove her marriage after her husband dies, as the marriage was not officially registered?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In a number of questions we have stated that it is obligatory to officially register marriages, because that will protect people’s rights so that they will not be lost.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 129851 .\nBut a man may be forced to forego registering a marriage because he lives in a western country where plural marriage is not allowed and the one who does that will be penalised. In that case, we may say:\nIf the husband married a second wife in accordance with Islamic teachings, then it is easy for the second wife and her children to prove that, because when she got married there must have been her guardian and two men – at least – who acted as witnesses or he must have announced the marriage to some of his friends or relatives.\nThe husband may have left behind something in his handwriting confirming this second marriage, or he may have registered his children from his second wife in his name, and so on.\nSo the second wife should take some of these witnesses and whatever proof or other circumstantial evidence she has to prove the validity of her claim, and present it to those in charge of the Islamic centre in her city, and they can present it to the family of the deceased and prove to them that there are other parties who have rights in this regard, and they are entitled to their share of the estate.\nThe first wife of the deceased and her children must accept that, and beware of cutting off ties of kinship and refuse to give what rightfully belongs to their brothers, because Allah has ordained that all wives and all children have rights to the estate, so there should be no differentiation between one wife and another, or between one son and another. They are all children of the deceased and are all entitled to their share of the inheritance. The prohibition [on denying them their rights] is further emphasized if any of the heirs are minors (orphans), because devouring the wealth of orphans is a major sin for which the one who does that deserves punishment in hell.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire. And they will be burned in a Blaze} [an-Nisa’ 4:10].\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the legal status of a second marriage often presents complexities, especially when it comes to inheritance and proving the validity of the marriage after the husband's death, particularly if the marriage was not officially registered. This situation can be approached through a combination of relevant Quranic principles regarding marriage and inheritance.\n\n### Proving the Marriage\n\n1. **Witnesses**: In Islamic tradition, a marriage is generally validated through the presence of witnesses. The second wife can seek to obtain testimonies from those who were aware of the marriage. This is aligned with the principle mentioned in various Hadiths where the presence of witnesses at a marriage contract is emphasized.\n\n2. **Custom and Public Recognition**: If the marriage was known to the community, even if it wasn't officially registered, this recognition can serve as proof. The public acknowledgement of the marriage can sometimes be sufficient in Islamic jurisprudence.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Although the marriage was not officially registered, if there are any documents (like a marriage contract or mutual agreement) that were exchanged during the marriage, these can serve as evidence of the relationship.\n\n### Inheritance Rights\n\nAccording to Islamic law, both the first wife and the second wife have specified rights to inheritance. The Quran lays down principles regarding the distribution of wealth after death, particularly in Surah An-Nisa:\n\n- **Inheritance Shares**: A wife’s share in the property left behind is defined by her marital status and whether the husband has children or not. For instance, in Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 12 states, \"Your share in the property the wives leave behind is half if they die without an issue, but in case they have left children, then your share is one-fourth after the payment of legacies and debts.\" (Quran 4:12).\n\n- **Wives' Rights Upon Husband's Death**: In Surah Al-Baqarah, it is specified that widows should wait a prescribed period (iddah) following their husband's death during which they have rights and responsibilities regarding inheritance (Quran 2:234).\n\n### Time of Mourning (Iddah)\n\nThe \"iddah\" period for a widow lasts four months and ten days, during which the widow cannot remarry and must remain in mourning. This provision is intended to ensure clarity regarding possible pregnancy and to honor the deceased husband (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 234 states: \"Wives of men who die among you should wait (after their husbands' death) for four months and ten days…\"). This legal framework also supports the validity of marriage upon fulfilling the iddah period.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. **Documenting the Marriage**: Although not officially registered, witnesses and public knowledge of the marriage can validate it.\n2. **Claiming Rights**: The second wife can claim her share of inheritance as outlined in Surah An-Nisa and verify her status as a wife through testimonies.\n3. **Mourning and Social Practices**: i.ddah serves the purpose of clarifying the status of the widow and ensures her rights are observed under Islamic law.\n\nIn matters of such significance, it is highly advisable for individuals seeking to resolve inheritance disputes or marriage validation issues to consult knowledgeable religious authorities or a qualified Islamic lawyer who can offer specific advice within the appropriate legal frameworks."

        "question": "Using contraception because of having a low income",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to use contraceptives for fear of low income, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Provider. This is akin to the actions of the people of Jahiliyyah who killed their children for fear of poverty. Rather you should think positively of Allah and put your trust in Him, may He be glorified and exalted.\nAllah is the Provider, the Almighty, may He be glorified and exalted, and it is He, may He be glorified and exalted, Who says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no creature that lives on the earth but its sustenance is guaranteed by Allah} [Hud 11:6].\nSo what is required is for both husband and wife to think positively of Allah and not use contraceptives.\nBut if the contraceptive is used for a different reason, such as if the mother is sick or if there is  the risk of harm to her health or her uterus, or there is fear of harm to both of them; or because they already have a lot of children, and without contraception there will be one pregnancy after another, without a break, so she wants to use contraception for a short period, such as a year or two, so that it will not be too difficult to raise the children and so that she will not become unable to do that – then there is nothing wrong with that, as it is in the best interests of the children, and it is not due to thinking negatively of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. The same applies if having another pregnancy could harm her and she is unable to cope. But if the matter has to do with provision (rizq), then the Provider is Allah; regardless of whether you are sick or healthy, it is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, Who provides for you and in His hand is the control of all things. So you must think positively of Allah and put your trust in Allah, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Provider, Lord of Might, the Powerful. End quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the question of using contraception due to low income can be assessed through several principles derived from the Quran. The verses you have provided highlight Allah's provisions for individuals in various situations, emphasizing that God does not burden a soul beyond its capacity, and encourages believers to maintain a level of trust and reliance on Him.\n\n### Key Verses and Their Interpretation\n\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233-237)**: \n   > \"The mothers should suckle their babies for a period of two years for those (fathers) who wish that they should complete the suckling, in which case they should feed them and clothe them in a befitting way; but no soul should be compelled beyond capacity, neither the mother made to suffer for the child nor the father for his offspring... But fear God, and remember that God sees all that you do.\"\n   - This verse emphasizes that both parents should provide for the child to the best of their ability without causing hardship to either party. This principle can be interpreted to allow parents to consider their financial circumstances when planning for more children, suggesting that managing family size through contraception is acceptable if it is done out of concern for both the children and the family's well-being.\n\n2. **Surah At-Talaq (65:2-3)**:\n   > \"When they have reached their appointed time, then either keep them lawfully or let them go honourably; but have two witnesses from among you, and give truthful evidence for (being acceptable to) God. This is to warn him who believes in God and the Last Day. God will furnish a way out for him who fears Him, and provide for him from where he does not reckon.\"\n   - This verse indicates that God will provide solutions and sustenance to those who are mindful of Him. Thus, using contraception to ensure that one does not become overwhelmed financially can be seen as taking a responsible approach to providing for family.\n\n3. **Surah An-Nisa (4:32)**:\n   > \"And do not covet that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of His bounty.\"\n   - This verse encourages fairness and responsibility in financial dealings. Parents struggling with finances could reasonably justify the use of contraception to ensure that they can provide adequately for their current family before considering additional children.\n\n4. **Surah At-Talaq (65:6)**:\n   > \"Let the man of means spend according to his means, and he whose means are limited should spend of what God has given him. God does not burden a soul beyond what He has given him.\"\n   - This directly addresses the capacity of each individual; it is a reminder that one's financial limitations should be taken into account, which supports the decision to use contraception if it is necessary for the family's well-being.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, using contraception due to low income is permissible and aligns with Islamic values of responsibility, trust in God, and consideration for the well-being of one's family. The aforementioned verses support a balanced approach where believers are encouraged to place their trust in God while also being practical about their circumstances. Thus, Muslim couples may decide to use contraception to ensure they can provide adequately for their children without falling into hardship."

        "question": "He did the marriage contract with her in the court without her family’s knowledge in order to force her wali (guardian) to accept the marriage. What must he do now?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for anyone to do a marriage contract with a woman except with the permission of her guardian. There is a great deal of evidence to this effect, such as the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “There can be no marriage contract except with a guardian.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1101), Abu Dawood (2085) and Ibn Maajah (1881) from Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.\nThe majority of scholars are of the view – and it is the correct view – that a marriage contract done without a guardian is invalid, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the permission of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1102), Abu Dawood (2038) and Ibn Maajah (1879) from the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (1840).\nThe Hanafis are of the view that it is valid for a woman to get married without a guardian.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not valid to do a marriage contract except with a guardian. A woman does not have the authority to give herself or any other woman in marriage, or to appoint anyone except her guardian to act on her behalf regarding her marriage, so if she does that, the marriage is not valid.\nThis was narrated from ‘Umar, ‘Ali, Ibn Mas‘ood, Ibn ‘Abbaas, Abu Hurayrah and ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with them).\nIt is also the view of Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyib, al-Hasan, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, Jaabir ibn Zayd, ath-Thawri, Ibn Abi Layla, Ibn Shubrumah, Ibn al-Mubaarak, ‘Ubaydullah al-‘Anbari, ash-Shaafa‘i, Ishaaq and Abu ‘Ubayd… Abu Haneefah said: She has the right to give herself and others in marriage, and to appoint someone to act on her behalf regarding her marriage.\nThen Ibn Qudaamah stated that the view of the majority is more likely to be correct, and he quoted as evidence the hadiths quoted above.\" (Al-Mughni  9/345).\nGiven that there is a difference of opinion among the leading scholars regarding this matter, and that it is an issue that is subject to ijtihad, if a Muslim lives in a country which follows the Hanafi madhhab and regards a marriage contract done without a guardian as valid, and the marriage contract was done on that basis, then it may be deemed to be valid in that case, and the ruling of the court is not to be annulled.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a judge rules that this marriage contract is valid, or the one who did the marriage contract is a judge, it is not permissible to annul it. The same applies to all marriages that are done in an inappropriate way.\nAl-Qaadi was of the view that it could be annulled.\nThis is also the view of al-Istakhri among the companions of ash-Shaafa‘i, because the marriage was done in a manner that is contrary to a religious text.\nBut the first view is more likely to be correct [that is, that it is not to be annulled], because it is a matter concerning which there is a difference of scholarly opinion and it is subject to ijtihad. So it is not permissible to annul the ruling. Moreover, this text is open to interpretation, and there are some reservations about its soundness, and there may be other evidence that contradicts it.\" (Al-Mughni 9/347).\nBased on that, what we think is that the marriage should be deemed to be valid, even though what you did was a mistake. Therefore you must repent from that, and strive to seek the approval of your wife’s father, if he is still not happy with this marriage, because you mistreated him badly.\nIf you renew the marriage contract with her, with her father acting as her guardian in the marriage contract, in the presence of two witnesses of good character, that would be better and more prudent.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the process of marriage requires not only mutual consent between the parties involved but also the consent of the wali (guardian) of the bride. If a man has entered into a marriage contract (nikah) without the knowledge or consent of the bride's family, it raises concerns about the validity and appropriateness of the marriage.\n\n### What Must He Do Now?\n\n1. **Seek Consent of the Wali**: The first step is to seek the approval of the wali. In Islam, the presence and consent of the guardian are important aspects of a valid marriage. The Qur'an emphasizes the need for social contracts to be made with mutual consent and encourages open and respectful dialogues among families (Al-Nisa, 4:19) which states: \n\n   > \"O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly or send it [in bribery] to the rulers in order that [they might aid] you [to] consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin, while you know [it is unlawful].\" \n   *(Surah Al-Nisa, 4:29)*\n\n   This verse underscores the importance of honest dealings, which is pivotal in seeking the wali's approval.\n\n2. **Correction of the Marriage Contract**: If the marriage contract was done without the wali's knowledge, the man should ideally approach the wali for consent and possibly reconfirm the marriage contract in front of the wali to ensure that all parties are in alignment with the marriage. The Qur'an acknowledges that marriage is a serious matter that requires the proper structure (Al-Baqarah, 2:235):\n\n   > \"And do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands if they agree among themselves on an acceptable basis...\" \n   *(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:232)*\n\n3. **If Rejected, Seek a Compromise**: If the wali refuses to accept the marriage, it might be necessary to discuss with the bride to seek a mutual approach toward resolving the situation. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the aspect of compassion and kindness in handling such matters (Al-Ahzab, 33:49):\n\n   > \"O you who have believed, when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them, there is no cause for you to dictate to them any waiting period...\" \n   *(Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:49)*\n\n4. **Divorce If Necessary**: If the wali remains firm in rejecting the marriage and no compromise can be found, it may be prudent for the man to consider divorce to avoid unnecessary complications, especially if there are issues of family honor or societal acceptance involved. The Qur'an instructs on maintaining dignity and respect during a divorce (At-Talaq, 65:1):\n\n   > \"O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them at their appointed period...\" \n   *(Surah At-Talaq, 65:1)*\n\n5. **Documentation and Future Conduct**: Regardless of the outcome, ensure clear communication and consider documenting the marriage properly once consent has been obtained. Any future relations should adhere to Islamic principles of marriage, which value respectful agreements and family involvement.\n\nIn conclusion, the crucial step is to engage the wali respectfully and seek a resolution that honors everyone's rights and desires. It is always best to follow the prescribed guidelines as mentioned in the Qur'an and respect familial structures in matters of marriage."

        "question": "Her husband is sterile and she used sperm from a donor and got pregnant. Does her husband have to deny the child is his by means of li‘aan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What your wife did of inserting the sperm of a stranger is a grave sin and a betrayal of her husband, and is introducing a child who is not his. What she must do is repent to Allah, may He be exalted.\nWhat you must do is deny that this child is yours and not attribute him to yourself, because if you do not deny that he is yours, he may inherit from you and inherit from your relatives, and look at your mother and your sister, and your womenfolk will not observe hijab in front of him, and he may be alone with them, and all of that is prohibited.\nThere is no way to deny that he is yours except by means of li‘aan.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Accusing the woman of zina is of three types: obligatory, which is when he sees his wife committing zina during a period of purity in which he has not had intercourse with her – in that case, he must keep away from her until her ‘iddah ends, then if she produces a child six months from the time of committing zina and he can deny that it is his child, he must accuse her of zina and deny that her child is his, because in that case it is almost certain that the child is from the adulterer. If he does not deny that the child is his, the child will be attributed to him, and may inherit from him and his relatives, and they may inherit from him, and the child will look at his daughters and sisters, when that is not permissible. So he must deny that the child is his so as to avoid all of that.\nIf his wife admits committing zina and he believes her, it is as if he saw her do that.\" (Al-Mughni  8/71).\nAr-Ramli said in Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj (7/111): … He must deny that the child is his, otherwise if he keeps quiet the child will be attributed to him when he is not his child, which is not allowed, just as it is prohibited to deny a child who is his, for reasons that we will mention below, because there is a stern warning to the one who does that.  Because of the evil consequences that result in both cases, these are regarded as very abhorrent major sins, and in fact they are referred to as kufr (disbelief) in the sound reports, even though some of the scholars said that it is only kufr if the doer believes that it is permissible; or the reports may be interpreted as meaning that these actions are a cause that will lead to kufr; or the word kufr may be understood in the sense of being ungrateful for Allah’s blessings.\nIf he came to know of her zina in the sense of being certain or thinking that it is most likely, he should accuse her of it and should engage in the process of li‘aan in order to deny  that the child is his. Doing so is obligatory in both cases.\nOtherwise, he may limit it to denying that the child is his through the process of li‘aan, because it is possible that the child is the result of a dubious marriage or a previous marriage. End quote.\nFor a description of li‘aan and how it is done, please see the answer to question no. 33615  .\nIn the process of li‘aan, you may limit it to denying that the child is yours and swearing by Allah four times that this child is not your child, and you should say on the fifth time: May the curse of Allah be upon you if you are lying.\nThe wife should not swear an oath at that point, if she admits her sin.\nIn that case, the child cannot be attributed to you and you are not obliged to spend on him. He should be given a random name, and his mother must take care of him; she may inherit from him and he may inherit from her.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the questions of paternity, lineage, and the legitimacy of a child are of significant importance, particularly when it comes to the concept of family integrity and the laws of inheritance. In the scenario where a wife gets pregnant using sperm from a donor, while her husband is sterile, there are significant concerns regarding the husband's rights and the legitimacy of the child.\n\n### 1. **Li‘aan (Mutual Cursing)**\nThe concept of **Li‘aan** is a process that is invoked for accusations of adultery, where a husband expresses his doubt regarding the paternity of a child. This process is based on a hadith narrated by Al-Mughirah ibn Sh’ubah, in which the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \n\n> **“If a man sees something in his wife that makes him doubt the child, he should invoke Li‘aan.”** (Hadith reference related to accusations of adultery can be found in Sahih al-Bukhari, vol. 7, book 63, hadith 250)\n\nIn the case where a couple chooses to use a donor's sperm, the situation is slightly different. Since the child is biologically parented by the donor and the husband has no biological connection, invoking Li‘aan can be controversial, as it traditionally pertains to situations where a wife has committed adultery.\n\n### 2. **Paternity and Existing Laws**\nIslam emphasizes the importance of using legitimate means for procreation. As per the Islamic teachings, lineage is determined by biological paternity (as stated in Surah Al-Anfal, Ayah 25):\n\n> **\"...Know that your properties and your children are but a trial...\"** (Surah Al-Anfal, 8:28)\n\nThe Arabic tradition has also maintained that a child would take the father's name unless specified otherwise.\n\n### 3. **Considering the Child's Rights**\nThe child conceived through donor sperm is not legally or religiously considered the husband's child. The marriage between the husband and wife raises ethical questions, as it could potentially impact the family lineage and the inheritance rights of the child. \n\nIn the eyes of Islamic law (Sharia), the biological link carries a hugely essential role in establishing relationships, inheritance, and familial duties. Therefore, the child would not inherit from the husband as he would from a biological father.\n\n### 4. **Conclusions on Li‘aan**\nIn this specific case:\n- Since the husband did not father the child, and invoking Li‘aan traditionally applies to cases of doubt about fidelity rather than artificial insemination, it may not be applicable.\n- However, any decision must also factor in the husband’s feelings and the family's dynamics.\n- If both the husband and wife are in agreement about the paternity situation of the child, and if the child grows under the husband's care, many scholars argue the importance of ensuring familial stability and emotional integrity.\n\n### **Critically Connecting to Islamic Values**\nIslam values family, lineage, and honesty. The decision to utilize artificial insemination should involve mutual consent, and the parties involved should seek wisdom and guidance from knowledgeable scholars to ensure that they act in accordance with their beliefs while addressing the emotional and psychological aspects of their situation.\n\n### References\n1. **Surah Al-Anfal (8:28)** - “...Know that your properties and your children are but a trial...” \n2. **Hadith on Li‘aan** - Found in Sahih al-Bukhari, vol. 7, book 63, hadith 250.\n"

        "question": "Are rizq (provision) and marriage written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Everything from when Allaah created the Pen until the Day of Resurrection is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz, because when Allaah first created the Pen, He said to it: “Write.” It said: “My Lord, what should I write?” He said: “Write what is to be. So at that moment it began to write what would be until the Day of Resurrection. And it is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that when the foetus in its mother’s womb is four months old, Allaah sends an angel to breathe the soul into it and write down its provision, its lifespan and its deeds, and whether it is doomed or blessed.  \nProvision is also written down and connected to its means, and it does not increase or decrease. Among those means are that man should work to seek provision, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“He it is Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e. easy for you to walk, to live and to do agriculture on it); so walk in the path thereof and eat of His provision. And to Him will be the Resurrection” [al-Mulk 67:15]\nOther means are:  \nupholding ties of kinship, such as honouring one’s parents and upholding ties with relatives. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his provision to be abundant and his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship.” \nFearing Allaah (taqwa), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\n3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things” [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]\nDo not say “Provision is foreordained and limited and I will not do any of the things that lead to it,” because this is helplessness; smartness and resolve mean striving to seek provision and that which will benefit you in religious and worldly terms. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The smart man is the one who takes stock of himself and strives to do that which will benefit him after death, and the helpless one is the one who follows his own whims and desires and engages in wishful thinking, (assuming that Allaah will forgive him regardless of what he does and that he does not need to strive to good deeds).” \nJust as provision is written and connected to its means, so too marriage is also written and preordained. For both spouses it is written that he or she will be the spouse of this particular person. Nothing is hidden from Allaah on earth or in heaven. End quote. \nAnd Allaah knows best. \nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, everything that happens in the universe, including marriage and provision (rizq), is indeed preordained and recorded in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz (the Preserved Tablet). Al-Lawh al-Mahfooz is considered to be the divine record that contains all the decrees of Allah regarding the destiny of all creatures, including their sustenance and marital affairs.\n\n### 1. **Rizq (Provision)**\n\nRizq, or provision, is universally believed by Muslims to be preordained. The Quran supports this understanding. For instance, Allah states:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), Ayah 286:**  \n  “Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear…”  \n  This verse reminds believers that Allah's decrees, including their provisions, are well-calibrated to their capacity.\n\n- **Surah Hud (Chapter 11), Ayah 6:**  \n  “And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allah is its provision…”  \n  This indicates that Allah guarantees sustenance to all of His creations.\n\n- **Surah Al-Isra (Chapter 17), Ayah 31:**  \n  “And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you…”  \n  This verse emphasizes that provision comes from Allah, removing the fear of poverty.\n\n### 2. **Marriage**\n\nJust like provision, marriage is also considered to be written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz. The following verses reflect this understanding:\n\n- **Surah Al-Rum (Chapter 30), Ayah 21:**  \n  “And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find rest in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy...”  \n  This verse emphasizes that the creation of partners (spouses) is a sign of Allah’s wisdom and design.\n\n- **Surah Al-Nur (Chapter 24), Ayah 32:**  \n  “And marry those among you who are single and those who are fit among your male and female slaves. If they are poor, Allah will enrich them from His bounty…”  \n  This verse underscores the directive to marry and reinforces that Allah provides for those who seek marriage, implying it is a part of their predestined provision.\n\n### 3. **Consolidation of Beliefs**\n\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (Chapter 33), Ayah 37** highlights the importance of following Allah’s decree in matters of marriage:  \n  “And when you said to the one whom Allah had favored and you had favored, ‘Keep your wife and fear Allah,’ while you concealed within yourself that which Allah was to make manifest…”  \n  This illustrates how marriage is preordained, and individuals are guided by Allah’s commands.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, both rizq (provision) and marriage are indeed written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz. The numerous references from the Quran establish that Allah has predetermined all aspects of life, including sustenance and the spouses people will have. As believers, it is essential to have faith in Allah’s wisdom and timing in these matters, knowing that they are all part of the divine plan."

        "question": "What Are the Characteristics of a Good Wife in Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Significance of choosing a righteous companion \nAs this world is a stage that leads to the Hereafter, in which man is tested to see what he will do, so that he will be requited for it on the Day of Resurrection, what the wise Muslim must do is seek in this world everything that will help him to attain happiness and bliss in the Hereafter. \nThe most important help and support is righteous company. That begins with the Muslim society in which he lives, then with choosing pious friends, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined: “Do not keep company with anyone but a believer.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (4832); classed as hasan (good) by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘.\nThen finally he should choose a righteous wife who he hopes will be the best companion to help him attain eternal happiness in Paradise with Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nBest qualities of a good wife\nThe righteous wife is one who is good in many aspects.\nShe is the one who it is thought will guard her chastity and her honour in the husband’s presence and absence, and be diligent with regard to both minor and major issues.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband’s) absence what Allah would have them guard” [an-Nisa 4:34].\nShe is the one who is of good character and has good manners. She is not known for foul speech, meanness or bad manners; rather she is good-natured, pure of soul and clean of heart, speaks in a gentle manner and treats people kindly.\nMore important than all of that, she accepts advice and listens to it attentively and wholeheartedly; she is not one of those who are used to arguing stubbornly and arrogantly.\nAl-Asma‘i said: \n“An elder from the tribe of Banu’l-‘Anbar said: It was said that women are of three types: one who is easy-going, gentle, chaste and dignified, Muslim, a help to her family, and not a burden on them; one who is merely a vessel for childbearing; and one who is like a heavy yoke that Allah places on the neck of whomever He wills, and takes it away from whomever He wills.”\nOne of the scholars said: “The best of women is the one who, if she is given she is grateful, and if she is deprived she is patient; you feel happy when you look at her, and she obeys you if you instruct her to do something.”\nShe is the one who upholds her connection to her Lord and always strives to increase her level of faith and piety. She does not omit any obligatory duty, and she is keen to do some nafl (supererogatory) deeds. She gives precedence to pleasing Allah, may He be glorified, over everything else.\nConcerning that, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4802) and Muslim (1466).\nThe righteous wife is the one whom you see is serious about caring for and raising your children, teaching them Islam, good manners and the Quran, and instilling in them love for Allah, love for His Messenger, and love of good for people. Her main concern is not what they may attain in this world of prominence, wealth and degrees; rather she is concerned that they should attain a high level of piety, religious commitment, good character and knowledge.\nIn addition to all of that, the Muslim should choose a wife who gives him comfort when he sees her, and he feels joy in his heart when she is present, so she fills his house and his life with ease, joy and happiness.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what type of wife is best? He said: “The one who makes (her husband) happy when he looks at her, and she obeys him if he instructs her to do something, and she does not do anything with regard to herself or his wealth in a manner of which he does not approve.”\nNarrated by Ahmad (2/251); classed as hasan (good) by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (1838).\nIt was said to ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her): Which type of woman is best? She said: The one who does not know about saying bad things, and she is not crafty like men; her focus is on adorning herself for her husband and taking care of her family.\nFor more information, please see questions no. 6585 , 8391 , 26744 , and 83777 .\nReferences\nMuhadarat al-Udaba by ar-Raghib al-Asfahani, 1/410. \n‘Uyoon al-Akhbar by Ibn Qutaybah, 1/375.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the characteristics of a good wife are grounded in the Qur'an and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Here are some essential characteristics based on these teachings:\n\n### 1. **Faith and Righteousness**\nA good wife is expected to be a believer and practice her faith sincerely. Faith is a foundational element in a marital relationship, encouraging a spouse to uphold moral values and good conduct. The Qur'an states:\n\n> \"And whosoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, while being a believer - those will enter Paradise\" (Surah An-Nisa, 4:124).\n\nThis teaches us that both men and women should strive for righteousness in their lives.\n\n### 2. **Supportive and Cooperative**\nA good wife should support her husband and work cooperatively towards mutual goals. The importance of a harmonious relationship is emphasized through the idea of building a life together based on love and compassion:\n\n> \"And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them. And He placed between you affection and mercy...\" (Surah Ar-Rum, 30:21).\n\n### 3. **Good Character and Modesty**\nModesty and good character are vital traits for a good wife. The Qur'an advises women to behave modestly and uphold their dignity:\n\n> \"O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not abused...\" (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:59).\n\nThis verse reinforces the significance of modesty and maintaining a good reputation.\n\n### 4. **Strength in Times of Trials**\nA good wife is expected to be resilient during difficulties and conflicts. The Qur'an encourages peace and reconciliation between spouses, highlighting the importance of resolving disputes amicably:\n\n> \"And if you fear a breach between them, appoint an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from her family. If they both desire reconciliation, Allah will cause it between them...\" (Surah An-Nisa, 4:35).\n\nThis shows that a good wife actively participates in ensuring peace, fostering harmony, and seeking resolutions.\n\n### 5. **Respect for the Husband**\nRespecting and honoring one's husband is a key aspect of a good marital relationship in Islam. The Qur'an advises both spouses to treat each other with kindness:\n\n> \"And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good\" (Surah An-Nisa, 4:19).\n\nThis emphasizes the principle of kindness regardless of dissatisfaction.\n\n### 6. **Mutual Rights and Obligations**\nA good wife understands that there are mutual rights and obligations in marriage. The Qur'an explicitly mentions:\n\n> \"And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is acceptable...\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:228).\n\nThis reiterates the balance and fairness that should exist within the marital relationship.\n\n### 7. **Patience and Forbearance**\nA good wife is encouraged to be patient and forgiving, particularly in a relationship where conflicts may arise. The Qur'an mentions the virtue of forgiveness:\n\n> \"But if you pardon and overlook and forgive - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful\" (Surah Al-Taghabun, 64:14).\n\nA good wife demonstrates these qualities in her dealings with her spouse.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe characteristics of a good wife in Islam encompass faith, support, good character, respect for the husband, patience, and an understanding of mutual rights and responsibilities. This holistic view of a marital partnership is vital for sustaining a healthy and fulfilling relationship in Islam. The cited verses underscore the divine guidance that shapes these characteristics, reflecting the profound respect and dignity that marriage should embody."

        "question": "Is Contraception Haram?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is it obligatory for a couple to produce children?\nWe hope that our brother will be certain that not one of the scholars said that it is obligatory for a couple to produce children, and that if they do not produce twenty children then they are sinning and deserve to be punished by Allah! \nSimilarly, not one of the earlier or contemporary scholars – as far as we know – has said that it is the fate of the wife to have a baby and breastfeed every single year, or that if the couple choose to delay pregnancy and having children, that is haram. \nWe mention these facts to you, and ward off doubts based on illusion, so that we can introduce the Islamic ruling, first of all, and so as to highlight that everything that you mentioned in your question is not an argument that has any sound basis, because the Islamic ruling is far removed from what you mentioned in your question. \nIs it permissible to delay having children?\nIn fact, the Islamic evidence indicates that it is permissible to delay having children. As Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with said): “We used to engage in ‘azl [coitus interruptus, a form of contraception] at the time when the Quran was being revealed. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5208) and Muslim , 1440) ‘Azl (coitus interruptus) means ejaculating outside the woman’s vagina in order to avoid pregnancy. \nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted this hadith as evidence for it being permissible to space having children in order to give them a proper Islamic upbringing, when he said: \n“If a woman has a lot of children, and it is difficult for her to give them a proper Islamic upbringing because they are so many, then there is nothing wrong with her taking something to space her pregnancies in order to achieve this important purpose, so that pregnancy will not adversely affect her or her children, as Allah has permitted ‘azl for this and similar purposes.” (Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn Baz ed. by ash-Shuway‘ir, 21/394) \nIs contraception haram?\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“Taking contraceptive measures is permissible in principle, because the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used the method of ‘azl (coitus interruptus) during the time of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he did not forbid them to do that. But it is contrary to what is preferable, because having a lot of children is something that is prescribed and is desirable.” (Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by al-‘Uthaymin, 22/2)\nWe have previously stated that it is encouraged to have a lot of righteous children .  \nThe ruling on different considerations for delaying having children \nSo you may rest assured that if you and your wife decide to delay having children, as you mentioned in your question, that is not regarded as a sin or disobedience in principle, unless there are other considerations that have an impact on this individual or personal choice, which may be dictated by present-day circumstances: \n\nIf the decision to delay having children is widespread, at the societal, national or ummah-wide level, then in this case it becomes a destructive and negative choice, and in that case the ruling is that it is not allowed, because it has moved from being a permissible and natural matter to one that is imposed from without and will lead to negative consequences, and is therefore blameworthy. \n\n\nIf the motive for delaying having children is fear for their provision and livelihood , then this reflects a serious doubt concerning our belief in the will and decree of Allah and our belief in the abundant provision of Allah and that He will help those who strive to earn a living in the land. It reflects an unjustified fear of the future and a failure to produce and strive. In that case it is blameworthy and is not allowed, and there are clear fatwas that speak of it. \n\n\nIf the reason for not having children is arguments and conflict between the spouses , where one of them does not want children and the other one does, then the one who is refusing does not have the right to do so, because having children is a right of both spouses, and it is not permissible for one of them to refuse with no excuse or good reason.\n\n\nIf the motive for delaying having children, or ceasing to do so, is to follow the cultural norms of non-Muslims and imitate them blindly, out of admiration for their culture and infatuation with their way of life, then undoubtedly the ruling in this case is that it is not allowed. One of the great principles of Islamic teaching is that the individual Muslim should be independent in his thinking and think within the framework of Islamic teaching; he should weigh up pros and cons objectively in the light of the circumstances that he lives in, and base his decisions on the Islamic principles in which he believes and with which he grew up, far removed from the illusionary psychological influences that are imposed by the media that represents the corporate powers that exist today, and should free himself from feelings of inferiority in the face of what he sees of the attitudes, customs and actions of the disbelieving nations. \n\n\nIf the means of delaying having children is medicine or surgical procedures that will prevent having children altogether (sterilisation), so that the woman or her husband will lose the ability to ever have children, then this is a serious transgression and is ingratitude for the blessing of Allah that He has bestowed upon His slaves, and it is destruction of a great blessing that Allah has instilled and created in them on the basis of great wisdom. \n\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade such things. This is the case concerning which there is no difference of opinion among the scholars that it is prohibited, for it is the undermining of one of the most important aims of Shari`ah and a blatant violation of one of the five necessities that Islam came to protect, which are: religious commitment, life, honour, wealth, and offspring. \nThese five cases are what the scholars refer to when they speak about spacing or limiting the number of children . They are the reason why they spoke in strict terms in many cases, so that no one would take undue advantage of the fatwas which say that contraception is permissible . \nThat is why we have mentioned these five cases here, so as to draw attention to them. In any other case, where a couple takes an individual decision on the basis of a genuine need, there is no blame on them for that. \nAnyone who reflects on the statement of the International Islamic Fiqh Council no. 39 (1/5), which has to do with family planning, will clearly understand that the way in which it is drafted is very careful and clear, as we have explained above. It says in the statement: \nThe session of the Islamic Fiqh Council held during its fifth conference in Kuwait, 1-6 Jumada al-Akhir 1409 AH/10-15 December 1988 AH. \nAfter studying the research papers presented by council members and experts on the topic of family planning, and listening to the discussion that took place on the topic, \nAnd based on the fact that one of the aims of marriage according to Islamic teaching is to produce children and preserve the human race, and that it is not permissible to undermine this aim, because undermining it is contrary to the texts of Islam and their teachings which call for having a lot of offspring, protecting them and caring for them because protecting offspring is one of the five holistic principles that are promoted by Islamic teaching, \nThe council determined the following: \n\nFirstly: it is not permissible to promulgate laws restricting the freedom of couples to have children. \nSecondly: it is prohibited to completely eradicate the ability to have children in the case of either the man or the woman, which is known as sterilisation, so long as there is no necessary reason, according to Islamic standards, for doing so. \nThirdly: it is permissible to use temporary methods of birth control for the purpose of spacing pregnancies, or preventing pregnancy for a specific length of time, if there is a valid reason, according to Islamic teachings, for doing so, according to what a couple decide on the basis of mutual consultation and consent, on condition that this does not lead to any harm and that the method used is Islamically permissible and does not cause harm to any existing pregnancy.

        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether contraception is considered haram (forbidden) in Islam is a complex issue and may vary based on interpretation, cultural practices, and the beliefs of different Islamic scholars. At its core, the Islamic perspective on contraception generally allows for its use provided it does not contradict the fundamental tenets of Islamic beliefs concerning family and procreation.\n\n### General Considerations Regarding Contraception\n\n1. **Islamic Views on Procreation**: Marriage is highly valued in Islam, and procreation is often encouraged. Children are seen as a blessing, and there is a strong emphasis on family. However, the Quran does not explicitly prohibit birth control methods.\n\n2. **The Intent Behind Contraception**: The use of contraception could be seen favorably if the intention is to allow parents to adequately provide for their children emotionally, financially, and physically. In this context, planning for children can be viewed as a responsible action.\n\n3. **Islamic Jurisprudence**: Many Islamic scholars refer to the permissibility of contraception based on the principle of avoiding harm (darar) and promoting welfare (maslahah). If contraception is used to protect the welfare of the family and mother, it may be seen as acceptable.\n\n### Supporting Verses\n\nIn addition to the considerations mentioned above, the following Quranic verses are relevant:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233)**:\n   > \"Mothers may breastfeed their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period]. Upon the father is their provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable, and no person is charged with more than his capacity.\"  \n   **Interpretation**: This outlines the responsibilities of the parents in caring for the children and emphasizes the importance of adequate provision for the family. It can be argued that using contraception to ensure that parents can adequately provide for their children aligns with this directive.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221)**: \n   > \"And do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith.\"  \n   **Interpretation**: This indicates that decisions concerning family life should be aligned with faith. Responsible family planning can also be included in this framework when managing the size of the family aligns with the ability to uphold Islamic values and responsibilities.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:6)**:\n   > \"O you who believe, fulfill your obligations. Made lawful (as food) for you are animals except those mentioned (here); but unlawful during Pilgrimage is game. God ordains whatsoever He wills.\"  \n   **Interpretation**: The broader principle of fulfilling one’s obligations and responsibilities can be extended to mean that families should manage their ability to maintain and nurture children, potentially through the use of contraception.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nContraception in Islam is a nuanced topic. While there are no explicit verses in the Quran that categorize contraception as haram, various scholars may interpret the permissibility based on the intent and context. Families who wish to use contraception are encouraged to reflect on their circumstances and seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars within their communities. Ultimately, the decisions regarding contraception should be made with the intention of benefiting the family unit and ensuring the well-being of both parents and children. \n\n**References**:\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233)\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221)\n- Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:6)"

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Islamic texts encourage marriage and state that it is the way of the Prophets and Messengers. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), and made for them wives and offspring” [ar-Ra‘d 13:38]\n“And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Salihoon (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves).

        "predicted_answer": "Islamic teachings on marriage, the status of women, and ways to cultivate a successful marital relationship can be derived from various verses in the Qur'an, particularly from Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2) and Surah An-Nisa (Chapter 4). Below is a summary of key rulings and guidelines, along with supporting Qur'anic references.\n\n### 1. Importance of Marriage\n\nMarriage is highly encouraged in Islam as a means to find tranquility and companionship. The Qur'an states:\n\n> \"And among His signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find tranquility in them, and He has put love and mercy between your hearts.\"  \n> (Surah Ar-Rum, 30:21)\n\n### 2. Responsibilities and Rights\n\n#### a. Mutual Rights and Responsibilities\n\nThe Qur'an emphasizes that both men and women have rights over each other. It states:\n\n> \"And they (women) have rights similar to those (of men) over them in kindness, and men are a degree above them.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:228)\n\nThis verse underlines the mutual rights that both genders have in a marriage, indicating the importance of kindness and respect.\n\n#### b. Financial Responsibilities\n\nFinancial provisions in marriage are also addressed. Men have the obligation to provide for the women they marry. The verses illustrate the importance of providing proper adornment and maintenance:\n\n> \"There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry; but then provide adequately for them...\"  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:236)\n\n### 3. Conduct During Marriage and Divorce\n\n#### a. Fair Treatment\n\nIslam acknowledges the challenges in treating multiple wives with fairness:\n\n> \"...Howsoever you may try you will never be able to treat your wives equally. But do not incline (to one) exclusively and leave (the other) suspended...\"  \n> (Surah An-Nisa, 4:129)\n\nThis verse encourages just treatment and solicits mutual respect between spouses.\n\n#### b. Divorce\n\nDivorce is allowed but should be approached with sensitivity and care:\n\n> \"Divorce is (revocable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are) two ways open for husbands: either to keep (them) honourably, or to part with them in a decent way.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:229)\n\nThis indicates the importance of conducting divorces respectfully, ensuring that both parties’ rights are upheld.\n\n#### c. Waiting Period (Iddah)\n\nWomen who have been divorced must observe a waiting period:\n\n> \"Women who are divorced have to wait for three monthly periods...\"  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:228)\n\nThis provision allows for reconciliation and consideration of the woman's circumstances.\n\n### 4. Encouragement of Reconciliation\n\nThe Qur'an encourages couples to work towards reconciliation if issues arise:\n\n> \"And if they (the couple) decide to separate, God in His largesse will provide for them; for God is infinite and all wise.\"  \n> (Surah An-Nisa, 4:130)\n\nThis illustrates that efforts toward peace and reconciliation are commendable in Islam.\n\n### 5. Guidelines on Choosing a Spouse\n\nWhen selecting a spouse, certain criteria are provided to ensure compatibility, faith, and shared values:\n\n> \"And do not wed the women your fathers had wed... unchaste women unless they are captives (of war).\"  \n> (Surah An-Nisa, 4:22-24)\n\nThese guidelines emphasize lawful relationships and the importance of choosing partners with care and respect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIslamic teachings about marriage not only lay out the legal framework but also emphasize the ethical conduct and emotional responsibilities both partners share. The verses in the Qur'an reflect a balanced approach to marriage, ensuring rights, responsibilities, and mutual respect. Marriage is seen as a partnership aimed at fostering love, mercy, and understanding. \n\nThe highlighted verses from Surah Al-Baqarah (2:228, 2:236, 2:229, etc.) and Surah An-Nisa (4:22-24, 4:129, etc.) provide a foundation for the rulings and principles guiding Islamic marriage and divorce, and they promote a successful and harmonious marital life."

        "question": "She refuses to get married for fear that her husband might force her to work",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We are very happy to see among the youth of our ummah people with enlightened minds and pure hearts, both young men and young women, who are able to cast off the chains and fetters of division and differences, and return to the purity of Islam as Allah revealed it to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). That is an immense and incomparable blessing, because the people became divided after the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) into sects and parties, each of them adhering to the call of their shaykhs and imams, until Islam became like a stranger among these groups and sects, despite the fact that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects (all kinds of religious sects), you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) have no concern in them in the least. Their affair is only with Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do” [al-An‘aam 6:159]. \nWe congratulate you and commend your way of thinking and focusing on the most important questions in life, those that have to do with religious commitment and beliefs, and what a person should believe in and adhere to with regard to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. \nThis path begins with the first step, which you have taken on the basis of what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has blessed you with of a mind that is able to ponder and reflect, far removed from all previous intellectual and social influences. Hence you read the Holy Qur’an far removed from sectarian distortions and interpretations that detract from the clarity of the text and deprive the reader of its benefits. So you ponder the word of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, that He sent down to guide mankind and enlighten humanity, and you will inevitably find therein guidance and enlightenment for yourself too, in clear and straightforward words in most of its verses and chapters. So you read therein the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’an) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. saved from the torment of Hell)” [al-An‘aam 6:155]\n“(This is the) Book (the Quran) sent down unto you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), so let not your heart be troubled about it, that you warn thereby, and a reminder unto the believers.\n(Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) to these idolaters (pagan Arabs) of your folk:) Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’an and Prophet Muhammad’s Sunnah), and follow not any Awliya (protectors and helpers, etc. who order you to associate partners in worship with Allah), besides Him (Allah). Little do you remember” [al-A‘raaf 7:2-3]. \nAs guidance is connected to following the Holy Qur’an and following Allah’s noble Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then what guidance could you find after that in the opinions and views of human beings? What happiness could we seek other than in the noble Book and the Prophet’s Sunnah? \nWhy would we introduce intermediaries between us and these two lights? Do we not have minds with which to think? Has Allah may He be glorified and exalted, not created for us hearts with which to distinguish between truth and falsehood? So why do we persist in imitating that with which we may have grown up of sectarian notions or esoteric factions? \nWhere do we find these factions in the Book of Allah, and where do we find them in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)? \nDo you think that we will enter Hell if we do not believe in a particular imam or a particular sect? \nDoes it make sense to suggest that we will enter Hell if we do not believe in things that neither the Holy Qur’an nor the noble Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught us? \nThese are very few simple questions that will lead us to cast away all these sects and factions and weird beliefs, and to become certain of the path that we follow, far away from them and closer to the pure Tawheed (affirmation of the Oneness of Allah) that is the religion of all of the Prophets (peace be upon them). \nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say: ‘Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, but if you turn away, he (Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) is only responsible for the duty placed on him (i.e. to convey Allah’s Message) and you for that placed on you. If you obey him, you shall be on the right guidance. The Messengers duty is only to convey (the message) in a clear way (i.e. to preach in a plain way).’” [an-Noor 24:54]\n“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it) , and fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment” [al-Hashr 59:7]. \nMoreover you should understand that the teachings of Islam do not instruct you to give up studying for fear that your husband may force you to work. The husband has no right to force his wife to do that, and by the same token he has no right to your wealth or property. Rather you can stipulate (in your marriage contract) whatever is appropriate for you and your situation. If you both agree that you can work in an appropriate environment, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as you strive to adhere to Islamic guidelines. \nIf you yourself do not want to work, then no one has the right to stipulate that you must do that, and you have the right to state that and stipulate whatever you wish to anyone who proposes marriage to you, so long as you do not make that a barrier that prevents you from getting married. Rather you should strive to maintain your chastity by getting married and choose for yourself a righteous husband who will take you from the environment, beliefs and traditions with which you have grown up and help you to adhere to the true and pure religion. It is not essential that his outward appearance should be such that it would cause your family to reject him; rather it is sufficient that he should be of good character and generally acceptable in terms of religious commitment, one who is keen to follow his religion and who prays regularly. \nIf you want to delay postgraduate study until after marriage, then you know best what is appropriate for you. But if you want to complete your studies, whilst striving to reduce things that are contrary to Islamic teachings to the best of your ability, and you are keen to pray on time so that the time for prayer does not end before you offer the prayer, except in exceptional circumstances and emergencies, then do that, and we hope that there will be nothing wrong with you doing that, in sha Allah. \nGoing out of the house does not require a mahram; rather it is in the case of travel that that is required, especially if you adhere to hijab and proper conduct, and there is no danger posed by aggressors. \nBut if you fear for yourself, that you may be subject to aggression, or you fear losing your religious commitment, or you are not able to observe hijab or adhere to the guidelines of your religion, then give precedence to all of that over the interests of work. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In response to the concern regarding a woman's fear of marrying due to the potential for her husband to force her to work, it’s essential to address the Islamic perspective on marriage, rights, responsibilities, and personal autonomy based on the Qur'an.\n\n### Rights of Women in Marriage\n\n1. **Mutual Consent:** Marriage in Islam is a partnership that requires mutual consent. The Qur'an emphasizes the agreement of both parties (surah 4 - An-Nisa, ayah 24). This indicates that a woman has the right to discuss and agree upon her circumstances before marriage:\n   - **Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 24**: \"Also forbidden are married women unless they are captives (of war). Such is the decree of God. Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery. Then give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower. It will not be sinful if you agree to something (else) by mutual consent after having settled the dowry.\" \n\n2. **Financial Independence:** The right to financial independence and negotiation regarding employment or work also underlines a woman’s autonomy. The Qur'an allows women to own property and engage in work if they choose to do so:\n   - **Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 32** mentions the importance of women’s rights and responsibilities. They also have rights regarding their earnings, suggesting that a woman is not obliged to work at her husband’s behest if she does not wish to.\n\n### Duties and Responsibilities\n\n3. **The Role of Wives:** While husbands have responsibilities towards their wives, including provision and protection, wives are not mandated to work unless they willingly choose to. In Islam, mutual respect and partnership are encouraged:\n   - **Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 34** discusses the roles of men as providers (qawwamun) and highlights the importance of mutual responsibilities in the household.\n\n4. **Emphasis on Kind Treatment:** Men are instructed to treat their wives with kindness and respect, which inherently means considering their feelings and choices regarding work:\n   - **Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 19**: \"O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, nor should you impede them from marrying their suitors when they have agreed with them in fairness. And live with them in kindness.\"\n\n### The Concept of Support\n\n5. **Support and Understanding:** The Qur'an advises believers to be understanding and supportive of one another's conditions. If a woman does not wish to work, a husband should respect that choice and provide the necessary support. The concept of partnership in marriage is aimed at creating beneficial and healthy relationships:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 228** states: \"Women have rights similar to those against them in a just manner, and men are a degree above them.\" This means while men have certain responsibilities, both parties are granted rights, reinforcing the notion of equality in mutual respect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the decision to marry should be based on consent and the understanding of mutual rights and responsibilities. Women are encouraged to voice their concerns and preferences, including the choice of employment. Islam advocates for a respectful and equitable partnership where both parties honor each other's wishes and decisions. Marriage should not be a source of coercion but rather a union built on mutual respect, understanding, and support.\n\n### References:\n- Surah An-Nisa (4:24)\n- Surah An-Nisa (4:19)\n- Surah An-Nisa (4:34)\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:228) \n\nThese verses collectively highlight the need for mutual respect and partnership in Islam, underscoring the importance of personal agency and consent in the context of marriage."

        "question": "Is it proven that the righteous wife will have a reward like that of one who fasts and prays qiyaam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Perhaps you are referring to the report that was narrated by at-Tabaraani in al-Mu‘jam al-Awsat (6733), and Ibn ‘Asaakir in his Tareekh (43/348), via ‘Amr ibn Sa‘eed al-Khawlaani from Anas ibn Maalik, according to which Salaamah the nurse of Ibraaheem, the son of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), said: O Messenger of Allah, you give the men all kinds of glad tidings but you do not give the women such glad tidings? He said: “Would it not please one of you that if she is pregnant from her husband and he is pleased with her, that she will have the reward of one who fasts and prays qiyaam for the sake of Allah?...” \nThis hadeeth is fabricated. It was narrated by Ibn al-Jawzi in al-Mawdoo‘aat (2/274). He said: \nIbn Hibbaan said: ‘Amr ibn Sa‘eed is the one who narrated this fabricated hadeeth from Anas; it is not permissible to quote it except by way of highlighting an example of a fabricated hadeeth.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is established through various verses of the Qur'an that both righteous men and women who fulfill their religious duties and act righteously will be rewarded by Allah. Specifically regarding the question of whether a righteous wife has a reward equivalent to one who fasts and prays qiyaam (night prayers), the Qur'an provides ample evidence supporting this notion.\n\n### Quranic Evidence\n\n1. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:31-35)**: \n   This passage refers to the righteous among the wives of the Prophet, stating that obedience to Allah and His Messenger will result in a double reward. It highlights various qualities such as performing devotional obligations, paying zakat, and remembering Allah, which are characterized as righteous deeds.\n\n   > \"But whoever of you is obedient to Allah and His Messenger, and does the right, will be given a two-fold reward by Us; and We have a rich provision in readiness for her.\"  \n   > (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:31).\n\n   Additionally, it mentions that men and women who are believers will receive great rewards for their righteous deeds:\n\n   > \"Verily men and women who have come to submission, men and women who are believers, men and women who are devout… for them God has forgiveness and a great reward.\"  \n   > (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:35).\n\n2. **Surah An-Nisa (4:124)**:\n   This verse states that those who perform good deeds, irrespective of gender, and are believers will surely enter Paradise and will not be deprived of their rewards. This further emphasizes that the righteous acts of women, including a righteous wife, are recognized and valued equally.\n\n   > \"But he who performs good deeds, whether man or a woman, and is a believer, will surely enter Paradise, and none shall be deprived even of an iota of his reward.\"  \n   > (Surah An-Nisa 4:124).\n\n3. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:29-30)**:\n   This passage reinforces Allah's promise of reward for those who embrace faith and righteousness, particularly directed at the wives of the Prophet but also applicable to all believing women.\n\n   > \"But if you desire Allah and His Messenger, and the joys of life to come, then Allah has verily set apart for those of you who are good, a great reward.\"  \n   > (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:29).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Qur'an clearly states that righteous acts, including those performed by women, will not be overlooked. The verses indicate that both men and women will receive rewards for their faith and good deeds, such as fasting and engaging in prayer. Given that a righteous wife who fulfills her obligations and lives in obedience to Allah will be rewarded significantly, it can be understood that her reward aligns with those who pray and fast, as both groups are performing acts of piety and righteousness recognized by Allah. \n\nIn conclusion, the righteousness of a wife in her duties resonates with the rewards promised for acts such as fasting and Qiyaam, and thus supports the notion that her efforts will indeed receive equivalent reward."

        "question": "I do not want to get married but my parents want me to; am I Islamically obliged to agree?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that marriage is part of the teachings and practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rebuked those who wanted to remain unmarried. He said: “As for me, I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sunnah (my way) is not of me.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4776) and Muslim (1401). What is meant by “my Sunnah” is his guidance and path. No one has the right to forsake the path, guidance and Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for the sake of some worldly matter because he is keen to pursue further studies or earn more money or seek some social position, or because of some specious argument of the evil doers that comes to his mind, and so on. \nThis teaching is more emphasized at times of fitnah (turmoil or temptation) when a person fears for himself (that he may give into temptation) because there is no control and no one is watching him. So the Muslim is enjoined to seek help in controlling his evil inclinations and in resisting the Shaytaan by all possible means, and he is enjoined to seek and attain chastity. If he fears that he may give in to temptation, then it is obligatory for him to get married, so as to ward off temptation and corruption from his religious commitment. \nYou should understand that some younger women may be sought in marriage at a specific age, when compatible and righteous men propose marriage to them, but they refuse on the grounds that they want to complete their studies, or they are looking for someone who is more rich, and so on. Then they grow older and spend the rest of their lives waiting. By doing so, they go against the command of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to accept a righteous husband who is religiously committed and of good character. \n“If there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then give [your daughter or other female relative under your care] to him in marriage, for if you do not do that there will be fitnah in the land and a great deal of mischief.” [Hadeeth narrated by at-Tirmidhi] \nBy doing that, the woman forgets her true role in life, the purpose for which Allah created mankind in two halves, male and female, and made that one of the signs of His might and power, and of His Oneness, may He be exalted. \nTherefore we do not agree that you should disregard the idea of marriage altogether on the grounds of pursuing further study or seeking material gains. If you do have a clear reason for that, then explain it to your parents and come to some mutual understanding about it, so long as you are not using that as an excuse to forgo marriage altogether and ignore one of the greatest means of maintaining a sound way of life and establishing true servitude (‘uboodiyyah) to Allah in this world. \nBut if what you meant is that you do not want to marry a particular individual, for some reason, although you accept the principle if a compatible man proposes to you, then this is your right and there is nothing wrong with that; your parents do not have the right to force you to marry a particular person. \nPlease see also the answer to question no. 163990 \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the institution of marriage is highly regarded and seen as a means of fulfilling important aspects of family and societal life. However, individual consent plays a crucial role in the decision to marry.\n\n1. **Consent in Marriage**:\n   The Prophet Muhammad stated clearly in his teachings that both parties, particularly a woman, must consent to the marriage. He said, \"A woman should not be married until she gives her consent\" (Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 1845). This indicates that you are not obliged to marry someone against your will, even if your parents desire otherwise.\n\n2. **The Significance of Individual Choice**:\n   The Quran emphasizes personal belief and choice in faith. For example, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:256) states: \"There is no compulsion in religion\" (لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ). Although this verse pertains generally to belief, it reflects the importance of individual choice in various aspects of life, including marriage.\n\n3. **Obeying Parents**:\n   While honoring one's parents and their wishes is an essential aspect of Islamic ethics, it does not override individual autonomy in personal decisions, such as marriage. Surah Al-Isra (17:23) states: \"And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment.\" This shows the importance of treating parents kindly but does not impose an obligation to follow their wishes in every circumstance.\n\n4. **Making a Decision**:\n   In Surah Al-Ahzab (33:36), it is stated: \"No believing man or believing woman should have any doubt about a matter decided by God and His Messenger...\". This suggests that each believer should make decisions aligned with their understanding of faith and personal conviction. Therefore, if you feel strongly against marriage, this is valid in the eyes of the Islamic teachings, assuming you are acting based on considered conviction and not rebellion or caprice.\n\n### Conclusion:\nYou are not Islamically obliged to agree to marry against your will. While it is important to respect the wishes of your parents, your own agency and comfort in the marriage decision is paramount in Islam. If your desire aligns more with personal conviction and ethics of consent, it may be worth having a respectful discussion with your parents to express your feelings and concerns. Ultimately, your comfort and consent in such a significant life decision are crucial in Islamic teachings."

        "question": "He committed zina with a married woman who was estranged from her husband; can he marry her if her husband divorces her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a woman leaves her husband or a man leaves his wife for one or two years, or for more or less time than that, the marriage remains valid until the man actually divorces his wife. So long as that has not happened, and the man has not uttered the word of divorce (talaaq) to his wife, or has not written words to that effect with the intention of divorcing her, then the woman is still his wife, even if the separation has gone on for a long time. \nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: When is a woman regarded as divorced? He said: The woman is regarded as divorced if her husband issues a divorce (talaaq) to her when he is of sound mind and does so by choice, with no impediment to divorce such as insanity, intoxication and the like, and the woman is pure (i.e., not menstruating), during a period of purity in which he has not had intercourse with her, or she is pregnant or postmenopausal.\nEnd quote from Fataawa at-Talaaq, 1/35 \nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 11681\nSecondly: \nZina (fornication or adultery) is one of the major sins; the degree of sin is worse and the punishment is multiplied if the woman is married, because that is a betrayal of her husband … Hence the punishment for an unmarried zaani is one hundred lashes, and the punishment for a previously married zaani is stoning to death. \nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)), and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him)”\nAl-Isra’ 17:32]. \nShaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The prohibition on approaching it or coming near it is more eloquent than merely prohibiting the action, because that includes the prohibition on all the things that may lead to it or promote it, because the one who approaches a forbidden area will soon find himself wandering in it, especially in the case of this matter which is very tempting for many people. \nAllah described zina and its abhorrent nature as a “faashishah” (something that transgresses its limits); in other words it is a sin that is regarded as immoral and odious in terms of sharee‘ah, rational thought and sound human nature, because it implies transgression of the sacred limits with regard to the rights of Allah, the rights of the woman and the rights of her family or husband, betrayal of marriage, confusion of lineage, and other negative consequences. \nThe words “and an evil way” mean: what an evil way is the way of the one who dares to commit this grave sin.\nEnd quote from Tafseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan fi Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan, 1/457 \nWhat they must both do is repent sincerely, turn back to Allah and keep away from the things that lead to zina. Whoever repents, Allah will accept his repentance. \nFor more information on the crime of zina and repentance therefrom, please see the answer to question no. 47924 and 138270\nSecondly: \nThe basic principle is that it is not permissible for the zaani to marry the zaaniyah until after they have repented sincerely, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The adulterer marries not but an adulteress or a Mushrikah and the adulteress none marries her except an adulterer or a Muskrik (and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely he is either an adulterer, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater, etc.) And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress, etc.)). Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism)”\n[an-Noor 24:3]. \nRepentance is attained by regretting (what one has done) and resolving not to go back to the sin. So long as they have repented and regretted what they fell into of sin, it is valid for them to marry according to most of the scholars. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nIf a woman commits zina, it is not permissible for the one who knows of that to marry her unless two conditions are met:\n1.That her ‘iddah has ended\n2.That she has repented from zina.\nIf these two conditions are met, it is permissible for the zaani or anyone else to marry her, according to the opinion of most of the scholars, including Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbaas, Jaabir, Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyab, Tawoos, Jaabir ibn Zayd, ‘Ata’, al-Hasan, ‘Ikrimah, az-Zuhri, ath-Thawri, ash-Shaafa‘i, Ibn al-Mundhir, and ashaab ar-ra’y. \nIt was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood, al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib and ‘Aa’ishah that she is not permissible (in marriage) for the zaani under any circumstances. They said: They are still zaanis whenever they are together, because of the general meaning of the verse and the report. \nIt may be that what they meant by that was the period before they repent or before it is established that she is not pregnant, in which case it is the same as our view. \nWith regard to it being forbidden in absolute terms, that is not correct, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “All others are lawful, provided you seek (them in marriage) with Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) from your property” [an-Nisa’ 4:24]. \nBecause she is permissible (in marriage) for someone other than the one who committed zina with her, she is also permissible to him, like any other woman. \nEnd quote from al-Mughni, 7/108. \nThirdly: \nIt is not permissible for a Muslim to turn a woman against her husband because that leads to the breakup of families, even if there was a bitter dispute between the spouses. Some scholars regarded this as a major sin. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who turns a woman against her husband.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2175; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. \nAbu Dawood (5170) also narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever turns a man’s wife or slave against him is not one of us.”\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. \nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeem Abaadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“Whoever turns a woman against her husband” (means) by mentioning the husband’s bad qualities to his wife, or mentioning the good qualities of another man to her. \n‘Awn al-Ma‘bood, 6/159 \nAnd he said “Whoever turns a man’s wife” means: he deceives her and corrupts her, or makes the idea of divorce attractive to her so that he or someone else can marry her, and so on.\n‘Awn al-Ma‘bood, 14/52 \nAl-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our shaykh, ash-Sha‘raawi, said: That also includes the case where a woman who is angry with her husband comes to him so that he can reconcile between them, for example, so he offers her abundant food and wants to spend on her and honour her, even if that is in order to honour her husband, then her heart may be inclined to someone else and she starts to look down on her husband. This is also included in this hadeeth. The wise man should be careful with regard to such matters, even if his intention is good. \nHe said: I did this several times; I put pressure on the woman who was angry with her husband, and I advised my family to leave her hungry, so that she would go back and would appreciate how blessed she was with her husband.\nEnd quote from Fayd al-Qadeer Sharh al-Jaami‘ al-Kabeer, 6/159 \nFourthly: \nIf a person turns a woman against her husband and spoils her for him so that she leaves him, then he marries her, his marriage is not valid and they must be separated, according to the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him). This is also the view of the Maalikis. For more information on the ruling on this issue and what is meant by turning a woman against her husband, please see the answer to question no. 84849\nBased on the above, if this man is the one who turned the woman against her husband, so that she would get divorced for his sake, it is not permissible for him to marry her, especially when he has committed zina with her. There is a difference of opinion concerning marriage of the zaani to the woman with whom he committed zina. In this case he has combined two evils: turning a woman against her husband and zina. \nBut if he is not the one who turned her against her husband, as appears to be the case from the question, and he only got to know her and meet her after she had left her husband and she had left his house, then his marriage to her is valid, if she has got divorced from her first husband, on condition that they both repent to Allah, may He be exalted, from what occurred between them. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the issue of whether a man who has committed zina (adultery) with a married woman can marry her after her divorce from her husband is a nuanced topic. Based on Quranic injunctions, there are a few key considerations to take into account:\n\n1. **The Status of Married Women**: The Quran explicitly prohibits the marriage of married women unless they are captives (of war) or have been separated from their husbands through divorce or death. This is clearly stated in Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 24:\n\n   > \"Also forbidden are married women unless they are captives (of war). Such is the decree of God.\"  \n   *(Surah An-Nisa, 4:24)*\n\n2. **Divorce and Waiting Period**: In Islamic law, once a woman is divorced, she has a waiting period (iddah) during which she cannot remarry. This waiting period is generally three menstrual cycles or three months, depending on the circumstances surrounding the divorce. This is emphasized in:\n\n   > \"Women who are divorced have to wait for three monthly periods.\"  \n   *(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:228)*\n\n   During this time, she should not enter into any new marriage contract. Therefore, the man who committed zina with her must wait until she completes her waiting period.\n\n3. **Repentance and Forgiveness**: Both the man and the woman, upon committing zina, should seek forgiveness from Allah. The Quran acknowledges the possibility of repentance and a new beginning:\n\n   > \"And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.\"  \n   *(Surah Al-Furqan, 25:68)*\n\n4. **Marrying After Divorce**: If the woman is indeed divorced and has completed her iddah, the man is allowed to marry her. The main condition is that both parties must have repented sincerely for their past actions. However, the prohibition regarding marrying married women should be Heeded.\n\n5. **Legal and Social Considerations**: Generally, there are additional social norms and legal systems influencing marital relationships in various cultures. Not only does Islamic law play a role, but cultural practices and community acceptance are also considerations.\n\nIn summary, if the man who committed zina with a married woman is desirous of marrying her, he may do so after she has divorced her husband and completed her iddah. Both parties should seek repentance and guidance from Allah in their future relationship. \n\n### References:\n- Surah An-Nisa (4:24): Discusses the prohibition of marrying married women except under specific circumstances.\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:228): Highlights the waiting period for divorced women before they can remarry.\n- Surah Al-Furqan (25:68): Emphasizes the importance of repentance for sinful acts such as zina."

        "question": "Is Divorce in Anger Valid?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is divorce in anger valid?\nIf the anger reached a level where the individual did not know what he was saying, or it was extreme anger that made him issue the divorce , and were it not for the anger he would not have issued the divorce, then it does not count as a divorce . \nDoes triple divorce count as one divorce?\nThe jurists differed concerning the threefold divorce , and the most correct opinion is that it counts as one divorce , whether it was uttered in a single phrase, such as saying “you are thrice divorced”, or it was uttered in separate phrases such as saying, “you are divorced, you are divorced, you are divorced.” \nBy the same token, if he issued a divorce then he repeated it during the `Iddah, the divorce before taking her back is part of the first divorce, because it only happens once, and divorce can only happen again after a marriage contract or after taking the wife back. \nDo you need witnesses for divorce?\nIt is not essential or obligatory to have witnesses to the divorce. If a man utters the word of divorce, then divorce has taken place, even if it is in the absence of the wife or no one else was present. The same applies if he writes the word of divorce in a message or on a piece of paper with the intention of divorce; divorce has taken place in this case. \nIt was narrated that there was scholarly consensus that it is not essential to have witnesses to divorce. \nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the issue of having witnesses to taking the wife back: \n“Among the evidence that it is not essential is the fact that there was scholarly consensus that it is not essential to have witnesses to divorce, as was narrated by Al-Muwazi‘i in Taysir Al-Bayan. And taking back the wife is of a similar nature, so it (having witnesses) is not essential in that case as it is not essential in the case of divorce.” (Nayl Al-Awtar, 6/300) \nAllah has enjoined having witnesses to divorce and taking back the wife in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Then when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims),” [At-Talaq 65:2]\nThis command is by way of recommendation and preference according to the majority of jurists. \nAbu Dawud (2188) narrated that `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about a man who divorced his wife, then had intercourse with her but he had not called witnesses to the divorce or to his taking her back, and he said: Your divorce was not in accordance with the Sunnah and your taking her back was not in accordance with the Sunnah; bring witnesses to the divorce and to taking her back, and do not do (this mistake) again. It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud. \nIt may also be understood as meaning that it is recommended to have witnesses. \nThe words “bring witnesses to the divorce and to taking her back, and do not do (this mistake) again” indicate that witnessing divorce or taking back the wife may come after the fact, hence he told him to bring witnesses to both even though they had happened previously. \nShaykh `Abd Al-Muhsin Al-`Abbad (may Allah preserve him) said: \n“This indicates that witnessing may come later and that it does not have to be at the time of the divorce or at the time of taking the wife back; rather a man may issue a divorce and then have it witnessed or he may take back his wife and then have it witnessed. And the taking back may be in the form of intercourse, because if a man has intercourse with his divorced wife during her ‘Iddah, that constitutes taking her back. Or it may be done verbally, but having it witnessed is required so that it will be known that the divorce has ended with the taking back. And the same applies to divorce.” (Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud) \nTo sum up, your divorce issued in the state of extreme anger does not count as such, and the threefold divorce counts as one divorce; it is not essential to have divorce witnessed and the same applies to taking the wife back. \nWe advise you to be careful and avoid using the word divorce (Talaq) altogether. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Is Divorce in Anger Valid?\n\nIn Islam, divorce is a serious matter and is guided by specific rules and principles laid out in the Qur'an. While emotions such as anger are natural, the validity of a divorce pronounced in such a state can raise questions.\n\n#### Overview of Divorce in Islam\n\n1. **Divorce should be a considered decision**: The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of proceeding with divorce thoughtfully. Surah Al-Talaq (Chapter 65) states:\n\n   - **\"O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their appointed period, and calculate that period, and fear God, your Lord. Do not expel them from their houses, nor should they go away themselves, unless they are openly guilty of adultery...\"**\n     (Qur'an 65:1)\n\n   This verse emphasizes that the divorce should be conducted with a clear mind and at a designated time, reflecting on one's actions rather than acting impulsively in anger.\n\n2. **A call for fairness**: Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2) further solidifies this principle by highlighting the need to maintain dignity in divorce proceedings:\n\n   - **\"...When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honourably (by revoking the divorce), or let them go with honour...\"**\n     (Qur'an 2:231)\n\n   This indicates that the process of divorce should be approached with honor and respect for the other party, even amidst personal feelings of anger or frustration.\n\n#### Conditions Affecting the Validity of Divorce\n\n1. **Intention Matters**: A divorce pronounced angrily may still be valid, but it must be critically examined whether it was done with proper intention (niyyah). If the utterance was made in a fit of rage without genuine desire for separation, scholars may argue that such divorce lacks sincerity.\n\n2. **Avoiding haste**: The emphasis in the Qur'an on reflection and patience indicates that divorcing in anger is not ideal. The period of waiting (iddah) cited in the Qur'an serves as time for contemplation to allow either party to reconsider their decision:\n\n   - **\"Those who swear to keep away from their wives (with intent of divorcing them) have four months of grace; then if they reconcile (during this period), surely God is forgiving and kind...\"**\n     (Qur'an 2:226)\n\n   This grace period highlights the importance of cooling down emotions and reconsidering the decision made in anger.\n\n3. **Revocation and reconciliation**: The Qur'an permits revocation of a divorce during the waiting period, encouraging reconciliation. This underlines the idea that anger should not dictate final decisions:\n\n   - **\"Divorce is (revocable) two times (after pronouncement), after which either keep (the wives) honorably, or part with them in a decent way...\"**\n     (Qur'an 2:229)\n\n#### Summary\n\nIn conclusion, while divorce pronounced in anger is technically valid, Islamic teachings encourage a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to it. The Qur'an provides clear guidelines aimed at promoting fairness, respect, and reconciliation in marital matters. Therefore, it is preferable to wait and reflect on one's feelings before finalizing such a significant decision. The prescribed waiting period (iddah) allows time for such reflection, enhancing the possibility of reconciliation and ensuring that actions taken are genuinely in line with one’s intentions."

        "question": "Ruling on a man kissing his adult daughter and hugging her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    For a man to embrace and hug his daughter, or kiss her on the \n    head or cheek or between the eyes by way of showing compassion, kindness and \n    love is permissible, even if she is an adult, on condition that there be no \n    fear of fitnah or provocation of desire. Excluded from that is kissing on \n    the mouth, which is only for spouses, and which usually provokes desire. \n\n    Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Can a man \n    kiss a woman who is his mahram? He said: If he has come home from a journey \n    and does not fear (temptation) for himself. \n\n    Ibn Muflih said: But he should never do that on the mouth, \n    only on the forehead or head. \n\n    End quote from al-Adaab al-Shar‘iyyah, 2/256. See also\n    al-Iqnaa‘, 3/156; al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 13/130 \n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \n\n    Is it permissible for a man to kiss his daughter when she has \n    grown up and passed the age of puberty, whether she is married or not, and \n    whether the kissing is on her hand or mouth or so on? If she kisses him in \n    those places, what is the ruling? \n\n    He replied (may Allah have mercy on him): \n\n    There is nothing wrong with a man kissing his daughter, \n    whether she is older or younger, without desire so long as that is on her \n    cheek once she has grown up, because it is proven from Abu Bakr (may Allah \n    be pleased with him) that he kissed his daughter ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be \n    pleased with her) on her cheek. And because kissing on the mouth may lead to \n    provocation of sexual desire, so it is better and safer not to do that. \n    Similarly, a daughter may kiss her father on his nose or head, without \n    desire. But if there is desire then that is haraam for all concerned, so as \n    to avoid temptation and so as to block means that may lead to immorality. \n    And Allah is the source of strength.\n\n    End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/78, 79. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    Embracing sons and daughters when they are small, hugging \n    them, smelling them and kissing them are all part of the compassions and \n    warmth that people should give in abundance to their children and not \n    deprive them of it, because it is compassion that Allah has created in the \n    hearts of His slaves, and Allah only shows mercy to those of His slaves who \n    are merciful. \n\n    We advise fathers and mothers not to deprive them of this \n    parental gesture, because it is a basic psychological need, especially in \n    small children, as is proven in all psychological and educational studies, \n    both contemporary and classical. \n\n    It is proven in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (5997) that Abu \n    Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) kissed al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali, when \n    al-Aqra‘ ibn Haabis al-Tameemi was sitting with him. al-Aqra‘ said: I have \n    ten children and I have never kissed one of them. The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) looked at him, then he said: “The \n    one who does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.” \n\n    In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (3704) it also says: al-Bara’ \n    entered with Abu Bakr upon his family -- after he reached Madinah as a \n    migrant. ‘Aa’ishah was lying down as she was suffering a fever. I [al-Bara’] \n    saw her father kiss her cheek and say: How are you, O my daughter? \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the relationship between a father and his daughter, even when she has reached adulthood, is one marked by respect, love, and appropriate physical displays of affection. Kissing and hugging an adult daughter is not prohibited in Islam, as it is considered an expression of love and care within the bounds of the relationship defined by the faith.\n\nThe relevant verses that indicate the nature of family relationships are found in Surah An-Nisa (The Women). Specifically, Surah 4:23 emphasizes the importance of the bonds between family members without explicitly prohibiting expressions of affection such as hugging or kissing:\n\n> **\"Unlawful are your mothers and daughters and your sisters to you...\"** (Quran 4:23)\n\nThis verse outlines who is unlawful to marry within one’s family, thus delineating the family bond and the sanctity of those relationships.\n\nAdditionally, the Quran encourages mutual love and kindness among family members. The concept of maintaining compassionate relationships is further emphasized throughout the Quran, including in the following verse:\n\n> **\"...live with them with tolerance and justice...\"** (Quran 4:19)\n\nThis illustrates the importance of treating family members with care, which can extend to physical affection, such as hugging and kissing, as long as it is done respectfully and appropriately.\n\nIn Islamic teachings, such physical expressions of love towards one’s daughter are not only permissible but can also be seen as a means of reinforcing familial ties and emotional support. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was known for his affection towards his family, often embracing and showing love to his daughters, which serves as an example for Muslims to follow.\n\nUltimately, while there are boundaries within family relationships as laid out in Islamic teachings, expressions of love such as kissing and hugging an adult daughter are not against Islamic principles. Respecting these boundaries while fostering a loving relationship is vital to the family structure in Islam."

        "question": "He divorced her three times and she wants to marry a man who is on his deathbed so that she can go back to the first husband",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a man divorces his wife three times, she is not permissible for him until she has been married to another husband, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband. Then, if the other husband divorces her, it is no sin on both of them that they reunite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allâh. These are the limits of Allâh, which He makes plain for the people who have knowledge”\n[al-Baqarah 2:230]. \nAnd it is essential that the second husband have intercourse with her; if no intercourse takes place between them, she does not become permissible for the first husband. \nThe scholars are unanimously agreed on that, and the evidence for that from the Sunnah is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (2639) and Muslim (1433) from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that Rifaa‘ah divorced his wife for the third time, and after that she married ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn al-Zubayr, and claimed that he had not consummated the marriage with her and she wanted to get divorced from him and go back to her first husband. The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you want to go back to Rifaa‘ah? No, not until you taste his (‘Abd al-Rahmaan’s) sweetness and he tastes your sweetness.” \nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “not until you taste his sweetness and he tastes your sweetness” are a metaphor for intercourse, likening its pleasure to the sweetness of honey. \nIn this hadeeth we see that the woman who has been divorced three times is not permissible for the one who divorced her until she has been married to another husband, and he has intercourse with her, then he divorces her and her ‘iddah comes to an end. As for merely doing the marriage contract with her, that does not make her permissible for the first husband. This is the view of all the scholars among the Sahaabah and Taabi‘een and those who came after them, except Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyib; perhaps this hadeeth did not reach him. End quote. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nAfter the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) clearly explained what was meant in the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and that she is not permissible for the first husband until the second husband tastes her sweetness and she tastes his sweetness, no differing view should be given any consideration and it is not permissible for anyone to follow a different view.\nEnd quote from al-Mughni, 10/549 \nIf there is an agreement with the second husband that he will marry her in order to make her permissible for her first husband, or if the second husband intends that without any prior agreement with anyone, and he does not want to marry her (except for this purpose) or stay with her, then this is a tahleel marriage, and the Messenger of Allah (sa) cursed the one who does that. The woman does not become permissible to her first husband by means of this haraam marriage, even if the second husband has intercourse with her. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nTahleel marriage is haraam and is invalid according to most scholars. … If it is stipulated that it is tahleel before the marriage contract is done, but it is not mentioned in the marriage contract, or he intended it as a tahleel marriage without that being stipulated, then the marriage is also invalid.\nEnd quote from al-Mughni, 10/49-51 \nIf the intention is on the part of the woman only, and no agreement to that effect was made with the second husband and he did not intend it to be a tahleel marriage, then the marriage is valid and she becomes permissible thereby for the first husband, if the second husband consummates the marriage with her then divorces her or dies, and the woman’s intention does not have any effect on that. \nThis has been explained in the answer to question no. 159041. \nBut the fact that she is giving money to this man so that he will agree to this marriage contract indicates that he is aware of the intention of tahleel and that he does not want to marry her at all, so by accepting that he is like a borrowed billy-goat, who comes between the divorced spouses to make her permissible for her first husband. \nSee also the answer to question no. 76324. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic law regarding divorce, particularly in the context of a woman whose husband has pronounced divorce three times, there are specific guidelines outlined in the Quran that determine her ability to remarry, including the possibility of marrying another man with the intent to return to her first husband. \n\n### Key Verses and Their Implications:\n\n1. **Divorce and Remarriage**: \n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:230) clearly states: \n     > \"If a man divorces her again (a third time), she becomes unlawful for him (and he cannot remarry her) until she has married another man. Then if he divorces her, there is no harm if the two unite again if they think they will keep within the bounds set by God and made clear for those who understand.\"\n     \n   Here, we see that after a third divorce, a woman cannot return to her first husband unless she marries another man first and that man subsequently divorces her. This scenario establishes a requirement for a waiting period and a new marriage before reconciliation is permissible. \n\n2. **Provisions on Waiting Period and Rights**:\n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:228) stipulates:\n     > \"Women who are divorced have to wait for three monthly periods, and if they believe in God and the Last Day they must not hide unlawfully what God has formed within their wombs. Their husbands would do well to take them back in that case, if they wish to be reconciled.\"\n     \n   This verse highlights the waiting period (iddah) that a divorced woman must observe, which is three menstrual cycles in cases of a regular divorce (not applicable if the divorce is final, as with the third).\n\n3. **Honorable Conduct in Marital Affairs**:\n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:231-232) emphasizes:\n     > \"When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honourably (by revoking the divorce), or let them go with honour.\"\n     \n   This verse underscores the importance of respectful treatment during the divorce process and after, urging the divorced woman not to be hindered in her future marital decisions.\n\n4. **Marriage After Divorce**:\n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:234) states:\n     > \"There is no harm if they do what they like with themselves honourably once the waiting period is over.\"\n     \n   This supports a woman's right to remarry after her waiting period ends, thereby affirming her autonomy in choosing her future.\n\n5. **Consequences of Exceeding Limits**:\n   - Surah At-Talaq (65:1-2) reflects:\n     > \"O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them at their appointed periods, and calculate that period. [...] When they have reached their appointed time, then either keep them lawfully or let them go honourably.\"\n     \n   This passage adds a layer of caution regarding the actions related to divorce, dictating that they must be done within specified parameters and with justice.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn the case presented, if a woman has been divorced three times, she cannot return to her first husband unless she married another man and that marriage ends in divorce. The intention of marrying a man on his deathbed solely for the purpose of returning to the first husband may not align with the spirit of the law, which emphasizes genuine marital unions and honorable treatment of individuals in marital relations. The guidelines provided by the Quran are clear and indicate that such actions should be approached with sincerity and respect for all parties involved, including the new husband. \n\n### References:\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:230)\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:228)\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:231-232)\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:234)\n- Surah At-Talaq (65:1-2)"

        "question": "He did the marriage contract with her but she does not have any accommodation and he wants to be intimate with her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIf the \n    marriage contract has been done, then you have become his wife and it is \n    permissible for a husband to be intimate with his wife however he wants. But \n    she can refuse to let him have his way with her until he gives her the mahr \n    and prepares a suitable marital home for her. \nIbn \n    al-Mundhir (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated that the scholars were \n    unanimously agreed that a woman has the right to refuse to let her husband \n    consummate the marriage with her until he gives her the mahr. \nAl-Mughni \n    (7/200). \nAl-Kasaani \n    said in Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’ (4/19) that a woman has the right to \n    refuse to let her husband have his way with her until he provides her with a \n    home. \nThis is the \n    shar’i ruling on this matter. \nWhat we are \n    afraid of is that this man is not serious about providing a home and \n    striving to settle in it and build a family, and that he is content to get \n    his pleasure from meeting you. Hence we advise you not to answer his demand \n    and not to let him be intimate with you, until he provides you with a home. \n    This will encourage him to pay attention and hasten to consummate the \n    marriage, and protect you. For intercourse may take place as the result of \n    pressure on his part and weakness on yours, then pregnancy may occur, and \n    that may lead to bad consequences in the event of divorce or delay of \n    consummation of the marriage and announcement thereof to the people. \nSecondly: \nIf your work \n    is permissible and free of any haraam things, then we do not advise you to \n    give it up, and the husband has no right to prevent you from working so long \n    as he did the marriage contract with you at the time when you were doing \n    this job and he did not stipulate that you should leave it. At the very \n    least you should keep your job even if you take a temporary leave of absence \n    until you find out what your husband is really like. \nThirdly: \nAttention \n    must be paid to the religious commitment and character of a husband, and one \n    should find out whether he prays regularly and keeps away from haraam \n    things. From your question it seems to us that this is not a man who is good \n    in these ways, hence it is easy for him to insult your parents and to \n    threaten to cheat on you. We do not know how such things could be said by a \n    wise man who understands how things are. Is this a proper way of putting \n    pressure on his wife – threatening to commit zina as a punishment to her? \n    This is indicative of a severe lack of religious commitment and \n    intelligence. If we had been consulted about the matter before the marriage \n    contract was done, we would have advised you not to marry him. But as the \n    contract has been done, we say: If he is careless about prayer, then you \n    should advise him time after time. If he does not improve, then separate \n    from him, for there is nothing good for you in marriage to a man who is \n    careless about prayer. \nFourthly: \nIf it \n    becomes clear to you that he is messing about and is not serious about \n    preparing a home etc, and that he may mistreat you and your family – even if \n    he does pray regularly – then we advise you to leave him, even if you free \n    yourself from the marriage by giving up some of your rights (i.e., khula’). \nYou say that \n    your family and everyone around you thinks that he is not suitable for you. \n    The family’s opinion in such matters is usually closest to the truth, \n    because they look at the matter with a measure of wisdom, far removed from \n    emotion which may sometimes blind one to the truth. They also have knowledge \n    and experience of such matters. Hence we think that you should discuss the \n    matter with your family, and do what they advise you, as well as praying to \n    Allaah for guidance (istikhaarah), for He does not betray the one who seeks \n    guidance and the one who asks for advice will not regret it. \nWe ask Allaah to make things easy for you and to take away your distress and to guide you to good things. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the institution of marriage is grounded in both moral and legal principles. The situation you're describing involves a man who has completed the marriage contract but does not have appropriate accommodation for his wife and wishes to be intimate with her. Here is a comprehensive response based on Quranic guidance and teachings.\n\n### 1. **Understanding the Marriage Contract**:\nThe marriage contract, known as \"nikah,\" is a sacred agreement in Islam. It grants both parties rights and sets forth responsibilities. It is essential that both the husband and wife understand the significance of this contract. In Surah An-Nisa (4:21), it is emphasized that the commitment of marriage is serious:  \n**“How could you do that having slept with one another, and when they had taken a solemn pledge from you?”** (Quran 4:21).\n\n### 2. **The Importance of Accommodation**:\nIslam encourages providing a proper living situation ( accommodation) for the wife. This is not just a matter of convenience; it is a fundamental aspect of fulfilling the rights of a spouse. Surah At-Talaq (65:6) mentions,  \n**“House the (divorced) women where you live, according to your means…”** (Quran 65:6). While this verse specifically addresses divorced women, it reflects the broader Islamic principle that anyone being cared for in marriage should be provided a suitable home.\n\n### 3. **Intimacy without Accommodation**:\nSeeking intimacy without providing for accommodation can be viewed as neglectful and contrary to the spirit of nurturing and respectful relations in marriage. It is prudent for the husband to ensure that he has the means to fulfill the basic needs of his wife before engaging in intimate relations. This includes a safe and comfortable place for them to reside, reflecting the responsibilities highlighted in the Quran.\n\n### 4. **Consultation and Mutual Agreement**:\nIf the husband finds himself in a situation where he has married but lacks accommodation, it is essential to have open and respectful communication with his wife. Both partners should consult each other about their circumstances and find ways to fulfill their obligations towards one another. This can be guided by the principles found in Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49), which emphasizes providing properly for wives:  \n**\"But provide suitably for them, and let them go with honour...\"** (Quran 33:49).\n\n### 5. **Possible Solutions**:\n- **Seek Temporary Accommodation**: If a permanent solution is not presently possible, the couple may consider temporary living situations that ensure comfort and privacy.\n- **Financial Planning**: The husband should evaluate his financial situation and possibly look for ways to improve it to provide a stable and suitable living environment.\n  \n### 6. **Emphasis on Patience and Kindness**:\nIn cases of difficulty, it is recommended to exercise patience and kindness. Surah An-Nisa (4:28) states,  \n**“God wishes to make it clear to you… and to lighten your burden, for man was created weak.”** (Quran 4:28). This reinforces that difficulties in life should be approached with patience and understanding.\n\n### 7. **Significance of Mutual Respect**:\nUltimately, the marriage relationship is built on mutual respect, compassion, and shared responsibility. It is the responsibility of both parties to ensure that their marriage is fulfilling and conducive to a loving home environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is permissible for a husband to be intimate with his wife following a valid marriage contract, doing so without ensuring the proper living arrangements is not ideal. The emphasis in Islam is on providing and caring for one's spouse, highlighting the need for a supportive environment in which intimacy can naturally flourish."

        "question": "Ruling on the bride sitting on a dais",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The dais on which the bride sits is something that has been well known from ancient times and is mentioned in several classical texts. \nThere is nothing wrong with the bride sitting on a dais, subject to the condition that it be screened from the gaze of non-mahram men. This is not regarded as a kind of arrogance, rather the aim, as you stated, is for everyone to be able to see her. \nHere we should point out the evils that happen in some societies on such occasions, where the husband sits with his wife on this dais when she is wearing all her finery, in front of both men and women, or the husband comes in and sits with his wife on the dais when there are women present who are not his mahrams, wearing all their adornments. \nThe scholars of the Standing Committee said:  \nFor the husband to appear on the dais in front of women who are not his mahrams and who are present at the wedding party, where he can see them and they can see him, and they are wearing all their adornments and he is wearing all his finery, is not permissible, rather it is an evil action which must be denounced. \nFataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 19/120. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether the bride sitting on a dais is permissible in Islam is not explicitly addressed in the Qur'an. However, we can draw on related principles from Islamic teachings and the examples presented in the Qur’an to provide guidance.\n\n### 1. **Cultural Context and Customs:**\nIslamic teaching stresses that practices related to marriage can often be influenced by cultural customs, as long as they do not contradict fundamental Islamic principles. The joyous occasion of a wedding is an opportunity for celebration, and many cultures have their own traditions regarding weddings, including the use of dais for the bride.\n\n### 2. **Modesty and Decorum:**\nThe Qur'an emphasizes the importance of modesty and respect in all aspects of interaction between genders. For example, in Surah Al-Ahzab (33:53), it is instructed that when asking for something from the wives of the Prophet, one should do so from behind a screen to maintain modesty:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:53):** “O you who believe! Do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless you are permitted for a meal without waiting for the meal's preparation. But when you are invited, enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to discuss matters. Indeed, that was disturbing the Prophet, and he is shy of (saying) no to you. But Allah is not shy of the truth…” \n\nThis kind of guidance underlines the significance of maintaining decorum and respect, which can be seen as relevant when considering the setting of a wedding ceremony.\n\n### 3. **Celebrating the Marriage:**\nIslam encourages the celebration of marriage. Surah An-Nisa (4:24) addresses the importance of fulfilling the dower and acknowledges the joy of forming marital ties:\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:24):** \"And (forbidden to you are) married women except those your right hands possess. This is the decree of Allah upon you. And lawful to you are (all others) beyond these, so long as you seek them with your wealth, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\"\n\n### 4. **Khadijah's Marriage as an Example:**\nThe marriage of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) can serve as an illustrative example of honoring the bride and celebrating the union in a respectful and dignified manner. While specific details of their wedding ceremony are not outlined in the Qur'an, the context indicates a celebration of their commitment.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion:**\nWhile there are no explicit prohibitions against a bride sitting on a dais in the Qur'an, practices should reflect Islamic values of respect, dignity, and modesty. If a dais is used in a manner that honors the bride and the purpose of the marriage, it can be considered acceptable.\n\nIncorporating local customs and cultural expressions into the wedding ceremony, provided they adhere to the principles of Islam, is often celebrated in many Muslim societies. Therefore, a bride sitting on a dais can be permissible as long as the arrangement supports the values of modesty and respect inherent in Islam."

        "question": "The situation of one who is illegitimate and the ruling on marrying him",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    There are some ahaadeeth that condemn the illegitimate child, \n    but most of these ahaadeeth are da’eef (weak) and are not saheeh (sound). It \n    was narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (4/39) and by Ahmad in \n    al-Musnad (2/311) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) \n    that the Prophets  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    “The illegitimate child is the most evil of the three” meaning more evil \n    than his parents. Among the scholars who classed this as hasan were Ibn \n    al-Qayyim in al-Manaar al-Muneef (133) and al-Albaani in \n    al-Silsilat al-Saheehah (672). \n\n    The scholars interpreted this hadeeth in a number of ways, \n    the most famous of which was that suggested by Sufyaan al-Thawri, who said: \n    it means he is the most evil of the three if he does the same action as his \n    parents did (i.e., zina or adultery). \n\n    This was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah, who said that the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He is the most evil \n    of the threeif he does the same action as \n    his parents did – meaning the illegitimate child.” Although its isnaad is \n    da’eef, it was interpreted in this manner by the salaf, as stated above. \n\n    This interpretation is supported by the report narrated by \n    al-Haakim (4/100) – with an isnaad of which al-Albaani said, “It may be \n    regarded as hasan” – from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), that \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The \n    illegitimate child does not bear any part of his parents’ burden of sin.\n    ‘and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of \n    another’ [al-An’aam 6:164 – interpretation of the meaning].” \n    (al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 2186) \n\n    Some scholars said that this hadeeth is to be interpreted as \n    meaning that there is some evil in most illegitimate children because they \n    are created from an evil nutfah (sperm drop), and usually nothing good is \n    created from an evil nutfah. If a good soul comes out of this nutfah then it \n    will enter Paradise. This hadeeth is to be taken as a general rule to which \n    there may be exceptions. (See al-Manaar al-Muneef, 133). \n\n    Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on \n    him) said: “If an illegitimate child believes and does righteous deeds, he \n    will enter Paradise, otherwise he will be punished for his deeds just like \n    anyone else. The punishment is for the deeds, not for the lineage. Rather \n    the illegitimate child is condemned because he is expected to do evil deeds, \n    as often happens. By the same token, good lineages are regarded as \n    praiseworthy because such people are expected to do good deeds. But when a \n    person does a deed, then the reward or punishment is based on that, and the \n    most noble of people before Allaah are those who are most pious. (al-Fataawa \n    al-Kubra, 5/83). \n\n    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: “If an \n    illegitimate child dies in Islam (as a Muslim), he will enter Paradise, and \n    his being illegitimate does not have any effect on that, because that was \n    not due to his own actions, rather it was the action of someone else. Allaah \n    says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    ‘and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of \n    another’ \n\n    [al-An’aam 6:164]\n\n    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    ‘Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned’\n\n    [al-Toor 52:21]\n\n    And there are other similar verses. \n\n    With regard to the words narrated from the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), ‘No illegitimate child will \n    enter Paradise,’ this hadeeth is not saheeh. It was mentioned by al-Haafiz \n    Ibn Jawzi in al-Mawdoo’aat, but it is one of the ahaadeeth that were \n    fabricated against the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him). And Allaah is the Source of strength.” \n\n    With regard to the ruling on marrying one who is \n    illegitimate, none of the reputable fuqaha’ have stated that this is haraam. \n    However there was some difference of opinion among the Hanbalis as to \n    whether such a person is compatible with a woman of good lineage. Some of \n    them said that he is compatible with her, and othesr did not agree with that \n    because that will be a source of shame for the woman, because he will be her \n    guardian, and that would also affect her child. (See al-Mughni, \n    7/28).\n\n    (al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 34/282). \n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked \n    about a man who married his daughter to a person who was apparently \n    illegitimate – what was the ruling on that? He answered as follows: \n\n    “If he is Muslim, then the marriage is sound, because the sin \n    of his mother and the one who committed zina with her does not rest on him. \n    Allaah says ‘and no bearer of burdens shall bear \n    the burden of another’ [al-An’aam 6:164 – interpretation of the meaning].  \n    And there is no shame on him because of their action, if he adheres \n    steadfastly to the religion of Allaah and develops good characteristics, \n    because Allaah says\n\n    ‘O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, \n    and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, \n    the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa \n    [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]. Verily, Allaah is \n    All-Knowing, All-Aware’\n\n    [al-Hujuraat 49:13]\n\n    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said, when he was asked who is the most noble of people, ‘Those who are \n    most pious.’ And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    ‘If a person’s actions make him less worthy than others, his lineage will \n    not make him more worthy.’” \n\n    From Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/166.\n\n     And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Question: The situation of one who is illegitimate and the ruling on marrying him\n\nIn Islam, being born out of wedlock (illegitimate) does not inherently render a person unworthy or virtuous. Islam emphasizes the dignity of all individuals, regardless of their familial circumstances. Consequently, the Quran and Hadith provide guidelines regarding marriage in relation to an individual's background, yet, there is no specific prohibition against marrying someone who is illegitimate. The focus is, instead, on the character and faith of the individual.\n\n**1. Islamic perspective on individuals born out of wedlock:**\n\nIslam teaches that all human beings are equal in the sight of God. The Quran does not label people as inferior based on their birth circumstances. Instead, it emphasizes virtues such as faith, good behavior, and righteousness.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- Surah Al-Hujurat (49:13): \"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.\"  \n  (Quran 49:13)\n\nThis verse underscores that nobility in the sight of God is determined by piety and actions rather than lineage or circumstances of birth.\n\n**2. Rulings on marriage:**\n\nFrom a legal perspective, there is no restriction on marrying someone based on their status as illegitimate. The relevant criteria for marriage include the person's religious commitment, character, and mutual consent between parties. In Islam, the most significant aspect is the faith and morality of the prospective spouse.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- Surah Al-Nisa (4:32): \"And do not covet that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of His bounty. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things.\"  \n  (Quran 4:32)\n\nThe verse emphasizes individual merit and worth based on personal actions rather than family history.\n\n**3. Marrying believers:**\n\nIslam highly encourages the marriage of believing individuals, which denotes both moral and spiritual compatibility. A person who is illegitimate but is a believer has the same standing in terms of marriage as any other believer.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- Surah Al-Nisa (4:25): \"And whoever among you cannot [find the means to marry] free, believing women, then [he may marry] from those whom your right hands possess of believing slave women. And Allah is Knowing of your faith. You are of one another. So marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due compensation, according to what is acceptable—[this is] for those among you who fear falling into marital unchastity. And if you should be patient, it is best for you. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\"  \n  (Quran 4:25)\n\nThis verse offers guidance on marriage, underscoring the importance of faith and making allowances for those unable to marry free women.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn summary, individuals born out of wedlock are not seen as less than any others in Islam. The essential factors for marriage are faith, character, and mutual consent, rather than the circumstances of one's birth. This compassionate view aligns with the overarching Islamic teachings of equality, mercy, and dignity for all human beings."

        "question": "Talking to Fiancé before Marriage in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to talk to your fiancé except in a case where both parties trust one another and where the parents agree to the marriage and have no objections. In this case it is acceptable for them to speak to one another in a normal manner, discussing matters of life that concern them . But if they know that their parents do not agree to that, then it is not permissible for them to speak to one another in this case.\n Shaykh `Abullah ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The fiancée is still a non-Mahram woman and speaking to her is still speaking to a non-Mahram woman , so it must be done properly and only as much as is necessary, such as agreeing on specific matters to do with after they get married. Attention must also be paid to the following:\n\nIt must be done with the agreement of the woman’s guardian and with no objection on his part to the marriage.\nThe talk should not involve anything that may provoke desire or cause temptation.\nThere should be no other way of telling her what he wants to say, such as through his sister or her brother, or by letter.\nIt should not go beyond what is essential.”\n\n And Allah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, communication and engagement before marriage, often with a fiancé, are generally permitted but must be approached with caution and in accordance with Islamic principles. The key verses from the Quran address the manner in which men and women should interact in the context of engagement and marriage.\n\n### Talking to Your Fiancé Before Marriage\n\n1. **Permissibility of Proposing in Secret**:\n   Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that it is permissible to propose marriage in secret or keep intentions in one’s heart. However, it advises against making promises in secret without a proper manner of speaking:\n   \n   > “There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself: God is aware that you will keep them in mind. Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper...”  \n   **(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:235)**\n\n2. **Limits to Interaction**:\n   Communication should always be respectful and mindful of boundaries. The Quran instructs believers to remain pious and consider God’s knowledge of what is in their hearts:\n   \n   > “Remember that God knows what is in your hearts; so be fearful of Him…”  \n   **(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:235)**\n\n3. **Conduct During Engagement**:\n   Engagement conversations should observe Islamic etiquette. This means that while one may talk to their fiancé, it should be in a context that honors the sanctity of the relationship. The teaching underscores that opinions should be respectful and maintain the dignity of both parties.\n\n4. **Importance of Intentions**:\n   Another aspect addressed is the need for good intentions and behavior. The Quran stresses being good to one another, regardless of the status of the marriage, whether before or after consummation:\n   \n   > “But do not forget to be good to each other, and remember that God sees all that you do.”  \n   **(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:237)**\n\n### Engaging with Respect\n\n1. **No Right to Demand Waiting Period**:\n   If a marriage contract has not yet been consummated, the husband has no right over the wife until the marriage is consummated. This is an important aspect, emphasizing the need for respect and consent at all stages:\n   \n   > “O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' of them.”  \n   **(Surah Al-Ahzab 33:49)**\n\n2. **Kindness in Marriage**:\n   Continued this theme of kindness and respect in interpersonal relationships, whether in engagement or marriage:\n   > “...let them go with honour. We have made lawful for you, O Prophet, wives to whom you have given their dower…”  \n   **(Surah Al-Ahzab 33:49)**\n\n3. **No Interference in Private Matters**:\n   When it comes to the Prophet Muhammad's household, it is instructed that believers honor private boundaries. This serves as a broader lesson about respecting privacy within the context of relationships:\n   \n   > “Do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without awaiting the proper time, unless asked, and enter when you are invited, and depart when you have eaten…”  \n   **(Surah Al-Ahzab 33:53)**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, talking to your fiancé before marriage in Islam is permitted and can be beneficial for understanding one another. However, such communication must be guided by respect, good intentions, and adherence to Islamic principles. Moreover, both parties are advised to maintain ethical standards and avoid any form of unseemly behavior. Communication should remain honorable, reflecting the Islamic values of respect, integrity, and piety. \n\nReferences:\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:235)\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:237)\n- Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49)\n- Surah Al-Ahzab (33:53)"

        "question": "Is it permissible for a Muslim woman to appear in front of a kaafir woman without hijab?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with a woman looking at a man; hence men, whether they are Muslim or kaafirs, are not enjoined to cover their faces. Women are enjoined to cover themselves but men are not. Similarly, there is nothing wrong with a woman looking at another woman if one of them is not Muslim. That is because the prohibition on looking is due to the fear of desire being provoked, and it is well known that a woman will not be stirred by desire if she looks at another woman. \nAs for the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “It is no sin on them (the Prophet’s wives, if they appear unveiled) before their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brother’s sons, or the sons of their sisters, or their own women” [al-Ahzaab 33:55], the word nisa’ihinna (their own women) does not apply exclusively to believing women; rather it also includes disbelieving women. If a woman looks at a non-Muslim woman that will not result in evil, so there is nothing wrong with her looking at a non-Muslim woman, especially if she needs to meet with her, such as if she is a teacher or a doctor and so on. It would be too difficult for her to observe hijab before her or to look away from her.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Question: Is it permissible for a Muslim woman to appear in front of a kaafir woman without hijab?\n\nIn Islam, the guidelines regarding modesty and the hijab are derived primarily from the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Generally, Muslim women are advised to wear the hijab (a headscarf) and dress modestly in public and in the presence of non-mahram (those who are not closely related) men. However, the case of appearing in front of a non-believing (kaafir) woman opens up different perspectives.\n\n1. **Non-Mahram Guidelines**: The Quran advises believing women to guard their modesty. In Surah An-Nur (24:31), Allah instructs believing women to lower their gaze and guard their modesty, including covering their bosoms with their veils. This verse implies that women should cover themselves in front of non-mahram individuals, which can include men and women from different faith backgrounds:\n\n   - **Quran 24:31:** \"And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [ordinarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their outer garments over themselves...\" (Surah An-Nur, Ayah 31)\n\n2. **Presence of Kaafir Women**: The question of whether a Muslim woman can forgo hijab in front of a kaafir woman is less explicitly addressed in the Quran. However, the general rulings about modesty apply universally, regardless of the faith of the other woman. The hijab serves not only as a means of modesty but also as an expression of faith and identity.\n\n3. **Friendship and Interaction**: Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:8-10) speaks about being just and kind to those who do not fight Muslims over their faith. While the context of these verses pertains to relations with non-believers, they underline the importance of maintaining dignity and righteousness in interactions. They do not explicitly relieve a believing woman from the obligation of hijab when meeting non-believing women, as the principles of modest behavior remain overarching.\n\n   - **Quran 60:8-10:** \"Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.\" (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, Ayah 8)\n\n4. **Cultural Context**: In some cultural contexts, interactions between women of different faiths may allow for less strict interpretations of hijab. If there is a significant cultural precedent that accepts a non-hijab appearance among women, this may be considered contextually acceptable. However, the primary consideration should always be the principles of modesty stipulated in the Quran.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the interpretations of Quranic verses, it is generally recommended for Muslim women to maintain their hijab in the presence of non-mahram individuals, regardless of their faith, including kaafir women. This is in line with the broader Islamic principles of modesty and self-respect. While kindness and good behavior are encouraged towards all, the obligation of wearing hijab remains for Muslim women when interacting with individuals outside of close family. \n\nFor further clarification or questions, consulting knowledgeable scholars or sources related to Islamic jurisprudence can provide more personalized guidance."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    You do not have to execute the will mentioned, because the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “A virgin should \n    not be married until her permission is sought.” According to another \n    version: “The virgin should be asked for permission by her father, and her \n    permission is her silence.” We advise you to ask Allaah for guidance and \n    pray istikhaarah, and consult those whom you trust among your relatives and \n    others who know both people. May Allaah make all good easy for you. End quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is a personal choice, and while parents may express their wishes or preferences regarding a suitable spouse for their children, their wishes cannot override the individual's right to choose. The Quran emphasizes mutual consent in marriage and acknowledges that individuals have agency in these decisions.\n\nThe specific scenario in question involves a father's will for his daughter to marry her cousin (the son of her paternal aunt). Here’s an analysis based on Islamic principles and relevant Quranic verses.\n\n### Consent in Marriage\n1. **Mutual Consent**: Islam places great importance on the consent of both parties in the marriage. Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 232 states: \n   > \"When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:232)\n   \n   This verse underscores that both parties should agree to the marriage freely and honorably without coercion.\n\n2. **Father's Will**: While a father can suggest or express a desire for his daughter to marry a particular individual, Islamic teachings do not allow him to impose this choice on her. The daughter has the autonomy to accept or reject the proposed marriage. The marriage should be built on mutual agreement, as emphasized in Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 19:\n   > \"O believers, you are not allowed to take by force the women (of dead relatives) into your heritage, or tyrannise over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them...\" (Surah An-Nisa 4:19)\n\nThis verse illustrates that no one should be coerced into a marital arrangement.\n\n### Legitimacy of Marrying a Cousin\n3. **Prohibition of Cousin Marriage**: According to the Quran, marrying a cousin is permissible, as long as both parties consent. In Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 23 provides insight into permissible and forbidden relationships and does not list cousins as prohibited:\n   > \"Unlawful are your mothers and daughters and your sisters to you, and the sisters of your fathers and your mothers, and the daughters of your brothers and sisters...\" (Surah An-Nisa 4:23)\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, while the father may wish for his daughter to marry her cousin, Islam prioritizes the consent of the individual. If the daughter does not wish to marry her cousin, she is not obliged to fulfill her father's will. She has the right to seek a partner of her choosing, ensuring that the marriage is based on mutual agreement and understanding.\n\nThus, she does **not** have to execute her father's will if it is in opposition to her wishes."

        "question": "Her father will not let her get married on the grounds that she should complete her education",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Undoubtedly your father’s preventing you from getting married \n    to someone compatible is haraam. Marriage is more important than study, and \n    it does not rule out study because it is possible to do both. \n\n    In your situation it is permissible for you to contact the \n    sharee’ah court and tell them what has happened, then after that the final \n    decision is up to the court. End quote. \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on \n    him).",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the question of marriage, especially in relation to education, involves understanding the importance of both individual choice and parental guidance. When addressing the concern that a father would prevent his daughter from marrying so she can focus on her education, there are several important principles and verses from the Qur'an that may be relevant in this context.\n\n1. **Consent and Choice in Marriage**: One fundamental principle in Islam regarding marriage is the requirement of consent from both parties. The prospective bride has the right to accept or reject a marriage proposal. This is supported by the following verse in the Qur'an:\n\n   - **Surah An-Nisa (4:21)**: \"How could you do that having slept with one another, and when they had taken a solemn pledge from you? And do not wed the women your fathers had wed. What happened in the past is now past: It was lewd and abhorrent, and only the way of evil.\" This verse underscores the importance of mutual agreement and consent in marriage, which extends to the rights of women to choose their partners.\n\n2. **Priorities and Responsibilities**: The focus on education and personal development, especially for women, is highly regarded in Islam. The Prophet Muhammad emphasized knowledge as a duty for every believer, male or female. \n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:282)** mentions the importance of knowledge in transactions, which can be interpreted to mean that education is essential. \"O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down…\"\n\n   The spirit of this guidance can be understood to support the pursuit of education and self-development, which ultimately enhances one's life and potential.\n\n3. **Parental Rights and Responsibilities**: The role of parents is significant, and they are to guide their children in a manner that benefits them. Parents should support their children’s choices, including decisions regarding education and marriage.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Isra (17:31)** states: \"And kill not your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely killing them is a great sin.\" This verse encourages protection and care for children, implying that their rights and well-being should be prioritized.\n\n4. **Timing of Marriage**: There is a notion within the Islamic texts that support a measured approach to marriage. While marriage is encouraged, it is also advised that people should not rush into it, especially if other personal goals, such as education, have not been met.\n\n   - **Surah An-Nisa (4:25)** says: \"If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman (let him marry) a maid who is a believer. God is aware of your faith...\"\n\n5. **Importance of Education**: Finally, Islam highly values education, and many scholars highlight that a woman pursuing her education is a noble endeavor that should not be hindered by familial pressures.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:11)**: \"God will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees.\" This suggests the elevation of those who seek knowledge and education. \n\nIn summary, while a father may wish for his daughter to prioritize her education before marriage, it is essential to balance this desire with respect for her autonomy and the importance of her consent. Ideally, discussions should take place that consider both educational pursuits and the possibility of marriage, allowing for informed and mutual decisions in this significant life choice. Each individual situation will require careful consideration of Islamic principles, family dynamics, and personal aspirations."

        "question": "A woman asking for a divorce from her husband who is addicted to drugs",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The basic principle is that it is not permissible for a woman \n    to ask for divorce unless there is a reason for that. The Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who \n    asks her husband for a divorce with no reason, the fragrance of Paradise \n    will be forbidden to her.” Narrated by Ahmad (21874), Abu Dawood (2226) and \n    al-Tirmidhi (1187); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel \n    (2035). \n\n    And the words “with no reason” mean without there being any \n    hardship that compels her to ask for a divorce. \n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in \n    Fath al-Baari: \n\n    The reports which warn women against asking for divorce from \n    their husbands are to be understood as applying to cases where there is no \n    reason for that, because of the hadeeth of Thawbaan… then he mentioned the \n    hadeeth quoted above. End quote. \n\n    Undoubtedly addiction to drugs is a serious shortcoming, \n    which harms a woman in both religious and worldly terms, because there is no \n    guarantee that her husband will not enter upon her when he is intoxicated \n    and beat her or revile her, or ask her to do something at that time which it \n    is not permissible for her to do. \n\n    Such a thing is regarded as an excuse which makes it \n    permissible for a woman to ask for divorce, but what the woman should do is \n    be patient with her husband, and try to set him straight as much as she can. \n    If she is not able to do that, and she finds that staying with him will \n    cause her harm, then there is nothing wrong with asking for divorce in that \n    case. \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was asked: \n\n    What is the ruling on a woman seeking divorce from her \n    husband who uses drugs? What is the ruling on her staying with him? Please \n    note that there is no one who will provide for her and her children except \n    him. \n\n    He replied: \n\n    It is permissible for a woman to ask for a divorce from her \n    husband who is addicted to drugs, because her husband’s condition is not \n    acceptable. In this case, if she asks for a divorce from him, then the \n    children should stay with her, if they are younger than seven years, and the \n    father must spend on them. If she can stay with him to set him straight by \n    advising him, then that is better. End quote. \n\n    Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah \n    (2/745, 746). \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, a woman has the right to seek a divorce (known as *talaq* or *khula*) if her marriage is harmful to her well-being or if her husband exhibits detrimental behavior, such as addiction to drugs. The issue of seeking a divorce in such circumstances can be guided by specific teachings in the Qur'an. Below is a thorough examination of the relevant verses and their implications.\n\n### Rights of Women in Divorce\n\n1. **Recognition of Women's Rights**: The Qur'an acknowledges the rights of women in divorce. Surah Al-Baqarah states:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:228**: \"Women also have recognized rights as men have, though men have an edge over them. But God is all-mighty and all-wise.\"\n   This verse emphasizes that women have rights in the context of marriage and divorce, affirming their entitlement to protection and respect.\n\n2. **Process of Divorce**: The process of divorce is elaborated upon, offering a structured approach. Surah Al-Baqarah mentions:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:229**: \"Divorce is (revokable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honorably, or part with them in a decent way.\"\n   This illustrates that divorce must be approached with dignity, providing a framework for respectful separation.\n\n### Context of Seeking Divorce\n\n3. **Seeking Divorce due to Harm**: In Surah Al-Mujadila, God acknowledges a woman's grievances against her husband. \n   - **Surah Al-Mujadila 58:1**: \"GOD CERTAINLY HEARD what the woman who argued with you about her husband said, and complained to God; and God heard your interrogation. Verily God hears all, and sees everything.\"\n   This verse highlights that God listens to the cries of women suffering in their marriages, which gives the woman an avenue for seeking relief through divorce.\n\n4. **Trial and Challenges in Marriage**: \n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:231**: \"When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honorably (by revoking the divorce), or let them go with honor, and do not detain them with the intent of harassing lest you should transgress.\"\n   This verse emphasizes the importance of treating women with kindness, especially following a divorce, which is particularly relevant for those seeking a divorce due to their husband's harmful behavior, such as drug addiction.\n\n### Practical Guidance in Divorce\n\n5. **Conditions for Divorce**: Surah At-Talaq provides guidance relevant to the situation:\n   - **Surah At-Talaq 65:6**: \"House the (divorced) women where you live, according to your means; but do not harass them so as to reduce them to straitened circumstances.\"\n   This encourages providing for the woman's welfare even during the divorce, ensuring that she is not left in distress.\n\n6. **Final Thoughts & Encouragement**: \n   - **Surah At-Talaq 65:7**: \"Let the man of means spend according to his means, and he whose means are limited, should spend of what God has given him. God does not burden a soul beyond what He has given him.\"\n   This verse underscores the principle of fairness and compassion in the arrangements following a divorce.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, a woman facing a challenging marriage, particularly one affected by her husband's drug addiction, is allowed to seek divorce under Islamic law. The Qur'an provides clear guidance on the rights of women, the processes involved in divorce, and the ethical responsibilities of both spouses. Women are encouraged to voice their concerns and seek justice while being assured that their grievances are heard and valid.\n\nFor additional references, the cited verses provide a full context within Islamic teachings:\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:228-231**\n- **Surah Al-Mujadila 58:1**\n- **Surah At-Talaq 65:6-7**"

        "question": "Muslim man marrying a chaste Christian woman",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islam does not prevent marriage to a Christian woman if she is chaste. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“…The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends…” [Al-Maa’idah 5:5]\nWhat is meant by chaste women is that they are free (not slaves) and chaste (not loose or immoral). \nSee also question no. 2527 \nBut if a woman is not chaste, and she has boyfriends or lovers with whom she is intimate, then Islam forbids marriage to her, whether she is a Muslim or a woman from among the People of the Book, just as it forbids marriage to a man who has girlfriends or lovers, to protect married life from collapse and to protect against mixing of lineages and to avoid causes of dispute, accusation and suspicion. \nWith regard to the Muslim husband attending marriage parties according to the Christian tradition, this is not permissible because there will be many things in these celebrations that are forbidden in Islam, such as free mixing between men and women, listening to music, drinking alcohol, dancing etc. \n \nIn the hadeeth the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him not sit at a table where wine is being drunk.” Narrated by Ahmad, 1/20; al-Bayhaqi, 7/366. Al-Albani said in al-Irwa’, 7/6: it is saheeh.\nWe thank you for your noble feelings and this good attitude and your keenness to ask about the Islamic rulings on this matter. \nWe ask Allah to help you and guide you to the religion of Islam. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, a Muslim man is permitted to marry certain categories of women from the People of the Book, which primarily includes Christians and Jews. This is justified by the Qur'an and is based on cultural and religious considerations.\n\n### Permissibility of Marriage to Christian Women\n\nThe Qur'anic basis for a Muslim man marrying a chaste Christian woman can be found in Surah Al-Ma'idah. The relevant verse states:\n\n> **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:5)**: \n> \"This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them. And [mutually lawful in marriage] are chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [them] as secret lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\"\n\nThis verse clearly indicates that chaste women from the People of the Book (which includes Christians) are lawful for Muslim men to marry, provided that certain conditions such as giving a proper dowry and seeking a lawful marital relationship are met.\n\n### Islamic Guidelines for Interfaith Marriages\n\n1. **Faithful Relationship**: The Quran emphasizes that while such marriages are permissible, they should aim for chastity rather than illicit relationships. This underlines the importance of mutual respect and commitment in the marriage.\n\n2. **Community Consent**: It is often encouraged to marry with the consent and approval of both families. This is generally a good practice in fostering a harmonious relationship, considering cultural and familial values.\n\n3. **Raising Children**: Another consideration is how interfaith marriages may affect the faith of children. While the husband may marry a Christian woman, it is generally recommended to raise the children within the Islamic faith. This concern ties into maintaining identity and religious cohesion within families.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, a Muslim man is allowed to marry a chaste Christian woman as per the teachings of Islam, primarily supported by the injunctions in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:5). It is critical, however, that the marriage is approached with sincerity, consideration of both family values, and a focus on mutual respect and understanding between partners. The overarching goal is to build a family that adheres to shared values and norms while respecting each partner's faith background."

        "predicted_answer": "### Answering the Question: Unofficial Marriage Contract in Islam Due to Delays\n\nIn the context of Islamic law, the concept of marriage (nikah) is significant and has specific guidelines. An unofficial marriage contract, sometimes referred to as a \"secret marriage\" or \"mut'ah\" (temporary marriage), raises various legal and ethical questions in Islam.\n\n1. **Validity of Marriage**: \n   A marriage in Islam is valid when it is established through a formal marriage contract (nikah) that includes the consent of both parties, the payment of a dowry (mahr), and the presence of witnesses. The absence of these elements may invalidate the marriage under traditional Islamic jurisprudence. Moreover, a marriage contract is not only a cultural formality but also a religious obligation that protects the rights of both parties and establishes social order. \n\n   **Supporting Verse**:\n   - Surah An-Nisa (4:24) states: \"And [prohibited to you are] married women, except those your right hands possess. This is the decree of Allah upon you. And lawful to you are [all others] beyond these, so long as you seek them with [money] through marriage, not unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever of you does not have the means to marry free, believing women, then he may marry from those whom your right hands possess of believing slave girls. And Allah is Knowing of your faith. You are of one another. So marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due [bridal gift] according to what is acceptable, [and] if they should chaste, not unlawful or taking [them] as secret lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\" (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 24)\n\n2. **Conditions for Valid Marriage**:\n   According to Islamic teachings, the marriage must satisfy certain conditions. For example, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:232) emphasizes the importance of mutual respect and consideration after divorce, noting the significance of having a contract. \n\n   **Supporting Verse**:\n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:232): \"And when you divorce your wives and they have fulfilled their term, do not prevent them from marrying their former husbands if they agree among themselves in a lawful manner. This is an admonition for whoever among you believes in Allah and the Last Day. And the command of Allah is to be observed.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 232)\n\n3. **Witnesses and Documentation**: \n   A formal marriage must also include witnesses, as stated in Surah At-Talaq (65:2). This reflects the importance of public acknowledgment of the marriage.\n\n   **Supporting Verse**:\n   - Surah At-Talaq (65:2): \"And when they have reached their appointed time, then either keep them with kindness or release them with kindness. And take for witness two just men from among you. And establish testimony for Allah.\" (Surah At-Talaq, Ayah 2)\n\n4. **Government Procedures**: \n   While it is understandable that government delays might prompt individuals to conduct an unofficial marriage, Islam still emphasizes following lawful procedures to ensure the marriage's legitimacy and acceptance within the community. Engaging in an unofficial marriage can lead to complications regarding inheritance, children, and social standing.\n\n5. **Consideration of Women's Rights**:\n   The marital arrangement must prioritize the rights and well-being of both partners. The Quran emphasizes that marriage is a sacred covenant, reflecting mutual rights and responsibilities.\n\n   **Supporting Verse**:\n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:228): \"And the wives have rights similar to those [of their husbands] over them in a just manner, and due to the wives is a degree [of responsibility] over them. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 228)\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, while there may be circumstances that lead to an unofficial marriage contract, Islamic law emphasizes the necessity of a formal contract that includes clear consent, witnesses, and the legal requirements set forth by the religion. It is essential to adhere to these principles to uphold the rights of all parties involved and to maintain order and integrity within family structures according to Islamic teachings. For those facing delays in government procedures, seeking guidance from a local Imam or scholar may be beneficial to navigate these complexities while adhering to Islamic principles."

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the question of whether one spouse cursing another leads to divorce or makes them forbidden to one another does not have a direct answer in the Quran. Generally, cursing or verbally abusing a spouse is considered a serious issue but does not necessarily produce an immediate effect of divorce unless it is accompanied by a clear intention of divorce or specific types of pronouncements regarding separation.\n\n### Context of Spousal Interaction\n\n1. **Swearing Oaths and Intention of Divorce**: The verses from Surah Al-Baqarah (2:225-230) describe oaths regarding distancing from one's spouse with the intention of divorce. For instance:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:226-227**: \"Those who swear to keep away from their wives (with intent of divorcing them) have four months of grace; then if they reconcile (during this period), surely God is forgiving and kind. And if they are bent on divorce, God hears all and knows everything.\"\n   - This indicates that there is a period for reflection and potential reconciliation after a declaration of separation.\n\n2. **Rights and Responsibilities**: The Quran emphasizes that both spouses have rights and responsibilities toward each other, as mentioned in:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:228**: \"Women also have recognized rights as men have, though men have an edge over them. But God is all-mighty and all-wise.\"\n   - This verse hints that there should be honor and respect in the relationship, and acts like cursing can deteriorate this respect but do not automatically sever the marital bond.\n\n### Divorce and Cursing\n\n3. **Verbal Abuse vs. Divorce**: Simply cursing or insulting does not equate to a legal divorce. The Quran indicates that divorce can occur under specific circumstances, which need to be clear:\n   - If a man pronounces the divorce three times, then it may lead to the wife being forbidden to him until she marries another man (2:230). This scenario is contingent upon explicit and formal declarations of divorce, rather than insults or curses.\n\n4. **The Role of Intention**: The intention behind words is critical in Islamic jurisprudence. For example, someone might curse out of anger without the intention of severing marital ties. In such a case, it is not considered a formal act of divorce:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:225**: \"God will not call you to account for that which is senseless in your oaths, but only for what is in your hearts; for God is forgiving and forbearing.\" \n   - This reflects the importance of intention behind statements and actions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while cursing between spouses is discouraged and goes against the values of mutual respect and kindness outlined in the Quran, it does not automatically result in divorce. For a divorce to be effective in Islamic law, it requires specific pronouncements and intentions. Cursing, unless constituting a clear intention of divorce, does not make one spouse forbidden to the other. \n\nIt is advisable for those facing such situations to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars or local Islamic authorities to help resolve conflicts in a manner that is respectful and adheres to Islamic teachings."

        "question": "Who is the woman who is religiously committed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Advice to marry the woman who is religiously committed – who is the one who is religiously committed? \n(a)\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged marrying women who are religiously committed, as he said: “Women may be married for four things: their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may your prosper).” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5090; Muslim, 1466. \n‘Abd al-‘Azeem Abaadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWhat this means is that a man who is religiously committed and of noble character should make religion his focus in all things, especially with regard to long-term matters. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined finding a wife who is religiously committed, which is the ultimate goal. \n“may your hands be rubbed with dust” is urging him to strive hard and roll up his sleeves and seek that which is enjoined.  \n‘Awn al-Ma’bood (6/31). \n(b)\nWith regard to the attributes of religiously committed women, we may list many attributes which apply to women who are described as religiously committed. These include: \n1.     Sound belief  \nThis is the most important attribute. The woman who is from ahl al-sunnah wa’l-jamaa’ah will have achieved the highest and most precious characteristic of religiously-committed women, and the one who is a follower of bid’ah (innovation) and misguidance will not be one of the religiously committed women whom the Muslim is encouraged to marry, because of the bad effect that she will have on the husband or children, or on both. \n2.     Obedience to her husband, and not going against him if he enjoins something that is right \nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: It was said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Which of women is best? He said: “The one who makes (her husband) happy when he looks at her, obeys him when he tells her to do something, and does not disobey him with regard to herself or her wealth in a way that he dislikes.”\nNarrated by al-Nasaa’i (3131); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i. \nSo the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned together three important characteristics to be found in the good, righteous wife. They are:\n(i)                When he looks at her, he is happy with her religious commitment, attitude, behaviour and appearance.\n(ii)              When he is away from her, she protects his honour and his wealth.\n(iii)            If he tells her to do something, she obeys him, so long as he does not tell her to commit sin. \n3.     Helping her husband in his faith and religious commitment, telling him to do acts of obedience and stopping him from doing haraam things. \nIt was narrated that Thawbaan said: When there was revealed about silver and gold what was revealed, they said: So what kind of wealth should we acquire? ‘Umar said: I will find out about that for you. So he mounted his camel and caught up with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I was right behind him. He said: O Messenger of Allah, what kind of wealth should we acquire? He said: “Let one of you acquire a thankful heart, a tongue that remembers Allah and a believing wife who will help him with regard to the Hereafter.” \nNarrated and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi (3094). In another version it says: “who will help him with his faith.” Ibn Maajah (1856). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.   \nAl-Mubaarakfoori (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“A believing wife who will help him with his faith” means, with his religious commitment, by reminding him to pray, fast and do other acts of worship, and will keep him from committing zina and all other haraam deeds. \nTuhfat al-Ahwadhi (8/390). \n4.     She should be a righteous woman, and among the attributes of the righteous woman is that she is obedient to her Lord and fulfils her husband’s rights with regard to his wealth and herself, even when her husband is absent. \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity and their husband’s property)” [al-Nisa’ 4:34]. \nShaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  \n“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient” means: obedient to Allah, may He be exalted. \n“guard in the husband’s absence” means: they are obedient to their husbands and even in their absence they guard themselves and their husband’s wealth, seeking the help of Allah in that, because no one can do that by himself or herself, for the self is inclined towards evil, but the one who puts his trust in Allah, He will suffice him and help him in his religious and worldly affairs.\"(Tafseer al-Sa’di p. 177) \nIt was narrated that Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are four things that are essential for happiness: a righteous wife, a spacious home, a good neighbour and a sound means of transportation. And there are four things that make one miserable: a bad neighbour, a bad wife, a small house and a bad means of transportation.” \nNarrated by Ibn Hibbaan in al-Saheehah (1232); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (282) and Saheeh al-Targheeb (1914). \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  \nA righteous wife will be with her righteous husband for many years, and she is the one who is meant in the hadeeth in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “This world is temporary conveniences and the best of its comforts is a believing wife, who when you look at her she pleases you and if you tell her to do something she obeys you, and if you are away from her she protects you with regard to  herself and your wealth.”\n This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined when the Muhaajiroon asked him which kind of wealth they should acquire, and he said: “Let one of you acquire a tongue that remembers Allah, a thankful heart, and a believing wife who will help him with regard to the Hereafter.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi from Saalim ibn Abi’l-Ja’d, from Thawbaan. \nShe may offer the love and compassion that Allah speaks of in His Book, and the pain of separation may be harder for her than death in some cases, and harder than losing wealth or leaving one’s homeland, especially if one of them is fond of the other or they have children together who will be harmed by separation.  \nMajmoo’ al-Fatawa (35/299). \n5.     Good etiquette and knowledge \nIt was narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three who will be given a double reward: a man from among the people of the Book who believed in his Prophet, then lived to see the Prophet (S) and followed him and believed in him– he will have a double reward; and a slave who fulfils his duty towards Allah and towards his master – he will have a double reward; and a man who had a slave woman whom he fed and fed her well, and taught her and taught her well, then he set her free and married her – he will have a double reward.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (97) and Muslim (154). \nAl-Mubaarakfoori (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“and taught her” means he taught her good manners. \n“and taught her well” means teaching in a kind manner.  \nTuhfat al-Ahwadhi (4/218). \n6.     Doing acts of worship and obedience, and refraining from haraam things. \nThis is part of what being religiously committed means, that is mentioned in the saheeh hadeeth that we quoted at the beginning of our answer. \nAl-Khateeb al-Sharbeeni al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWhat is meant by religious commitment is acts of obedience and worship, and righteous deeds, and refraining from haraam things. \nMughni al-Muhtaaj (3/127). \nThe one who combines obedience to her Lord, doing the obligatory duties that are enjoined upon her, and avoiding the haraam things that she is forbidden to do, with obedience to her husband, has glad tidings from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that she will be highly honoured when she enters Paradise. \nAccording to the hadeeth: “If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (Ramadaan), guards her chastity and obeys her husband, it will be said to her: Enter Paradise by whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish.” Narrated by Ahmad (1664) and others; classed as hasan by al-Albaani because of another report in Saheeh al-Targheeb, as stated by al-Arna’oot in Takhreej al-Musnad. \n7.     She is a devout worshipper and one who fasts \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you __ Muslims (who submit to Allah), believers, obedient (to Allah), turning to Allah in repentance, worshipping Allah sincerely, given to fasting or emigrants (for Allah’s sake), previously married and virgins” [al-Tahreem 66:5] \nal-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “will give him instead of you, wives better than you Muslims” means who submit to Allah and obey Him. \n“believers” who believe in the Oneness of Allah (Tawheed). \n“obedient (to Allah)” means obedient, or it was said: who offer supplication (du’aa’), or who pray. \n“given to fasting or emigrants” those who fast often, or Zayd ibn Aslam said: women who migrated (for the sake of Allah), or it was said, who go with him wherever he goes.  \nTafseer al-Baghawi (8/168). \nThus it is known that “religious commitment” (deen) is a comprehensive word that includes different kinds of worship, obedience, characteristics and attitudes. It is essential to note that that which we have said of these qualities and deeds is not the same with all women, rather there are different degrees thereof, and that is well known. The more modest, knowledgeable and devoted to worship a woman is, the more desirable she is as a wife. \nWhatever the case, the woman who is religiously committed is the one who will help a man to protect his own religious commitment, and help him with regard to his Hereafter; she will make him happy when he looks at her and she will protect him when he is absent, and she will raise his children well. \nSee the answer to question no. 83777 for information on proposing to a girl who is religiously committed but not beautiful; you will find useful information there that is complementary to this answer. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, a woman who is religiously committed is one who exhibits the qualities and characteristics emphasized in the Qur'an. Here are several key aspects of what defines such a woman, supported by relevant verses:\n\n1. **Faith and Submission to God**:\n   A religiously committed woman is a believer who submits to God's will. She has a strong faith and engages in acts of devotion. Surah Al-Ahzab (33:35) notes that both believing men and women, who come to submission and demonstrate righteousness, will be rewarded:\n   > \"Verily, men and women who have come to submission, men and women who are believers, men and women who are devout, truthful men and truthful women, men and women with endurance, men and women who are modest, men and women who give alms, men and women who observe fasting, men and women who guard their private parts, and those men and women who remember God a great deal, for them God has forgiveness and a great reward.\" (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:35)\n\n2. **Moral Integrity**:\n   A committed woman adheres to high moral standards, which includes avoiding theft, fornication, and wronging others. This is articulated in Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:10-12), where a woman wishing to convert is not only examined for her faith but also for her commitment to righteous conduct:\n   > \"O Prophet, when believing women come to you and swear an oath that they will not associate anything with God, nor steal, nor fornicate, nor kill their children, nor accuse others for what they have fabricated themselves, nor disobey you in any rightful thing, then you should accept their allegiance...\" (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:12)\n\n3. **Marriage to a Believer**:\n   The Qur'an instructs that a believing woman should marry a man who shares her faith. This promotes unity in belief and practice within the family. Verse 2:221 emphasizes that:\n   > \"Do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:221)\n\n4. **Seeking Knowledge and Resilience**:\n   A religiously committed woman seeks to grow in her knowledge of religion and engages with the teachings of Islam. Surah Al-Ahzab (33:34) encourages reflection and learning:\n   > \"Remember God's revelations and the wisdom that is recited in your homes. God is indeed all perceiving, well-informed.\" (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:34)\n\n5. **Charity and Social Responsibility**:\n   Engaging in charitable acts and supporting those in need is a manifestation of a committed faith. This is acknowledged in the quality of \"giving alms\" found in Surah Al-Ahzab (33:35):\n   > \"...men and women who give alms...\" (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:35)\n\n6. **Commitment to Community**:\n   A religiously committed woman supports and acts justly towards her community. Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:8) emphasizes kindness and justice towards those who have not opposed faith:\n   > \"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you, nor expelled you from your homes. God indeed loves those who are just.\" (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:8)\n\nIn conclusion, a woman who is religiously committed in Islam embodies faith and devotion, moral integrity, the importance of marrying another believer, pursuit of knowledge, charitable acts, and a commitment to community justice. These attributes are drawn from the teachings of the Qur'an and exemplified through the lives of historical figures in Islam."

        "question": "She received a proposal from an engineer who works in a bank – should she accept?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    A woman should be keen to choose a righteous husband who will \n    fear Allaah with regard to her and will feed her and her children with \n    halaal income and help them to avoid that which is haraam. \n\n    Hence we appreciate this question from you, as it indicates \n    that you are concerned about this matter. We say: if the bank where this \n    person works is a riba-based bank which markets and sells its apartments and \n    buildings on the basis of riba, then it is not permissible to work there, or \n    to help it with its projects in any way whatsoever. \n\n    Similarly, it is not permissible to work in building \n    apartments or places for sin, such as leisure venues, places for gambling, \n    riba based banks and the like. \n\n    It is on this basis that this suitor should be accepted or \n    rejected. If his work is permissible and he is religiously committed and of \n    good character, then accept him. But if his work is haraam or he is not \n    religiously committed and of good character, then do not accept him, because \n    marrying him will result in harm that will affect you and your children. \n\n    We ask Allaah for guidance. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "When considering a marriage proposal in Islam, several factors play a crucial role, including the character and integrity of the individual, their beliefs, and the circumstances surrounding the proposal. The situation described involves a woman receiving a proposal from an engineer who works in a bank. It's essential to evaluate whether this profession aligns with Islamic principles.\n\n### Considerations for the Proposal\n\n1. **Employment in a Bank**:\n   - Most Islamic scholars agree that working in a conventional bank that practices interest (riba) is problematic because interest is prohibited in Islam. The Qur'an explicitly forbids usury:\n     - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:275-279)** states: \"Those who consume usury cannot stand on the Day of Resurrection except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, 'Trade is just like usury.' But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden usury...\"\n     - This suggests that the profession may not be compliant with Islamic principles if the bank deals in interest.\n\n2. **Character and Integrity**:\n   - The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of finding a partner who is strong in faith and character. As mentioned in **Surah Al-Qasas (28:26)**, one of the maidens said about Moses: \"Surely the best (man) to employ is one who is strong and honest.\" This can be extrapolated to mean that integrity and strength of character are vital qualities to consider in a potential husband.\n\n3. **Seeking Consent and Mutual Respect**:\n   - According to **Surah An-Nisa (4:25)**, marriage should be built on mutual consent, and it should be respectful and dignified. The verse encourages seeking partners who have a respectable background and with whom one can establish a rightful relationship.\n\n4. **Marrying a Believer**:\n   - The Qur'an guides believers to marry within their faith: **Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:10)** reminds Muslims that believing women are not lawful for unbelieving men and vice versa. Hence, it’s crucial to ascertain the man’s faith, as it strongly influences the moral and religious guidance in the family.\n\n5. **Financial Responsibility**:\n   - One of the principles of marriage is the provision of a suitable dowry, as stated in **Surah An-Nisa (4:24)**. It emphasizes that men should provide for their families. Therefore, evaluate whether this engineer can fulfill financial responsibilities in a manner that is beneficial for both partners and aligns with Islamic teachings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt is important for the woman to engage thoughtfully with these considerations:\n- Assess whether the bank's operations align with Islamic principles and evaluate the man’s character and piety.\n- Ensure that the proposal comes with mutual respect and consent.\n- Confirm that the potential spouse can financially support a family in accordance with Islamic teachings.\n\nIf the engineer's employment involves interest and he does not exhibit strong Islamic character, it may be advisable to decline the proposal. If, however, he demonstrates good character, is honest about his work, and shows a commitment to Islamic values, the woman may consider moving forward. Ultimately, seeking guidance through prayer and consulting knowledgeable individuals in the community can also provide clarity."

        "question": "Ruling on Caesarean births",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nCaesarean section is an operation in which the abdomen is cut in order to bring the child out of the mother. It is said that it is so called after Julius Caesar, because he was the first one to be born in this manner, when his mother died during labour, after which the doctor cut open her stomach and brought him out of her, and Caesar lived to become the emperor of Rome. \nSecondly:\nNatural childbirth is better for the mother, but this does not mean that Caesarean section should not be used when necessary. Among such cases of necessity are: when the placenta is in the lower part of the uterus (placenta praevia), when the foetus is deprived of oxygen, when there are tumours in the pelvis, when there is high blood pressure, when there is haemorrhaging that threatens the life of the mother and baby, when there are conjoined (“Siamese”) twins, when the foetus is abnormally large, and other cases of necessity where Caesarean section is indicated. This is one of the great blessings of Allah, an example of His mercy towards His creation. \nMany doctors take the matter of resorting to Caesarean section lightly, because they want to earn more money or because they cannot be patient with the mother during natural childbirth. Some women ask for this surgery in order to preserve the gracefulness of their bodies or so as to avoid the pain of childbirth. \nUndoubtedly doing this leads to the loss of numerous benefits, and also has effects on the mother and on future births, as referred to by the brother in his question. \nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nI would like to take this opportunity to point out a phenomenon that has been mentioned to us, which is that many obstetricians, male and female, in the hospitals are too keen for birth to take place by surgical means, which is known as a Caesarean. I am afraid that this may be a plot against the Muslims, because the more births take place in this manner, the more the skin of the abdomen is weakened and pregnancy becomes more dangerous for the woman, and she becomes unable to get pregnant. Some of the people who work in private hospitals have told me that many women come to the hospitals and their specialists tell them that there is no alternative to a caesarean,  then they go to this private hospital and give birth naturally. He mentioned that there were about eighty such cases in one month. This means that the issue is serious, and attention must be drawn to it. It should be noted that in this case some pain and exhaustion is inevitable. \n“His mother bears him with hardship. And she brings him forth with hardship” [al-Ahqaaf 46:15]\nIt is not something to be done as soon as the woman feels a contraction, so that she may avoid pain. Natural childbirth is better than a caesarean. End quote. \nLiqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftoohah (2/question no. 42). \nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: \nAllah says in Soorat ‘Abasa (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Then He makes the Path easy for him” [‘Abasa 80:20]\nSo Allah guarantees to make it easy for this newborn. Many men and women have noticed that there is haste in performing caesarean sections. Is this a sign of weak trust in Allah, may He be glorified and exalted? \nHe replied: \nI think that this method which people use nowadays when the woman feels the contractions and goes to the hospital, and they do a caesarean section for her, I think that this is inspired by the shaytaan, and that the harm caused is far greater than any benefits, because a woman is bound to feel pain when in labour, but this pain has a number of benefits: \n1 – It is an expiation for sin \n2 – It raises her in status if she is patient and seeks reward. \n3 – The woman understands the extent of the pain suffered by other mothers. \n4 – She will appreciate the extent of the blessing of good health that Allah bestows on her. \n5 – It will increase her love towards her child, because the more difficult it is to attain something, the dearer it becomes. \n6 – If the child is born by via the usual, well-known route, this is better for him and the woman. \n7 – Damage may be expected from this surgery, because this operation weakens the wall of the uterus etc, which may tear. And it may be successful or unsuccessful. \n8 – The woman who gets used to having caesareans is unlikely to give birth in the natural manner, because that is not possible, and there is the risk that the site of the surgery may rupture.\n9 – Having surgery results in having fewer children, because if the abdomen is cut three times in different places, it becomes weak and future pregnancy becomes dangerous. \n10 – This is a kind of luxury, and luxury is a thing that leads to doom, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  \n“Verily, before that, they indulged in luxury…” [al-Waaqi’ah 56:45]\nWomen should be patient and seek reward, and should continue to give birth in the natural way, because that is better for them in this world and in the Hereafter. Men should also pay attention to this issue, for we do not know, perhaps our enemies are the ones who have made these operations easy for us so that we will lose these benefits and be subject to these losses. \nQuestion: What is meant by luxury? \nAnswer: Luxury includes avoiding the natural pain of childbirth. This is a kind of luxury. If luxury does not help one to obey Allah, then it is either blameworthy or at the very least permissible. \nLiqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (86/question no. 17). \nTo sum up: Caesarean section should not be resorted to except in cases of necessity, when natural childbirth is not possible, or it poses a danger to the mother or the child. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The ruling on Caesarean births in Islam is generally permissive and favorable, particularly in contexts where the health of the mother or the child is at risk. Although the Quran does not specifically address Caesarean sections, Islamic jurisprudence allows medical interventions when necessary to save lives or prevent harm. \n\n### Health and Preservation of Life\n\n1. **Principle of Not Compelling Beyond Capacity**:\n   The Quran emphasizes that no individual should be compelled beyond their capacity. This principle is often interpreted to allow for medical interventions, including Caesarean sections, especially if they are necessary to safeguard the mother’s or child’s health. \n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233)**: \"...but no soul should be compelled beyond capacity...\"\n   \n2. **The Importance of Intention in Medical Care**:\n   Islam places significant emphasis on intention, and the act of seeking medical treatment, including a Caesarean delivery when required, aligns with the Islamic principle of taking necessary steps to protect life. \n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:195)**: \"...and do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.\"\n  \n3. **Support for Women during Childbirth**:\n   The Quran acknowledges the challenges of motherhood and childbirth. The emphasis on compassion in these verses can extend to decisions made regarding childbirth processes, such as opting for a Caesarean when it is deemed necessary for the safety of the mother or child.\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233)**: \"The mothers should suckle their babies for a period of two years for those (fathers) who wish that they should complete the suckling...\"\n\n### Practical Application in Islamic Jurisprudence\n\nIslamic scholars from various schools of thought have provided guidelines concerning medical practices, including Caesarean births:\n\n1. **Permissibility of Medical Interventions**:\n   Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) encompasses allowances for medical interventions. Scholars assert that interventions like Caesarean sections are justified and even necessary in situations where complications during labor may pose life-threatening risks.\n   \n2. **Consultation and Consensus**:\n   It's encouraged for families to engage in dialogue with medical professionals about the safest birthing methods for the health of both mother and child. The decision to proceed with a C-section can be based on the consensus of medical advice and the needs of the mother and child.\n\n3. **Precedent of Historical Practices**:\n   The historical context of Islamic teachings also reveals a tendency to consider the health and well-being of women. For instance, during childbirth, if traditional methods pose risks, alternative medical solutions—including surgical ones—are accepted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while the Quran does not explicitly reference Caesarean births, the principles within the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) along with the rulings of Islamic jurisprudence support the permissibility and acceptability of Caesarean deliveries when necessary for health reasons. The overarching Islamic concepts of compassion, care for life, and the allowance for medical intervention provide a clear framework for understanding and accepting Caesarean births within the faith."

        "question": "If he asks her to say “I accept So and so as a husband before Allaah”, does she become his wife?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is not a marriage, rather it is a deviation and calling it a marriage is lying and deceit. What you must do is cut off ties with this man who is toying with the rulings of Allaah, and regarding as permissible that which Allaah has forbidden. His claim that this is a marriage means that he regards it as permissible to do with you what a man does with his wife. Wouldn’t any adulterer on the face of the earth be able to do such a marriage with the immoral adulteress who is his partner in sin, so that she would be his wife and they would not be committing adultery?!  \nWe are afraid that he may gradually make you take off your hijab in front of him or do something even worse, and take a picture of you and try to threaten you with this picture. It is easy nowadays to combine pictures with one another and threaten you using these pictures if you do not do what he wants. Many such cases have happened. See the answer to question no. 91868 and learn a lesson from it. \nHow many heedless women have been gradually tricked in such ways by treacherous “wolves” until they lost their honour and chastity, then these men leave them, forgetting about the so-called marriage, and there is no maintenance and no rights, not even a divorce! \nIn a valid marriage it is essential that the woman’s guardian be present, along with two witnesses of good character from among the Muslims. Any marriage that is conducted without a guardian is invalid, and a woman who gives herself in marriage without her guardian is a zaaniyah (adulteress), as Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The one who gives herself in marriage is a zaaniyah.” Narrated by al-Daaraqutni.  \nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage except with a guardian and two witnesses.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ no. 7557. \nAnd he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who gives herself in marriage without the permission of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.” Narrated by Ahmad (24417), Abu Dawood (2083) and al-Tirmidhi (1102); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (2709). \nIts seems to us from your question that you fear Allaah, may He be exalted, and you do not want to fall into haraam and be exposed to the wrath of the Almighty. Hence we advise you strongly to forget about this man and to cut off all ties with him, via the internet or otherwise, for every word, smile and moment of desire will be recorded against you, and tomorrow you will be questioned about it before your Lord.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the conditions for marriage are quite specific and rooted in the teachings of the Quran and Hadith. To address the question about whether saying \"I accept So and so as a husband before Allah\" leads to marriage, we need to consider several important points, including the necessity of a formal marriage contract (Nikkah), consent from both parties, and the payment of dowry (mahr).\n\n### Key Components of Islamic Marriage:\n\n1. **Consent**: The bride must willingly accept the marriage without any coercion. The Quran emphasizes the importance of mutual consent in several verses, such as:\n   - _\"O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the waiting period of them. But provide suitably for them, and let them go with honour...\"_ (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:49)\n\n2. **Marriage Contract (Nikkah)**: A formal marriage contract is essential in Islamic law. The act of verbally accepting the marriage is a part of this process but must be accompanied by the registration of the contract. The principles surrounding the Nikkah can be found in the following verse:\n   - _\"Marry those among you who are single, or those who are virtuous among your men, and women...\"_ (Surah An-Nisa, 4:32)\n\n3. **Dowry (Mahr)**: It is obligatory for the groom to provide a dowry to the bride as a symbol of respect and responsibility. This dowry must be agreed upon and given to the bride:\n   - _\"And give the women (whom you marry) their dowry as a free gift...\"_ (Surah An-Nisa, 4:24).\n\n4. **Witnesses**: There needs to be witnesses present at the marriage contract for it to be valid in Islamic jurisprudence. This is a requirement for the marriage to be recognized as legal. The Quran states:\n   - _\"And obtain two witnesses from among your men...\"_ (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:282).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTherefore, while verbally stating “I accept So and so as a husband before Allah” signifies that the woman consented to the marriage, this alone is not sufficient to establish the marriage legally in the eyes of Islamic law. A formal marriage contract (Nikkah) must occur, which includes signature by both parties (with the bride's consent), the presence of witnesses, and the payment of the dowry.\n\n### Supporting Verses:\n\n1. **Consent and Respect**:\n   - Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49)\n\n2. **Marriage Contract**:\n   - Surah An-Nisa (4:32)\n\n3. **Dowry (Mahr)**:\n   - Surah An-Nisa (4:24)\n\n4. **Witness Requirement**:\n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:282)\n\nIn summary, saying “I accept So and so as a husband before Allah” indicates a willingness to marry, but it must be part of the complete process of Nikkah to be legally binding."

        "question": "His father refuses to arrange his marriage until he has completed his studies",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It is mustahabb to hasten to get married for the one who is \n    able for it, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who \n    has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon \n    (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid‑servants \n    (female slaves)”\n\n    [al-Noor 24:32]\n\n    Ibn Katheer(may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on \n    this verse: This is a command to marry off those who need to get married. A \n    number of scholars are of the view that it is obligatory for everyone who is \n    able for it, and they quoted as evidence the apparent meaning of the words \n    of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “O young \n    men, whoever among you can afford to get married, then let him do so, for it \n    is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity. And whoever is \n    not able to do that, then let him fast, for that will be a shield for him.” \n    Narrated in al-Saheehayn from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood. \n\n    In is narrated in al-Sunan via more than one isnaad \n    that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: “Marry and produce offspring for I will be proud of your numbers \n    on the Day of Resurrection.” \n\n    Ayyim (translated here as “single”) refers to the woman who \n    has no husband or the man who has no wife, whether they were married then \n    separated or were never married. End quote. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    The son should tell his father clearly of his wish to get \n    married, and the father should understand the importance of that, and he \n    should help his son to get married. Many of the fuqaha’ are of the view that \n    that is obligatory if he is able for it. \n\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Our \n    companions said: The father must keep his son chaste if he is obliged to \n    spend on him and if he needs to be kept chaste.  This is the view of some of \n    the companions of al-Shaafa’i. End quote from al-Mughni (8/172). \n\n    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: A \n    person’s need to get married is urgent, and in some cases it may be like his \n    need for food and drink. Hence the scholars said: It is obligatory for the \n    one who has to spend on a person to arrange his marriage if he can afford to \n    get married, so it is obligatory for fathers to arrange the marriages of \n    their sons, if the sons needs to get married but cannot afford to do so. But \n    I heard that some fathers who forget how they were when they were young, \n    when the sons ask them to arrange their marriage, they say: Get married at \n    your own expense. This is not permissible and it is haraam if he able to \n    arrange his marriage. His son will dispute with him on the Day of \n    Resurrection if he does not arrange his marriage when he is able to do so. \n    End quote from Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (18/410). \n\n    A widespread mistake is when the father refuses to listen to \n    his son concerning this matter, and ignores the son’s need. His need for \n    marriage may be urgent, and as a result of delaying marriage he may fall \n    into some kind of deviation. It is well known that people vary with regard \n    to this need and their level of self-control in this matter. The father may \n    be sinning by preventing his son from getting married if he needs that, as \n    stated above. \n\n    Some fathers give precedence to study and work over marriage \n    in all cases, and they never consider arranging their son’s marriage before \n    that. This is also wrong. Rather they should study the matter and weigh up \n    the pros and cons. They should find out how much their son needs to get \n    married, and how able he is to combine marriage and study, and which should \n    be given priority if it is not possible to do both. Protecting one’s \n    religious commitment is important, and takes precedence over protecting \n    one’s physical health and wealth, so naturally it takes precedence over \n    studying. \n\n    Thirdly: \n\n    The father may be excused for refusing to arrange his son’s \n    marriage before he completes his studies, either because he sees that the \n    son is not well-organized in handling his affairs and cannot take \n    responsibility for himself, let alone anyone else, or he thinks that he is \n    neglecting his studies and would neglect them even more after marriage, or \n    he does not think that he really needs to get married, and it is only a \n    passing fancy or he wants to imitate someone else. The son should excuse his \n    father and strive to convince him, and explain to him the extent of his need \n    for marriage and how able he is to take care of his wife after that. \n\n    We ask Allaah to guide you. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is not only a personal union between two individuals but is also regarded as a significant social contract with religious and ethical ramifications. The decision to marry can often involve various considerations, including financial, educational, and familial responsibilities. The situation where a father refuses to arrange his son’s marriage until he has completed his studies presents an interesting intersection of personal choice, family expectations, and the principles highlighted in the Quran.\n\n### Importance of Education\n\nThe father’s insistence on the completion of studies before marriage can be seen as aligning with the Islamic principle that emphasizes the pursuit of knowledge. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.\" (Sunan Ibn Majah). Education plays a crucial role in equipping an individual for various responsibilities in life, including marital duties.\n\n### Marriage Guidelines in the Quran\n\nThe Quran provides several guidelines on marriage and relationships, detailed in various Surah:\n\n1. **Surah An-Nisa** (4:22-24):\n   This passage outlines who one is permitted to marry and emphasizes the importance of marrying with integrity and mutual consent. It articulates an approach that highlights the necessity of personal and social responsibilities when entering into marriage:\n   > “And do not wed the women your fathers had wed... Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery.”\n\n2. **Surah Al-Baqarah** (2:233):\n   This verse emphasizes the well-being of families and encourages consideration for one’s obligations, which includes financial and emotional readiness before entering into marriage:\n   > “Mothers may nurse their children two complete cycles, for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period]. Upon the father is [a responsibility] of their food and their clothing according to what is acceptable. No person is charged with more than his capacity...\"\n\n3. **Surah Al-Baqarah** (2:221):\n   Another important aspect is the teaching regarding selecting a spouse. The Quran advises marrying those of faith:\n   > “And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe. And a believing servant is better than a polytheist even though she impresses you.”\n\n### Role of the Family in Marriage Decisions\n\nIn many Muslim cultures, families play a significant role in marriage decisions. The father's authority to delay marriage until the son has completed his studies reflects a desire for the son to be properly prepared for the responsibilities that come with marriage, both in terms of providing for a family and understanding life's complexities.\n\n1. **Respect for Parents**:\n   Islam teaches respect and kindness towards one’s parents. Surah Al-Isra (17:23-24) directs:\n   > \"And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment...\"\n\n2. **Balancing Responsibilities**:\n   Completing one's education can be viewed as aligning with the Quranic teachings of personal development and provision. Respecting a parent's wishes in such a case also falls under the ethical considerations of obedience to parental authority, as long as such wishes do not contradict Islamic teachings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while the refusal to arrange a marriage until studies are complete may seem restrictive, it can also be interpreted as an investment in the son's future well-being and ability to fulfill his marital responsibilities. The verses from the Quran provide both a framework for understanding the importance of marriage and education, as well as the need for mutual respect and collaboration within familial relationships. A young Muslim should strive to balance parental expectations, personal aspirations, and ethical teachings from the Quran in their journey towards marriage. \n\nThis approach not only honors family values but also aligns with the Islamic principles of acquiring knowledge and preparing adequately for the responsibilities of marriage, ultimately fulfilling the duties prescribed by Allah."

        "question": "Ruling on one who forbids marriage for himself",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIt is not \n    permissible for anyone to forbid that which Allaah has made permissible, \n    such as women (marriage), food or anything else, because Allaah, may He be \n    exalted, said:  \n“O you \n    who believe! Make not unlawful the Tayyibaat (all that is good as regards \n    foods, things, deeds, beliefs, persons) which Allaah has made lawful to you, \n    and transgress not. Verily, Allaah does not like the transgressors”\n\n    [al-Maa’idah 5:87]\nSome of the \n    Sahaabah wanted to be celibate and keep away from women, but the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade them to do that, \n    and Allaah revealed this verse. \nIbn Jareer \n    narrated with his isnaad that Mujaahid (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \n    Some men, including ‘Uthmaan ibn Maz’oon and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr (may \n    Allaah be pleased with them) wanted to be celibate, and to castrate \n    themselves, then this verse was revealed.  \nAl-Bukhaari \n    (5074) and Muslim (1402) narrated that Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) forbade ‘Uthmaan ibn Maz’oon to be celibate. If he had \n    given him permission, we would have gotten ourselves castrated.  \nRemaining \n    celibate, getting castrated and regarding women as haraam are all haraam. \n    This is turning away from the Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), who got married and encouraged others to \n    get married. \nAl-Bukhaari \n    (5063) and Muslim (1401) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: Three people \n    came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) asking about the worship of the Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). When they were told, it was as if they \n    regarded it as too little. They said: Who are we in comparison to the \n    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? Allaah has forgiven his \n    past and future sins. One of them said: As for me, I will pray all night \n    forever. Another said: I shall fast all my life and never break my fast. \n    Another said: I shall keep away from women and never get married. The \n    Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came and \n    said: “Are you the ones who said such and such? By Allaah, I am the one who \n    fears Allaah the most among you and I am the most pious, but I fast and I \n    break my fast, I pray and I sleep, and I marry women. Whoever turns away \n    from my Sunnah is not of me.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5063) and Muslim \n    (1401).  \nThus is it \n    clear that no one has the right to forbid women (marriage) to himself. \nThirdly: \nWhoever has \n    done that has to repent to Allaah, may He be exalted, and he has to offer \n    expiation for breaking an oath, because Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \n“O \n    Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allaah has allowed to \n    you, seeking to please your wives? And Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most \n    Merciful.\n2. Allaah \n    has already ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths”\n    [al-Tahreem 66:1-2]\nAllaah has \n    described the forbidding of something permissible as an oath. \nSee: \n    al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (10/475). \nThe \n    expiation for breaking an oath is to free a slave, or to feed ten poor \n    persons with the average kind of food that he gives his own family, or to \n    clothe them. Whoever cannot do that must fast for three days. \nThis has \n    been explained in detail in the answer to question no. \n    45676. \nFourthly:  \nThe ruling \n    on marriage varies from one person to another, according to financial and \n    physical ability and how much a person needs to get married. In some cases \n    it is obligatory and in others it is mustahabb or makrooh. See question no. \n    36486. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the act of forbidding oneself from marriage when it is permissible by divine decree can be seen as an act of disobedience to God. The Quran provides clear guidelines regarding marriage, emphasizing its lawful nature and importance as a foundational social institution.\n\n### Key Verses on the Lawfulness of Marriage\n\n1. **Surah At-Tahrim (66:1-3)**:\n   - \"O PROPHET, WHY should you forbid (yourself) what God has made lawful for you, in order to please your wives? Yet God is forgiving and kind. Surely God has sanctioned the dissolution of your vows. God is your Lord: He is all-knowing, and all-wise.\" (At-Tahrim 66:1-3)\n   \n   This verse is particularly significant as it directly addresses the Prophet Muhammad, reminding him that it is not proper to forbid oneself from what God has made lawful. It serves as a reminder to all believers about the importance of adhering to divine commands and the idea that God wishes ease for His followers.\n\n2. **Surah An-Nisa (4:24-26)**:\n   - \"Also forbidden are married women unless they are captives (of war). Such is the decree of God. Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery. Then give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower. It will not be sinful if you agree to something (else) by mutual consent after having settled the dowry. God is certainly all-knowing and all-wise.\" (An-Nisa 4:24-26)\n   \n   This passage underscores that marriage is not only lawful but also a significant aspect of maintaining social order and personal dignity. The emphasis on lawful unions indicates the central role of marriage within Islam.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49-50)**:\n   - \"O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' of them. But provide suitably for them, and let them go with honour.\" (Al-Ahzab 33:49)\n   \n   This verse clarifies the rights and regulations associated with marriage, further demonstrating the importance of this institution within Islamic law.\n\n### Ruling on Forbidding Marriage\n\nGiven these teachings, if a person deliberately forbids themselves from marrying when marriage is permissible, they are acting against the clear guidance of the Quran. Such an action might stem from personal interpretations, cultural pressures, or misguided beliefs. However, the Quran explicitly encourages marriage and provides particulars on who may be married and how marriages should be treated.\n\nIn Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), it is generally considered impermissible to swear off marriage when there is no valid reason (e.g., keeping oneself dedicated to worship as a vow, which is a rare and personal circumstance). The Prophet Muhammad actively encouraged marriage, stating, \"Marry those who are single among you...\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, 5065).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nForbidding oneself from marriage without a legitimate reason, especially when God has made it lawful, is viewed as a harmful practice that can lead to spiritual and social consequences. The verses from the Quran highlight the legitimacy and desirability of marriage. Therefore, it is essential for believers to engage with these teachings to ensure alignment with Islamic values regarding marriage and family."

        "question": "Can a person with AIDS masturbate?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nA person who is a carrier \n    of the virus or who has AIDS may get married to a woman who is healthy or \n    who also has the disease, if she accepts that after coming to know of his \n    condition and to what extent he is affected, and they may agree not to have \n    children, or not to have intercourse. The husband may be masturbated by his \n    wife, and there is no sin on him for that. \nBut it is not permissible \n    for him to get married without informing the woman of his sickness, because \n    concealing it is deceit and is haraam. If he conceals it then the wife finds \n    out, she has the right to annul the marriage. \nSecondly: \nMasturbation is haraam, as \n    has been explained in question no.\n    329. \nBut if the person who has \n    AIDS cannot get married, and he is afraid that he may fall into zina \n    (fornication), it is permissible for him to masturbate, so as to choose the \n    lesser of two evils. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn \n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard to ejaculating by \n    choice, if he masturbates with his hand, this is haraam according to most of \n    the scholars, and it is one of the two reports narrated from Ahmad, in fact \n    it is the more correct of the two. According to another report it is \n    makrooh, but if he is compelled to do that, such as one who fears that he \n    may fall into zina if he does not masturbate, or he fears that he may become \n    ill, then in this case there are two well known scholarly views and in this \n    case a number of the earlier and later scholars granted a concession, \n    whereas others forbade it. And Allaah knows best. End quote from \n    al-Fataawa al-Kubra (1/302). \nIt says in Sharh \n    al-Muntaha (3/366): Whoever masturbates with no need, man or woman, his \n    action is forbidden and he should be disciplined for that because it is a \n    sin. But if he does it for fear of committing zina or homosexuality, then \n    there is no punishment, and if he does it for fear of physical harm the same \n    applies, and more so. But it is not permissible for a man to masturbate with \n    his hand unless he is unable to get married, because if he is able to get \n    married there is no need for that. End quote.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether a person with AIDS can masturbate is one that intersects various theological and medical considerations in Islam. \n\n### Understanding the Context \n\n1. **Health Considerations**: From a medical standpoint, individuals with AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) face unique health challenges. The disease compromises the immune system, making individuals susceptible to infections and diseases. However, masturbation in itself is not inherently harmful to health, but one should consider the individual’s health specifics and consult medical professionals regarding any activities that may pose risks given their condition.\n\n2. **Islamic Teachings on Masturbation**: Islamic texts do not directly address masturbation, and different scholars have varied opinions—from viewing it as discouraged (makruh) to permissible under certain circumstances. The primary concern of Islamic law centers around maintaining modesty, chastity, and fulfilling sexual needs in a lawful manner.\n\n### Relevant Islamic Principles \n\n1. **The Need for Self-Control**: The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of self-control and the fulfillment of sexual needs through legal means such as marriage. However, there are allowances for those who are unable to marry or who may be in a difficult situation. For instance, Surah Al-Mu’minun (23:5-7) mentions that successful believers are those who guard their chastity, except with their wives or those whom their right hands possess, indicating that outside of these relationships, abstaining is encouraged.\n\n2. **Laws of Purification**: If masturbation occurs and leads to seminal pollution (which may happen regardless of health status), it typically requires a ritual purification (ghusl), as mentioned in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:6). This overarching rule applies regardless of an individual's health condition:\n   > \"O believers, when you stand up for (the service of) prayer, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads and wash your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of seminal pollution, then bathe and purify yourself well...\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:6).\n\n3. **Forgiveness and Understanding of Individual Circumstances**: Surah Al-Baqarah (2:286) states:\n   > \"Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:286).\n   This can extend to matters of personal conduct and sin. If someone is engaging in something like masturbation out of a necessity of their situation (e.g., physical urges in a state of illness) but approaches it with awareness and self-control, it may not be viewed as sinful as long as it does not lead to sinful behavior or illicit thoughts.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, from an Islamic perspective, a person with AIDS does not face a blanket prohibition against masturbation. However, it is essential to consider the aspects of health, individual circumstances, and adherence to Islamic principles regarding modesty and purity. Engaging with a knowledgeable scholar or a medical professional could provide personal guidance tailored to individual circumstances, especially concerning health concerns related to AIDS.\n\nIn all matters, it's vital to uphold the principle of compassion and understanding in Islam, showing consideration for one’s situation and seeking knowledge to navigate personal issues."

        "question": "She is asking about marrying a man who plays soccer (football)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nPlaying soccer is permissible subject to certain conditions. \n1 – That it should not be for money, whether it is paid by the two teams, one of them or by a third party, because it is not permissible to give prizes except for competitions which help prepare one for jihad, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be no (money) prizes for competitions except archery competitions and races with camels and horses.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1700), al-Nasaa’i (3585), Abu Dawood (2575) and Ibn Maajah (2878); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. \nSome scholars added to these three anything that helps in jihad and propagating Islam, such as competitions in knowledge of Qur’aan, hadeeth and fiqh, in which is permissible to offer prizes. \nTherefore it is not permissible to give or take the prizes that are given to those who win soccer matches and tournaments between two or more teams, and they come under the heading of forbidden betting. \n2 – The game should not be accompanied by anything haraam, such as uncovering the ‘awrah. The man’s ‘awrah is the area from the navel to the knee, and it is well known that most of those who play this game uncover their thighs, but this is haraam and is not permitted. \n3 – The game should not lead to anything that is haraam, such as missing prayers, or missing Jumu’ah prayer or prayers in congregation. Unfortunately we say that many of those who play this game in clubs miss the prayers because of the matches. It is well known that delaying the prayer beyond its time with no excuse is a major sin, and it is narrated from a number of scholars that the one who does that deliberately is a kaafir, so we must be very careful. \nThis has to do with the game itself. But if there are tournaments on which money is spent and people are distracted by them, and waste time because of them, and they provoke factionalism and both Muslims and kaafirs, righteous and evildoers are glorified to the extent that a player becomes a role model for one’s sons and daughters, then this definitely should not be allowed, because among the ummah there are enough calamities, ignorance and backwardness to distract them from games on which millions of the people’s wealth are spent. \nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The basic principle concerning such games and sports is that they are permissible if they serve an innocent purpose, as was referred to by Ibn al-Qayyim in his book al-Faroosiyyah and as was mentioned by Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen Ibn Taymiyah and others. If that is done as training for jihad and attack and retreat, or for physical fitness, or to ward off chronic diseases and strengthen the spirit, then it comes under the heading of permissible things, if the one who does it has a sound intention. In all cases it is essential that there be no harm caused to bodies or minds, and that it does not lead to the grudges and hatred that usually occur between players, and that it does not distract them from things that are more important, and that it does not prevent them from remembrance of Allaah (dhikr) or prayer. \nBut whoever thinks about these sports as they are played nowadays will find that they are involve evil things which dictate that they should be disallowed, in addition to the fact that it is in the nature of the game to create factionalism and stir up resentment and hatred between the victors and the losers, this team and that team, as is quite apparent. They are also accompanied by physical danger for the players as the result of collisions and fisticuffs. Games hardly ever end without one of them breaking a bone or being injured or losing consciousness. This is why ambulances are always present. \nThe games also continue during the times of prayer, which results in people not praying or offering the prayer late. \nThe players also uncover their ‘awrah, which is forbidden. The man’s ‘awrah is the area from the navel to the knee. But you will find that their clothes end at mid-thigh, and some of them are shorter than that. It is well known that the thigh is part of the ‘awrah because of the hadeeth: “Cover your thigh for the thigh is part of the ‘awrah.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2797) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to ‘Ali: “Do not uncover your thigh and do not look at the thigh of anyone, living or dead.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (4015). And Allaah knows best. \nEnd quote from Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, vol. 8, question no. 1948. \nAnd he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nPlaying football nowadays is accompanied by reprehensible things which mean that playing it should be disallowed. These things may be summed up as follows: \n1 – It is proven to us that play continues during the times of prayer, which results in the players and spectators missing prayers or prayers in congregation, or they delay performing prayers until the time for them is over. Undoubtedly any action that interferes with performance of prayers on time or leads to missing prayers in congregation with no valid shar’i excuse is haraam.  \n2 – The nature of this game leads to factionalism, stirring up fitnah and hatred. These results are the opposite of what Islam promotes of tolerance, friendship and brotherhood, and cleaning hearts and souls of hatred, resentment and grudges.  \n3 – The game involves physical danger for the players as a result of collisions and injuries. Usually the players do not end the game without some of them falling on the pitch unconscious or with broken arms or legs. Nothing is more indicative of that than the fact that there must always be an ambulance present throughout the game.  \n4 – The purpose behind allowing sports is to make people become physically active and to train them for fighting and to ward off chronic disease. But playing football nowadays has no such aim. As well as the things mentioned above, it is now also taking people’s money for false purposes, let alone the danger of physical injury and the generation of hatred in the hearts of players and spectators, and the stirring up of fitnah. It has even gone so far that some spectators attack some players, which could go as far as murder, as happened in a match a few months ago. This alone is sufficient reason to disallow it. And Allaah is the source of strength. End quote.  \nHe also said: \nIf it is done in an organized manner [as in the clubs] it seems that it should be banned altogether, because people becomes deeply involved in it and that prevents people from remembering Allaah, and it more akin to gambling. They call it “sport” but it is just a game, and matters of jihad are not like this, and even if the players have some agility and nimbleness, they are not able to strive hard in any other field. \nIt also involves other things. Some of them offer prizes for it, and this is gambling. Islam does not allow prizes for anything except competitions which support the religion and strengthen one for that. If it strengthens Islam then it is permissible to engage in competitions. In the hadeeth it says: “There should be no (money) prizes for competitions except archery competitions and races with camels and horses.” And this applies by analogy with these three to anything that supports Islam. End quote. Question no. 1950. \nHe also said: As for one or two people playing with a ball in an unorganized fashion, there is nothing wrong with that, because it does not involve anything haraam. And Allaah knows best. End quote. Question no. 1949. \n Secondly: \nHaving established this, we do not advise you to marry this soccer player unless he gives it up, whether he is playing for a local club or a foreign one, especially since that will result in your moving to live with him in a kaafir country where there is the risk of temptation for oneself or one’s children, and it is difficult for a person to maintain his religious commitment in the environment of that game and in a kaafir country. \nYou may also refer to question no. 13363 for more information on living in the land of the mushrikeen. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "When considering the question of marrying a man who plays soccer (football), it is important to approach this matter from an Islamic perspective, addressing both the nature of the sport and the characteristic moral values of the individuals involved.\n\n### 1. **Nature of the Sport**\nPlaying soccer in itself is not inherently objectionable in Islam. The sport can promote physical fitness, teamwork, and enjoyment in a healthy and respectful manner. However, it is essential that engagement in sports does not lead to behavior that contravenes Islamic principles, such as gambling (which can sometimes be associated with sporting events), immodesty, or neglecting religious obligations.\n\n### 2. **Marital Considerations**\nAccording to the Quran, one of the fundamental principles for a valid marriage is that both partners should share the Islamic faith. The relevant verses emphasize marrying those who are believers:\n\n- **Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:10-12)** states that believing women should not be returned to unbelievers, emphasizing the importance of marrying within the faith: \n    - \"O believers, when believing women come over to you as refugees, then examine them. God alone is cognizant of their faith... and infidels are not lawful for believing women.\"\n  \n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:25)** states, \"If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman (let him marry) a maid who is a believer... God wishes to make it clear to you and guide you through the example of earlier people.\" This highlights the importance of faith in potential partners.\n\n### 3. **Character and Conduct**\nIn addition to faith, it is also vital to assess the character and conduct of the potential spouse. Playing soccer, if done respectfully and within Islamic guidelines, should not affect one's character negatively. There are numerous verses in the Quran encouraging good character and actions:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49-53)** emphasizes good conduct in marriage: \n    - \"O you who believe, when you marry believing women, then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the waiting period of them.\"\n\n### 4. **Social and Community Aspects**\nMarrying someone who is socially active, such as being involved in sports, can be beneficial for a relationship, as it may lead to a strong community connection:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:237)** advises on presenting oneself properly and maintaining a good relationship, stating: \"There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself… but do not forget to be good to each other...\"\n\n### 5. **Final Thoughts**\nIn conclusion, marrying a man who plays soccer is permissible in Islam as long as he adheres to Islamic values, respects his duties as a believer, and engages in the sport in a manner that is respectful and does not violate Islamic principles. It would be essential to evaluate his character, commitment to faith, and how well he aligns with your values as a potential partner.\n\n### References\n- **Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:10-12)**\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:25)**\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49-53)**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:237)** \n\nThese references provide a foundation for understanding the requirements and considerations in forming a marriage according to Islamic teachings."

        "question": "Ruling on marrying a sufi woman",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nSufis are of \n    various kinds with various schools of thought, most of which follow \n    innovation and deviant ways of various kinds. Some of them exceed the proper \n    bounds to the extent of associating others with Allaah, may He be exalted, \n    such as praying to the dead, turning to them to relieve distress and ward \n    off calamity. Some of them follow a great deal of innovation in their deeds, \n    in dhikr and in worship. See question no.\n    4983 for more \n    information on some of the deviations of the Sufis, and question no.\n    34817 for \n    information on shirk and its types. \nIt says in\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: Most of those who are called Sufis \n    nowadays follow innovations of shirk, as well as other innovations, such as \n    what some of them say, “Madad ya sayyid (Help, O Master)”and their \n    calling upon the aqtaab (highest ranking awliya’ or “saints”), reciting \n    dhikr in unison and calling upon Allaah by names that He has not called \n    Himself, such as “Huwa Huwa (He, He)” and “Ah, ah (a \n    contraction of the name of Allaah)”. Anyone who reads their books will \n    notice a lot of their innovations of shirk as well as other evils. End \n    quote. \nSecondly: \nMarriage to \n    a Sufi woman is subject to further discussion. \n1 – If she \n    is one of those who commits shirk in belief or in deeds, such as one who \n    believes that the awliya’ (“saints”) have knowledge of the unseen and have \n    control over the universe, or she believes in incarnation of the divine or \n    the unity of all things, or she devotes worship to something other than \n    Allaah, such as du’aa’, seeking help, sacrifices or vows, then it is not \n    permissible to marry such a woman, because she has committed major shirk – \n    Allaah forbid.\n2 – If she \n    has not fallen into shirk, but she does some acts of innovation such as \n    celebrating the Mawlid (Prophet’s birthday) or invented forms of dhikr, or \n    reciting a certain number of dhikrs for which there is no basis, or a \n    certain manner of dhikr that is not proven in sharee’ah, then it is better \n    not to marry such a woman, because the danger of innovation is great, and \n    the harm caused by it is severe. It is dearer to Iblees than sin, because \n    one may repent from sin, unlike innovation, for the one who does it regards \n    it as part of religion by means of which he may draw closer to Allaah, so \n    how can he give it up? Moreover, marriage to a woman who follows bid’ah \n    presents a danger to the children and to the whole family, especially if the \n    woman speaks well or is of a good attitude, so that others may be deceived \n    by her. Imam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Do not marry the \n    people of innovation, or give your womenfolk to them in marriage, or greet \n    them with salaam… al-Mudawwanah (1/84). \nThirdly: \nIf he did \n    not know that the woman was a follower of Sufism until he married her, then \n    if she is of the first type that commits shirk in word and deed and belief, \n    he should call her (to the proper way) and advise her and explain to her. If \n    she responds, then praise be to Allaah, otherwise it is obligatory to \n    separate from her, because it is not permissible to marry a mushrik woman or \n    to remain in such a marriage, because Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \n“And do \n    not marry Al-Mushrikaat (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allaah \n    Alone)”\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:221]\nBut if she \n    is of the second type, which does some innovated actions that do not reach \n    the extent of kufr, then each case should be examined separately – to what \n    extent does the woman adhere or not to the innovation that she believes in, \n    and what effect will that have on the household and the children? \nHe should \n    also look at the consequences of divorcing her, and he should do that which \n    is in the best interests of Islam in each case, and which will ward off harm \n    or reduce it as much as possible. \nMay Allaah \n    help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Ruling on Marrying a Sufi Woman in Islam\n\n**Overview:** \n\nIn Islam, the permissibility of marrying a woman, including a Sufi woman, hinges primarily on her faith and adherence to the core tenets of Islam. Sufism is often understood as a mystical dimension of Islam that emphasizes inward spirituality and personal connection to God. The general ruling on marriage in Islam applies to Sufi women as long as they adhere to Islamic beliefs and practices.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n1. **Faith (Iman):** \n   The Quran highlights the importance of faith in determining marital relationships. Believing women—those who affirm the oneness of God and adhere to Islamic principles—are lawful for Muslim men. \n\n   - **Quranic Verses:**\n     - *\"They are not lawful for them, nor are infidels lawful for believing women.\"* (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:10)\n     - *“If you find that they are believers, do not send them back to unbelievers.”* (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:10)\n\n2. **Marriage and Dowry:**\n   The Quran stipulates that if a Muslim man wishes to marry a believing woman, he must provide her with a dowry (mahr) and treat her honorably. This is applicable regardless of whether she identifies as Sufi or follows another Islamic tradition, provided she is a believer.\n\n   - **Quranic Verses:**\n     - *“There is no sin if you marry them provided you give their dowers to them.”* (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:10)\n     - *“Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery.”* (Surah An-Nisa, 4:24)\n\n3. **Interaction with Non-Believers:**\n   The Quran advises Muslims to be cautious in alliances with non-believers, but it also encourages justice and kindness towards those who do not fight against their faith.\n\n   - **Quranic Verses:**\n     - *“God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you.”* (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:8)\n\n4. **Qualities of Spouses:**\n   The verses emphasize seeking spouses who are righteous and uphold the tenets of Islam. Sufism, with its focus on inner purity and devotion, aligns with these ideals as long as the Sufi individual maintains core Islamic beliefs.\n\n5. **Community Acceptance:**\n   Cultural context and community norms may also play a role in the acceptance of marrying a Sufi woman. It is advisable to consider the perspectives of one's family and community, as marriage often involves broader social dynamics.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nMarrying a Sufi woman is permissible in Islam, provided that she is a believer and adheres to the fundamental principles of Islam. Respectful treatment and provision of a dowry are important aspects of this union. The emphasis should be on the woman’s faith and character rather than strictly her Sufi practices, provided they align with the broader teachings of Islam. \n\n**References to the Quran:**\n- Surah Al-Mumtahanah, Ayah 10-13\n- Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 24-28 \n- Surah Al-Mumtahanah, Ayah 8-9\n\nIn summary, the essential factor is the faith of the woman and her adherence to Islamic teachings, rather than the specific Sufi practices she might follow."

        "question": "She claims that she was divorced by her husband. Is it permissible to arrange her marriage without any proof of that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIf the woman \n    says that she was married then she got divorced and her ‘iddah ended, should \n    her word be accepted or is it essential to have proof to confirm that she is \n    divorced? There is a difference of opinion among the scholars concerning \n    that. \nSome of them \n    say that her word should be accepted and she should be believed, because she \n    is responsible for herself.  \nOthers say \n    that if it is thought most likely that she is telling the truth, it is \n    permissible to believe her. \nOthers make \n    a distinction between one who is a stranger and one who is living in her own \n    city. The word of the former should be accepted ,whereas the one who is in \n    her own city should not get married until proof of her divorce is brought. \nSome of them \n    make a distinction between her telling of her divorce from a specific \n    husband, such as saying, “So and so married me then he divorced me” and her \n    speaking of marriage to an unspecified person. In the former case it is \n    essential to bring proof that she has been divorced by him. \nThere \n    follows a brief look at the comments of the fuqaha’: \nIt says in\n    al-Mabsoot (5/151): If she says: My husband divorced me or died, and \n    my ‘iddah has ended, it is permissible for her fiancé to marry her and \n    believe her, because the issue of halaal and haraam is something that is \n    determined by sharee’ah and every Muslim is responsible for himself and his \n    words may be accepted with regard to issues that are decided by sharee’ah, \n    but his word is not to be accepted with regard to someone else if the other \n    person says that he is lying. Hence it is permissible to accept her word \n    concerning that. And Allaah knows best what is correct. End quote. \nIt says in\n    al-Habr al-Raa’iq (4/64): He indicated that the word of a divorced \n    woman may be accepted when he said: If a (previously) married woman said to \n    another man: My husband divorced me and my ‘iddah has ended, then it is \n    permissible for him to believe her if he thinks it most likely that she is \n    telling the truth. End quote. \n‘Aleesh \n    al-Maaliki (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked, as it says in Fath \n    al-‘Aliy al-Maalik fi’l-Fatwa ‘ala Madhhab al-Imam Maalik (2/78): What \n    is your opinion about a woman who came from Fayyoom to al-Qalyoobiyyah and \n    says: I was married in al-Fayoom, and my husband divorced me two months ago, \n    and she has a document confirming a divorce, dated and sealed with the seal \n    of the qaadi in the city where she used to be, and she wants to get married \n    after her ‘iddah ends based on the date of the document. May she be allowed \n    to do that? Please answer.  \nThe answer \n    was: Praise be to Allaah and peace and blessings be upon our Master \n    Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah. Yes, she may be allowed to do that \n    because she is to be believed in her claim to be divorced and her claim that \n    the ‘iddah has ended in the manner described, especially since her claim is \n    supported by the document from the qaadi. This is what is indicated by the \n    texts. But further proof should be established because of what we see \n    nowadays of many women cheating and having several husbands at once. We ask \n    Allaah to keep us safe and sound. End quote. \nAl-Zarkashi \n    said in al-Manthoor fi’l-Qawaa’id (1/171): If she says: My husband So \n    and so divorced me and my ‘iddah is over, and she asks the judge to conduct \n    a marriage for her, in Adab al-Qadaa’ by al-Dubayli it says: If she \n    is a stranger and her (former) husband is absent, then her word should be \n    accepted with no proof or oath. If the husband is in the same city and she \n    is not a stranger, then the judge should not conduct a new marriage until \n    her claim has been proven. \nIn Fasl \n    al-Tahleel, al-Raafa’i said that her word should be accepted if it is \n    plausible, and he quoted from Fataawa al-Baghawi: If a man and a woman \n    appear before the qaadi, and she asks him to marry her to this man, and says \n    that she was the wife of So and so but he divorced her or died, the qaadi \n    should not proceed with the marriage until proof of the divorce or death has \n    been established, because she has admitted to being married to So and so. \n    End quote. \nAl-Ramli \n    al-Shaafa’i was asked about a woman who said that her husband So and so \n    divorced her or died, and her ‘iddah has ended; can the judge conduct her \n    marriage without any proof? He replied that the judge cannot conduct her \n    marriage until proof of what she says has been established, because she \n    admitted to being married and marriage in principle is still valid (unless \n    there is evidence to the contrary). This is unlike the case if she admits \n    having been married without specifying a person.  This is what is indicated \n    by what al-Dubayli said in Adab al-Qadaa’, [and he quoted the words of \n    al-Zarkashi mentioned above], and what al-Qaadi mentioned in his fatwa that \n    if the woman claims that her husband has died or has divorced her in front \n    of her wali, and the wali denies it, she may swear an oath and the judge may \n    tell him to arrange her marriage, or the judge may arrange her marriage. \n    (3/161). \nHe also said \n    (3/153): To conclude: if a woman claims that she is divorced from a specific \n    marriage, the judge should not let her remarry until it has been proven. If \n    the marriage is not specified then he may accept her word, and there are \n    other views on this issue. End quote. \nIt seems \n    that caution is required in this matter, especially at times of corruption \n    and when there have been many incidents in which marriage contracts have \n    turned out to have been done for women who are already married and are \n    lying. But the judge still has the right to make the decision in such cases. \n    If he thinks that her word is acceptable, he may arrange her marriage, and \n    if he thinks otherwise he should ask her for proof, or he does not think \n    that she is telling the truth, he should not conduct her marriage until the \n    divorce has been proven. \nWhat is done \n    now is that the qaadi or registrar does not conduct the marriage of a woman \n    who is proven to have been married before and claims that she is divorced, \n    until she brings proof of the divorce. We do not know how the marriage \n    contract with the man mentioned was done. \nSecondly: \nIf there is \n    some doubt as to whether the woman is divorced or if she is still married to \n    her first husband, then the sons of the person in question should strive to \n    ask about her and her first husband. If it is proven that she was not \n    divorced from her first husband, then their father must be told about that \n    and the couple must be separated until her ‘iddah from both is over. The \n    matter should be referred to the qaadi to decide on the matter, and it is \n    not permissible for them to be quiet if they know about that, because \n    marriage to a woman who is already married to someone else before she gets \n    divorced and completes her ‘iddah is an invalid marriage, and the one who \n    does that is committing zina if he knew the real situation. \nBut here we \n    should point out two things: \n1 – The \n    children should respect their father and recognize his status and not offend \n    him by speaking of this matter. If we assume that they found out something \n    reprehensible, they should look for a suitable means of advising their \n    father, and if they ask someone else to intervene that is better, so to \n    avoid offending him and to preserve the love that exists between them. \n2 – The \n    motive for this doubt and accusing should not be hatred of their father’s \n    wife because she is a foreigner or because their father married her when he \n    was old, or for some other reason that is not hidden from the Knower of the \n    unseen, may He be glorified. Let them speak good words and beware of \n    accusing one who is innocent; they should try to think in positive terms and \n    refrain from saying anything that may hurt them or their father, so long as \n    there is nothing that they cannot keep silent about. \nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever intercedes \n    to prevent one of the hadd punishments of Allaah has opposed Allaah in His \n    command; and whoever dies owing a debt, it is not (going to be settled by) \n    dinars and dirhams, but rather by good and bad deeds; and whoever argues \n    about falsehood knowingly will remain subject to the wrath of Allaah until \n    he gives it up; and whoever says something about a believer that is not \n    true, Allaah will cause him to dwell in the mud of the juice of the people \n    of Hell  until he recants what he said.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (5129) from \n    the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him).  Classed as \n    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. \nMay Allaah \n    help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, determining a woman's eligibility for remarriage after divorce involves understanding the specific conditions surrounding her divorce. The Quran provides guidance in various verses regarding the process of divorce and the waiting period ('iddah) that a woman must observe after being divorced.\n\n### Divorce and Waiting Period\n\n1. **Divorce Process**: According to **Surah Al-Talaq (65:1)**, when a husband wishes to divorce his wife, he is instructed to do so during her waiting period. The verse states: \n   > “O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them at their appointed period, and calculate that period, and fear God, your Lord...” (Quran 65:1). \n\n   This establishes the importance of a structured approach toward divorce, which includes a waiting period to ascertain the woman's status.\n\n2. **Waiting Period**: The waiting period for a divorced woman is elaborated in **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:228)**:\n   > “When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honourably or let them go with honour...” (Quran 2:228).\n\n   This indicates that once the waiting period is complete, the woman is free to remarry.\n\n3. **Witnesses and Evidence**: **Surah Al-Talaq (65:2)** emphasizes the necessity of having witnesses during the divorce process: \n   > “But have two witnesses from among you, and give truthful evidence for (being acceptable to) God...” (Quran 65:2).\n\n   Thus, for a divorce to be valid in Islam, there should be proper documentation or acknowledgment, ideally with witnesses, to support the claim.\n\n### Implications of a Claim of Divorce\n\nIf a woman claims her husband has divorced her but there is no proof (such as witnesses or other corroborative evidence), the fundamental principles of Islam would generally imply that she cannot assume she is divorced without credible evidence. \n\n- **Authenticity of Divorce**: **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:230)** states that if a man divorces his wife three times, she becomes unlawful for him unless she marries another man:\n   > “If a man divorces her again (a third time), she becomes unlawful for him until she has married another man...” (Quran 2:230).\n\n   This verse reinforces the seriousness of the divorce process and implies that any claim of divorce should be backed by some form of verification.\n\n- **Remarriage**: If the woman does not have proof of divorce and expresses uncertainty, as elaborated in **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:234)**, the norms regarding remarriage would apply:\n   > “When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably...” (Quran 2:234).\n\n### Conclusion \n\nGiven this guidance from the Quran, if a woman claims she has been divorced without any proof, it is not permissible in Islam to arrange her marriage without substantiating her claim. Evidence or witnesses are essential to validate the divorce, and without them, her status as a married or divorced woman remains in question. The principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability in marital relations are emphasized throughout these Quranic verses.\n\nThis comprehensive understanding enables both individuals and community leaders to navigate complicated matters of marital status while adhering to Islamic teachings."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIf a man is \n    able to provide the mahr (dowry) and can afford the expenses of marriage and \n    the maintenance of his wife and household, then he is compatible with her, \n    according to the majority of scholars, both those who regard wealth as a \n    condition of compatibility, such as the Hanafis and Hanbalis, and those who \n    do not, such as the Maalikis and the Shaafa’is according to the more correct \n    view among them. \nAs for the \n    view that the husband must be rich on the same level as the wife, this is a \n    less correct view that was held by some of the fuqaha’. \nBut the \n    correct view, based on the evidence, is that compatibility does not matter \n    except with regard to religious commitment, as is the view of Maalik (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said: Chapter on the ruling of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) on compatibility in marriage. Allaah, may He be exalted, \n    says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O \n    mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into \n    nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most \n    honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At‑Taqwa [i.e. he \n    is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]”\n\n    [al-Hujuraat 49:13]\n“The \n    believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic religion)”\n\n    [al-Hujuraat 49:10]\n“The \n    believers, men and women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, supporters, friends, \n    protectors) of one another”\n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:71]\nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no \n    superiority of an Arab over a non-Arab, or of a non-Arab over an Arab, or of \n    a white man over a black man, or of a black man over a white man, except in \n    terms of taqwa. The people are from Adam, and Adam is from dust.” Narrated \n    by al-Tirmidhi (3270); classed as hasan by al-Albaani. \nIn \n    al-Tirmidhi (1085) it is narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose religious \n    commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your female relative \n    under your care) to him, for if you do not do that there will be tribulation \n    in the land and great mischief.” They said: O Messenger of Allaah, even if \n    he is such and such? He said: “If there comes to you one with whose \n    religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your female \n    relative under your care) to him,” three times. Classed as hasan by \n    al-Albaani. \nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Banu Bayaadah: \n    “Give (your female relative) to Abu Hind in marriage and ask for his \n    daughters in marriage” and he was a cupper. \nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married Zaynab bint Jahsh \n    al-Qurashiyyah to his freed slave Zayd ibn Haarithah, and he married \n    Faatimah bint Qays al-Fahriyyah al-Qurashiyyah to Usaamah, the son of Zayd, \n    and he married Bilaal ibn Rabaah to the sister of ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf. \nAllaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Good \n    statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people \n    for good statements (or good men for good women)”\n[al-Noor \n    24:26] \n“then \n    marry (other) women of your choice”\n[al-Nisa’ \n    4:3]\nWhat is \n    implied by the ruling of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) is that attention should be paid to compatibility in religious \n    commitment first and foremost. So a Muslim woman should not be given in \n    marriage to a kaafir, or a chaste woman to an immoral man. The Qur’aan and \n    Sunnah do not pay attention to any compatibility beyond that. It is haraam \n    for a Muslim woman to marry an evil adulterer. No attention is paid to \n    lineage, profession, wealth, or whether the man is free or a slave. It is \n    permissible for a lowly slave to marry a free woman of noble birth, if he is \n    chaste and Muslim. And it is permissible for a non-Qurashi to marry a \n    Qurashi woman, and for a non-Haashimi to marry a Haashimi woman, and for \n    poor men to marry rich women. \nAnd he said: \n    The fuqaha’ differed as to the definition of compatibility. Maalik said, \n    according to the apparent view of his madhhab, that it refers to religious \n    commitment. According to a report narrated from him: It means three things: \n    Being similar in terms of religious commitment; both being slaves or both \n    being free; and compatibility with regard to physical soundness. End quote \n    from Zaad al-Ma’aad (5/144). See also al-Mughni (7/27) and \n    al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (34/271). \nSecondly: \nSocial level \n    may refer to lineage, wealth, education, profession or job, or it may mean \n    all of them. \nIf a man’s \n    religious commitment and character are pleasing, then he is compatible with \n    the woman, no matter what her social level, according to the more correct \n    view, as noted above. This is the basic principle and the ruling of \n    sharee’ah. But it remains to examine the situation of each suitor and \n    whether he is suitable to marry one whose social level is above him, or \n    not. \nIt seems – \n    and Allaah knows best – that if the difference is great in terms of lineage, \n    wealth, education and profession, that it is not advisable to go ahead with \n    this marriage, because there are usually problems from the woman or her \n    family. There may be differences in lifestyle and the ways in which they do \n    things, which may put the spouses off one another. \nBut if the \n    difference is small, or it has to do with one area but can be made up for in \n    another area, then there is nothing wrong with it in that case, such as if \n    the husband is poor but he is highly qualified, or he is qualified for a \n    decent job, or some of his family are of high standing and so on. \nThen there \n    are cases in which the woman and her family are so righteous that they are \n    above looking at material concerns and measuring people thereby, and they \n    may want to choose a husband who is poor because of his righteousness and so \n    on. But it is better if the husband is the one who is of a higher status.   \nWhatever the \n    case, the precise advice in each case depends on complete knowledge of both \n    parties and their families. Perhaps you can seek advice from someone whom \n    you trust in your community. \nWe ask \n    Allaah to help you and guide you. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, when it comes to the question of whether an individual should marry someone who is above them in terms of social status, there are several important factors to consider. Here’s a thorough exploration of this topic, supported by relevant verses from the Quran.\n\n### 1. **Understanding the Importance of Faith and Character Over Social Status**\nIslam places greater emphasis on a person’s faith (iman) and character (akhlaq) than on their social standing. In Surah Al-Hujurat (49:13), it is stated:\n\n**\"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.\"**  \n(Surah Al-Hujurat, Ayah 13)\n\nThis verse indicates that the value of a person in the eyes of Allah is determined by their piety and good actions, rather than their social or economic status. \n\n### 2. **Marrying for the Right Reasons**\nIn Surah An-Nisa (4:24-25), it emphasizes observing the rights of women and marrying with the intention of commitment rather than for debauchery:\n\n**\"Also forbidden are married women unless they are captives of war. Such is the decree of Allah. Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery. Then give those of these women you have enjoyed the agreed dower...\"**  \n(Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 24-25)\n\nThis implies that relationships should be founded on respect and mutual consent rather than on calculations of social status.\n\n### 3. **Considering Marital Compatibility**\nSurah An-Nisa (4:3) also addresses the importance of being equitable in marriage and the ability to provide for one's spouse:\n\n**\"If you fear you cannot be equitable to orphan girls (in your charge), then marry women who are lawful for you, two, three, or four; but if you fear you cannot treat so many with equity, then marry only one.\"**  \n(Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 3)\n\nThis verse suggests that the ability to maintain a balanced and fair relationship is crucial, which goes beyond social standing. \n\n### 4. **Community and Family Considerations**\nWhen marrying, community and family perspectives should also be acknowledged. The emphasis on marrying with the consent of families is highlighted in Surah An-Nisa (4:25):\n\n**\"So marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry.\"**  \n(Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 25)\n\nIt's essential that any union has the backing of both families to ensure harmony and mutual respect.\n\n### 5. **Avoiding Envy and Comparison**\nSurah An-Nisa (4:32) warns against coveting what others possess:\n\n**\"And do not covet what Allah has favored some of you over others...\"**  \n(Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 32)\n\nThis principle can be interpreted in a marital context as a reminder to avoid jealousy or feelings of inferiority or superiority based on socio-economic standings.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn Islam, the decision to marry someone of higher social status should not be the sole consideration. Instead, one should prioritize faith, character, and compatibility. Marriage is seen as a sacred bond, and it is essential to focus on spiritual and personal attributes rather than merely social or economic ones. Ultimately, mutual respect, consent, and the intention of building a family based on love and care should guide any marital decision.\n\nIn essence, one may marry someone of a higher social standing, but the more critical factors are shared values, mutual respect, and a process that honors the teachings of Islam regarding marriage."

        "question": "Is he obliged to attend the waleemah when there is someone there who will offend him with his words and actions?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIf the \n    waleemah is for a wedding, then it is obligatory to attend it, for the one \n    who is invited personally, according to the majority of fuqaha’. \nBut if the \n    invitation is general, and he is not invited by name, then he does not have \n    to attend. \nIbn Qudaamah \n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: There is no \n    difference of opinion among the scholars concerning the fact that it is \n    obligatory to attend a waleemah for the one who is invited to it, so long as \n    there is no idle entertainment in it. This is the view of Maalik, \n    al-Shaafa’i and Abu Haneefah. \nIt was \n    narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger \n    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If one of \n    you is invited to a waleemah, let him attend.” According to another version: \n    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: “Accept this invitation when you are invited.” Abu Hurayrah said: “The \n    worst of food is the food of a waleemah to which the rich are invited and \n    the poor are ignored. Whoever does not attend has disobeyed Allaah and His \n    Messenger.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. \nWhat is \n    meant – and Allaah knows best – by the words “the worst of food is the food \n    of a waleemah” is the food of a feast to which the rich are invited and the \n    poor are ignored. It dos not mean that the food of any waleemah is the worst \n    of food. \nBut it is \n    only obligatory to attend for one who is invited specifically, when a man or \n    a group is invited by name. But if someone issues an invitation and says, “O \n    people, come to the waleemah,” it is not obligatory to respond, and it is \n    not mustahabb to do so. Rather it is permissible to accept because one is \n    included in the general invitation. End quote from al-Mughni \n    (7/213). \nSecondly: \nIf there are \n    people at the waleemah who will cause offence, it is not obligatory to \n    attend. This is an excuse not to attend. \nThis was \n    stated by some of the fuqaha’. In that case he has to apologize to the one \n    who gave the invitation, or attend for a short while and leave quickly. \nIt says in\n    Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (7/430), where the conditions of it being \n    obligatory to accept an invitation are mentioned: There should not be in the \n    place where he is to attend anyone who will offend the invited one by means \n    of outward hostility or destructive envy (hasad), or anyone with whom it is \n    not appropriate to sit, such as vile and despicable people. End quote. \nThirdly: \nIf the \n    waleemah is not for a wedding, it is not obligatory to attend, even if one \n    is especially invited to it. \nIbn Qudaamah \n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/218): The ruling \n    on accepting invitations to circumcision waleemahs and all other invitations \n    except to weddings, is that it is mustahabb, because it involves offering \n    food to people. But accepting the invitation is mustahabb, not waajib \n    (obligatory). This is the view of Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, and Abu Haneefah and \n    his companions. End quote. \nBased on \n    this, there is no sin on you if you do not attend these waleemahs, if they \n    are not for weddings. \nFourthly: \nFor a woman \n    to uphold ties of kinship with her brothers and sisters is something that is \n    confirmed in sharee’ah, because of the commands to uphold the ties of \n    kinship that are mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and the prohibition on \n    severing those ties. This upholding of family ties may be achieved through \n    visits, phone calls and asking after family members, depending on what one \n    is able to do. \nYou should \n    not fall short in this great act of worship, and not let your brothers’ \n    coldness and lack of kindness push you to do that. You will be rewarded for \n    upholding ties with them, even if they fall short towards you, because the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who \n    upholds the ties of kinship is not the one who reciprocates, rather the one \n    who upholds the ties of kinship is the one who upholds those ties even if \n    his relatives cut him off.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5645). \nThe one who \n    reciprocates his relatives, and returns favours and treats them well if they \n    treat him well, is not the one who is upholding ties of kinship as required \n    by sharee’ah. Rather the upholding of kinship ties that is required in \n    sharee’ah is that which involves treating relatives well even when they \n    treat you badly.  \nBut if \n    meeting often will cause annoyance, there is no sin in reducing the \n    frequency, whilst remaining in touch at infrequent intervals or by phone, \n    etc. \nBut it is \n    better to hasten to remove the misunderstanding between you and your \n    brothers, and try hard to improve your relationship with them. That is \n    better for all of you in this world and in the Hereafter. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, attending a waleemah (the marriage banquet) is highly encouraged, as it is a communal celebration and a way to support and honor the newlyweds. However, the obligation may become complicated if there is a concern about offending interactions, such as harsh words or ill actions from others present.\n\n### Verses to Consider\n\n1. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:53-57)**\n   This verse advises believers on the etiquettes concerning the interactions with the Prophet (peace be upon him) and highlights the importance of respecting the Prophet's household. It mentions that it is not appropriate to annoy or trouble the Prophet. This can be extrapolated to imply that any gathering where one is likely to be subjected to harm or disrespect is not conducive to a believer's wellbeing.\n   \n   > \"O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without awaiting the proper time, unless asked... There is no harm if they come before their fathers or their sons... But those who offend God and His Prophet will be damned in this world and the next.\" (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:53-57)\n\n2. **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:8-11)**\n   This passage speaks about the importance of engaging in discussions that promote goodness and piety, rather than those filled with iniquity and rebellion. If a person knows that the waleemah will consist of such negative interactions, this could influence their decision to attend.\n   \n   > \"O you who believe, when you converse privately, do not talk of iniquity, rebellion, and disobedience to the Prophet, but talk of goodness and piety, and fear God before whom you will be gathered.\" (Surah Al-Mujadila, 58:9)\n\n3. **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:13-17)**\n   These verses reinforce the idea that those who engage in scheming or negativity are acting against the community, and thus create an environment that could be harmful to faith. The discomfort caused by offensive words or actions can distract from the purpose of gathering to celebrate the union.\n   \n   > \"Have you not considered those who were forbidden to conspire, but reverted after a time to what was forbidden them... Hell is sufficient for them, in which they will be burnt.\" (Surah Al-Mujadila, 58:13)\n\n### Conclusion\nIn light of the above verses, attending a waleemah where one anticipates being offended is not an obligation and can be re-evaluated. Islam emphasizes the importance of maintaining good character, fostering positive relationships, and protecting oneself from harm—both mental and emotional.\n\nUltimately, if a believer knows that their presence in such a gathering will lead to conflict or emotional distress, they may rightfully choose to abstain from attending to preserve their wellbeing and faith. Additionally, engaging in prayer for guidance and seeking counsel from trusted scholars about specific situations can be beneficial."

        "question": "Is she sinning by attending wedding parties that involve reprehensible things if she sits far away and helps them with cooking etc?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    It is not permissible to attend wedding parties that include \n    reprehensible things such as singing accompanied by drums or other musical \n    instruments, apart from the daff, or mixing between men and women, or other \n    evils, except for one who is able to denounce that and thinks it most likely \n    that he will be able to put a stop to the evil by denouncing it. \n\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person \n    is invited to a waleemah in which there is sin, such as alcohol and musical \n    instruments, etc, and he can denounce it and put an end to the evil, then he \n    must attend and denounce it, because then he will be fulfilling two \n    obligations: accepting the invitation of his Muslim brother and putting a \n    stop to evil. But if he is unable to denounce it, then he should not attend. \n    If he does not know of the evil until he gets there, then he should put a \n    stop to it, and if he is not able to, then he should leave. Something \n    similar to this was said by al-Shaafa’i. End quote from al-Mughni, \n    7/214. \n\n    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: If the \n    wedding party is free of evils such as mixing between men and women, \n    promiscuous singing and so on, or if she attends she will be able to change \n    the evils, then it is permissible for her to attend in order to share in the \n    joy. Rather attendance is obligatory if there is some evil that she is able \n    to put a stop to. \n\n    But if the party involves evils that she cannot denounce, \n    then it is haraam for her to attend, because of the general meaning of the \n    verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And leave alone those who take their religion as play and \n    amusement, and whom the life of this world has deceived. But remind (them) \n    with it (the Qur’aan) lest a person be given up to destruction for that \n    which he has earned, when he will find for himself no protector or \n    intercessor besides Allaah”\n\n    [al-An’aam 6:70]  \n\n    “And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. \n    music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, \n    and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur’aan) by way of \n    mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell‑fire)”\n\n    [Luqmaan 31:6]\nAnd there are very many \n    ahaadeeth which condemn singing and musical instruments. End quote from \n    Fataawa al-Mar’ah, compiled by Muhammad al-Musnad, p. 92 \nSecondly: \nIf your going to the \n    wedding and taking part in the cooking etc will not result in your listening \n    to the evils, or approving of them or helping in them, such as if the place \n    where the evil actions are being committed is far away from you, or you will \n    be able to leave before they start the reprehensible actions, then there is \n    nothing wrong with your going in that case, but you should offer them advice \n    and explain to them the rulings on these evils, and tell them that it is \n    haraam to take part in them. \nIn his commentary on the \n    verse (interpretation of the meaning):  \n“And it has already \n    been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the \n    Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until \n    they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) \n    certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect \n    the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:140]\nal-Qurtubi (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: “then sit not with them, until they engage in a \n    talk other than that” means, talk other than kufr; “certainly in that \n    case you would be like them”. This indicates that it is obligatory to \n    avoid those who commit sin if they openly commit an evil action, because \n    whoever does not avoid them is approving of what they are doing, and \n    approving of kufr is itself kufr. Allaah says “certainly in that case you \n    would be like them”. So whoever sits in a gathering where sin is \n    committed and does not denounce it has a burden of sin just like them. \nThey should be denounced \n    if they speak of or do sinful things; if a person is not able to denounce \n    them, then he should get up and leave them, so that he will not be one of \n    those mentioned in this verse. End quote. \nAl-Sa’di (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said: \nThis also includes \n    attending gatherings where sin and immorality take place, where the commands \n    and prohibitions of Allaah are taken lightly and the limits that He has set \n    for His slaves are transgressed. It is forbidden to sit with them “until \n    they engage in a talk other than that”, i.e., other than disbelieving in \n    the verses of Allaah and mocking them. “certainly in that case” \n    means, if you sit with them in those circumstances, “you would be like \n    them” because you have approved of their kufr and mockery of Islam, and \n    the one who approves of a sin is like the one who does it. \nTo conclude, the one who \n    attends a gathering in which Allaah is disobeyed is obliged to denounce them \n    if he is able to, or to leave if he is not. End quote. \nTafseer al-Sa’di, \n    p. 217 \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question regarding whether a woman is sinning by attending wedding parties that involve reprehensible activities, even if she chooses to keep her distance and participate in cooking or similar tasks, requires an understanding of the permissible behaviors in Islam, as outlined in the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n### Key Considerations\n\n1. **Nature of the Activities**: In Islam, engaging in activities that contradict Islamic teachings is prohibited. These include any form of immorality, such as promiscuity, drinking alcohol, or gambling, which are explicitly mentioned in the Quran. In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:90-91), it states:\n\n   > \"O you who believe, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful. Satan only wishes to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So avoid it.\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:90-91)\n\n   This sets a clear boundary that any gathering that promotes such activities can lead a believer away from what is right.\n\n2. **The Influence on Personal Faith**: If attending these events leads a person to be tempted by the acts done at these gatherings or if it harms their faith, it is advisable to refrain from attending. Each person is accountable for their actions and their environments. \n\n3. **Helping with Cooking**: Helping with food preparation can be perceived differently based on the intent and context. If the assistance is purely administrative (for example, cooking) and one stays out of any illicit actions, it raises a question about the impact this may have on one’s spiritual state. \n\n4. **Seeking to Maintain Good Relationships**: Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:8) approaches the issue of interactions with non-believers and states:\n\n   > \"Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes... Allah loves those who are just.\" (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:8)\n\n   This implies a balance between maintaining social ties and adhering to one's guiding principles.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, attending wedding parties that may involve sinful activities, even with the intention of cooking and helping while keeping a distance from those activities, requires careful consideration. A woman should evaluate:\n\n- The nature of the event and the activities that will take place.\n- Her own susceptibility to participating or being influenced by sinful actions.\n- The importance of maintaining ties with family or community against the preservation of her own faith.\n\nAs the verse from Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:91) warns of the potential harm of engaging with sinful acts, it might be advisable for her to excuse herself from such gatherings if they involve significant wrongdoing. Ultimately, the decision should be weighed with one's spiritual wellbeing in mind, and consulting knowledgeable individuals or a trusted scholar can also provide clarity specific to her situation."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islam encourages us to have many children, and the Prophet of Allah Shu’ayb (peace be upon him) reminded (his people) of this blessing and said to them: “And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied you” [al-A’raaf 7:86]. And it was narrated from Ma’qil ibn Yasaar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the nations.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2050; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.

In this case it is permissible to be sterilized. \n2 – When there is no need for it. Undoubtedly in this case it is a criminal act and a major sin, because it is a transgression against the creation of Allah for no reason, and preventing the production of offspring which was encouraged by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and being ungrateful for the blessing of children which Allah bestows upon His creation. \nIt says in al-Insaaf: It says in al-Faa’iq: And it is not permissible to do anything that will put a stop to pregnancy. (1/383). \nThe Islamic Fiqh Council stated the following in its report no. 39 (1/5): \nIt is haraam to sterilize both men and women, if there is no necessary reason for doing so unless there is a necessity which is to be determined according to the guidelines set out by sharee’ah. It is permissible to take temporary measures to space pregnancies or prevent them for a limited period of time, if there is a legitimate shar’i need to do so, so long as this decision is made on the basis of mutual consultation and approval between the spouses. That is subject to the condition that no harm should result from that, and that the means should be acceptable according to sharee’ah, and that there should be no harm caused to an existing pregnancy. End quote. \nBased on this, if your preventing pregnancy is for a legitimate reason as outlined above, then you do not have to do anything. But if it was not for a necessary reason, then you have done something which is haraam, and you have to repent sincerely to Allah and stop taking these injections immediately. If there is anything that will reverse their effect without causing harm, then you must take it.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the ruling on infertility treatments such as injections to make someone infertile in Islam, it's important to consider certain principles derived from Islamic jurisprudence, as well as specific medical and ethical considerations.\n\n### General Ruling on Infertility and Birth Control\n\n1. **Intent and Purpose**: In Islam, the intention behind taking any form of contraception must be evaluated. If the purpose of making someone infertile is to prevent a hidden or harmful risk to the mother or the child, then it could be permissible. Islam holds the life of the mother in high regard. This aligns with the Quranic principle of safeguarding life and well-being.\n\n2. **Contraception**: Classical Islamic jurisprudence permits the use of contraception as a means of family planning, provided it does not cause harm. Scholars have debated the acceptability of permanent contraception methods based on context, such as the health of the mother, family circumstances, or societal factors. It is typically framed within the context of mutual agreement between spouses.\n\n### Relevant Quranic Principles\n\n- **Respect for Life**: The Quran emphasizes the importance of life. For instance, Allah says: \"And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely killing them is a great sin.\" (Surah Al-Isra, Ayah 31). This verse highlights the importance of protecting life and trusts in Allah's provision, but it also reflects the sanctity of motherhood and childhood.\n\n- **Long-term Planning vs. Detrimental Practices**: Methods that permanently hinder procreation could lead to ethical dilemmas, especially if they are seen as counter to the procreative purpose of marriage. However, there is an understanding in Islamic law that decisions may be made based on individual circumstances. The Surah Al-Baqarah verses remind us about God’s wisdom in all matters: \"God knows what you do not know.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 30).\n\n### Jurisprudential Views\n\n1. **Temporary vs. Permanent**: If the injections are reversible and the couple intends to conceive later, there is greater leniency for their use. The same principle applies if the couple wishes to wait due to various considerations such as financial stability or education.\n\n2. **Scholarly Consensus**: Different scholars may have varied opinions on the permissibility of permanent birth control, with some allowing it under specific circumstances (such as health risks), and others urging caution due to the fundamental Islamic view on procreation.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, the ruling on injections to make a person infertile depends on intentions, health reasons, and scholarly interpretation. If the decision is made with mutual consent, and particularly if there are significant health concerns, it may be permissible. However, permanent solutions may be met with caution and should involve consulting knowledgeable religious scholars to ensure alignment with Islamic principles and ethics. \n\nIt is always advisable for individuals considering such actions to engage their local religious authorities to seek guidance tailored to their specific situations."

        "question": "She wants to marry a man who has a contagious disease",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It states in sharee’ah that the Muslim should not expose \n    himself to harm. \n\n    That includes mixing with a person who has a contagious \n    disease, especially if that disease is serious and chronic, such as herpes. \n\n    The rulings of sharee’ah are addressed to everyone, sick and \n    healthy alike. \n\n    With regard to the one who is sick, Muslim (2221) narrated \n    from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The owner of \n    sick camels should not bring them to the healthy ones” – lest the disease be \n    transmitted to the healthy ones. \n\n    With regard to the one who is healthy, the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Flee from the leper as \n    you would flee from a lion.” Narrated by Ahmad, 9429; classed as saheeh by \n    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7530. \n\n    Leprosy is a well-known contagious disease – we ask Allaah to \n    keep us safe and sound. \n\n    Muslim (2231) narrated from ‘Amr ibn al-Shareed that his \n    father said: Among the delegation from Thaqeef there was a leper. The \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent word to him \n    saying: “We have accepted your oath of allegiance; go back.” \n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in \n    Miftaah Daar al-Sa’aadah (2/272): \nHe sent word to that \n    leper accepting his oath of allegiance so as to establish the shar’i \n    principle of avoiding the causes of harmful and hateful things, because a \n    person should not expose himself to the causes of harm. \n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zaad al-Ma’aad (4/147): \nChapter on the guidance \n    of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on avoiding \n    contagious diseases and his advice to healthy people to avoid those who have \n    such diseases.

There \n    is nothing to compare to good health. \n\n    Our advice to you is not to marry this person.\n\n    We ask Allaah to bless you with a righteous husband who will \n    help you in your religious affairs. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the question of marrying someone with a contagious disease involves various considerations, including the potential implications for health, family stability, and moral obligations. Marrying a person who has a contagious disease is not explicitly addressed in the Qur'an, but there are several verses that provide guidance on marriage and social interactions.\n\n### Considerations Regarding Marriage\n\n1. **Choosing a Spouse**: The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of marrying believers and those of good character. For instance, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221), Allah advises against marrying idolaters unless they accept the faith and highlights that a believing servant is preferable to an idolater, even if the latter may be more appealing:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:221**: \"Do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her.\"\n\n2. **Compassion and Understanding**: The verses also stress the importance of mutual understanding and compassion in relationships. For example, Surah Al-Anfal (8:61) encourages peace and reconciliation:\n   - **Surah Al-Anfal 8:61**: \"And if they incline to peace, then incline to it and rely upon Allah. Indeed, He is the Hearing and Knowing.\"\n\n3. **Health and Well-Being**: The Qur'an promotes the idea of caring for one another's well-being. Although it does not mention contagious diseases directly, the spirit of concern for health and safety is important. Islam encourages believers to take precautions:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:195**: \"And spend in the cause of Allah and do good; and whatever good you put forth for yourselves - you will find it with Allah.\"\n\n### Specific Situations\n\n1. **Marrying for Compatibility**: In Surah An-Nisa (4:25), it implies that if someone cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman, they can marry a maid who is a believer, indicating the importance of compatibility in faith and circumstances:\n   - **Surah An-Nisa 4:25**: \"If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman, let him marry a maid who is a believer.\"\n\n2. **Rights and Obligations**: Islam teaches the importance of fulfilling rights within marriage, such as providing for the spouse. In Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49), it mentions the need to honor and provide for wives:\n   - **Surah Al-Ahzab 33:49**: \"O you who believe, when you marry believing women, then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them...\"\n\n3. **Consultation and Mutual Consent**: The decision to marry, especially someone with a contagious disease, should involve consultation and mutual consent. This is supported by the general principles of fairness and compassion found in the Qur'an:\n   - **Surah An-Nisa 4:28**: \"God wishes to make clear to you and to guide you through the examples of earlier people...\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMarrying someone who has a contagious disease requires careful consideration of health implications, mutual consent, and adherence to Islamic principles of seeking partners with good character. No verses explicitly prohibit such a marriage; hence, the focus should be on the faith, character of the individual, and mutual understanding. It’s often advisable to seek counsel from knowledgeable individuals within the community or scholars to navigate such a complex and sensitive issue."

        "question": "He wants to get married but his parents want him to delay that",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It is narrated in al-Bukhaari (5065) and Muslim (3384) that \n    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to us: “O young men, whoever among you \n    can afford to get married, let him do so, for it is more effective in \n    lowering the gaze and preserving chastity. Whoever cannot afford it, let him \n    fast, for that will be a shield for him” – i.e., it will reduce and weaken \n    his desire. \n\n    Based on this, if a person can afford to get married then he \n    should hasten to do so, because of the many benefits that this brings, as \n    mentioned by the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \n    namely it helps him to lower his gaze and protect his chastity, increases \n    the numbers of the ummah and offers protection against temptation and \n    mischief. \n\n    Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “If I only \n    had ten days left to live and I knew that I was going to die on the last of \n    them, and I could afford to get married, I would get married, for fear of \n    fitnah (temptation).” \n\n    Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Celibacy has \n    nothing to do with Islam at all.” \n\n    If you fear hardship for yourself and that you may and fall \n    into sin, then in that case it is obligatory for you to get married. \n\n    In this case parents are advised to arrange their son’s \n    marriage and not to stand in the way of his remaining chaste and protecting \n    himself from temptation. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: “With regard to marriage, people fall into three \n    categories. Some of them fear that they may fall into sin if they do not get \n    married, in which case it is obligatory to marry, according to the view of \n    most of the fuqaha’, because this will make a person remain chaste and \n    protect him from committing haraam actions; the only way to do is to get \n    married.” \n\n    Al-Mughni, 9/341. \n\n    You have to deal gently and kindly with your parents and try \n    to convince them of your need to get married, and tell them that this will \n    never conflict with what they want for you in the future. You can also seek \n    the help of wise people among your relatives to convince your parents. \n\n    The questioner is to be commended for not going out to places \n    of fitnah (temptation) and not fulfilling his desires by haraam means. We \n    ask Allaah to make you steadfast and to help you to find a good wife who \n    will be a delight to you and your parents, for He is Ever-near and \n    Responsive.\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Answer: \n\nWhen it comes to marriage within an Islamic context, individual desires, familial expectations, and societal norms can sometimes create conflicting situations. If a young man wishes to get married but his parents desire for him to wait, it is essential to approach this scenario thoughtfully, considering both the legal and moral aspects within Islamic teachings.\n\n**1. The Importance of Marriage:**\nIslam places significant emphasis on the institution of marriage. It is often described as a holy contract, and there are numerous teachings that advocate for marriage as a means of fulfilling physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. For instance, in Surah An-Nur (24:32), Allah commands believers to marry off those among them who are single: \n\n>\"And marry those among you who are single, and those who are fit among your male and female servants. If they be poor, Allah will enrich them out of His bounty. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\" \n*(Surah An-Nur, 24:32)*\n\nThis verse illustrates the significance of marriage in Islam, encouraging it as a societal norm that promotes chastity and reduced temptation.\n\n**2. Respecting Parents' Wishes:**\nWhile marriage is a personal choice, Islam also emphasizes the importance of honoring and respecting one's parents. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"He who wishes to enter Paradise must please his parents.\" Thus, the desire to honor one’s parents is highly regarded and should be considered seriously. \n\nSurah Al-Isra (17:23) mentions:\n\n>\"And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment.\" \n*(Surah Al-Isra, 17:23)*\n\n**3. Finding a Balance:**\nIn situations where a young man feels pressured by parental wishes to delay marriage while he feels ready, it may be possible to find a middle ground. A respectful conversation with the parents, bringing forth his readiness to fulfill his religious and worldly obligations can be beneficial. Highlighting his intentions and seriousness in pursuing a spouse may help assuage their concerns.\n\n**4. Seeking a Suitable Partner:**\nThe Quran further mentions that marriages should be grounded in mutual respect and preference for piety over mere physical attraction. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221) advises against marrying those outside of the faith due to the potential for future conflicts in lifestyle and value systems:\n\n>\"And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe. And a female slave who believes is better than a free woman who is polytheistic, even though she might attract you. Those invite you to the Fire, but Allah invites to Paradise and forgiveness by His permission.\"\n*(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:221)*\n\n**5. Preparing for Marriage:**\nFurthermore, if the young man eventually receives permission to marry, he must prepare adequately for this new responsibility. This might entail demonstrating readiness—increased financial stability and maturity, which are often concerns for parents. In Surah An-Nisa (4:25), Allah emphasizes that believers should marry those who are fit and able, reinforcing the viewpoint that marriage is a commitment that should be approached with readiness:\n\n>\"And whoever among you cannot afford to marry free, believing women, then he may marry from those whom your right hands possess of believing slave girls. And Allah knows your faith; you are of one another. So marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due portion of marriage.\"\n*(Surah An-Nisa, 4:25)*\n\n### Conclusion:\nMarrying is an important step that comes with both rights and responsibilities in Islam. While it’s crucial to consider the desires and concerns of one's parents, balancing these with one’s own readiness and intention to marry is equally essential. Engaging in respectful dialogue with parents while striving to fulfill religious obligations is likely the best path forward. The overarching goal is to seek Allah’s guidance through prayer and consultation with knowledgeable individuals to align decisions with Islamic values."

        "question": "There is nothing wrong with a woman wearing a white wedding dress",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with a woman wearing a white wedding dress on condition that she does not appear in it in front of men who are not her mahrams, because usually wedding dresses are adorned and decorated, and we have already stated in the answer to question no.  39570 that one of the conditions of women’s hijab is that it should not be an adornment in and of itself. \nIt is also essential that this dress does not reveal any of the woman’s charms, even if she is only going to appear in front of women in it. See question no.  6569 and 34745. \nWith regard to it being the dress of kaafir women, that is not the case. Rather many Muslim women nowadays, if not most of them, wear this kind of dress. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: \nWhat is the ruling on a woman wearing white for her wedding as it is known that this is an imitation of the kuffaar? \nHe replied: \nIt is permissible for a woman to wear white so long as it is not in the same form as men’s clothing. With regard to it being an imitation of the kuffaar, that is no longer the case, because now all Muslim women wear such clothes when they are getting married. The ruling depends on whether the reason for it is present or not. If it is no longer an imitation of the kuffaar and this has now become something that is common to both Muslims and kaafirs, then the ruling no longer applies, unless something is haraam in and of itself and not because it is an imitation of others. Such things are haraam in all cases. \nMajmoo’at As’ilat tahumm al-Mar’ah, p. 92.",
        "predicted_answer": "Regarding the question of whether there is anything wrong with a woman wearing a white wedding dress in Islam, it is important to understand that the Qur'an does not prescribe specific colors or styles for wedding attire. Islamic teachings on clothing place an emphasis on modesty, propriety, and allowing personal choice within these guidelines.\n\n### Modesty and Clothing in Islam\nIslamic teachings regarding clothing emphasize modesty and decorum. The following verse from the Qur'an emphasizes the importance of modest dress for both men and women:\n\n- **Surah An-Nur (24:30-31)**: \"Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their modesty and not expose their adornment except that which [ordinarily] appears thereof and to draw their veils over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of private aspects of women. And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. And turn to Allah in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed.\" \n\nThis verse indicates the importance of modesty rather than a specified type of dress.\n\n### Cultural Practices\nThe choice of a white wedding dress is largely a cultural practice that is popular in various societies, including among Muslims. There is no specific prohibition in Islam against wearing a white dress for a wedding. The significance of color in clothing is often culturally derived, and many cultures within the Muslim world have adopted the white wedding dress tradition, associating it with purity and joy. \n\n### Personal Choice\nAdditionally, personal preference plays a significant role in deciding what to wear for a wedding. As long as the attire adheres to the principles of modesty and appropriateness—drawing upon Qur'anic teachings, as mentioned above—there is no issue with wearing a white wedding dress. Clothing is a matter of personal and cultural expression, and Islam allows flexibility within its framework of guidelines.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, Islam does not impose restrictions against wearing a white wedding dress, as long as the dress is modest and adheres to Islamic principles regarding appearance. The choice of color and style is largely influenced by cultural norms and personal preference, and there should be no worry regarding wearing a white dress for marriage. \n\nThus, based on the principles of modesty outlined in the Qur'an, and the cultural significance placed on the color white in many societies, a woman wearing a white wedding dress is not only permissible but can be seen as a beautiful expression of her celebration of marriage."

        "question": "Attending wedding parties which involve some evils",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.1 – It is not permissible to attend wedding parties that involve evil actions, such as singing that is accompanied by music or that includes indecent words. The fact that this is widespread among people does not mean that it is permissible and should not be denounced. \n2 – Not attending these parties is not regarded as severing the ties of kinship, rather it is protecting oneself from seeing or hearing evil. Your family and relatives should understand that you would be keen to attend and take part, were it not for the evil things that they do. \n3 – If a person who is invited to such an event knows that there will be evil things happening and that he is not able to denounce them, it is not permissible for him to attend. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/214): If a person is invited to a wedding feast in which evil things will take place, such as wine, musical instruments, etc, and he is able to attend and remove those evils, then he must attend and denounce them, because then he will be fulfilling two duties: accepting the invitation of his Muslim brother and removing evil. But if he is not able to denounce them then he should not attend. If he does not know about the evils until he gets there, he should remove them. If he cannot, then he should go away. Something similar was stated by al-Shaafa’i. \nIt says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: \nIf wedding parties are free of evils such as men mixing with women and indecent songs, or if you attend then these evils will be changed, then it is permissible to attend, so as to share in the occasion of joy. Rather it is obligatory to attend if there is some evil that you can remove. \nBut if there are evil things in these parties that you cannot denounce, then it is haraam to attend them because of the general meaning of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And leave alone those who take their religion as play and amusement, and whom the life of this world has deceived. But remind (them) with it (the Qur’aan) lest a person be given up to destruction for that which he has earned, when he will find for himself no protector or intercessor besides Allaah” [al-An’aam 6:70] \n“And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur’aan) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire)”\n[Luqmaan 31:6]\nAnd because of the many ahaadeeth which condemn singing and musical instruments. \nFrom Fataawa al-Mar’ah, compiled by Muhammad al-Musnad, p. 92. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Attending wedding parties in Islam is a topic that can carry significant implications, especially when such events are associated with practices contrary to Islamic teachings. In this context, let’s explore the relevant aspects and verses from the Quran that address the concerns around attending such weddings.\n\n### Key Points to Consider:\n\n1. **Nature of the Event**: Weddings in Islamic teaching should ideally be celebrations rooted in joy, adhering to the teachings of modesty and righteousness. However, if a wedding involves activities considered sinful or impermissible in Islam (such as excessive drinking, gambling, or other forms of moral corruption), then attending such festivities could be discouraged.\n\n2. **Prohibition of Intoxicants and Gambling**: The verses from Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:90-91) explicitly prohibit intoxicants (in this context, wine) and gambling, labeling them as acts of Satan that create enmity and hatred among people:\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:90-91)**: \"O you who believe, this wine and gambling, these idols, and these arrows you use for divination, are all acts of Satan; so keep away from them. You may haply prosper. Satan only wishes to create among you enmity and hatred through wine and gambling, and to divert you from the remembrance of God and prayer. Will you therefore not desist?\" \n\n3. **Encouragement of Goodness and Piety**: Weddings should serve as an opportunity to uphold good values and communal ties. If the celebration fosters sin, believers are urged to distance themselves. The Quran calls for a collaborative environment of goodness:\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2)**: \"But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God.\"\n\n4. **Remembrance of God**: The primary purpose of gatherings, including weddings, should be to bring people closer to God and encourage piety. The involvement of activities that divert from this remembrance can be a deciding factor:\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:91)** emphasizes the danger of distractions from prayer and remembrance of God due to engaging in immoral acts: \"...Satan only wishes to create among you enmity and hatred through wine and gambling, and to divert you from the remembrance of God and prayer.\"\n\n5. **Conduct among Believers**: In social contexts, believers are reminded to observe proper etiquette and foster a respectful atmosphere. This includes the way they interact at social events, ensuring that they do not engage in sinful behavior:\n   - **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49-53)**: Provides guidance on proper conduct and respect within the community, stressing the importance of maintaining boundaries and honor in social interactions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn light of the above verses, attending wedding parties that involve evils such as intoxicants, gambling, or any form of immorality may not be permissible in Islamic practice. Indeed, such gatherings should be opportunities to uphold faith and develop positive community relations. If a wedding is known to compromise Islamic values, believers may choose to abstain from attending to avoid contributing to or being part of any sinful activities. Ultimately, the focus should be on supporting marriages in a manner that aligns with Islamic principles of decency, respect, and worship of God."

        "question": "The reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married ‘Aa’ishah despite the age difference",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) after he married Sawdah bint Zam’ah (may Allah be pleased with her). She – ‘Aa’ishah – was the only virgin whom he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married. And he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine years old. \nAmong her virtues was the fact that the Revelation did not descend when he under one cover with any of his wives other than her. She was one of the dearest of all people to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and news of her innocence was revealed from above the seven heavens. She was one of the most knowledgeable of his wives, and one of the most knowledgeable women of the ummah as a whole. The senior companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to refer to her opinion and consult her. \nWith regard to the story of her marriage, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had grieved over the death of the Mother of the Believers Khadeejah, who had supported him and stood by his side, and he called the year in which she died The Year of Sorrow. Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married Sawdah, who was an older woman and was not very beautiful; rather he married her to console her after her husband had died and she stayed among mushrik people. Four years later the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and he was over fifty. Perhaps the reasons for the marriage were as follows: \n1 – He saw a dream about marrying her. It is proven in al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her: “You were shown to me twice in a dream. I saw that you were wrapped in a piece of silk, and it was said, ‘This is your wife.’ I uncovered her and saw that it was you. I said, ‘If this is from Allah then it will come to pass.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 3682). As to whether this is a prophetic vision as it appears to be, or a regular dream that may be subject to interpretation, there was a difference of opinion among the scholars, as mentioned by al-Haafiz in Fath al-Baari, 9/181. \n2 – The characteristics of intelligence and smartness that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had noticed in ‘Aa’ishah even as a small child, so he wanted to marry her so that she would be more able than others to transmit reports of what he did and said. In fact, as stated above, she was a reference point for the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) with regard to their affairs and rulings. \n3 – The love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for her father Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), and the persecution that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) had suffered for the sake of the call of truth, which he bore with patience. He was the strongest of people in faith and the most sincere in certain faith, after the Prophets. \nIt may be noted that among his wives were those who were young and old, the daughter of his sworn enemy, the daughter of his closest friend. One of them occupied herself with raising orphans, another distinguished herself  from others by fasting and praying qiyaam a great deal… They represented all kinds of people, through whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was able to set out a way for the Muslims showing how to deal properly with all kinds of people. [See al-Seerah al-Nabawiyyah fi Daw’ al-Masaadir al-Asliyyah, p. 711]. \nWith regard to the issue of her being young and your being confused about that, you should note that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) grew up in a hot country, the Arabian Peninsula. Usually in hot countries adolescence comes early and people marry early. This is how the people of Arabia were until recently. Moreover, women vary greatly in their development and their physical readiness for marriage. \nIf you think – may Allah guide you – that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not marry any virgin other than ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and that all his other wives had been previously married, this will refute the notion spread by many hostile sources, that the basic motive behind the Prophet’s marriages was physical desire and enjoyment of women, because if that was his intention he would have chosen only those who were virgins and beautiful etc.    \nSuch slanders against the Prophet of Mercy (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by kaafirs and others of their ilk, are indicative of their inability to find fault with the law and religion that he brought from Allah, so they try to find ways to criticize Islam with regard to issues that are not related to sharee’ah. \nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. \nFor more information see Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/106.",
        "predicted_answer": "The marriage of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to ‘Aa’ishah is often discussed within the context of Islamic principles, historical practices, and specific divine permissions granted to him. Understanding this marriage requires a comprehensive look at both the cultural context of the time and the provisions outlined in the Qur'an.\n\n### Age Difference and Cultural Context\n\nFirstly, it is essential to acknowledge the cultural norms of 7th-century Arabia, where age differences in marriage, particularly for women, were not uncommon and were often viewed differently than they may be today. Marriages at a young age were a part of the societal structure. \n\n‘Aa’ishah was married to the Prophet at a young age, which reflects the customs of that time rather than an indication of any wrongdoing or moral failing.\n\n### Divine Permission and Unique Status of the Prophet\n\nThe Qur'an explicitly states that the Prophet was granted privileges that other men were not afforded. For instance, in Surah Al-Ahzab, we see the special status given to the Prophet concerning marriage. The verses also mention that he is permitted to marry women who offer themselves to him, which is not applicable to other Muslims.\n\nHere are the pertinent verses:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab, Ayah 50**: \"We have made lawful for you, O Prophet, wives to whom you have given their dower, and the believing women who offer themselves to the Prophet if the Prophet desires to marry her. This is a privilege only for you and not for the other believers.\" (33:50)\n\nThis clearly indicates that the Prophet's marriages were not only permitted but were divinely sanctioned and served specific purposes within the context of the community and the message of Islam.\n\n### Addressing Social Norms and Teachings\n\nThe arrangement of his marriage was also seen as a means of strengthening ties within the community and showing the importance of family and kinship. The marriage with ‘Aa’ishah allowed the Prophet to connect with a prominent family in the Quraysh, thus forging stronger relationships within the community. \n\nMoreover, as outlined in the Qur'an, it was also a means to demonstrate the rightfulness of marrying certain widows or ex-wives of adopted sons, which was initially seen as taboo at that time. The following verse is mentioned:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab, Ayah 37**: \"And when you said to him who had been favoured by God and was favoured by you: 'Keep your wife to yourself and fear God,' you were hiding something God was about to bring to light.\" (33:37)\n\nHere, the context relates to the Prophet's marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh, who was previously married to his adopted son Zaid. This marriage served to resolve cultural prohibitions and establish new norms within the community in relation to marital law.\n\n### Reflection of Religious Teachings\n\nThrough his marriage to ‘Aa’ishah, the Prophet exemplified virtues such as kindness, respect, and faithfulness towards one's spouse. ‘Aa’ishah later became one of the most significant figures in Islamic history due to her scholarship, her narrations of hadith, and her role in the early Islamic community.\n\nIn summary, the marriage of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to ‘Aa’ishah should be understood against the backdrop of the cultural norms of the time, divine permission granted only to him, and the broader socio-religious functions it served within the nascent Islamic community. The emphasis should be on the teachings of Islam that arose from these circumstances, demonstrating the importance of social responsibility, justice, and the sanctity of marriage as a relationship built on mutual respect and purpose."

        "question": "Does Islam Encourage Large Families?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Blessings of having children\nAbu Dawud (2050) narrated that Ma’qil ibn Yasar said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “I have found a woman who is of good lineage and is beautiful, but she does not bear children. Should I marry her?” He said, “No.” Then he came again with the same question and he told him not to marry her. Then he came a third time with the same question and he said: “Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 1784). \nThis hadith indicates that it is encouraged to marry women who are fertile, so that the numbers of the ummah will increase, and so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will feel proud of his ummah before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children. \nWill you be rewarded for having children?\nAl-Ghazali said that when a man gets married, intending thereby to have children , that this is an act of worship for which he will be rewarded because of his good intention. He explained that in several ways: \n\nThis is in accordance with what Allah wants, which is to perpetuate the human race. \nSeeking the love of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in having many children, so that he will feel proud of them before the other Prophets and nations on the Day of Resurrection. \nSeeking barakah (blessing) and a great deal of reward, and forgiveness of sins through the du`a of a righteous child after one dies. \n\nHaving children was the hope of the Prophets and Messengers\nIt is well known that since ancient times children have been the hope of the Prophets and Messengers and all of the righteous slaves of Allah, and that will continue to be the case so long as man’s innate nature (fitrah) remains sound. Children are a blessing whom people love and on whom they pin their hopes. \nIbrahim (peace be upon him) prayed to his Lord, saying (interpretation of the meaning): \n“My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous” [al-Saffat 37:100]\nAnd Allah says of Zakariyya (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): \n“When he called out to his Lord (Allah) a call in secret.\nHe said: ‘My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble, and grey hair has spread on my head, and I have never been unblest in my invocation to You, O my Lord!\nAnd verily, I fear my relatives after me, and my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an heir.\nWho shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya’qub (Jacob) (inheritance of the religious knowledge and Prophethood, not of wealth). And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are Well-Pleased!’\n(Allah said) ‘O Zakariyya (Zachariah)! Verily, We give you the glad tidings of a son, whose name will be Yahya (John). We have given that name to none before (him)’” [Maryam 19:3-7]\nAllah praises His righteous slaves in many ways, such as when He said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqun (the pious)’” [al-Furqan 25:74]\nAnd Allah tells us that Shu’ayb (peace be upon him) commanded his people to remember Allah’s blessing to them when He made them many after they had been few. He said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied you” [al-A’raf 7:86]\nHe regarded their being multiplied after they had been few as a great blessing which obliged them to obey Allah and obey His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nUndoubtedly the benefits of increasing the nation’s offspring are obvious to everyone who thinks about the matter. Hence nations who understand this matter have been keen to encourage their people to increase their numbers and also to make their enemies reduce their numbers by means of specious arguments and sometimes by using means that lead to infertility and having few children, by means of drugs, contaminated food stuffs that reduce fertility and so on. This is one of the means of war used against the Muslim ummah by its enemies. \nWe ask Allah to ward off the evil of those who disbelieve and to thwart their plots against the Muslims. \nFor more, please see this category: Fiqh of the Family\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the encouragement towards large families can be inferred from various teachings found in the Qur'an and the Hadith. While the Qur'an does not explicitly command having many children, it emphasizes the importance of family, the blessings children represent, and the moral responsibility of parents.\n\n### 1. **Blessings of Children**\nThe Qur'an portrays children as a blessing from God. For instance, in Surah Al-Kahf (18:46), it is stated:\n\n> **\"Wealth and children are [but] adornment of the worldly life. But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for [one's] hope.\"**  \n> (Surah Al-Kahf, 18:46)\n\nThis verse underscores that while wealth and children are desirable, the focus should be on the righteous deeds that please God.\n\n### 2. **Parental Responsibility**\nSurah An-Nisa (4:9) emphasizes the concern that individuals should have for their offspring, stating that people should fear the consequences of leaving their children unprovided after their passing. The verse reads:\n\n> **\"Let people fear the day when they leave behind them [small] children, unprovided, and let them fear God and speak words of appropriate justice.\"**  \n> (Surah An-Nisa, 4:9)\n\nThis highlights the moral obligation to care for and provide for one's children, indirectly promoting the importance of having and raising children.\n\n### 3. **Desire for Offspring**\nThe desire for children, particularly virtuous ones, is often mentioned in the stories of various prophets. For example, in Surah Ali 'Imran (3:38), when Zechariah prayed for a virtuous child, it showcases this fundamental yearning:\n\n> **\"Then prayed Zechariah to his Lord, 'My Lord, grant me from Yourself a good progeny. Indeed, You are the Hearing of supplication.'\"**  \n> (Surah Ali 'Imran, 3:38)\n\nThis reflects the intrinsic value and honor of asking for children who embody moral and virtuous qualities.\n\n### 4. **Respect for All Children**\nIn Surah An-Nisa (4:11-13), the understanding of the division of inheritance among family members also shows recognition and respect for children, ensuring their rights and establishing the importance of familial ties. The verses detail the shares of inheritance for parents and children, hence reinforcing the family structure:\n\n> **\"As for the children, God decrees that the share of the male is equivalent to that of two females...\"**  \n> (Surah An-Nisa, 4:11)\n\n### 5. **Prophetic Traditions**\nApart from the Qur'an, the Hadith literature contains several teachings that encourage having children. One notable Hadith reported by Alqamah ibn Qais states that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:\n\n> **\"Marry those who are single among you, for I fear for my nation the Day of Judgment if they do not marry.\"**  \n> (Sunan Ibn Majah, 1845)\n\nThis tradition emphasizes marrying and fostering families, which naturally leads to having children.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the Qur'an does not issue an explicit command to have large families, it does affirm values that encourage the raising of children as a divine blessing, portrays parental responsibility, and expresses admiration for individuals who seek virtuous offspring. Thus, Islam implicitly supports the notion of family growth through the invaluable roles children play in society and moral development."

        "question": "Which is better, marriage or Hajj?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If you fear that you may commit zina (fornication), then you should give priority to marriage over performing the obligatory Hajj and ‘Umrah. But if you do not fear that you may commit zina, then you should give priority to performing the obligatory Hajj and ‘Umrah over marriage. \nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether marriage or Hajj (pilgrimage) is better in Islam can be examined from various perspectives, especially considering the teachings of the Quran and the Hadiths. Both marriage and Hajj hold significant importance, but they cater to different aspects of life in Islam.\n\n### Marriage in Islam\nMarriage is highly esteemed in Islam and is considered a fundamental social institution. The Quran emphasizes the value of marriage as a means to find peace, love, and companionship. \n\n1. **Purpose of Marriage**: The Quran states:\n   - *“And among His Signs is that He created for you from your own selves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed, in that are signs for a people who give thought.”* (Surah Ar-Rum, 30:21)\n\nThis verse illustrates that one of the purpose of marriage is to provide emotional support and create a loving atmosphere.\n\n2. **Encouragement to Marry**: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:\n   - \"Marriage is my Sunnah, and whoever does not follow my Sunnah has nothing to do with me.\" (Sunan Ibn Majah, Book 9, Hadith 1845)\n\nMarriage is not only a personal choice but a communal act that upholds the moral fabric of society.\n\n### Hajj in Islam\nHajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and holds immense spiritual significance. It is obligatory for every Muslim who is physically and financially able to perform it at least once in their lifetime.\n\n1. **Obligation of Hajj**: The Quran states:\n   - *“And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the House — for whoever is able to undertake it. And whoever denies [going], then indeed, Allah is Free from need of the worlds.”* (Surah Al-Imran, 3:97)\n\nThis verse highlights the obligation of Hajj and its significance in the faith of Muslims.\n\n2. **Spiritual Rewards**: Hajj offers immense spiritual rewards and serves as an opportunity for Muslims to seek forgiveness and purification:\n   - *“The reward for Hajj Mabrur (accepted Hajj) is nothing except Paradise.”* (Sahih Bukhari, Book 26, Hadith 596)\n\n### Comparative Importance\nWhile both marriage and Hajj are important, they fulfill different roles. \n\n- **Marriage** provides social stability, emotional companionship, and fulfills a natural human desire for companionship and procreation. It is often seen as a means to complete one’s faith and maintain societal harmony.\n\n- **Hajj**, on the other hand, serves as a direct act of worship, representing submission to Allah and an opportunity to seek closeness to Him. It is a physical and spiritual journey that embodies the unity of Muslims worldwide.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn essence, a definitive answer to \"which is better\" depends on the context of the individual’s life. \n\n- For those who have not married and are of age, completing their marriage may be recommended as it aligns with fulfilling a Sunnah and maintaining societal norms.\n- For those who have the means and health to travel, performing Hajj is obligatory if they have not done so already.\n\nThus, it can be argued that while both are essential, fulfilling a religious obligation (such as Hajj) takes precedence over a personal choice (like marriage) during one's lifetime. However, once the obligation of Hajj is fulfilled, focusing on marriage becomes crucial for emotional and social stability. \n\nIn conclusion, both marriage and Hajj form integral parts of a Muslim's life and spiritual journey, and their significance cannot be understated as they lead to personal development and fulfillment of religious duties, respectively."

        "question": "She married without a wali (guardian) and wants to repeat the marriage contract, but her husband refuses",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islam forbids a woman to get married without a wali (guardian), and it regards a marriage contract done without a wali as invalid. A kaafir cannot be the wali of a Muslim woman, so if none of her family are Muslims, then the leader or mufti of the Muslims, or the imam of the Islamic center, should stand in as her wali. \nIbn Qudaamah said: A kaafir cannot be the wali of a Muslim woman under any circumstances, according to scholarly consensus. \nAl-Mughni, 7/356 \nWe have discussed all of the above, with evidence and the comments of the scholars, please see the answers to questions no. 7989 and 2127. \nSo the marriage contract is not valid, and it must be annulled and you have to keep away from your husband. The husband has to repeat the marriage contact in the manner prescribed in sharee’ah, if he wants to be married to you. Try to get some good and righteous people to intervene and convince him to do that, and to correct his mistake, as this is in your interests and the interests of your child. If he does not respond, then our advice is to forget about him, because his words are not the words of a trustworthy man. His saying that he is “not ready for marriage” indicates that he only wanted to have intercourse with you, and he did not want to adhere to the commands and laws of Allaah, and the commands to be the protector and maintainer of his wife.  \nSee also the answer to question no. 13501 \nIt is not permissible for him to tell you to have an abortion, and it is not permissible for you to have an abortion if the foetus has reached the stage where the soul has been breathed into it. If you do that you will be killing a soul. \nSee also questions no 12118 and 13319 and 4038. \nWith regard to the child, it is valid to call him after his father and he is not regarded as an illegitimate child, rather the scholars regard him as the child of a marriage contract with some faults in it, and the child born of such a marriage is to be attributed to his father. See al-Mughni, 11/196 \nRemember that Allaah has guaranteed provision for His slaves, and has promised that whoever fears Allaah, He will give him a way out. \nSo fear Allaah, put your trust in Him and repent to him… Part of repenting means separating from this man, because the marriage contract is invalid, for there is no marriage without a wali, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. And when you do that you will be doing it only because it is the command of Allaah.  \nKnow that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him or her with something better… May Allaah give you strength and make things easy for you. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the validity of a marriage contract (nikah) is contingent upon the presence of a wali (guardian), especially for women. The wali is typically a male relative, such as a father or brother, who plays a crucial role in safeguarding the interests of the bride. In your scenario, if a woman has married without a wali and now wishes to repeat the marriage contract but her husband refuses, there are several considerations to take into account based on Islamic teachings.\n\n### 1. Importance of the Wali in Marriage\n\nIt is widely accepted among scholars that a marriage contract without a wali is invalid. The Quran emphasizes mutual consent and guidance in the process of marriage, although it does not explicitly state the necessity of a wali. However, many hadiths and scholarly interpretations uphold the requirement, highlighting the protective nature of this condition.\n\n**Supporting Verse**: The Quran stresses the concept of fairness and mutual agreement in relationships:  \n**Surah An-Nisa (4:21)** - \"How could you do that having slept with one another, and when they had taken a solemn pledge from you?\"  \nThis indicates the importance of a pledged commitment, reflecting the essential nature of marital responsibilities and relationships.\n\n### 2. Seeking a New Marriage Contract\n\nIf a woman seeks to repeat her marriage contract due to the absence of a wali in her initial arrangements, she is typically advised to find a new husband through legitimate channels, including the presence of a wali. The husband’s refusal to recognize this need may indicate a misunderstanding of the Islamic legal requirements or an unwillingness to fulfill the proper obligations.\n\n### 3. Divorce and Recounting the Marriage\n\nIn cases where the marriage is considered invalid due to the lack of a wali, the couple must recognize the importance of adhering to Islamic law. If they wish to dissolve the relationship, this should be pursued respectfully and honorably, as indicated in the following verses addressing divorce and marriage:\n\n**Surah Al-Baqarah (2:229)** - \"Divorce is (revokable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honourably, or part with them in a decent way.\"\n\n### 4. Final Thoughts on Marriage and Wali\n\nIf the husband refuses, the woman may need to engage with her family or a local imam to facilitate understanding and possibly mediate the situation. This may involve:\n\n- Educating her husband about the Islamic requirements for marriage.\n- Seeking the involvement of a wali who can advocate on her behalf.\n- Exploring community resources for guidance on handling disputes.\n\n**Surah Al-Baqarah (2:231-233)** - \"When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honourably (by revoking the divorce), or let them go with honour, and do not detain them with the intent of harassing lest you should transgress.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of a wali in marriage is an essential element in Islamic jurisprudence. The woman should seek to approach her situation with patience, understanding, and a commitment to resolving her marital issues according to the principles outlined in the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)."

        "question": "She wants to marry a student like her and her family doesn’t agree",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah mercy on him) was asked a \n    similar question and said: \nThe ruling on that is that it is contrary to the command of the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose \n    religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry [your daughter or female relative under your care] to him.” Undoubtedly your \n    father’s preventing you from marrying one who is suitable is something that is haraam. Marriage is more important than study, and it does not mean \n    that you cannot study, because the two can be combined. What I advise my brothers who are the guardians of women to do, is to let them complete \n    their studies; a woman may stipulate as a condition of her marriage that she be able to continue studying until her studies are complete. \nFataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/704-705. \nSecondly: \nWith regard to what you mention about the situation of the one who has proposed \n    marriage and that he is still a student, being a student is not regarded as an impediment to marriage if he can afford to get married and to spend \n    on his wife on a reasonable basis. \nBut if his being a student means that he cannot afford to get married and spend on \n    his wife – apart from the unreasonable demands that some families make in the conditions that they stipulate – this is addressed by the words of \n    Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves \n    chaste, until Allaah enriches them of His Bounty”\n[al-Noor 24:33]\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: In this verse, Allaah commands everyone who is \n    unable to get married and cannot find any means of doing so to keep himself chaste, because the most common obstacle to marriage is lack of money. \n    So Allaah promises independence of means by His bounty, so that He will provide what one needs to get married or to find a woman who will accept a \n    small mahr, or else remove from him the desire to marry.” Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 12/242 \nIt should be noted that the mahr and maintenance are the rights of the woman, not \n    of her guardians. She has the right to agree to a little and to marry one whom she knows is poor, but it has to be pointed out that many woman may \n    agree to marry a man even though he is poor when he proposes to her, then shortly after marriage the woman may start to complain, and that leads \n    to arguments and divorce. This should be taken into consideration. \nThirdly: \nWe advise families and guardians not to be an obstacle to keeping their daughters \n    and female relatives chaste because of the unreasonable conditions that they stipulate regarding spending on the basis that they want to be \n    reassured about their daughters’ future. This puts off the men who want to marry them, which leads to them being left on the shelf and the evils \n    that result from that, especially nowadays when fitnah (temptation) is so widespread. Thus they harm themselves and their daughters when their \n    intention is to do good. \nWe ask Allaah to set the affairs of the Muslims straight. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the situation where a woman wishes to marry a student like herself but faces opposition from her family, various aspects of Islamic teachings can be referenced. It is essential to ensure that the marriage is grounded in mutual consent, as well as to acknowledge the rights and considerations surrounding marriage in Islam.\n\n### Key Points on Marriage in Islam:\n\n1. **Consent and Mutual Agreement:**\n   The importance of consent in marriage is emphasized in multiple verses. For instance, in Surah An-Nisa (4:25), it states:\n   > \"If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman (let him marry) a maid who is a believer. God is aware of your faith: The one of you is of the other; so marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry.\" \n   - This verse underscores that marriage should occur with the consent of both the individuals involved, as well as the approval of their families.\n\n2. **Criteria for Spousal Selection:**\n   In Islam, one is encouraged to consider the character and faith of the potential spouse. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221) provides guidance on whom one should marry:\n   > \"Do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her.\"\n   - This verse illustrates that faith is prioritized over characteristics such as wealth or status when choosing a partner. Thus, if the student is a believer and of good character, this aligns with Islamic principles.\n\n3. **Economic Considerations:**\n   The financial aspect of marriage is also addressed, with encouragement to marry those who may be less fortunate but share the same faith:\n   > \"If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman (let him marry) a maid who is a believer.\" (Surah An-Nisa, 4:25)\n   This may imply that marrying someone within similar economic means can be acceptable within the guidelines of faith, and the refusal by the family on economic grounds should be carefully examined.\n\n4. **Respecting Family Wishes:**\n   While personal agency is crucial, respecting family opinions is also an important consideration in many cultures, which may be reinforced by community values. However, Islamic teachings clearly point towards individual choice and integrity, particularly regarding faith:\n   > \"A believer will marry a believer; you should not marry idolaters until they accept the faith.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:221)\n\n5. **Seeking Guidance:**\n   In matters of significant life decisions such as marriage, it is also acceptable, and in fact encouraged, to seek guidance through prayer (Salat) or consultation with knowledgeable persons in the community or family while maintaining one’s personal conviction.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUltimately, while family approval is highly regarded in Islamic culture, the essential elements of a successful marriage—consent, faith, and character—should also be upheld. If her family’s objections are based on unjust criteria (e.g., financial status rather than the person’s character or faith), it may be worth discussing the principles and values of marriage in Islam with them. They could also be encouraged to engage in dialogue with the prospective spouse regarding his intentions and character, enhancing mutual understanding and respect.\n\nIn summary, the way forward for her would involve demonstrating her commitment to the shared values of faith and character, while also engaging respectfully with her family's perspective."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with a woman letting a man know that in principle, however the woman should not propose herself, rather it is better if that is done via her wali (guardian) or someone else who can let the man know. This is indicated by the fact that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) offered his daughter Hafsah in marriage to Abu Bakr and ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with them).",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the process of proposing marriage, including a woman expressing her interest in marrying a man, is permissible and can be seen as a positive action. However, there are guidelines within Islamic teachings that frame how such proposals should be approached.\n\n### Permissibility of Proposing\n\n1. **Expression of Interest**: \n   The Quran acknowledges that it is permissible for individuals to express their interest in marriage. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:235) states:\n   > \"There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself: God is aware that you will keep them in mind. Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper...\" \n   (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 235)\n\n   This verse suggests that a woman can express her interest in marriage, whether publicly or privately, as long as it is done respectfully and properly.\n\n2. **Mutual Consent**: \n   It is emphasized that marriage should be pursued with the consent of both parties and their families. Surah An-Nisa (4:25) highlights this by stating:\n   > \"So marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry.\" \n   (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 25)\n\n   This reflects the importance of seeking approval and working within the framework of familial relationships.\n\n### Conducting Marriage Proposals\n\n3. **Proper Conduct**: \n   The verse continues to underline the significance of conducting marriage proposals in a respectful manner, noting:\n   > \"...and give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower. It will not be sinful if you agree to something (else) by mutual consent after having settled the dowry.\" \n   (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 24)\n\n   This indicates that discussions around marriage should include considerations for dowries and mutual agreements, emphasizing fairness and respect for the rights of women in the process.\n\n4. **Waiting Period**: \n   Additionally, there are guidelines regarding the timing of proposals, especially concerning women who are undergoing a waiting period after a divorce or the death of a husband. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:234) states:\n   > \"Wives of men who die among you should wait (after their husbands death) for four months and ten days; and when the term is over there is no sin if they do what they like with themselves honorably...\" \n   (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 234)\n\n   This highlights the importance of respecting periods during which a woman is not to be considered for marriage immediately after significant life events.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Islam allows for women to express their desire to marry a man, and it encourages proper conduct and mutual consent in the process of marriage proposals. Respecting the rights of women, maintaining honor, and adhering to family and social norms are all critical in this context. The relevant verses from the Quran illustrate these principles, emphasizing the importance of dignity and morality in personal relationships. \n\nFor further information, here are the referenced verses:\n\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:235) - Proposing in secret.\n- Surah An-Nisa (4:25) - Marrying with consent and giving dowries.\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:234) - Waiting period for women."

        "question": "Can a woman look for her life partner herself?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThe Muslim woman must know that she is obliged to wear hijaab and observe proper Islamic hijaab at all times. It is not permissible for a woman to make a wanton display of herself (tabarruj). Tabarruj is a major sin for which the one who does it deserves the wrath and punishment of Allah.  A woman, as the saying goes, is a jewel, and when she is shown to people and makes a wanton display of herself she loses her value. \nSo I advise the questioner and every Muslim woman to adhere to proper Islamic hijaab, which is pleasing to Allah and is an act of obedience to Him, and is a means of Allah guiding His slave and making things easier for him. \nSecondly: \nWith regard to marriage, it may be obligatory if a man or woman longs for marriage and fears falling into immoral ways. It is also the Sunnah of the Prophets (peace be upon them). \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad), and made for them wives and offspring” [al-Ra’d 13:38]\nThirdly: \nThere is a difference between a Muslim woman looking for a husband and her mixing with and talking to men for that purpose, and meeting by accident a man who she thinks is a potential husband. The former is contrary to modesty, for a woman is required to be of modest character and shy, which is an adornment and beauty for women; the virgin is the epitome of modesty as it says in the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him): “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to be more shy than the virgin in her seclusion, and if he disliked something it would be known from his face.” \nNarrated by al-Bukhari, 5751; Muslim, 2320 \nA woman can do something better than that, which is to make du’aa’ asking Allah to give her a good and righteous husband. Du’aa’ is one of the best things with which a Muslim may equip himself and the best way in which a Muslim may seek to meet his needs. She can also speak to some of her Muslim sisters whose religious commitment and honesty she trusts to tell her of someone who can tell a young Muslim man who wants to get married about a Muslim girl. This is better than her doing something that is contrary to modesty. \nFourthly: \nUndoubtedly the one who told you to take off the hijab and that that is better than wearing it is wrong. How can a woman give up her religious commitment and hijab and ignore something that Allah has enjoined upon her and said that if she forsakes it then she will deserve the wrath and punishment of Allah and will not be granted His support? \nThe Muslim woman must adhere to this virtue which many Muslim women have forsaken, for it is the symbol of the Muslim woman, a sign of her commitment, sincere faith and piety.   \nI advise the sister to fear Allah and to adhere to hijab, and Allah will help her and make her life easier for her. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, a woman is permitted to seek a life partner on her own. This is supported by the teachings and verses found within the Quran, which emphasize mutual consent, respect, and the right of individuals to choose their partners.\n\n### Key Points Supporting a Woman's Agency in Choosing a Life Partner:\n\n1. **Mutual Consent in Marriage:**\n   One of the primary principles established in the Quran is that marriage should occur with mutual consent and agreement. In Surah An-Nisa (Chapter 4, Ayah 25), it states:\n   > \"And whoever among you cannot afford to marry free, believing women, then (he may marry) from those whom your right hands possess of believing maidens. And Allah is Knowing of your faith; some of you are from others. So marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due dowries.\" \n   (Surah An-Nisa, 4:25)\n\n   This verse underscores that consent is vital in marriage, which inherently allows women to express their desires and make choices regarding whom they marry.\n\n2. **Seeking Partnership:**\n   The verses also indicate that women may actively seek out those they wish to marry, reinforcing their autonomy. Surah An-Nisa further outlines the importance of pursuing marriages with dignity and respect:\n   > \"Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery.\" \n   (Surah An-Nisa, 4:24)\n\n   The distinction made between seeking a spouse for marriage versus pursuing illicit relationships emphasizes the respect associated with the institution of marriage in Islam.\n\n3. **Equality in Rights:**\n   The Quran delineates the equal rights and obligations of men and women regarding marriage. This reinforces the idea that women possess the right to choose their partners. The verse reinforces that dowry (mahr) is their right as well:\n   > \"Then give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower.\"\n   (Surah An-Nisa, 4:24)\n\n4. **Prohibition of Forced Marriage:**\n   Additionally, the Quran explicitly condemns forced marriages, making it clear that both parties must willingly enter into the union. The importance of choice reflects the dignity and status afforded to women within Muslim society:\n   > “There is no compulsion in religion.” \n   (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:256)\n\n5. **Examination of Partners:**\n   In Surah Al-Mumtahanah (Chapter 60, Ayah 10-12), it emphasizes the importance of choosing partners who share similar beliefs:\n   > “O you who have believed, when the believing women come to you as refugees, examine them. Allah is most knowing of their faith...” \n   (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:10)\n\n   This highlights the significance of shared faith and values in the context of marriage.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, Islamic teachings clearly affirm a woman’s right to seek her life partner. The Quran emphasizes mutual consent, dignity, equity, and the importance of shared values, thereby endorsing and encouraging women to play an active role in selecting their spouses. The relevant verses collectively highlight the autonomy women possess in this critical aspect of their lives."

        "question": "‘Azl (coitus interruptus) and using birth control pills",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly, what the Muslims should do is to try to have as many \n    children as they can, because this is the command of the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: “Marry the one who is loving \n    and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the nations.” \n    (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2050; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh \n    Abi Dawood, 1805). \n\n    Having more children increases the numbers of the ummah, and \n    increasing the numbers of the ummah is a source of its glory, as Allaah \n    says, reminding the Children of Israel of His blessings: \n\n    “and made you more numerous in man-power”\n\n    [al-Isra’ 15:6 – interpretation of the meaning]\n\n    And Shu’ayb said to his people: \n\n    “And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied \n    you”\n\n    [al-A’raaf 7:86 – interpretation of the meaning]\n\n    No one can deny that having a large number is a source of \n    pride and strength for the ummah, contrary to what those pessimists think \n    who say that large numbers causes poverty and starvation in a nation. \n\n    If the ummah increases in number, puts its trust in Allaah \n    and believes His promises as mentioned in the aayah,  \n\n    “And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its \n    provision is due from Allaah”\n\n    [Hood 11:6 – interpretation of the meaning], \n    then Allaah will make things easy for them and will grant them independence \n    of means from His bounty. Based on that, the answer to your question is as \n    follows: \n\n    Birth control pills: \n\n    A woman should not use birth control pills, unless the \n    following conditions are met: \n\n    1-She should need to use them, \n    for example if she is ill and cannot cope with a pregnancy every year, or \n    she is physically unfit, or there is some other reason that getting pregnant \n    every year may harm her.\n\n    2-Her husband should give his \n    permission, because the husband has the right to have children. There must \n    also be consultation with the doctor, to find out whether these pills are \n    harmful or not. \n\n    If these two conditions are met, there is nothing wrong with \n    taking these pills, but that should not be on a permanent basis, because \n    that means preventing having children. \n\n     With regard to ‘azl (coitus interruptus), or withdrawing \n    during intercourse, the correct scholarly view is that there is nothing \n    wrong with it, because of the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him): “We used to practise ‘azl at the time when the Qur’aan was being \n    revealed” – i.e., at the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him). If that action had been haraam, the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have forbidden it. But the \n    scholars say that one should not engage in ‘azl with a free woman except \n    with her permission, because she has the right to have children. Moreover, \n    withdrawing without her permission diminishes her pleasure, because the \n    woman’s pleasure can only be completed after ejaculation. So not asking her \n    permission causes her to lose out on pleasure and on the possibility of \n    having children. Hence we state the condition that this may only be done \n    with her permission.\n\n     From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen.\n\n     From Fataawa Islamiyyah, vol. 3, p. 190.\n\n     Thirdly: the reason why the Sahaabah engaged in ‘azl was \n    because they did not want the woman – especially a slave woman – to get \n    pregnant, so that they could continue to enjoy a physical relationship with \n    them and the woman would still be able to do their work. Abu Dawood narrated \n    that a man said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I have a slave woman and I engage \n    in ‘azl with her, because I do not want her to get pregnant, but I want what \n    men want. But the Jews say that ‘azl is a lesser form of infanticide.” He \n    said, “The Jews are lying. If Allaah wants to create (a child) you cannot \n    prevent that.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, Kitaab al-Nikaah, 1856; \n    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1903).",
        "predicted_answer": "### Answer: ‘Azl (Coitus Interruptus) and Birth Control Pills in Islam\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe discussion surrounding 'azl (coitus interruptus) and the use of birth control pills in Islam reflects broader principles related to family planning, responsible parenthood, and the safeguarding of health and well-being in family life. These subjects are not extensively detailed in the Quran, but interpretations and Hadith provide guidance on the permissibility of family planning methods.\n\n#### 1. **'Azl (Coitus Interruptus)**\n\n'Azl, or coitus interruptus, is a method where a man withdraws before ejaculation to prevent pregnancy. This practice has been mentioned in various historical accounts and can be examined through Islamic legal perspectives.\n\n**Permissibility in Islamic Jurisprudence**:  \nWhile there is no explicit verse in the Quran mentioning 'azl, some scholars derive its permissibility from Hadith literature. One notable narration from the Sahih Muslim recounts a conversation where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) referred to the practice, indicating that it is permissible, provided both partners agree to this practice.\n\n### 2. **Birth Control Pills**\n\nThe use of contraceptive pills has become a common practice for family planning. Similar to 'azl, the permissibility of birth control pills is not directly mentioned in the Quran, yet Islamic scholars have provided guidance on this issue within the framework of Islamic principles.\n\n**Guidance from Islamic Scholars**:  \nScholars generally permit the use of contraceptive methods, including birth control pills, as long as they do not harm the woman and are used for justifiable reasons such as financial stability, health considerations, or the well-being of existing children. \n\n### 3. **Support from the Quran**\n\n**Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233)**:  \nThis verse discusses the rights and duties of parents and the importance of mutual cooperation and understanding in parenting. It says:\n\n> \"Mothers may breastfeed their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period]. Upon the father is [a duty] to provide for them and their clothing according to what is acceptable. No person is charged with more than his capacity.\"  \n> *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:233)*\n\nThis verse emphasizes that the responsibilities towards children include creating a suitable environment for their upbringing, which can involve family planning measures. \n\n**Surah Al-Talaq (65:3)**:  \nThis verse also indicates the importance of planning and provision in family settings:\n\n> \"And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out and will provide for him from where he does not expect.\"  \n> *(Surah Al-Talaq 65:3)*\n\n### 4. **Conclusion**\n\nBoth 'azl and the use of contraceptive pills are seen to be permissible under Islamic law, provided that their use does not result in harm and respects the rights and health of the individuals involved. The principles of mutual consent, understanding, and family welfare play pivotal roles in making decisions regarding reproductive health. \n\nIn summary, while the Quran does not explicitly mention these methods, Islamic teachings encourage responsible family planning in a manner that promotes health and well-being in marital life. As such, seeking knowledge from qualified scholars and considering personal circumstances will guide the decision-making process for Muslim families regarding birth control methods."

        "question": "His family want him to marry a girl who is not religious and they say that she will change in time",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    commanded the one who wants to get married to look for a religious woman. He \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “A woman may be \n    married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty or her \n    religious commitment. Look for the one who is religious, may your hands be \n    rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” \n\n    A wife is a life-long companion, and she will take care of \n    his household and all his affairs. She will be the one to bring up and teach \n    his children. Religious commitment is the thing that makes a woman chaste \n    and keeps her away from bad things. So you must choose a wife from among \n    those women who are religiously-committed and fear Allaah. \n\n    What I think you should do is to strive to influence her and \n    make da’wah to her through your family or some of your mahrams so that she \n    will improve and adhere to the straight path. If she adheres to the straight \n    path and improves, then marry her. \n\n    Otherwise, I think that you should look for someone else, for \n    you have no guarantee that you will be able to influence her; she may not \n    respond, or you may be influenced by her, for no matter how much faith and \n    taqwa (piety) a person may have, he is still human and is still subject to \n    change or influence.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the choice of whom to marry is significant, and there are various guidelines provided in the Quran. When faced with familial pressure to marry someone who is not religious, it’s essential to reflect on the following Quranic verses.\n\n### Key Considerations from the Quran\n\n1. **Choosing a Believing Partner**:\n   The Quran explicitly advises believers to choose their spouses from among those who share their faith. For instance, in **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221)**, it is stated:\n   > \"Do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her. And do not marry your daughters to idolaters until they accept the faith.\"  \n   - *[Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 221]*\n\n   This verse emphasizes the importance of faith in marriage, suggesting that a believing partner is preferable.\n\n2. **Marrying a Believer**:\n   In **Surah An-Nisa (4:25)**, it mentions:\n   > \"If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman (let him marry) a maid who is a believer. God is aware of your faith; the one of you is of the other...\"  \n   - *[Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 25]*\n\n   This verse reiterates that marrying a believing woman is encouraged and thus should be a priority.\n\n3. **Potential Consequences of Marrying Non-Believers**:\n   In **Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:10)**, it outlines the impact of marrying non-believers:\n   > \"O believers, when believing women come over to you as refugees, then examine them. God alone is cognisant of their faith. If you find that they are believers, do not send them back to unbelievers. They are not lawful for them, nor are infidels lawful for believing women...\"  \n   - *[Surah Al-Mumtahanah, Ayah 10]* \n\n   Marrying someone of a different faith may impede the religious obligations and family dynamics in the household.\n\n4. **Seeking God's Guidance**:\n   The verses also express the mercy and forgiveness of God for those who repent and seek guidance. Thus, if a situation arises, one may seek sincerity and prayer to guide their decisions regarding marriage (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:2). \n\n5. **Reflecting on Relationships**:\n   As mentioned in **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:48-50)**, believers are also reminded to maintain a strict approach towards their marital relationships:\n   > \"O you who believe, do not listen to the unbelievers and the hypocrites...\"  \n   - *[Surah Al-Ahzab, Ayah 48]*\n\nThis highlights that the influence of believers (or non-believers) can have significant effects on one's spiritual journey.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn light of these verses, it is strongly advised to consider the spiritual and moral implications of marrying someone who does not share the same beliefs. While familial pressure must be navigated with care and wisdom, the Quran emphasizes the importance of faith and belief compatibility in building a harmonious and faithful family life. Convincing family members of your concerns might require patience and understanding, but adhering to the divine guidance can ultimately lead to peace and better familial relationships. \n\nIn this matter, seeking counsel from knowledgeable members of your community or religious leaders can also be beneficial to gain more insight and proper guidance."

        "question": "Are Wedding Rings Permissible?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can men wear gold?\nWith regard to men wearing gold , whether it is a ring or anything else, it is not permissible under any circumstances. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade gold for the males of this ummah. He saw a man wearing a ring of gold and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took it from his hand and said, “Would any one of you take a coal from the fire and hold it in his hand?” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Libas wa’l-Zinah, 3897)\nSo it is not permissible for the Muslim male to wear a gold ring. \nBut with regard to rings of silver or any other kind of metal, it is permissible for men to wear them even if they are precious metals. \nAre wedding rings haram?\nWith regard to the wedding ring, which is worn on the occasion of marriage, this is not one of the customs of the Muslims. If it is believed that it generates love between the spouses, and that taking it off and not wearing it will have an effect on the marital relationship, then this is regarded as a form of shirk and is a kind of jahili belief. Based on the above, it is not permissible to wear a wedding ring under any circumstances. \nWhy are wedding rings haram?\n\nFirstly, because it is an imitation of those who are no good; it is a custom that has come to the Muslims from the non-Muslims.\nSecondly, if that is accompanied by the belief that it has an effect on the marital relationship, then this is a kind of shirk. La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (there is no power and no strength except with Allah). (From a fatwa issued by Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan). \n\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked about the ruling on wearing engagement rings. He said: \n“The engagement ring is a kind of ring, and there is nothing wrong with rings in principle, unless that is accompanied by some belief, as some people do when the man writes his name on the ring that he gives to his fiancée, and she writes her name on the ring that she gives to him, believing that this will create strong bonds between the couple. In this case, this ring is haram, because it is an attachment to something for which there is no basis in Islam and which makes no sense. Similarly, with regard to the engagement ring, it is not permissible to the man to put it on his fiancée’s hand, because she is not his wife yet and she is still a stranger (non-mahram) to him, because she is not his wife until after the marriage contract has been done.” (Al-Fatawa al-Jami’ah li’l-Marah al-Muslimah, vol. 3, p. 914-915) \nFor more, please see these answers: 76413 , 20069 , and 11446\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The permissibility of wedding rings in Islam is not directly addressed in the Qur'an, but the practice can be understood through Islamic teachings and cultural considerations. Here is a detailed answer based on relevant Islamic principles and verses.\n\n### 1. **Symbol of Marriage**\nWedding rings are often viewed as a symbol of marriage and commitment. While they are not mentioned explicitly in Islamic texts, the concept of wearing rings and symbols to signify relationships and commitments is generally accepted in Islamic cultures.\n\n### 2. **Dowry (Mahr)**\nThe Qur’an emphasizes the importance of giving a dowry (mahr) to the wife as a part of the marriage contract, which is a central element in Islamic marriage. The dowry is considered a gift from the husband to the wife, symbolizing respect and commitment. \n\n**Relevant Verses**:\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:24)**: \"It is also forbidden to marry married women, except those whom your right hands possess. This is the law of Allah upon you. And lawful to you are all beyond these, provided that you seek them with your wealth, in chastity, not in lust.\"  \n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:25)**: \"And whoever among you cannot afford to marry free, believing women, then (he may marry) from those whom your right hands possess of believing young women.\"\n\nThese verses establish that financial ability and the intention to honor the marriage through the dowry are very important, which can be symbolically represented through wedding rings.\n\n### 3. **Cultural Practices**\nIslamic scholars often look at the cultural practices surrounding marriage to determine what is permissible. In many Muslim cultures, wearing rings is a widespread practice and is seen as a cultural norm that reflects commitment.\n\n### 4. **Personal Choice**\nIn Islam, there is a great deal of discretion allowed in terms of cultural expressions of marriage. As long as wedding rings do not contradict Islamic principles, such as excessive extravagance or adornment that leads to vanity, their use is generally permissible. \n\n### 5. **Mutual Agreement**\nIn Islam, customs and practices that benefit the couple and promote marital harmony can be accepted. If both partners agree to exchange rings as a sign of their commitment, it can be seen as a positive act, as mutual consent in family matters is encouraged.\n\n**Relevant Verse**:\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:24)** indicates that giving something of value, such as a ring, is a proper act when seeking a spouse, \"Then give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower.\"\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile there are no explicit prohibitions against wedding rings in Islamic texts, they can be considered permissible as long as they are used within the context of Islamic values, such as simplicity, mutual consent, and respect. In practice, many Muslims around the world wear wedding rings as a cultural expression of their commitment to one another in marriage. \n\nThis allows wedding rings to be seen as not only a personal choice but also a cultural practice that fosters the ties of marriage while adhering to Islamic teachings."

        "predicted_answer": "Deciding whether to marry someone is a significant choice that requires careful consideration and reflection on various factors from an Islamic perspective.\n\n### Key Considerations in Choosing a Spouse:\n\n1. **Character and Piety**: One fundamental aspect Islam emphasizes when choosing a spouse is their character, particularly their faith and piety. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) recommended that when seeking a spouse, one should consider their religious commitment: \n   - \"A woman is married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty, and her religion. So choose the one who is religious, may you be blessed.\" (Narrated in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim). \n   Although this is a Hadith, it reflects the Islamic ethos of prioritizing faith.\n\n2. **Mutual Respect and Agreement**: Marriage in Islam is built on mutual respect, understanding, and agreement. The Qur'an states:\n   - \"And among His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.\" (Surah Ar-Rum, 30:21).\n\n3. **Honourable Conduct**: Surah Al-Baqarah provides guidance when it states:\n   - \"When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the waiting term, do not prevent them from marrying their suitors if they agree among themselves in a good way.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:232).  \n   This principle underscores the significance of maintaining dignity and kindness even in matters of love and marriage.\n\n4. **Shared Interests and Goals**: A successful marriage often relies on shared values, life goals, and compatibility. While this is not explicitly stated in the Qur'an, the importance of harmony is implied in several verses discussing marriage.\n\n5. **Consultation and Consent**: The principles of consultation and seeking parental guidance are essential in Muslim marriages. Considering the family's opinion can often provide a clearer insight into potential compatibility.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBefore deciding to marry him, ponder the characteristics he embodies, how he aligns with your understanding of faith, and how well you would both fit into a harmonious partnership. The verses from the Qur'an and teachings of the Prophet guide believers towards prioritizing piety, mutual respect, and understanding when considering marriage.\n\nUltimately, the decision is significant and should not be rushed. Pray for guidance in making this important choice, as Allah is aware of our hearts and intentions. You may refer to Surah Al-Baqarah (2:235) regarding the nature of proposals, and the companionship intended within marriage (Surah Ar-Rum, 30:21) as a reminder of the depth and purpose of this sacred bond."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. \n          He should not marry his daughter to him unless he has \n          explained his situation and said, “I have such and such a disease.” \n          Then if they agree to that, then that is fine, otherwise the marriage \n          should not proceed, because if he conceals the matter from them he may \n          have cheated them and deceived them, and the woman may pass the disease \n          to her husband, or the husband may pass it to his wife, and to their \n          children after that.  But if she accepts you and agrees, and accepts \n          the will and decree of Allaah, then that is OK",
        "predicted_answer": "The issue of marrying one’s daughter to a person who is an AIDS patient is not explicitly addressed in the Qur’an. However, it involves several important considerations related to Islamic teachings on marital selection, health, and guidance from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). \n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n1. **Compatibility and Health**: While the Qur’an does not specifically mention diseases such as AIDS, it emphasizes the importance of marrying individuals who are good in character and have the ability to fulfill their responsibilities in a marriage. The health of a potential spouse can be a valid concern for the family, as it impacts the well-being of the family unit. Surah 24, Al-Nur, encourages choosing partners with good moral character and soundness of faith, which can extend to their health as well (Surah Al-Nur, 24:26).\n\n2. **Consent and Welfare of All Parties**: The Islamic approach to marriage stresses the well-being of both parties involved. If the father of the daughter believes that marrying her to someone with AIDS would compromise her health or general welfare, it is permissible for him to consider this as a factor in his decision. The Qur'an emphasizes mutual consent and the importance of welfare in marriage (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:233).\n\n3. **Social Responsibility**: Islam encourages social responsibility and care for those who are ill. If a father decides to allow his daughter to marry someone with HIV/AIDS, it should be done with full awareness of the implications, and efforts should also be made to ensure that both parties can manage a healthy and supportive relationship. \n\n### Relevant Verses:\n\n1. **On Choosing a Spouse Based on Character**: \n   - Surah Al-Nur (24:26) - \"Good women are for good men, and good men are for good women. These are innocent of what the others say. For them is forgiveness and a generous provision.\"\n\n2. **On Mutual Consent in Marriage**: \n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233) - \"And when you divorce your women and they have fulfilled their term, do not prevent them from marrying their husbands when they have agreed between them in a lawful manner. This is an admonition for whoever should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is better for you and purer.\"\n\n3. **On the Importance of Welfare**: \n   - Surah Al-Hujurat (49:10) - \"The believers are but brothers, so make settlement between your brothers. And fear Allah that you may receive mercy.\"\n\n### Concluding Remarks\n\nWhile there is no explicit ruling in the Qur’an that forbids marrying a daughter to an AIDS patient, it is crucial to approach the situation with sensitivity and thorough consideration of the implications. The father should weigh the health, emotional, and social dimensions of the proposed marriage and involve the daughter in the decision-making process. Marital relations in Islam are built on mutual respect, understanding, and responsibility, which should guide any decision made in this context. It may also be beneficial to seek guidance from knowledgeable religious authorities or scholars to navigate complex issues related to health and marital choices.\n\nIn the end, it's also vital to ensure that any views taken on such matters align with compassion and understanding for those living with illnesses, maintaining the values of kindness and support that are central to Islam."

        "question": "Is masturbation permissible if a person knows that he would not be able to give a wife her rights?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to marry, let him get married, and whoever cannot do that, then he should fast, for it will be a protection for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4677) \nIbn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari: With respect to marriage, the scholars have divided men into several categories. \nThe first is those who have the desire to get married and who have the financial means to do so and who fear for themselves. It is recommended for such a person to get married according to all the scholars; according to one report the Hanbalis said that it is obligatory. The well-known view of Ahmad is that it is not obligatory for the one who is able and has the desire, unless he fears hardship. \nIbn Daqeeq al-‘Eid said: Some of the fuqaha’ divided marriage into five rulings. They said that it is obligatory in cases where there is the fear of hardship, where a man is able for marriage and it is difficult to find a concubine. This was narrated by al-Qurtubi from one of their scholars, namely al-Maaziri, who said: it is obligatory in the case of one who cannot keep away from zinaa otherwise, as stated above. \nHe said: it is forbidden in the case of one who will not take care of his wife with regard to intercourse and spending on her, who is not able for marriage and has no desire for it. Al-Safaareeni said: the poor man who cannot spend on a wife and has no income, and has no desire – in this case it is said that marriage is makrooh for him, because he is cannot afford it and he cannot provide his wife with enjoyment to protect her, and he has no need for it. \nSee Ghidhaa’ al-Albaab, vol. 2, p. 434 \n‘Iyaad said: it is recommended in the case of everyone who hopes for offspring even if he has no desire for intercourse, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I will be proud of your great numbers.” And because of the encouragement for marriage and the commands to marry. The same applies to the one who has any desire for other kinds of enjoyment of women besides intercourse. But in the case of one who is sterile or has no desire for women or for physical pleasure, marriage is permissible for him if the woman knows and accepts that. \nThe hadeeth indicates that masturbation is haraam, because if it were prescribed the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have indicated that. See also Question no. 329 \nIf a person is patient in abstaining from that which Allah has forbidden and gives it up because he is seeking the pleasure of Allah, then Allah will reward him abundantly on the Day of Resurrection, because whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better. \nAnd Allah says, describing the believers (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)” [al-Mu’minoon 23:5]\nThe Muslim has to follow the path prescribed by Islam, as taught by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which is fasting. May Allah protect you and us from falling into haraam. And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether masturbation is permissible for someone who cannot fulfill the rights of a wife touches upon several important aspects of Islamic teachings, including self-control, responsibility in relationships, and respect for others. \n\n### Islamic View on Masturbation\n\nMasturbation is a subject of debate among Islamic scholars, with opinions divided. Generally, it is considered discouraged (makruh) or prohibited (haram) based on the understanding that it may lead to further sinful acts, such as seeking unlawful sexual pleasures. \n\n### Relevant Quranic Verses and Interpretations\n\n1. **The Importance of Marriage and Sexual Relations**: \n   In Surah An-Nisa (4:24), Allah states, \"Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery.\" This verse underscores the significance of marriage in Islam as the proper context for sexual relations. The implication here is that sexual fulfillment should ideally be pursued through marriage, rather than through solitary acts like masturbation.\n\n   - **Surah 4:24**: \"Also forbidden are married women unless they are captives (of war). Such is the decree of God. Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery...\"\n\n2. **Rights of a Spouse**: \n   In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:229-230), the Quran details the responsibilities and rights that one has in marriage. If a person believes they cannot provide these rights adequately to a spouse, the responsibility may suggest that they should not engage in marital relations at all, including masturbation that can be perceived as a means to fulfill sexual desire without entering into genuine affirmation of those responsibilities.\n\n   - **Surah 2:229**: \"Divorce is (revocable) two times... You are not allowed to take away the least of what you have given your wives, unless both of you fear that you would not be able to keep within the limits set by God.\"\n\n3. **Avoiding Sinful Passions**: \n   The Quran advises believers to restrain their desires, as seen in Surah Al-Mu’minun (23:5-7), where it states that true believers are those who guard their chastity except with their spouses or those whom their right hands possess. \n\n   - **Surah 23:5-7**: \"And they who carefully maintain their prayer. And they who guard their chastity, except from their wives or those their right hands possess...\"\n\n4. **Fear of God**: \n   In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233), it emphasizes the fear of Allah and the importance of mutual respect in personal relations. If a person engages in masturbation, knowing they are falling short of their commitments, it could undermine their standing before God.\n\n   - **Surah 2:233**: \"Mothers may breastfeed their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period]. Upon the father is their provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable...\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile there is no explicit mention of masturbation being categorically prohibited in the Quran, the context provided by various verses highlights a preference for marriage as the proper outlet for sexual needs. If an individual knows they cannot give a wife her due rights, it suggests that they should refrain from marital relations, and by extension, find means of fulfilling their desires that do not transgress the bounds of what is deemed acceptable in the faith.\n\nTherefore, masturbation, while possibly seen as a lesser evil compared to illicit sexual relations, still raises concerns about self-control and fulfilling one’s obligations to others. It would be prudent for a person to seek the guidance of a knowledgeable scholar or a reliable authority within their religious community for personal advice in this matter."

        "question": "He is confused as to whether he should marry a virgin or a widow",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This \n          depends on the situation of the husband; it may be that marriage to \n          a widow is more suitable for him, and better.  \nThe \n          widow may be a lady of religious commitment and good character, such \n          that you would not want to let the opportunity to marry such a woman \n          “slip through your fingers”, and you could not find a virgin of such \n          religious commitment and character.  \nBut \n          generally speaking, the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) encouraged marriage to virgins.  \n          \nThere \n          is the story of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him), whose father \n          had died, leaving him with sisters. In his case it would not have been \n          suitable for him to marry a virgin who was young like them. So he wanted \n          to marry a woman who had been previously married, who could take care \n          of them and look after them, and the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of his decision.  \n          \nIt was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah \n          (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: “The Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked me, ‘Have you got \n          married?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘A virgin or a previously-married \n          woman?’ I said, ‘A previously-married woman.’ He said, ‘Why not a young \n          girl, whom you could play with and she could play with you?’ I said, \n          ‘I have sisters and I wanted to marry a woman who could gather them \n          together and comb their hair and take care of them.’ He said: ‘You will \n          reach, so when you have arrived (at home), I advise you to associate \n          with your wife (that you may have an intelligent son).’”\n(Narrated \n          by al-Bukhaari, 1991; Muslim, 715)  \nAccording \n          to another report narrated by al-Bukhaari (2257), “… so she could teach \n          them and discipline them.”  \nAccording \n          to another report narrated by al-Bukhaari (2805) and Muslim (715): “He \n          said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me, when I asked \n          his permission (to participate in jihaad), “Have you married \n          a virgin or a previously-married woman?” I said, “A previously-married \n          woman.” He said, “Why did you not marry a virgin whom you could play \n          with and she could play with you?” I said, “O Messenger of Allaah, my \n          father has died (or has become a shaheed/martyr), and I have \n          young sisters, so I did not want to marry someone like them who could \n          not discipline them or take care of them, so I married a previously-married \n          woman who could take care of them and discipline them.”’”  \nIt was narrated that Jaabir (may Allaah be \n          pleased with him) said: “My father died, leaving seven – or nine – daughters, \n          and I married a previously-married woman. The Messenger of Allaah  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked, ‘Did you get married, \n          O Jaabir?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘A virgin or a previously-married \n          woman?’ I said, ‘A previously-married woman.’ He said, ‘Why not a young \n          girl whom you could play with and she could play with you, and you could \n          laugh with her and she could laugh with you?’ I told him that ‘Abd-Allaah \n          had died and left behind daughters, and I did not want to bring to them \n          someone like them. So I had married a woman who could take care of them \n          and discipline them. He said, ‘May Allaah bless you,’ or similar kind \n          words.”(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5052)  \nShaykh \n          Mustafa al-Ruhaybaani said: \n“It is \n          Sunnah for the one who wants to get married to marry a virgin, because \n          the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n          of Allaah be upon him) said to Jaabir, ‘Why not a virgin whom you could \n          play with and she could play with you?’ (agreed upon) – unless there \n          is a reason for which marrying a previously-married woman is better, \n          in which case he should choose such a woman over a virgin, in order \n          to serve that interest.”(Mataalib Uli al-Nuha, 5/9, 10)  \n          \nAnd Allaah \n          knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "When considering whether to marry a virgin or a widow, it is important to take into account various aspects highlighted in the Quran and the principles of Islamic teachings. \n\n### Quranic Guidance on Marriage\n\nThe Quran provides guidance on the types of women permissible for marriage. Although the texts do not explicitly favor marrying a virgin over a widow or vice versa, they do offer considerations on marriage that can help one come to a decision. \n\n1. **Marrying with Intention and Consent**: \n   In Surah An-Nisa (4:25), it is stated, \"If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman (let him marry) a maid who is a believer. God is aware of your faith... so marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry.\" This emphasizes that the intention behind marriage should be sincere, and one's financial capability should also be considered.\n\n   **Reference**: Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 25 (4:25)\n   \n2. **Mourning Period for Widows**: \n   Surah Al-Baqarah (2:234) mentions that \"wives of men who die among you should wait (after their husbands' death) for four months and ten days.\" After this period, it states that there is \"no sin if they do what they like with themselves honourably.\" This illustrates that widows are given time for mourning and are permitted to remarry thereafter.\n\n   **Reference**: Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 234 (2:234)\n\n3. **Purpose of Marriage**: \n   Marriage in Islam is grounded in nobility and mutual respect. Surah An-Nisa (4:19) highlights not to \"inherit women against their will,\" signifying the importance of consent and the respect in marriage whether to a virgin or a widow.\n\n   **Reference**: Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 19 (4:19)\n\n### Advantages of Marrying a Virgin or a Widow\n\n- **Marrying a Virgin**: Traditionally, marrying a virgin is sometimes preferred due to cultural norms and perceived freshness in starting a family. Additionally, it can also imply the opportunity to mold a shared life and nurture each other from the beginning.\n\n- **Marrying a Widow**: On the other hand, marrying a widow can denote compassion and the fulfillment of social and moral duties, especially if the widow has children. It reflects maturity and respect for the trials that they may have endured. The Quran acknowledges the emotional depth that such individuals may bring to a new relationship.\n\n### Personal Considerations\n\nUltimately, the decision hinges on personal preferences, compatibility, and the qualities one values in a partner. Factors such as emotional intelligence, mutual understanding, and family goals tend to be more pivotal than merely focusing on the virginity of the spouse.\n\n- **Fear of God and Wisdom**: Surah Al-Baqarah (2:232) reminds believers that \"this warning is for those among you who believe in God and the Last Day. This is both proper and right for you, for God knows and you do not know.\" This can serve as guidance that one should trust God's wisdom in making choices.\n\n   **Reference**: Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 232 (2:232)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn Islam, both virgins and widows are valued members of society, and the decision should encompass personal, emotional, and situational factors rather than a rigid preference. The Quran promotes dignity, respect, and intention in marriage, reminding believers to consider these deeply human qualities over perceptions and cultural biases. Ultimately, prayer for guidance (Istikhara) is encouraged to seek what is best for one’s circumstances."

        "question": "Undoing the effects of magic on the groom on his wedding night",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is not necessarily the case, but it could happen. Some people are tested by means of someone else putting a magic spell on them which prevents them from having intercourse with their wives. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife, but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allaah’s Leave [al-Baqarah 2:102]\nBut if a person uses the prayers for refuge prescribed in Islam, Allaah will be sufficient for him against the evil of the magicians and others, and Allaah will take that (magic) away if it is present. So he has to read Aayat al-Kursi over himself, and al-Faatihah, and the verses which speak of sihr (magic), and “Qul Huwa Allaahu Ahad” and the Mi’wadhatayn, and it will go away by Allaah’s Leave. This has been tried a great deal. A good qaari’ (reader) from among the good and righteous people from whom one hopes for good may also recite for him. The reader may recite into water which the man may then drink from or wash with, and the harm will go away from him, or the reader may recite over him and blow onto him, and Allaah will cure him of that. All of these are means of keeping safe and sound.",
        "predicted_answer": "Undoing the effects of magic, particularly on a groom during significant events such as a wedding night, is a matter that invokes both spiritual and practical considerations in Islam. The Quran acknowledges the existence of magic and sorcery, and it emphasizes the importance of seeking protection from Allah against such harms.\n\n### Understanding the Context of Magic\nIn Islam, magic is considered a serious offense and is believed to stem from the evil and sinful actions of individuals seeking power over others. It is mentioned in various parts of the Quran, illustrating its deceptive nature. For instance, in Surah Taha, Allah reveals that the works of magicians are mere tricks and have no real power against the truth. In verse 20:69, it states:\n\n\"Throw down what is in your right hand: It will swallow up what they have conjured. For what they have fashioned is only a trick of the sorcerer; and a sorcerer does not succeed wherever he may come\" (Surah Taha, Ayah 69).\n\nThis verse underscores the idea that true power lies with Allah, and the sorcery merely distracts from that reality.\n\n### Seeking Protection from Magic\nFor someone affected by magic, the guidance from the Quran and the Prophetic traditions emphasizes seeking Allah's help through prayers (Dua), recitation of specific verses, and other significant acts of worship. Surah Al-Baqarah provides a fundamental guideline for protection against evil:\n\n\"And if an evil whisper comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He is the Hearing and the Knowing\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 203).\n\nPractices that are recommended to nullify the effects of magic include:\n\n1. **Reciting Ayat Al-Kursi (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 255)**: This verse is recognized for its powerful protective qualities against evil.\n   \n   \"Allah! There is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence...\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 255).\n\n2. **The Last Two Verses of Surah Al-Baqarah (Ayahs 285-286)**: These verses offer protection and encompass guidance from Allah.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Falaq (Surah 113)** and **Surah An-Nas (Surah 114)**: These two chapters specifically address seeking refuge in Allah from the evils of creation, including magic and sorcery.\n\n### Encouragement to Keep the Faith\nIn situations where one feels oppressed or affected by external forces like magic, turning to Allah in sincere and humble prayer is essential. The Quran encourages believers to have faith and to seek forgiveness:\n\n\"O you who believe, turn to Allah in sincere repentance\" (Surah At-Tahrim, Ayah 8).\n\nThis verse encourages believers to seek forgiveness and to strive for closeness to Allah as a remedy for their afflictions.\n\n### Concluding Steps: Practical Advice\n1. **Ruqyah (Spiritual Healing)**: Engaging in Ruqyah, which involves reciting specific verses from the Quran over the affected person, can help in undoing spells or curses. \n\n2. **Increasing Worship**: Ensuring regular prayers, making constant remembrance of Allah, and seeking forgiveness help fortify oneself against any evil.\n\n3. **Consultation with a Knowledgeable Person**: If problems persist, seeking the advice of an Islamic scholar or an expert in Ruqyah can provide further clarity and methods for protection.\n\nIn conclusion, while the threat of magic is recognized in Islam, the emphasis remains on the power of Allah, the importance of sincere worship, and the protective qualities found in reciting the Quran. A focus on faith, prayer, and reliance on Allah’s mercy provides a comprehensive approach to overcoming any adverse effects, such as those that might occur on significant occasions like a wedding night."

        "question": "Is it makrooh to leave a long interval between the marriage contract and consummation of the marriage?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:\nIt is not makrooh, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concluded the marriage contract with ‘Aa’ishah when she was six years old, and consummated the marriage with her when she was nine. The prospective husband may do that sometimes because he is keen to get married and is afraid that the woman or her family may change their minds, so he hastens to conclude the marriage contract. There is nothing wrong with that from the point of view of sharee’ah, but I think that the marriage contract should be concluded at the same time as the marriage is to be consummated, or shortly before, because that helps to avoid problems that may arise, such as differences that lead to divorce, or death of one of the spouses, etc… And Allaah is the source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether it is makrooh (discouraged) to leave a long interval between the marriage contract and consummation of a marriage can be approached by examining Islamic teachings regarding marriage and the relationship between spouses.\n\n### Guidance from the Quran and Hadith\n\n1. **Marriage and Consummation**: Islamic law stipulates that a marriage contract (nikah) is sanctified once both parties consent and a dowry (mahr) is provided. However, consummation (the physical union) is an essential element that completes the union. \n\n2. **Quranic References**:\n   - In **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:231-232)**, it is emphasized that once a divorce occurs, a couple should not hinder each other from marrying again if sufficient time (the waiting period or `iddah`) has passed. This indicates the importance of not delaying the opportunity for lawful unions (Al-Baqarah 2:231-232):\n     > \"When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably... there is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage...\"\n\n3. **Ahadith References**: \n   - The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) encouraged prompt consummation after the marriage contract. It is reported that he said, “There is no marriage except with the permission of the guardian and two witnesses, and consummation of the marriage is an important and required aspect.” (Source: Sunan Ibn Majah)\n\n4. **Views of Scholars**: Islamic scholars have generally viewed a long delay in consummating a marriage as discouraged. While there are valid reasons that might warrant postponement (such as education, migration, etc.), unnecessarily delaying the consummation can lead to complications and misunderstandings.\n\n### Is It Makrooh?\n\nIn Islamic jurisprudence, the categorization of actions into makrooh (discouraged) and halal (permissible) varies among schools of thought. However, a significant consensus suggests:\n\n- **Makrooh to Delay without Reason**: Leaving a long interval between marriage and consummation without a valid reason may lead to feelings of neglect or abandonment, and thus a delay could be seen as makrooh, as it could negatively affect the relationship.\n  \n- **Proper Communication**: It's important for both spouses to communicate openly about their expectations and any concerns they may have regarding consummation, which can alleviate stress around the timing and build a stronger relationship foundation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while there isn't a specific hadith that categorically states it is makrooh to delay consummation of a marriage after the contract, the implications of Quranic verses and general scholarly consensus indicate that unnecessarily prolonged separation is discouraged. This understanding aligns with the principle that marriage is a partnership that should be actively nurtured. The couple is advised to approach this matter with sensitivity and communication to ensure their mutual happiness and compliance with Islamic teachings."

        "question": "Is Intimacy an Act of Worship in Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is Intimacy an Act of Worship in Islam?\n If a man has intercourse with his wife , he will be rewarded for that, because he is doing something permissible and avoiding something forbidden. This is what is stated in the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):\n It was narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that some people from among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allah, the rich people will get more reward. They pray as we pray, and they fast as we fast, but they give in charity from their excess wealth.” He said, “Has not Allah given you things with which you can give charity? Every Tasbihah (saying `Subhan Allah’ (Glory be to Allah)) is a charity. Every ‘Takbirah’ (saying `Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)) is a charity. Every ‘Tahmidah’ (saying `Al-hamdu-Lillah’ (praise be to Allah)) is a charity. Every Tahlilah (saying `La ilaha ill-Allah’ (there is none worthy of worship but Allah)) is a charity. Enjoining what is good is a charity. Forbidding what is evil is a charity. Having intercourse (with one’s wife) is a charity.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?” He said, “Do you not see that if he does it in a haram way he will have the burden of sin? So if he does it in a halal way, he will have a reward for that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1674) \nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The phrase, `Having intercourse is a charity’ – the word bud’ (translated here as `having intercourse’ ) may mean intercourse, or it may refer to the private part itself…\nThis indicates that permissible actions may become acts of worship, if there is a sincere intention. Intercourse may be an act of worship if the intention behind it is to fulfil the rights of one's wife, to treat her kindly as enjoined by Allah, to seek a righteous child, to keep oneself or one’s wife chaste, to prevent both partners from looking towards or thinking of haram things, and other good intentions. `O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?’” (Sharh Muslim, 7/92)\nIs the reward of sex in Islam equivalent to 70 Sunnah prayers?\n With regard to your comment that the reward of sex in Islam is equivalent to seventy optional prayers”\nPerhaps this question about the reward for having intercourse with one’s wife comes from your reading of Imam An-Nawawi’s commentary on Sahih Muslim (Sharh An-Nawawi `ala Sahih Muslim). It is a comment which we will quote below, where the Shaykh (An-Nawawi – may Allah have mercy on him) was discussing the issue of enjoining what is good and saying that it is obligatory. Then he discussed the issue of saying Tasbih and Dhikr, which he noted is Sunnah. Then he explained that the obligatory act of worship is equivalent to seventy times the Sunnah act, and said: they reached this conclusion from a Hadith… Then at the end of this discussion he referred to the phrase “Having intercourse…” \nIf this is indeed the case, then you should note that the first comment has nothing to do with what follows it. The phrase “from a Hadith” means from some Hadith, but Imam An-Nawawi does not quote it. When he finishes discussing the issue of obligatory and Sunnah acts of worship, and the status of each, he then starts his discussion of the phrase “Having intercourse...” So the confusion has arisen from this juxtaposition.\nThis is what we think. But if you mean that the reward for obligatory acts of worship is equivalent to the reward for seventy Sunnah acts, then An-Nawawi did discuss this point and said that there was a Hadith about it, but he did not quote it.\n We know what An-Nawawi was referring to, and this is what was pointed out by Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him).\n Al-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n “Note:\nIn Ziyadat Ar-Rawdah, An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from the Imam of the Haramayn from some of the scholars that the reward for an obligatory act of worship is seventy times more than the reward for a Sunnah act. An-Nawawi said: they reached this conclusion from a Hadith.”\n The Hadith in question was quoted by Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) in An-Nihayah. It is the Marfu` Hadith of Salman concerning the month of Ramadan: “Whoever seeks to draw closer to Allah during (this month) by doing some good deeds will be like one who does an obligatory action at any other time, and one who does an obligatory action (during Ramadan) will be like one who does seventy obligatory actions at any other time.”\n This is an inauthentic Hadith which was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah (may Allah have mercy on him), but he was uncertain as to whether it was sound or not.” ((At-Talkhis Al-Habir, 3/118)\n What he meant (may Allah have mercy on him) by saying that Ibn Khuzaymah was uncertain as to whether it was sound or not may be understood more clearly by referring to Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (3/191), where he includes it under the chapter heading, Bab Fada’il Sharh Ramadan in Sahha Al-Khabr (Chapter on the virtues of the month of Ramadan, if the report is authentic).\n And the chain of transmission of this Hadith includes `Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad`an, who is a weak narrator.\n And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Intimacy in Islam, particularly within the confines of a marital relationship, can indeed be considered an act of worship. This assertion is supported by the principles found in the Quran that emphasize the sanctity of marriage, the importance of mutual satisfaction between spouses, and the understanding that fulfilling one’s marital duties (including physical intimacy) is part of a believer's practice of faith.\n\n### 1. **Intimacy as a Form of Worship**\nOne of the core teachings in Islam is that marital intimacy is not merely a physical act; it is an important aspect of the emotional and spiritual bond between spouses. When approached with the right intention, it is seen as an act of worship and fulfillment of God's commands.\n\n- **Quranic Reference**: In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:5), it is stated that \"lawful are the chaste Muslim women...\" This indicates that intimacy within marriage is a permissible and lawful act that should be conducted in accordance with Islamic principles. The conducive conditions of marriage elevate sexual relations to a respectable act.\n\n  - **Verse**: Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:5).  \n  - **Context**: This verse highlights the importance of lawful relationships and implies that fulfilling one's needs within such relationships is part of following divine guidance.\n\n### 2. **Marital Relationship as a Source of Blessing**\nIslam teaches that maintaining a close bond with one’s spouse—including through sexual intimacy—can enhance love and mercy, which are crucial elements in a marriage. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of treating spouses with kindness and fulfilling their needs.\n\n- **Quranic Reference**: Surah Al-Ahzab (33:35) mentions various qualities of believers, including those who \"guard their private parts.\" This protection extends to marital fidelity, suggesting that sexual relations within marriage are righteous and rewarded.\n\n  - **Verse**: Surah Al-Ahzab (33:35).\n\n### 3. **Encouragement of Mutual Fulfillment**\nThe Quran encourages communication and mutual fulfillment of needs between spouses. It establishes the idea that both partners have rights over each other, thus further reinforcing the importance of a fulfilling marital life.\n\n- **Quranic Reference**: In Surah An-Nur (24:30-31), it instructs both men and women to guard their modesty and private parts, thereby highlighting the significance of privacy and respect within the marital relationship.\n\n  - **Verse**: Surah An-Nur (24:30-31).  \n\n### 4. **Physical Intimacy as an Obligation**\nFulfilling the rights of the spouse, which includes physical intimacy, is treated as an obligation. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was reported to have said that there are certain rights of one spouse over another.\n\n- **Hadith Reference**: There are numerous hadiths where the Prophet emphasized that being intimate with one's spouse, providing for their needs, and being kind and considerate is treated as part of a believer’s obligations.\n\n### 5. **Spiritual and Emotional Dimensions**\nIntimacy enhances the spiritual and emotional connection between partners, which ultimately leads to a more fulfilling partnership. The Quran mentions that God created spouses for companionship and tranquility (Surah Ar-Rum 30:21).\n\n- **Quranic Reference**: \"And among His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them...\" \n\n  - **Verse**: Surah Ar-Rum (30:21).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, intimacy within marriage is recognized as an act of worship in Islam when approached with the right intentions and respect. It is emphasized through various Quranic verses and hadith that fulfilling the needs of one's spouse, including physical intimacy, is an essential part of being not only a good partner but also a good believer. This reinforces the notion that every act performed within the framework of marriage can be made an act of worship, reflecting obedience to God's commands and promoting a harmonious family structure."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.in all \n          circumstances. \n         My dear brother, what \n          you have described is indeed difficult and hard, but the Muslim can \n          do nothing but accept the decree of Allaah and face whatever difficulties \n          Allaah sends by following the means prescribed in sharee’ah. \n What we advise you to \n          do is the following:  \n-Consult a trustworthy Muslim psychologist. \n-Seek help through ruqyahs prescribed in sharee’ah [i.e., reciting \n          Qur’aan and du’aa’s for the purpose of seeking healing]. You can recite \n          ruqyah over yourself, or ask a righteous person to do this for you. \n          \n-If things do not change, we advise you to have patience, to fear \n          Allaah and do your duty towards Him, and to persist in making du’aa’; \n          Allaah will make a way out for you. \n-If this goes on for a long time and causes difficulties for your \n          wife, there may be no option other than separation (divorce), and Allaah \n          will provide abundance for everyone of them from His bounty (cf. Al-Nisaa’ \n          4:130) \n-You have to have faith in Allaah and be optimistic. As time goes \n          by, things may change. \n We \n          ask Allaah to relieve your distress and to help you soon. And Allaah \n          is the source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is not only a legal contract but also a significant bond that is ideally based on mutual affection, understanding, and attraction. If a person finds himself married to someone he does not feel any attraction towards, several elements must be considered according to Islamic teachings.\n\n### Understanding Marriage in Islam\n\nMarriage is intended to provide companionship, love, and tranquility. In the Qur'an, it is stated:\n\n1. **Companionship and Peace**: \n   - \"And among His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed, in that are signs for a people who give thought.\" \n   (Surah Ar-Rum, 30:21)\n\nThis verse implies that the essence of marriage is not just about physical attraction but also about emotional and spiritual connection, which fosters peace and love.\n\n### Addressing Lack of Attraction\n\nIf a person finds himself not attracted to his spouse, it is essential to recognize that attraction can develop over time. However, if there are fundamental issues or incompatibilities, the following guidance can be applied:\n\n1. **Seek Understanding and Patience**: \n   - \"God wishes to lighten your burden; and man was created weak.\" (Surah An-Nisa, 4:28) \n   This verse highlights that human beings are weak; they require patience and understanding in relationships.\n\n2. **Possibility of Divorce**:\n   - \"O you who believe, when you marry believing women, then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' from them. But provide for them suitably and let them go in a good manner.\" (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:49)\n   \n   In instances where there is an irreconcilable lack of attraction or compatibility, divorce can be considered a valid option. The Qur'an emphasizes treating one’s spouse with respect and dignity during this process.\n\n3. **Consideration of Dowry and Financial Responsibilities**:\n   - If a divorce is pursued, a husband must ensure to fulfill his obligations regarding the dowry and provide for the wife appropriately, as indicated in the above verse (33:49).\n\n### Mutual Consent and Companionship\n\nThe Qur'an encourages mutual consent and understanding in marriage:\n\n- \"It is not lawful for you to take back any of your gifts (to your wives), except when both parties fear that they will not be able to keep within the limits prescribed by God.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:229)\n\nThis highlights the importance of mutual respect and understanding.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, when a person feels no attraction towards their spouse, it is essential to analyze the situation thoughtfully. Given the principles laid out in Islam concerning marriage, one should strive for understanding, patience, and, if necessary, consider divorce in an honorable and respectful manner. The overarching theme is that any decision made should maintain dignity and compassion, reflecting the values that Islam promotes in all human interactions.\n\nThroughout this process, turning to God in prayer and seeking guidance is of utmost importance, as God is aware of what is in the hearts (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:51)."

        "question": "He wants to limit having children because he is poor",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation \n          of the meanings) \n“And \n          no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due \n          from Allaah” [Hood \n          11:6] \n “And \n          so many a moving (living) creature carries not its own provision! Allaah \n          provides for it and for you. And He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Knower” \n          [al-‘Ankaboot \n          29:60] \n “Verily, \n          Allaah is the All‑Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong” [al-Dhaariyaat \n          51:58] \n “so \n          seek your provision from Allaah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and \n          be grateful to Him”\n[al-‘Ankaboot \n          29:17] \n Allaah condemned the people of the Jaahiliyyah \n          who killed their children for fear of poverty, and He forbade doing \n          what they did. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And \n          kill not your children for fear of poverty. We shall provide for them \n          as well as for you. Surely, the killing of them is a great sin” [al-Israa’ \n          17:31] \n Allaah has commanded His slaves to put \n          their trust in Him in all their affairs, and He is Sufficient for those \n          who put their trust in Him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n          \n “and \n          put your trust in Allaah if you are believers indeed” [al-Maa’idah 5:23] \n          \n “And \n          whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him” [al-Talaaq \n          65:3]. \n So you have to put your trust in your \n          Lord and believe that He will provide for you and your children. Do \n          not let the fear of poverty prevent you from seeking to have children, \n          for Allaah has guaranteed provision for all. By not wanting children \n          for fear of poverty, you are imitating the people of the Jaahiliyyah.\n You should also note that taking out \n          loans with interest is ribaa (usury), for which Allaah issues the warning \n          of a painful torment. It is one of the seven sins which condemn a person \n          to Hell. The Prophet  (peace and \n          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Avoid the seven sins  which \n          condemn a person to Hell…[which include] consuming ribaa.” And he  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has cursed \n          the one who consumes ribaa, the one who pays it…” Consumption of ribaa \n          is one of the greatest causes of poverty and loss of blessings, as Allaah \n          says (interpretation of the meaning): \n “Allaah \n          will destroy Ribaa and will give increase for Sadaqaat (deeds of charity, \n          alms)” [al-Baqarah 2:276]\n I think that you do \n          not know the ruling on interest-based loans. So seeks Allaah’s forgiveness \n          for what is in the past, and do not do it again. Wait for your Lord \n          to grant you a way out and seek provision from Him. Put your trust in \n          Him for Allaah loves those who put their trust in Him.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, raising children is viewed as a significant blessing and duty, but it comes with responsibilities that some may feel are daunting, especially when financial resources are limited. The belief in God's provision and mercy plays a crucial role in addressing concerns about financial capability in raising children.\n\n### Trust in God's Provision\n\nThe Quran emphasizes that God is aware of the struggles of individuals and assures that He provides sustenance according to His wisdom. One important verse is found in **Surah At-Talaq (Chapter 65), Ayah 3**, where it is stated:\n\n> “And provide for him from where he does not reckon. God is sufficient for him who places his trust in Him. Certainly, God fulfills His purpose. God has indeed fixed a measure of everything.”  \n> *(Surah At-Talaq 65:3)*\n\nThis verse reassures believers that reliance on God will lead to provision, even in times of financial difficulty.\n\n### Avoiding Offspring Out of Fear of Poverty\n\nIn addition, the Quran directly responds to concerns about financial dues in the context of childbirth and family size. In **Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), Ayah 233**, it mentions:\n\n> “... But no soul should be compelled beyond capacity...Neither the mother made to suffer for the child nor the father for his offspring...”  \n> *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:233)*\n\nThis highlights the Islamic principle that while there are responsibilities in parenting, one should not feel overwhelmed beyond their ability or means. It promotes a balance between having faith in God and recognizing personal and economic capabilities.\n\n### The Value of Children\n\nThe Quran also recognizes the deep concern one may have regarding the welfare of children and stresses the moral responsibility towards them, especially when discussing orphans and the vulnerable. In **Surah An-Nisa (Chapter 4), Ayah 9**, it is stated:\n\n> “Let people fear the day when they leave small children behind them unprovided, and how concerned they would be for them. So fear God and say the right things to them.”  \n> *(Surah An-Nisa 4:9)*\n\nThis verse emphasizes the moral and spiritual duty of parents and guardians to provide for their children, suggesting that fearing poverty as a reason to limit children should be reconsidered in light of divine trust and guidance.\n\n### Encouragement for Joint Support and Community\n\nThe Quran also encourages community support, which can ease the burden of parenting. In **Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), Ayah 267-270**, it is emphasized that when it comes to charity and giving, believers should contribute according to their means:\n\n> “...And do good to those near to you and to your companions, and to the traveler and to those whom your right hands possess. Surely, God does not like those who are self-deluding and boastful.”  \n> *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:267-270)*\n\nThis signifies that raising a family may not just be the burden of parents but can also involve extended support from their community.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn light of these teachings, while it’s understandable to be concerned about raising children when finances are tight, Islamic teachings encourage belief in God's provision, the moral obligation of caring for children, and the support of community. Limiting children strictly due to financial constraints may not align with the broader Islamic perspective, which calls for trust in God’s wisdom and communal responsibility. Thus, the decision should reflect both personal circumstances and faith in divine assistance and support."

        "question": "He\r\n      has found a religious woman but he does not find her appearance attractive\r\n      – should he marry her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If\n      you want to get married, then look for one who is religious, as the\n      Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised when he\n      said: “Choose the one who is religious, may your hands be rubbed with\n      dust [i.e., may you prosper].” There is no reason why a man should not\n      also look for other things, such as beauty etc., that will help him to\n      keep his gaze lowered. This is something which should be taken into\n      account. Hence the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\n      him) mentioned it when he said, “Women may be married for four things”\n      – and he mentioned beauty as one of them. If you are afraid that you may\n      treat this woman badly because you do not find her attractive, then do not\n      go ahead and marry her. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the decision to marry is influenced by multiple factors, including religious piety, physical attraction, and the compatibility of values between partners. When considering whether to marry a religious woman whom one does not find physically attractive, there are several important Quranic guidelines and teachings that can be referenced.\n\n### Importance of Religious Faith\n\nOne of the most pertinent verses regarding marriage is found in **Surah Al-Baqarah** (Surah 2, Ayah 221-224), which states:\n> \"Do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her. And do not marry your daughters to idolaters until they accept the faith. A servant who is a believer is better than an idolater even though you may like him. They invite you to Hell, but God calls you to Paradise and pardon by His grace.\" (Quran 2:221-223)\n\nThis verse emphasizes the significance of religious faith over physical attraction. It suggests that marrying someone whose beliefs align with Islamic teachings is more beneficial than marrying someone who may be more physically appealing but does not share the same faith.\n\n### The Nature of True Beauty\n\nAdditionally, **Surah Al-Mumtahanah** (Surah 60, Ayah 10-13) reinforces the idea that the worth of a believer is not solely based on external appearances. The emphasis here is on faith and mutual respect:\n> \"O believers, when believing women come over to you as refugees, then examine them. God alone is cognisant of their faith. If you find that they are believers, do not send them back to unbelievers... There is no sin if you marry them provided you give their dowers to them.\" (Quran 60:10)\n\nThis passage underscores the importance of examining a person’s faith and character.\n\n### The Choice of Marriage\n\nIn **Surah An-Nisa** (Surah 4, Ayah 24-25), it is mentioned:\n> \"Also forbidden are married women unless they are captives (of war). Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery... If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman, let him marry a maid who is a believer.\" (Quran 4:24-25)\n\nThis indicates that the pursuit of a pious partner is a priority, and if one finds a believing woman who meets the criteria of being religiously observant and righteous, she is indeed a worthy choice for marriage.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile physical attraction is a significant factor in any relationship, Islamic teachings prioritize compatibility in faith and character over outward beauty. A woman's religious conviction can often lead to a more stable and fulfilling partnership based on shared values and beliefs.\n\nTherefore, if he finds a religious woman who does not meet his standards of physical attractiveness, he may consider marrying her, as her faith and ethical comportment are of higher importance in the guidance of Quranic principles. Believers are reminded that true beauty is reflected in one's actions and faith and that they should seek partners that contribute positively to their spiritual journey.\n\nIn conclusion, he should weigh the benefits of marrying based on faith against his preferences for physical appearance, as faith is a strong foundation for a successful marriage according to Islamic values."

If there is no such intention, then it is permissible and is one of the actions of this world which is solely for enjoyment. It will not be rewarded, but there is no sin involved.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Marriage in Islam is fundamentally viewed as a social and spiritual contract that exists within the context of this world but carries implications for the Hereafter. The concept of marriage is found extensively in the Qur'an, emphasizing both the worldly and spiritual dimensions.\n\n**1. Marriage as a Worldly Action with Hereafter Implications**\n\nMarriage is mainly recognized as an action relevant to this world, integral to the social structure, family life, and moral framework of society. However, it is also intertwined with the spiritual and moral responsibilities that affect one's standing in the Hereafter.\n\nA key verse in this context is found in Surah Al-Baqarah:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221)**: \"And do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her. And do not marry your daughters to idolaters until they accept the faith. A servant who is a believer is better than an idolater even though you may like him. They invite you to Hell, but God calls you to Paradise and pardon by His grace. And He makes His signs manifest that men may haply take heed.\"\n\nThis verse illustrates that while marriage takes place in the realm of this world, it is imbued with spiritual consequences, such as the potential to lead one away from faith or toward it (based on whom one marries). \n\n**2. The Concept of Companionship and Fondness in Marriage**\n\nMarriage is also depicted as a means of companionship, which is a crucial aspect of life in this world, but is also aligned with divine guidance concerning morality and piety:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:223)**: \"Women are like fields for you; so seed them as you intend, but plan the future in advance. And fear God, and remember, you have to face Him in the end.\"\n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of approaching marriage thoughtfully and respectfully, reinforcing that actions in this world carry weight for one's fate in the Hereafter.\n\n**3. The Divine Origin of Marriage**\n\nIn Surah Ash-Shuraa, Allah discusses the creation of partners, indicating that marriage is divinely ordained:\n\n- **Surah Ash-Shuraa (42:11)**: \"Originator of the heavens and the earth, He has made your consorts from among you, and made pairs of cattle. He multiplies you in this way.\"\n\nThis reflects God's design for human relationships and reinforces the notion that marriage is part of divine will, affecting both this world and the next.\n\n**4. The Reward for Married Life and Good Deeds**\n\nMarriage is a precursor to the type of good deeds that lead to rewards in the Afterlife. In Surah Al-Kahf:\n\n- **Surah Al-Kahf (18:46)**: \"Wealth and children are only the gloss of this world, but good deeds that abide are better with your Lord for recompense, and better for expectation.\"\n\nHere, the value of marriage—while material and social—is aligned with the pursuit of good deeds, hinting at a holistic approach where marriage and righteous actions serve a higher purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn summary, marriage in Islam is certainly a primary action of this world—as a fundamental aspect of human social life—but it is also deeply interwoven with the spiritual beliefs and moral frameworks that influence one’s standing in the Hereafter. The Qur'an provides a clear message that marriage is both a worldly contract and a divine commandment that impacts the soul's journey beyond this life, underscoring the importance of responsibility and faith in such relationships."

        "question": "validity of a marriage",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Your wife’s brother can assume\n      the (wali) position. If there is not a brother then an uncle would do. He\n      second eldest son would also do, if he is an adult. In the absence of all\n      of these, an Islamic judge or the head of the Islamic center can renew the\n      contract. You don’t have to tell anyone about the reason. You can say\n      that you just want to renew it because you don’t feel good about the\n      first one. Publicity is not needed at all. There was an addition to my\n      answer to you, but apparently it was lost for one reason or another. Here\n      is the full answer once again:\nThe marriage\n      contract is void because it was made without fulfilling its necessary\n      conditions. One of these conditions is the readiness of the womb. This\n      means that the woman whom is to get married must have her womb unoccupied.\n      For example, a man may not marry a woman who is pregnant. He may not marry\n      a woman who was divorced until she is out of her idd’ah (a period where\n      a widow or a divorced woman may not marry). Also a man may not marry a\n      woman he has been having intercourse with until they both repent and she\n      gets her monthly period. This is a sign that her womb is clean. The\n      Prophet forbade Muslims to have intercourse with female slaves they bought\n      recently until they are certain that their wombs are clear from any\n      pregnancy. Waiting for the monthly period does this. In your case, the\n      marriage contract must be renewed. This is not a difficult thing to do.\n      The first boy is not Islamicly your son, as he was not created in his\n      mother’s womb through a valid marriage contract. Some scholars say he is\n      not to be called after you as he is born out of adultery. He is to be\n      called after his mother’s family. He is not to inherit you and you are\n      not to inherit him. As for the remaining children, they are yours and they\n      carry your name.

        "predicted_answer": "The validity of a marriage in Islam is governed by several factors as defined in the Quran, particularly regarding the conditions of marriage and divorce. These factors include the proper procedure for marriage, the rights and responsibilities of both spouses, and the rules surrounding divorce.\n\n### Key Elements Validating a Marriage:\n\n1. **Consent of the Parties**:\n   - A valid marriage requires the mutual consent of both parties. This is critical because forced marriages are not permissible in Islamic law. Although not explicitly stated in one verse, the emphasis on mutual agreement is reflected in various teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and the principles derived from the Quran.\n\n2. **Mahr (Dowry)**:\n   - The establishment of a mahr (dowry) is an essential aspect of the marriage contract. This is a gift from the husband to the wife, and it signifies the serious commitment of the husband to the marriage. The Quran says: \n     - \"There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry...\" (Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:236).\n     - This indicates that the dowry should be agreed upon as part of the marriage contract.\n\n3. **Witnesses**:\n   - The presence of witnesses during the marriage ceremony is crucial for validity. A minimum of two Muslim witnesses is required to validate the marriage. Although the Quran does not specifically mention marriage witnesses as explicitly as it does for divorce, the principle of having witnesses is drawn from the overall legal practice in Islamic jurisprudence.\n\n4. **Capacity and Legal Age**:\n   - Both parties must have the legal capacity to marry, meaning they should have reached maturity (baligh) and must not be prohibited from marrying due to family relations or other legal constraints. This is implied in the teachings surrounding consent and safeguarding marital rights.\n\n5. **Divorce and Marriage Validity**:\n   - The conditions and procedures concerning divorce can also reflect back on the understanding and practices around marriage. For instance, a divorce must be conducted in an Islamic manner, as seen in the verses regarding divorce:\n     - \"O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them in their waiting period...\" (Quran, Surah At-Talaq 65:1).\n     - This verse highlights the importance of following correct procedures regarding separation, which underscores the sanctity and seriousness surrounding marriage.\n\n6. **WWaiting Period (Iddah)**:\n   - When a marriage ends, the wife must observe a waiting period (iddah), during which she cannot remarry. This period serves multiple purposes, including ensuring that there are no misunderstandings regarding potential pregnancy. The Quran states:\n     - \"When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably...\" (Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:232).\n     - This denotes that once the waiting period is completed, the divorced woman has the right to remarry, which validates her autonomy even after divorce.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn essence, the validity of a marriage in Islam is rooted in clear consent, the provision of a dowry, the existence of witnesses, and the adherence to proper procedures both in marriage and divorce. The numerous verses in the Quran emphasize the importance of following these guidelines, ensuring that both spouses uphold their rights and obligations within the marital bond."

        "question": "The wife’s    family want to do forbidden things during the wedding party",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What the girls family wants to do is undoubtedly haraam and is unacceptable. It is not permissible to please people by doing something that angers Allaah. We do not advise you at all to start your married life with haraam actions. The Muslim should disassociate himself and his family from the idea that his wife is a cheap product to be looked at by all and sundry when she is wearing all her make-up and jewellery etc.\nWe advise you to deal with the situation by doing the following:\n\n\nYou should advise them, politely, and explain to them the Islamic ruling concerning what they are planning to do. Warn them of the wrath of Allaah, and explain to them that music and mixing are haraam. Tell them that they could still have a successful wedding without these haraam things, and it is not in their interests at all in this world or in the Hereafter to respond to the blessing of Allaah, i.e., their daughters marriage, by disobeying Him and going against His commands and doing things that anger Him.\n\n\nIf that does not work, look for some wise people among their family and relatives, and from your own family too, who they think highly of and who you hope can help. Perhaps Allaah will decree that you will find a way out through them, and they will give up these evil things even if it is through pressure and embarrassment.\n\n\nIf that does not work, look for intervention on the part of someone who is knowledgeable and wise, whom they respect and look up to. Perhaps he will make them feel ashamed, or will be able to convince them that what they want to do is wrong, so they will give it up.\n\n\nIf none of this works, perhaps you can threaten them with divorce or separation. They might pay attention to that, because it would make them look bad in front of other people, so they will give up that which has been forbidden by Allaah. Perhaps leaving a long time between the nikaah (marriage contract) and the wedding party will have the result of convincing these people.\nIf they do not respond at all, then we would seriously warn you against getting involved with these people. But if the girl is religious and good-mannered, and she does not agree with what her family are doing, and you and she are able not to be present when the haraam things are happening, and you can leave the party when they start doing things that anger Allaah, and also announce your objections and state that you are disassociating yourselves from what is going to happen, (this is fine). Remember the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): then sit not with them (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them [al-Nisaa 4:140]. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it\nAnd Allaah is the source of help; to Him we complain and in Him we put our trust.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, wedding celebrations are significant events meant to honor the sanctity of marriage. However, it is important that these celebrations remain within the parameters of what is considered permissible (halal) according to Islamic teachings. If the bride’s family wishes to engage in forbidden activities during the wedding party—such as promoting immodesty, consuming alcohol, or engaging in gambling—this presents a dilemma for the couple and their families. \n\n### 1. Importance of Following Islamic Principles\n\nMuslims are advised to conduct their lives, including celebrations, according to the guidelines laid out in the Quran and Hadith. Engaging in forbidden acts undermines the very foundation of a marriage and can lead to negative consequences both in this life and the hereafter.\n\n**Quran References:**\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:90-91):** “O believers, this wine and gambling, these idols, and these arrows you use for divination, are all acts of Satan; so keep away from them. You may haply prosper. Satan only wishes to create among you enmity and hatred through wine and gambling, and to divert you from the remembrance of God and prayer. Will you therefore not desist?” \n\nThis verse emphasizes the prohibition of wine and gambling and how they can lead to division among people, which can spoil a joyful occasion like a wedding.\n\n### 2. Setting Boundaries\n\nIt is crucial for those involved in planning the wedding to set clear boundaries against engaging in any prohibited activities. The bride and groom should communicate their values and expectations to their families to ensure the wedding aligns with their beliefs.\n\n**Quran References:**\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:19):** “O believers, you are not allowed to take perforce the women (of dead relatives) into your heritage, or tyrannize over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them, unless they are guilty of open adultery. Live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them. For it may well be you may not like a thing, yet God may have endued it with much goodness.”\n\nThis verse advises us to engage with others justly, even if there are disagreements. In a wedding setting, this might translate into approaching family matters with patience and understanding.\n\n### 3. Divine Guidance and Prayer\n\nIt is vital to pray for guidance and help from Allah in maintaining the integrity of your event. When faced with such difficulties, seeking wisdom through prayer can help in making sound decisions.\n\n**Quran Reference:**\n- **Surah Al-Anfal (8:9):** \"And when you sought help from your Lord, and He answered you: 'Indeed, I will reinforce you with a thousand from the angels, following one another.'\"\n  \nThis highlights the importance of seeking divine support when facing difficulties.\n\n### 4. Refusing Forbidden Practices\n\nIf the family continues to insist on engaging in forbidden practices, the couple must take a firm stand. It is permissible to decline such traditions that conflict with Islamic teachings, as preserving the principles of faith takes precedence over satisfying cultural expectations.\n\n**Quran Reference:**\n- **Surah Al-Tahrim (66:1-2):** “O Prophet, why should you forbid (yourself) what God has made lawful for you, in order to please your wives? Yet God is forgiving and kind.” \n\nThis indicates the necessity of prioritizing what is lawful over familial or social pressures.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while weddings are celebratory occasions, Islam calls for them to be conducted with respect to its teachings. If the bride’s family wishes to partake in forbidden activities, it is essential that the couple communicates their values firmly and seeks to create an event that adheres to Islam's principles. Remember that the success of a marriage begins on a foundation of obedience to God and His commandments, reflected even in the celebration of that marriage."

        "question": "He    loves his cousin and wants to marry her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Your maternal uncles daughter is not counted as one of your mahrams, so the same rulings apply to her as to other women who are strangers to you (i.e., non-mahrams). One of these rulings is that it is permissible for you to marry her. But we should note an important point, which is that even though love is something nice, and it is mustahabb for a man to marry a woman whom he loves, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: there is nothing better for two who love one another than marriage\n(Saheeh al-Jaami, no 5200), nevertheless, this love should not be overwhelming and cause a person to forget other characteristics which he should look for in the person he wants to marry. The most important characteristic is religious commitment. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A woman may be married for four things her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her commitment to religion. Choose the one who is religious, may your hands be rubbed with dust [i.e., may you prosper]! (Agreed upon). If your cousin is religious and has a good attitude, then you have chosen well and we ask Allaah to fulfil your hopes and bring you together in a good way. If she is not, then think again about your choice. May Allaah help you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marrying one's cousin is permissible, and this is supported by various verses from the Quran and established Islamic jurisprudence. There are specific guidelines provided in the Quran regarding marriage, but marrying a cousin is not prohibited.\n\n### Verses and Their Interpretations:\n\n1. **Surah An-Nisa (Chapter 4), Ayah 22-23**: \n   - **Verse**: \"Unlawful are your mothers and daughters and your sisters to you, and the sisters of your fathers and your mothers, and the daughters of your brothers and sisters, and foster mothers, foster sisters, and the mothers of your wives, and the daughters of the wives you have slept with who are under your charge; but in case you have not slept with them there is no offence (if you marry their daughters)...\"\n   - **Interpretation**: This verse outlines the prohibited degrees of kinship for marriage. Cousins are not mentioned in this list, indicating that marrying cousins is permissible (Surah An-Nisa 4:23).\n\n2. **Surah Al-Ahzab (Chapter 33), Ayah 50**: \n   - **Verse**: \"We have made lawful for you, O Prophet, wives to whom you have given their dower, and God-given maids and captives you have married, and the daughters of your father's brothers and daughters of your father's sisters, and daughters of your mother's brothers and sisters, who migrated with you...\"\n   - **Interpretation**: This verse mentions that the daughters of one's paternal or maternal aunts and uncles (cousins) are lawful for marriage. This further supports the idea that marrying cousins is allowed (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:50).\n\n3. **Cultural and Historical Context**: Historically, cousin marriages have been practiced in many cultures, including Arab culture during the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Prophet himself had family relations through marriage to his cousins.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, your cousin is permissible to marry in Islam. The Quran supports this through its verses that define prohibited and permissible relationships. In the Islamic tradition, such unions are often encouraged within the community to strengthen familial bonds. As always, it’s advisable to seek consent from both parties involved and that the marriage is conducted according to Islamic principles."

        "question": "Attributes    of the ideal Muslim husband",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your eagerness to find out the attributes which will help you to choose a righteous husband, in shaa Allah. There follows a description of the most important qualities which should be present in the man whom you choose or accept to be your husband and the father of your children, if Allah decrees that you will have children.\nReligious commitment. This is the most important thing to look for in the man you want to marry. The husband should be a Muslim who adheres to all the laws and teachings of Islam in his daily life. The woman’s guardian (wali) should strive to check out this matter and not rely only on outward appearances. One of the most important things to ask about is the man’s prayer (salaah); the one who neglects the rights of Allah is more likely to neglect the rights of others. The true believer does not oppress or mistreat his wife; if he loves her, he honours her, and if he does not love her, he does not mistreat or humiliate her. It is very rare to find this attitude among those who are not sincere Muslims. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):\n“and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you” [al-Baqarah 2:221]\n“Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwaa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]” [al-Hujuraat 49:13]\n“Good statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or good men for good women)” [al-Noor 24:26]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n“If there comes to you one whose religious commitment and attitude pleases you, then marry [your female relative who is under your care] to him, for if you do not do that, there will be tribulation on earth and much corruption.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1084).\nAs well as being religiously committed, it is preferable that he should come from a good family and a known lineage. If two men come to propose marriage to one woman, and they are equal in terms of religious commitment, then preference should be given to the one who comes from a good family that is known for its adherence to the commands of Allah, so long as the other person is not better than him in terms of religious commitment – because the righteousness of the husband’s close relatives could be passed on to his children and his good origins and lineage may make him refrain from many foolish and cheap actions. The righteousness of the father and grandfather are beneficial to the children and grandchildren. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the town; and there was under it a treasure belonging to them; and their father was a righteous man, and your Lord intended that they should attain their age of full strength and take out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord” [al-Kahf 18:82].\nSee how Allah protected their father’s wealth for the two boys after the father died, as an honour to him because of his righteousness and taqwaa. By the same token, if the husband comes from a righteous family and his parents are good, Allah will make things easy for him and protect him as an honour to his parents.\nIt is good if he has sufficient wealth to keep him and his family from having to ask people for anything, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her), when she came to consult him about three men who had proposed marriage to her, “As for Mu’aawiyah, he is a poor man who has no wealth…” (Narrated by Muslim, 1480). It is not essential that he should be a businessman or rich, it is sufficient for him to have an income that will keep him and his family from having to ask people for anything. If there is a choice between a man who is religiously committed and a man who is wealthy, then the religious man should be given preference over the wealthy man.\nIt is preferable that he should be kind and gentle towards women, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Qays, in the hadeeth quoted above, “As for Abu Jaham, his stick never leaves his shoulder”, referring to the fact that he used to beat women a lot.\nIt is good if he is sound of body and healthy, free of faults, sickness, etc., and not disabled or sterile.\nIt is preferable that he should have knowledge of the Qur’aan and Sunnah; if you find someone like this it is good, otherwise you should realize that this is something rare.\nIt is permissible for the woman to look at the man who comes to propose marriage, and for him to look at her. This should be in the presence of her mahram, and it is not permitted to look more than is necessary, or for him to see her alone, or for her to go out with him on her own, or to meet repeatedly for no reason.\nAccording to Islam, the woman’s wali (guardian) should check on the man who proposes marriage to the woman who is under his guardianship; he should ask those whom he trusts among those who mix with him and who know him, about his commitment to Islam and his trustworthiness. He should ask them for an honest opinion and sincere, sound advice.\nBefore and during all of this, you must turn towards Allah and pray to Him to make it easy for you and help you to make a good choice and to grant you wisdom. Then after all these efforts, when you have decided on a particular person, you should pray Istikhaarah, asking Allah for that which is good. For more details on Salaat al-Istikhaarah, please see Question  2217. Then after you have done your utmost, put your trust in Allah, for He is the best of helpers, may He be glorified.\nAdapted from Jaami’ Ahkaam al-Nisaa’ by Shaykh Mustafaa al-‘Adawi.\nWe ask Allah, the Exalted, the Powerful, to make things easy for you, to help you make a wise choice, and to bless you with a righteous husband and good offspring, for He is Able to do all that. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "predicted_answer": "An ideal Muslim husband is characterized by a number of attributes that align with principles outlined in the Quran and Hadith. Here, I will discuss several of these key attributes and provide relevant verses from the Quran, particularly focusing on Surah Al-Ahzab (Chapter 33), which addresses various aspects of marriage, family, and interpersonal relationships.\n\n### 1. **Faithfulness and Loyalty**\nA husband must be loyal and committed to his wife. The Quran emphasizes the importance of dealing justly with one's spouse. In Surah Al-Ahzab, it states:\n\n> \"You may defer the turn of any of your wives you like, and may take any other you desire. There is no harm if you take any of those (whose turn) you had deferred. This would be better as it would gladden their hearts and they will not grieve, and each will be happy with what you have given her. God knows what is in your heart, for He is all-wise and benign.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:51)\n\nThis verse shows that a husband should manage relationships with his wives (if he has multiple) with care, ensuring they feel valued and secure.\n\n### 2. **Respect and Honor**\nMuslim husbands are expected to treat their wives with honor and respect. This includes treating them as partners and not as possessions. The Quran instructs:\n\n> \"O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' of them. But provide suitably for them, and let them go with honour.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:49)\n\nThis highlights the importance of giving women their due respect and support, even in the event of a divorce.\n\n### 3. **Financial Responsibility & Provision**\nAn ideal husband should provide for his family’s needs, not just materially but also emotionally and spiritually. One of the messages in Surah Al-Baqarah reflects on the obligation of a husband to support his spouse:\n\n> \"When they are free of it, you may go to them as God has enjoined. For God loves those who seek pardon, and those who are clean.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:222)\n\nAdditionally, the Quran stresses empowerment through provision as a sign of a good husband:\n\n> “Do not marry your daughters to idolaters until they accept the faith. A servant who is a believer is better than an idolater even though you may like him.”  \n> (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:221)\n\nThis verse can be understood to imply that the true value in relationships lies in mutual worship and support.\n\n### 4. **Compassion and Kindness**\nBeing compassionate and kind is vital in a marital relationship. The Quran emphasizes goodwill amongst spouses:\n\n> \"God desires to remove impurities from you, O inmates of this house, and to cleanse and bring out the best in you.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:33)\n\nFurther, it illustrates that husbands should strive to reflect the best of their characters towards their wives.\n\n### 5. **Obedience to God’s Guidance**\nAn ideal husband should embody faith and submission to God’s commandments, fostering a religiously aligned household:\n\n> \"Verily men and women who have come to submission, men and women who are believers, men and women who are devout, truthful men and truthful women...\"  \n> (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:35)\n\nThis reinforces that spiritual alignment is key to harmonious family life.\n\n### 6. **Good Character and Communication**\nCommunication is essential for lasting relationships. The Quran advises kindness in speech:\n\n> \"If you are mindful of God, do not be too obliging in your speech, lest some one sick of heart should covet your person; so say only customary things.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:32)\n\nThis suggests that men must be aware of their words and communicate effectively with their wives.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe attributes of an ideal Muslim husband include faithfulness, respect, support, compassion, obedience to God's will, and effective communication. It is essential for a husband to create an environment of love, loyalty, and mutual respect, fostering a strong family unit based on Islamic teachings. Each of these qualities is found within the context of various Quranic verses, particularly within Surah Al-Ahzab, which offers comprehensive guidance for marital relationships."

        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the question of a woman seeking to get married despite the context of her mother having conceived her out of wedlock, it’s essential to consider Islamic teachings on marriage, legitimacy, and the status of individuals born in such circumstances.\n\n1. **Legitimacy and Marriage**: In Islam, the legitimacy of a person—whether born within or outside of wedlock—does not determine their worth or their ability to marry. The Qur'an places emphasis on the character of an individual rather than the circumstances of their birth. Allah states in **Surah Al-‘Anfal (8:28)**: “And know that your properties and your children are but a trial and that Allah has with Him a great reward.” This verse indicates that the value of an individual is tied to their faith and actions rather than their lineage or circumstances of birth.\n\n2. **Marriage as a Purpose**: The Qur'an encourages marriage as a means of seeking companionship and protection against sinful behavior. In **Surah An-Nisa (4:24)**, Allah mentions the importance of lawful unions, stating: “Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery.” This highlights that marriage is a noble act, and one should seek to marry with the intent of commitment and righteousness, regardless of any familial circumstances.\n\n3. **Seeking Marriage Despite Past Circumstances**: The case of Mary (Maryam), who was a miraculous birth, emphasizes that extraordinary circumstances should not deter one from pursuing a meaningful life. The honor and noble status of Mary as detailed in **Surah Maryam (19:16-22)** is an example of the respect and reverence held for her, despite the unusual nature of her birth.  \n   - “And mention, when the angels said, 'O Mary, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary – distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought near [to Allah],’” (19:19).  \n   This verse portrays that divine messages and destinies are not constrained by human societal norms regarding lineage.\n\n4. **Emphasis on Character and Faith**: In Islam, the most crucial aspects in the context of marriage are the faith and characteristics of the individuals involved. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"A woman is married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty, and her religion. So you should strive for the one who is religiously inclined; may your hands be rubbed with dust\" (Sahih al-Bukhari). Thus, the focal point is the spiritual and moral qualities of the potential partner.\n\n5. **Social Misunderstanding and Stigmatization**: The Qur'an encourages compassion and understanding, urging the community to treat everyone with justice and kindness. **Surah Al-Hujurat (49:11)** advises: “O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them.” This reinforces the idea that societal judgments should not cloud the merciful and just treatment of individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, a woman seeking to get married in the context of her mother's circumstances has every right to do so in Islam, upheld by numerous teachings that emphasize character, faith, and the inherent worth of each individual. The focus should be on seeking a partner who is righteous and aligns with her values in faith, regardless of familial history."

        "question": "Does Anal Sex Break Nikah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (Have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus ), when or how you will, and send (good deeds, or ask Allah to bestow upon you pious offspring) for your ownselves beforehand. And fear Allah, and know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give good tidings to the believers (O Muhammad).” [Al-Baqarah 2:223]\nFrom the word Harth (tilth) we understand that what is permissible is only in the vagina (the front passage), especially because this is what will produce children. The semen that is planted in the womb from which offspring come is likened to the seeds which are planted in the ground, from which vegetation comes, as both of them are substances from which something else is produced.\nThe phrase translated as when or how you will means, in any manner you wish, from behind or from the front, sitting or with the wife lying on her back or on her side, so long as it is in the place of tilth (i.e., the vagina, the place from which a baby is born).\nThe poet said:\nThe wombs are lands for us to till; we have to plant the seeds and whatever grows is up to Allah.\nIt was reported from Khuzaymah ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah is not too shy to tell you the truth: do not have intercourse with your wives in the anus .” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 5/213; a good Hadith)\nIbn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will not look at a man who has intercourse with his wife in her anus .” (Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 3/529; narrated and classed as authentic by At-Tirmidhi, 1165) (See Nayl Al-Maram by Siddiq Hasan Khan, 1/151-154)\nIf a man does this, his wife is not considered to be divorced as many people think, because there is no Shar`i evidence at all that indicates this. But the scholars said that if a man habitually does this, his wife has the right to ask for a divorce, because he is an evildoer who is causing harm by his action, and also because the purpose of marriage cannot be achieved through this action. The wife has to resist this evil action and remind her husband about Allah and about the punishment for transgressing the limits set by Allah. If the husband repents to Allah from this deed, there is no reason why she should not stay with him, and there is no need to renew the marriage contract. \nFor more details, please see the following answers: 5560 , 10053 , 23339 , and 1202 .\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the issue of anal intercourse (anal sex) between married couples is a subject of debate among scholars and is generally considered forbidden (haram) based on the general principles laid down in Islamic texts, although specific verses from the Quran do not directly address this act. The consensus is largely derived from the Hadith literature and the interpretations offered by various scholars.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n**1. Purpose of Marriage and Sexual Relations:**\nIn Islam, the primary purpose of marriage is to form a family unit and to maintain a healthy and fulfilling sexual relationship within the bounds of lawful conduct. The Quran emphasizes lawful sexual relations. \n\nReferencing **Surah Al-Mu’minun (23:6)**:\n> “Except from their wives or those whom their right hands possess, for indeed, they will not be blamed.” \n>\n- (Surah Al-Mu’minun, Ayah 6)\n\n**2. General Guidelines on Sexual Conduct:**\nIslam promotes intimacy between spouses but encourages it to be within the natural parameters. The absence of explicit mention of anal intercourse in the Quran leads to the interpretation that this form of intimacy is discouraged or forbidden. The Hadith literature further elucidates this aspect.\n\nFor example, in a well-known Hadith narrated in Sahih Muslim, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:\n> \"Cursed is the one who approaches his wife through her anus.\" \n>\nThis hadith underscores the prohibition against anal intercourse.\n\n**3. Consequences of Anal Intercourse:**\nEngaging in anal intercourse is often viewed as detrimental to a healthy marriage given its potential implications for the relationship, which is meant to be built on mutual love, respect, and compassion.\n\n> “And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy.” \n>\n- (Surah Ar-Rum, Ayah 21)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, anal sex would not nullify a marriage (nikah) but is considered haram and discouraged. Engaging in such acts does not break the marriage contract, but it can be seen as a violation of the moral and ethical guidelines set forth by the religion. \n\nTherefore, while one may remain married, such acts may invite disapproval from God and could have spiritual consequences for the individuals involved. \n\n### Supporting References:\n- **Surah Al-Mu’minun (23:6)**: Discusses lawful sexual relationships.\n- **Hadith in Sahih Muslim**: Explicitly warns against anal intercourse.\n- **Surah Ar-Rum (30:21)**: Highlights the foundational purpose of marital relationships.\n\nFor a deeper understanding, consulting with a knowledgeable scholar or cleric may provide individualized guidance tailored to specific circumstances."

        "question": "Is      it possible to be pious without being married?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not essential to be married in order to enter Paradise, but if a person fears that he may do something forbidden, then he has to get married. If he does not get married in this case, then he is making a mistake.\nWith regard to your second point, it is possible for a person to be pious without being married, but this is rare. Usually no one forgoes getting married except one who is either impotent or promiscuous, as ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) said to a man who had not got married: “Nothing is keeping you from getting married except either impotence or immorality.”\nIn any case, Islam urges people to get married and considers marriage to be one of the ways of the Messengers; it is forbidden to forego getting married even if the intention is to devote oneself to worship. “There is no monasticism in Islam.”\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is indeed possible to be pious without being married. Piety is a broader concept that encompasses one's relationship with God, adherence to His commandments, and the cultivation of moral and ethical character. The Quran and Hadith do not state that marriage is a prerequisite for piety or righteousness; rather, being single can also be a valid and respected choice for those who are dedicated to worship and good deeds.\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Piety Beyond Marriage**: \n   The Quran emphasizes that piety is rooted in faith and righteous actions, regardless of one’s marital status. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:177), Allah delineates the qualities of righteousness, including belief in God, the Day of Judgment, angels, Scripture, and the Prophets, along with performing acts of charity, prayer, and fulfilling promises. Marriage is not mentioned as a requirement for piety.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:177)**:  \n   \"Righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is in one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, and the Prophets and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zakah; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous.\" \n\n2. **Voluntary Celibacy**: \n   For some individuals, the choice to remain unmarried and focus on their spiritual journey may lead to greater piety and dedication to worship. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:236-237), it is stated that there is no harm in proposing marriage or maintaining intentions towards it, but the path of abstention can also be a sign of dedication and self-discipline.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:236)**:  \n   \"There is no sin on you if you propose marriage to women, or hide that within yourselves...\"  \n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:237)**:  \n   \"And if you divorce them before you have touched them, and you have specified for them a compensation, then [give] half of what you specified, unless they forgo the right, or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract forgoes it. And to forgo is nearer to righteousness. And do not forget the favor among yourselves. Indeed Allah is Seeing of what you do.\"\n\n3. **Spiritual Focus**: \n   The Quran encourages believers to prioritize God, even in the context of family and marriage. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2) emphasizes helping one another in goodness and piety, which can transcend marital status.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2)**:  \n   \"O you who have believed, do not violate the sanctity of the rites of Allah or of the sacred month or of the sacrificial animals or of those coming to the Sacred House seeking the bounty and pleasure of their Lord. And when you have completed the pilgrimage, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.\"\n\n4. **Respect for Individual Choices**: \n   Individuals are encouraged to seek what is best for their spiritual and personal well-being. The Quran recognizes that some may choose to remain single and suggests that patience and control over one’s desires can be a valuable personal trait.\n\n   - **Surah An-Nisa (4:25)**:  \n   \"And whoever among you cannot [find] the funds to marry free, believing women, then he may marry those whom your right hands possess of believing young women. And Allah is Knowing of your faith. You are of one another. So marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due compensation, according to what is acceptable...\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Islam permits individuals to be pious without being married. A person's devotion, good deeds, and relationship with God define their piety far more than their marital status. Thus, singles can live fulfilling lives devoted to worship, charity, and moral conduct, embodying the principles of Islam in their actions and interactions."

        "question": "Differences\r\n      between Muslim and non-Muslim weddings",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There are many differences between Muslim and non-Muslim\n    weddings, such as: the condition that the woman must have a wali or\n    guardian to marry her off, the condition that there be witnesses and that\n    the marriage be announced, that the woman cannot be a mahram (close blood\n    relative) of the man, and that the wedding does not have to take place in a\n    mosque.\nThe groom can wear any kind of clothing that has been\n    permitted by Allaah, and it does not have to be any specific colour.\nIt is not permitted for the couple to exchange rings,\n    because this is an innovation that has been newly invented in the religion,\n    and is even worse if the man wears a gold ring because gold is forbidden for\n    men in Islam. It is mustahabb (recommended) for women in particular to sing\n    at weddings and to use the daff (hand-drum), but not any other kind of\n    musical instruments.\nIt is not permissible for men and women to mix, at weddings\n    or at any other time, or for the groom to sit with his bride in front of the\n    women.\nIf the women are alone and no men can see them, it is\n    permissible for them to dance, so long as this will not cause undue\n    provocation of desires.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Weddings in Islam hold significant spiritual, cultural, and communal importance and differ markedly from various non-Muslim wedding traditions. Here are the principal differences, supported by relevant verses from the Qur'an.\n\n### 1. **Witnesses**\n\nIn Islamic weddings, the presence of witnesses is a critical requirement. Two adult witnesses are needed for the marriage contract (nikah) to be valid. This requirement underscores the importance of community and accountability in Islamic marriages.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- *“...and get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses, so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her.”* (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:282).\n\n### 2. **Marriage Contract (Nikah)**\n\nThe marriage contract (nikah) in Islam is a formal agreement that outlines the rights and responsibilities of both spouses. It often includes the payment of a dower (mahr) by the groom to the bride, which signifies respect and acknowledgment of her rights.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- *“And give the women [upon marriage] their bridal gifts (mahr) graciously...”* (Surah An-Nisa, 4:24).\n\n### 3. **Restrictions on Who Can Marry**\n\nIslam outlines explicit guidelines about whom Muslims can marry. It prohibits Muslims from marrying polytheists (pagans/idolaters) and limits the marriage of Muslim men to chaste women from the People of the Book (Jews and Christians). \n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- *“Do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. And do not marry your daughters to idolaters until they accept the faith. A believer is better than an idolater even though you may like him.”* (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:221).\n\n### 4. **Role of the Family**\n\nIn Islamic weddings, family involvement in the marriage process is significant, emphasizing the importance of approval and mutual consent. Both families often take part in the decision-making, and the bride's family typically has a significant role in the arrangements.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- *“And marry those among you who are single, and those who are fit among your male and female slaves. If they are poor, God will enrich them from His bounty.”* (Surah An-Nur, 24:32).\n\n### 5. **Conduct During the Ceremony**\n\nIslamic wedding ceremonies emphasize modesty and the avoidance of extravagance. The nikah is often conducted in a simple, dignified manner, focusing on prayers and blessings rather than elaborate celebrations. \n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- *“The most blessed marriage is that which is easiest.”* (As mentioned in various Hadiths).\n\n### 6. **Durations of Prohibition on Remarriage**\n\nIf the marriage ends in divorce, there are guidelines regarding the waiting period (iddah) for the wife before she can remarry. This waiting period, typically three menstrual cycles, ensures that there are no confusions regarding paternity should the wife be pregnant.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- *“O you who have believed, when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them, there is no waiting period for you to count concerning them...”* (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:49).\n\n### 7. **Religious Blessings**\n\nThe concept of seeking God's blessings through prayer is fundamental in an Islamic wedding. The couple often recites specific prayers (duas) to invoke God's guidance and blessing in their marital life.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- *\"And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy...\"* (Surah Ar-Rum, 30:21).\n\n### 8. **Prohibition of Extravagance**\n\nIslam places a strong emphasis on moderation in all aspects of life, including weddings. Extravagance and excess in spending are discouraged, aligning with the principle of being prudent and responsible with one's resources.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- *“And do not waste [resources], for indeed, He does not like the wasteful.”* (Surah Al-An'am, 6:141).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMuslim weddings are deeply rooted in religious principles and cultural practices that emphasize justice, respect, community, and spiritual partnership. The marriage contract and the participation of family, along with adherence to Islamic laws regarding marriage, define the unique character of weddings in Islam, setting them apart from many non-Muslim traditions."

        "question": "She does not want to go through another bad\r\n    marriage",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The information you have stated about this\n    second person is not encouraging. The fact that he calls a non-mahram woman on a daily\n    basis is cause for suspicion. It is not necessary to call her every in order to find out\n    her opinion and her response. The promises that he spoke about may be genuine or may not\n    be. Hence our advice to you is as follows:\nTry to ask others about him, and about the new situation he claims to be\n    in. Maybe you will find that he has some righteous female relatives who will be able to\n    give you some useful pointers. Of course, asking questions and checking information will\n    take time, but that does not matter, because of the seriousness of the issue. If, after\n    you have found out about the mosque where he prays, the classes he attends, or the books\n    and tapes he reads and listens to, you feel that he is most likely sincere and if you feel\n    that you are able to cope with the possibility of a second failed marriage – Allaah\n    forbid – and that it would not be too great a loss if you were to leave him after\n    discovering that he is a hypocrite and a cheat, then we see no reason why you should not\n    marry him. You can set out conditions and make clear requests in the marriage contract,\n    such as requiring that he do all the prayers on time, and give up major sins like drinking\n    alcohol, committing immoral actions, and so on. Tell him that you are going to take him at\n    face value and deal with him on that basis. Also, do not forget to pray Istikhaarah. We\n    ask Allaah to help you make the right decision and to guide you. May Allaah bless our\n    Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace.",
        "predicted_answer": "The concerns regarding a bad marriage are valid, and within the framework of Islamic teachings, guidance is offered regarding marriage and divorce. If a woman is apprehensive about entering into another marriage due to a previous bad experience, the Qur'an provides several verses that outline rights, guidance, and the options available to her, emphasizing kindness, justice, and consultation in marital matters.\n\n### 1. Rights of Women and Fair Treatment\n\nThe Qur'an emphasizes the rights of women and the importance of treating them justly. Surah An-Nisa (4:19) states:\n\n> \"O believers, you are not allowed to take perforce the women (of dead relatives) into your heritage, or tyrannise over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them, unless they are guilty of open adultery. Live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them. For it may well be you may not like a thing, yet God may have endued it with much goodness.\" (Surah An-Nisa, 4:19)\n\nThis verse signifies that even in difficult situations, kindness should prevail, and that one may discover good in situations that initially appear unfavorable.\n\n### 2. Divorce as a Consideration\n\nIf a woman has experienced issues in her previous marriage, such as abuse or mistreatment, she may consider divorce. The Qur'an outlines the process and rights associated with divorce in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:229-231):\n\n> \"Divorce is (revokable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honourably, or part with them in a decent way... When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:229-231)\n\nThese verses highlight that divorce should be approached with seriousness and compassion. After divorce, women have the right to remarry and should not be prevented from moving on with their lives.\n\n### 3. Remarriage and Waiting Periods\n\nThe waiting period (iddah) after a divorce is also specified, which is three cycles for women who are menstruating (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:228). After this period, women are free to marry again, which emphasizes the notion that they have the right to choose their partners freely:\n\n> \"When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honourably (by revoking the divorce), or let them go with honour, and do not detain them with the intent of harassing lest you should transgress.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:231)\n\n### 4. Fear of God and Mutual Respect\n\nThe importance of both partners acting within the bounds set by God is reiterated throughout the marriage and divorce discussions in these verses. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:227), it states:\n\n> \"And if they are bent on divorce, God hears all and knows everything.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:227)\n\nThis acknowledges that both parties' intentions are known by God, urging fairness and consideration in decisions regarding marriage and divorce.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor a woman hesitant about entering into another marriage due to past negative experiences, it is crucial to remember the principles of justice, kindness, and the recognition of her rights laid out in the Qur'an. Engaging in a new marriage should be approached with careful consideration, ensuring an environment of mutual respect and open communication. Consulting knowledgeable individuals within her community for advice and support can also provide additional comfort and guidance in making such significant decisions."

        "question": "He wants to commit suicide because they rejected his marriage proposal",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\"And do not kill yourselves. Surely, Allaah is Most merciful to you. And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire\" [al-Nisa' 4:29-30]\n\nNo matter what psychological pressure or extreme distress befalls him, the Muslim cannot go ahead and kill himself, because he knows that the punishment for that is Hell and a painful torment, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\n\"Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself, he will be in the Fire of Hell throwing himself down for ever and ever. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will have the poison in his hand, drinking it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron [a weapon] will have that piece of iron in his hand, stabbing himself in the stomach with it in the Fire of Hell forever and ever.\" (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5778).\n\nStarving oneself to death by refusing food is also a kind of suicide and deliberately killing oneself. How can a Muslim who believes in Allaah and the Last Day think of trying to move from the suffering of this world to the suffering of the Hereafter, which is more severe and more long-lasting? No sane person would do this. And for what? For a woman, when you could always find another woman to marry, for there are many women besides this one. Moreover, circumstances may change, and they may change their minds and agree to the marriage after a while. You could look for a college or school in your country that is only for women, which your wife could join, and that would solve a part of the problem. Whatever the case, you have to seek the help of Allaah and persevere with sabr (patience).\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\"And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\" [al-Talaaq 65:2]\n\"Allaah will grant after hardship, ease.\" [al-Talaaq 65:7]\n\nWe also suggest that you refer to the book \"Alhomoom - Dealing with Worries and Stress\", which is to be found on this web-site, and put into practise some of the things described therein, to calm you down and restore your equilibrium. Allaah is the One Whom We ask to relieve your distress and grief. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace.",
        "predicted_answer": "It is deeply concerning to hear that someone is contemplating suicide due to the rejection of a marriage proposal. In Islam, life is considered sacred, and taking one's own life is viewed as a grave sin. There are many teachings within the Quran and the Hadiths that stress the importance of preserving life and seeking help and guidance through difficult times.\n\n### Importance of Life and Seeking Help\n\n1. **Life is Sacred**: The Quran clearly emphasizes the sanctity of human life. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:32) states:\n   > \"Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely...\"\n   - (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:32)\n\n2. **Facing Hardship with Patience**: Islam encourages believers to be patient during trials and tribulations. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:155-157) states:\n   > \"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient, who, when disaster strikes them, say, 'Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.'\"\n   - (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:155-157)\n\n3. **Allah's Mercy and Forgiveness**: It's essential to remember that Allah is merciful. Surah Az-Zumar (39:53) says:\n   > \"O My servants who have believed, fear your Lord. For those who do good in this world is good, and the earth of Allah is spacious. Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account.\"\n   - (Surah Az-Zumar, 39:53)\n\n### Finding Peace and Healing\n\n1. **Encouragement to Seek Support**: The Quran and Hadith encourage individuals to seek help through prayer and community support. Surah Al-Ankabut (29:69) states:\n   > \"And those who strive for Us, We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good.\"\n   - (Surah Al-Ankabut, 29:69)\n\n2. **Repentance and Seeking Forgiveness**: In times of distress, turning back to Allah and seeking forgiveness is a profound source of comfort. Surah At-Tahrim (66:8) encourages believers:\n   > \"O you who have believed, repent to Allah with sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow...\"\n   - (Surah At-Tahrim, 66:8)\n\n3. **Finding New Opportunities**: The verses you provided from Surah At-Tahrim (66:5-9) hint at greater plans that Allah has for individuals, stating that if a relationship does not work out, Allah can provide better matches:\n   > \"In case he divorces you, his Lord will give him better wives in return, who will be modest, true believers, obedient to God...\"\n   - (Surah At-Tahrim, 66:5)\n\n4. **Trust in Allah's Plan**: Humans are encouraged to trust that Allah has a better plan for them. It is important to focus on self-improvement and faith rather than despair. Surah Al-Talaq (65:2-3) shows that Allah will indeed make a way out for those who fear Him:\n   > \"And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out and will provide for him from where he does not expect...\"\n   - (Surah Al-Talaq, 65:2-3)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf someone is feeling overwhelmed by hopelessness or suicidal thoughts, it’s essential they reach out to trusted family members, friends, or professionals who can provide the necessary support. Islam teaches us to seek help in times of distress, whether that be through faith, community, or counseling. Life is a precious gift, and there is always hope and help available. Allah’s mercy is vast, and there are many avenues to find healing and comfort even in the toughest times."

        "question": "Her husband did\r\n    not respect her family and divorced her after the nikaah but before the wedding party",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The parents have great rights, but the husband has a\n    greater right. It is not permissible for either party to abuse the rights of the other. If\n    the wife thinks that her husband has wronged her parents, she should advise him and remind\n    him that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning),  and live with them\n    [wives] honourably [al-Nisa 4:19] includes treating her family well\n    too, because that makes her happy, and it includes not harming them, because that upsets\n    her. By the same token, if one or both of her parents abuse her husbands rights, she\n    should advise them and remind them of the seriousness of backbiting, wrongdoing and\n    aggression. If they order her to do something and her husband orders her to do the\n    opposite, then her husband takes precedence, because his rights are greater in\n    shareeah. This does not mean that she should forget about their rights; this is the\n    guideline she should follow in cases where there is a conflict.\nWith regard to your second question, it is not haraam according to\n    shareeah for a man to have intercourse with his wife after the nikaah (conclusion of\n    the marriage contract) and before the wedding party. Whatever happened after the nikaah is\n    halaal (permissible), so there is no scandal involved and no need to fear the\n    consequences. If a man divorces his wife after the marriage has been consummated, then she\n    is entitled to keep the entire mahr (dowry)\nIf it is possible for mediators to try to bring you back together in\n    accordance with shareeah and following the proper etiquette, then this is better.\n    And Allaah is the source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the case where a husband did not respect his wife's family and divorced her after the marriage contract (nikah) but before the wedding celebrations, several Islamic teachings and Quranic verses can help clarify how to approach this situation, both from a legal and a moral perspective.\n\n### 1. **Divorce Before Consummation of Marriage**\n\nIslamic jurisprudence allows for a divorce occurring before the consummation of marriage. The following verse addresses this specifically:\n\n- **Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:236**:\n  \"There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry; but then provide adequately for them, the affluent according to their means, the poor in accordance with theirs as is befitting. This is surely the duty of those who do good.\"\n  \n- **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:237**:\n  \"And if you divorce them before the consummation of marriage, but after settling the dowry, then half the settled dowry must be paid, unless the woman forgoes it...\"\n\nThis establishes that a husband is required to provide financial support if the marriage has been formally initiated (nikah), even if it has not been consummated.\n\n### 2. **Fair Treatment and Respect for Women**\n\nIslam emphasizes fair treatment of women and the importance of compassion and dignity in marital relationships. The following verses highlight this principle:\n\n- **Quran, Surah An-Nisa 4:19**:\n  \"O believers, you are not allowed to take perforce the women (of dead relatives) into your heritage, or tyrannize over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them, unless they are guilty of open adultery. Live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them.\"\n\nThis verse stresses the necessity to treat women with kindness and justice, reflecting the values of respect and integrity expected in relationships.\n\n### 3. **Divorce Should Not Be Abusive**\n\nIn the context of divorce, it's essential to understand that the act should not be harmful or disrespectful. The Quran discourages behaviors that can be construed as harassing or mistreating one's spouse:\n\n- **Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:231**:\n  \"And when you divorce your wives and they have reached the end of the term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably...\"\n\nThis indicates that the divorce process should be conducted with dignity and honor for both parties involved.\n\n### 4. **Financial Obligations Upon Divorce**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are financial obligations upon the husband in cases of divorce:\n\n- **Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:237**:\n  \"And if you divorce them before the consummation of marriage, but after settling the dowry, then half the settled dowry must be paid...\"\n\nThis verse establishes that even if the marriage has not been consummated, if a dowry was settled, the husband must honor that agreement, either by paying half or by mutual consent of forgoing it.\n\n### 5. **Final Remarks on the Situation**\n\nIf a husband does not respect his wife and chooses to divorce her without following Islamic principles—with emphasis on respect, kindness, and responsibility—it can lead to emotional and psychological harm. It is expected that the community, family, and even the courts (where applicable) support the wife through validating her marriage experience, protecting her rights, and ensuring she receives any financial support due to her.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis situation of divorce before the wedding celebration raises several Islamic legal and ethical considerations. It should be approached with an understanding of the rights and responsibilities designated in the Quran, focusing on respect, justice, and fair treatment of both spouses, as detailed in the verses provided."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to write the Basmalah on invitations and other letters, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to begin his letters by mentioning the name of Allah. It is not permissible for anyone who receives a letter in which Allah is mentioned or an aayah of the Qur’aan is quoted to throw it into the garbage or put it in any undesirable place. The same applies to newspapers and other similar papers: it is not permitted to mishandle them or throw them in the garbage, or to use them to wrap food or other things, because the name of Allah is mentioned in them. The sin is on the person who does this, not on the one who writes it. And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Writing \"Bismillah ir-Rahmaaan ir-Raheem\" (In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) on wedding invitations can be considered permissible in Islam. This phrase is often used by Muslims as an invocation of God's name, and its use underscores the sacredness and the intention of seeking blessings in significant life events, including marriage.\n\n### The Significance of \"Bismillah ir-Rahmaaan ir-Raheem\"\n\n1. **Invocation of God's Blessings**: Starting an important event or document with \"Bismillah\" aligns with the Islamic tradition of invoking God's blessings and guidance in all actions. This practice is rooted in the teachings of the Qur’an, where it is emphasized to begin tasks with God's name. \n\n2. **General Verses Supporting the Invocation of God's Name**:\n   - Surah Al-Nahl (16:128): “Indeed, Allah is with those who fear Him and those who are doers of good.” This verse highlights the importance of invoking God’s presence and support in all endeavors.\n   - Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:88): \"Eat what is lawful and good of the provisions God has bestowed on you, and fear God in whom you believe.\" This instruction emphasizes the need to remember and acknowledge God in various aspects of life, including celebrations.\n\n3. **Cultural and Contextual Relevance**: Using \"Bismillah ir-Rahmaaan ir-Raheem\" on wedding invitations is a cultural practice that expresses the couple's devotion and their hope for a blessed marriage. It aligns with the teachings of Islam regarding marriage, as it is considered a sacred contract (nikah) that is encouraged to commence with the remembrance of God.\n\n### Additional Related Verses\n\n- **On Marriage**: \n  - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221): \"And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe. And a believing slave woman is better than a free polytheistic woman, even though she might impress you.\" This verse underscores the importance of marriage within the framework of faith, which is concurrent with invoking God’s name for blessings in this sacred bond.\n  \n- **On Life’s Transitions**: \n  - Surah Al-Ma’idah (5:2): “...Do not let your hatred of a people lead you to aggression...” This verse, while primarily discussing conduct towards others, reflects the wisdom of approaching life’s transitions—such as marriage—with positive intentions and a heart aligned with God's guidance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, writing \"Bismillah ir-Rahmaaan ir-Raheem\" on wedding invitations is permissible and holds significant spiritual connotation within the Islamic faith. It acts as a reminder of the couple's commitment to start their married life under God's blessings, which is a highly regarded practice in Islam. The verses of the Qur'an support invoking God's name in various aspects of life, enhancing the moral and spiritual throughput of such significant events."

If you are able to treat both wives equally, then\n    respond to your parents request to marry the cousin you mention. This is included in\n    the words of the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning):  then marry\n    (other) women of your choice, two or three or four [al-Nisa 4:3]. If\n    you fear that you will not be able to treat them equally and fairly, then be content with\n    one wife, whether it is the first or the second, because Allaah says (interpretation of\n    the meaning): if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly (with\n    them), then [marry] only one [al-Nisa 4:3]. Try in all cases to\n    please your parents. And Allaah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is an important institution governed by various principles and guidelines outlined in the Qur'an. The scenario you've described involves a man marrying someone other than the woman his parents wanted for him. Here’s a thorough look at this situation based on Islamic teachings and specific verses:\n\n### Acceptance of Choice in Marriage\n\n1. **Individual Choice**: The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of individual consent in marriage. While parents may have preferences for a partner based on socio-economic, cultural, or religious factors, the individual's choice should also be respected. A well-known saying of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is that a woman should choose her spouse based on four criteria: wealth, lineage, beauty, and piety, but the emphasis is on seeking someone who promotes one's faith and well-being. \n\n2. **Individuals’ Rights**: Surah An-Nisa mentions that it is unlawful to force women into marriage against their will: \n   - **Surah An-Nisa (4:19)**: \"O believers, you are not allowed to take perforce the women (of dead relatives) into your heritage or tyrannize over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them, unless they are guilty of open adultery. Live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them. For it may well be you may not like a thing, yet God may have endued it with much goodness.\"\n  \n3. **Parental Guidance**: Parents have a role in guiding their children towards suitable partners; however, their wishes are not absolute. The idea of choosing a spouse includes parental input but fundamentally prioritizes the individual's preferences and choices. \n\n### Prohibition Against Certain Marriages\n\n4. **Marital Restrictions**: The Qur'an explicitly prohibits marrying certain relatives, emphasizing that marriage should occur without violating these moral and ethical boundaries. For example:\n   - **Surah An-Nisa (4:22-24)**: \"And do not wed the women your fathers had wed... unlawful are your mothers and daughters and your sisters…\"\n\n5. **Marital Justice**: In Islam, fairness and justice in relationships are essential. If a man chooses to marry another woman despite familial objections, he is required to treat all his wives with justice and fairness—both emotionally and financially. The Qur'an makes clear the obligations of a husband towards his wives:\n   - **Surah An-Nisa (4:36)**: \"And serve God, and do not associate anything with Him, and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, the needy, the near neighbor, the neighbor farther away, the companion at your side, the companion along the way, and those whom your right hands possess...\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while parents may have their preferences regarding their child's spouses, Islam places significant emphasis on the individual's right to choose their own partner, provided that it adheres to the moral and ethical guidelines set in the Qur'an. The choice to marry someone outside of the parents' wishes is permissible, as long as the decision is made thoughtfully, in line with Islamic values of justice and respect.\n\nFor further understanding, the relevant verses supporting the points made in the response include:\n\n1. **Qur'an Surah An-Nisa (4:19)** - about respecting and tolerating the choices of spouses.\n2. **Qur'an Surah An-Nisa (4:22-24)** - about permissible and forbidden marriages.\n3. **Qur'an Surah An-Nisa (4:36)** - about the broader scope of justice and duty within relationships.\n\nThese verses underscore the balance between respecting family wishes and the individual’s rights within Islamic marriage practices."

        "question": "She is in love with a Muslim and wants to marry\r\n    him – does she have to become Muslim?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Yes, it is very necessary for you to enter Islam. This will solve \n  all the problems, from making the marriage valid, through giving a united direction \n  to the future upbringing of the children, to attaining success and happiness \n  in the Hereafter. Your feelings of unease about taking this step may be due \n  to the difficulty of leaving behind what you are used to and the religion that \n  you have grown up in, or reluctance to go against your family and relatives, \n  or fear of hostility and criticism from others, or concern about losing some \n  worldly advantages. But all these issues will be easily overcome when you seek \n  the help of Allaah and are determined to follow the truth. The wise person is \n  prepared to make sacrifices and put up with difficulties for the sake of following \n  the truth, because the truth is worth pursuing. Any difficulties encountered \n  will become easy because the result is happiness in this world and the next, \n  and Paradise the width of heaven and earth. Moreover, your marriage will help \n  you to live in love and harmony with your husband (if he repents to Allaah for \n  the forbidden relationship and becomes a religious person of good morals) and \n  his Muslim family. There will be no dispute as to which religion the children \n  will be raised in, and they will not feel that there is any conflict in the \n  family, so they will be able to grow up free of the psychological complexes \n  that result from the parents difference of religion. Other people have \n  felt something similar to the feelings that you are experiencing now, as is \n  reflected in the following story, which happened at the time of the Prophet \n  of Islam  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n  him). Anas reported that the Messenger of Allaah  \n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to a man, Become Muslim. \n  He said, I feel that I dont want to. He said, Become \n  Muslim, even if you feel that you dont really want to. (Reported \n  by Imaam Ahmad, 11618; Saheeh al-Jaami, 974). This is the correct approach \n  which people should have towards the true religion. For more information on \n  the topic of marriage, please see Questions #3025 \n  and #2527. We wish you every good thing \n  and success. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the requirements for marriage vary depending on the faith of the individuals involved. When it comes to a Muslim marrying a non-Muslim, certain rules apply, as outlined in the Quran.\n\n### Can a Non-Muslim Woman Marry a Muslim Man?\n\n1. **Prophetic Teachings and the Quran**: \n   Generally, a Muslim man is permitted to marry women from the \"People of the Book,\" which refers primarily to Jews and Christians. This allowance is based on the following verse:\n\n   **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:5)**:\n   > \"This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage] are chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [them] as secret lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\"\n   \n   This verse permits Muslim men to marry chaste women from the People of the Book (i.e., Jewish and Christian women).\n\n2. **Conditions for Non-Muslim Women Marrying Muslim Men**: \n   While Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women (provided they are from the People of the Book), the situation is more complicated for Muslim women. Generally, Islamic jurisprudence does not permit Muslim women to marry non-Muslim men. This is derived from various Islamic texts and interpretations which emphasize the importance of shared faith. \n\n   **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221)**:\n   > \"And do not marry the polytheists until they believe. And a believing slave is better than a polytheist even though he attracts you. Those invite you to the Fire, but Allah invites to Paradise and forgiveness by His permission. And He makes clear His verses to the people that perhaps they may be reminded.\"\n\n   This indicates that Muslim women are advised to marry to a believer in their faith.\n\n3. **Conversion**: \n   If a non-Muslim woman is deeply in love with a Muslim man and wishes to marry him, she may choose to convert to Islam. This is a personal decision and reflects her commitment not only to the relationship but also to understanding and accepting the faith of her partner. Conversely, there are also instances where relationships continue without conversion, but this may vary based on individual circumstances, communities, and personal beliefs.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn conclusion, a non-Muslim woman can marry a Muslim man, provided she is from the People of the Book (i.e., Jewish or Christian) according to Quranic injunctions. However, for a Muslim woman wishing to marry a non-Muslim man, Islamic law generally does not permit this without the woman converting to Islam. Ultimately, the couple should engage in open dialogue, respecting the beliefs and values of each other as they consider their future together. For non-Muslims who are considering conversion, it is encouraged to learn about Islam fully and embrace it wholeheartedly before making such a significant decision. \n\n### References\n- Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:5)\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221)\n- Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:10-13), which emphasizes the importance of shared faith in marriage contexts.\n\nIt is essential for individuals in such situations to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars or community leaders who can provide further clarity tailored to their specific circumstances."

        "question": "Appearaing before\r\n    one’s fiancé before the wedding (nikaah)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.So long as the nikaah (marriage contract) has not yet taken place, this\n    man is still a “stranger” to you, and you should observe hijaab with him (i.e.,\n    wear proper hijaab and avoid contact) just as you would in the case of any other man. He\n    has no right to look at you beyond the look that is allowed by sharee’ah at the time\n    of making a marriage proposal, beyond which no further look is permitted until the nikaah\n    is completed. What you father has told you about it being OK for you to relax the rules of\n    hijaab in front of your fiancé is not correct, and there should be no obedience to any\n    created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator. The mere intention of marriage\n    does not justify uncovering in front of him. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the interactions between an engaged couple, or fiancés, before they enter marriage (nikah) are guided by principles derived from the Qur'an and Hadith. Understanding these principles is crucial for adhering to the Islamic moral and legal framework regarding pre-marital relationships. \n\n1. **Engagement and Proposal**:\n   The Qur'an does mention the appropriateness of proposing and making intentions regarding marriage. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:235) states, \"There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself: God is aware that you will keep them in mind. Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper; and do not resolve upon marriage till the fixed term of waiting is over...\" This verse indicates that expressing an intention of marriage is permissible, but one should maintain a level of propriety and should wait until any required waiting period for women (due to divorce or death of a spouse) is over.\n\n2. **Physical Interaction**:\n   While engaged couples can communicate and interact, physical contact (such as holding hands or being alone together) is generally not allowed until the marriage contract is actualized (nikah). Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49) discusses the rights of women who are engaged and emphasizes that if a man divorces a woman before consummation, he must still provide for her, underscoring the seriousness of their commitment even in engagement. \n\n3. **Guidelines on Modesty and Conduct**:\n   Modesty is a significant component in interactions between unmarried individuals. Surah An-Nur (24:30-31) commands believing men and women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining modesty and propriety, which is echoed in the context of interaction with fiancés. \"Say to the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their private parts... and tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their private parts...\" (An-Nur, 24:30-31).\n\n4. **Avoiding Temptation**:\n   The guidelines provided by Islamic teachings are rooted in the desire to avoid scenarios that can lead to sinful behavior. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:238) reminds believers to be mindful of their prayers but also underscores the imperative of being conscious of God's commandments in all interactions. This conscientiousness extends to the engagement period, emphasizing that both parties should remain focused on their obligations to God and avoid situations that may tempt them away from righteousness.\n\n5. **Final Thoughts on Engagement**:\n   Engagement is seen as a serious step towards marriage. While there is allowance for communication and some forms of interaction, it is pivotal that both parties remain within the boundaries set by Islamic law to preserve the sanctity of their future relationship. Engaged couples are encouraged to strengthen their spiritual bonds and commitments while maintaining appropriate conduct according to Islamic teachings.\n\nIn conclusion, while an engaged couple can interact and express their intentions towards each other, it is essential to do so with a clear understanding of the boundaries set in Islam concerning modesty, physical contact, and mutual respect. Engaging within these limits ensures that the relationship is built upon a foundation of shared values and faithfulness, ultimately leading to a blessed marriage."

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, when it comes to marriage, the consent of both parties is important, and the involvement of parents can also be significant due to cultural norms and expectations. However, there are instances where one may face challenges concerning parental approval, especially if they wish to marry someone their parents do not accept. The Quran provides guidance on marriage, emphasizing the importance of individual choice, mutual love, and respect in relationships.\n\n**1. Autonomy in Marriage:**\nThe Quran emphasizes the importance of mutual consent in marriage. The relevant verse states:\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:25)**: \"And whoever among you cannot afford to marry free, believing women, then let him marry from among those whom your right hands possess of believing girls. And Allah is Knowing of your faith. You are of one another. So marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due compensation (dowry) according to what is acceptable, a bounty of the rich and a modest provision of the poor, a duty upon the doers of good.\" \n\nThis verse encourages marrying with the consent of families, indicating that familial approval, while important, should not supersede the wishes of the individuals involved.\n\n**2. Respect for Parents:**\nWhile parental approval is valued in many cultures, their preferences should be balanced against the feelings and rights of the individuals involved in the marriage. It is encouraged to approach this with patience and understanding. The Quran states:\n\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:23)**: \"And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment. Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], 'uff,' and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word.\"\n\nThis verse showcases the vital role of respect towards parents while also emphasizing that one should not adhere to their wishes if it leads to injustice or is burdensome upon oneself.\n\n**3. Importance of Personal Happiness and Consent:**\nMarriage is not merely a contractual agreement; it is a relationship built on love, compassion, and commitment. Choosing a spouse based on personal feelings is also illustrated in the Quran:\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:19)**: \"O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion. And do not make difficulties for them in order to take part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.\"\n\nThis verse encourages treating spouses with kindness regardless of personal feelings and highlights the importance of mutual affection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, while parental approval is important, the decision to marry should involve mutual consent and respect for individual rights and feelings. It is advisable for the parties involved to communicate openly with their parents, striving for a balance between familial expectations and personal happiness. Ultimately, marriage in Islam is designed to be a source of comfort and support, and both partners should feel fulfilled in their union. Engaging a knowledgeable person, such as an Imam or a trusted elder, for guidance amidst such family conflicts can also be beneficial."

Allaah says (interpretation of \n  the meaning):\nO you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, \n  it may be that the latter are better than the former; nor let (some) women scoff \n  at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former \n  [al-Hujuraat 49:11]\nAllaah has not created mankind in nations and tribes so that they \n  may be proud and despise one another, but so that they may be distinguished \n  from one another and thus get to know one another.

Verily, \n  the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has taqwa (i.e. \n  is one of the muttaqeen  the pious). Verily Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. \n  [al-Hujuraat 49:13]\nIbn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in his commentary \n  on this aayah:\nHere Allaah is telling mankind that He created them from \n  one soul, from which He created its mate  this refers to Aadam and Hawwa \n  (Adam and Eve)  and made them into nations, which are bigger than tribes. \n  Beyond the tribe there are other smaller units and divisions, such as families \n  and clans. An alternative interpretation is that nations refers \n  to the non-Arabs and tribes refers to the Arabs. All people are \n  equal with regard to lineage because of their descent from Aadam and Hawwa, \n  upon whom be peace, but some may be better than others in religious matters, \n  i.e., in obedience to Allaah and in following His Messenger  \n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). For this reason, after forbidding \n  envy and scornful attitudes towards others, Allaah pointed out their equality \n  as human beings: O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, \n  and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another  \n  i.e., that they may know one another by referring to their tribes. Mujaahid \n  said that this meant by calling a person So-and-so the son of So-and-so, \n  from such-and-such a tribe.  Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger \n  of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n  him) was asked, Which people are the most honourable?

They said: That is not \n  what we were asking about. He said, Are you asking about which lineage \n  of the Arabs is most honourable? They said, Yes. He said: \n  The best of you at the time of Jaahiliyyah are the best of you in Islam, \n  if they understand properly. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased \n  with him) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah  \n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah does not look \n  at your outward appearance or your wealth, He looks at your hearts and your \n  deeds.\nFurther information that is relevant to your question may be found \n  under #1805 and #1114. \n  We ask Allaah to bless us and you with strength and goodness, and to keep us \n  all away from that which is forbidden.

        "predicted_answer": "The situation you described—of a man loving a woman whose origins are disrespected by his mother—invokes several important Islamic principles regarding relationships, respect for one’s family, and justice. A few key points are relevant here along with supporting verses from the Quran.\n\n### 1. Respect for Parents\nIslam places a strong emphasis on the respect and kindness owed to one’s parents. Despite the mother's feelings or prejudices about the woman's origins, a son is encouraged to maintain a respectful and caring attitude towards his mother. \n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah 19 (Maryam), Ayah 14**: \"And he was dutiful to his parents, and he was neither arrogant nor disobedient.\" (Maryam, 19:14)\n- **Surah 31 (Luqman), Ayah 14**: \"And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. To Me is your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do.\" (Luqman, 31:14)\n\n### 2. Marriage and Personal Choice\nIn Islam, the choice of a spouse is a personal one, and it is emphasized that one’s character and faith are of greater importance than lineage or social status. The Quran encourages marrying those who are righteous.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah 24 (An-Nur), Ayah 26**: \"Evil women are for evil men, and evil men are for evil women. Good women are for good men, and good men are for good women.\" (An-Nur, 24:26)\n- **Surah 4 (An-Nisa), Ayah 3**: \"And if you fear that you will not be just to the orphans, then marry those that please you of [other] women...\" (An-Nisa, 4:3)\n\n### 3. Justice and Tolerance\nThe Quran teaches believers to show justice and tolerance in their relationships, even towards those whom they may personally dislike. \n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah 4 (An-Nisa), Ayah 19**: \"O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly or send it [in bribery] to the rulers in order that [they might aid] you [to] consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin, while you know [it is unlawful]. Live with them in kindness… for perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you.\" (An-Nisa, 4:19)\n- **Surah 4 (An-Nisa), Ayah 36**: \"And worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents, do good, and to relatives, orphans, the needy, the near neighbor, the neighbor farther away, the companion at your side, the companion along the way, and those whom your right hands possess. Indeed, Allah does not like those who are self-deluding and boastful.\" (An-Nisa, 4:36)\n\n### 4. Dealing with Prejudice and Preconceptions\nIslam advocates for looking beyond superficial qualities such as origin or ethnicity. Prejudices that a family might have should be addressed through wisdom and sometimes require guidance, which can change over time through understanding and respect.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah 49 (Al-Hujurat), Ayah 13**: \"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.\" (Al-Hujurat, 49:13)\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, while a mother’s disapproval can be a challenge in relationships, Islamic teachings emphasize the importance of respect towards parents, the significance of personal choice in marriage, and the necessity of justice and kindness. It is crucial for the man in question to maintain a balance between his love for the woman and his obligations towards his mother, seeking to educate and perhaps soften her views over time while upholding principles of fairness and unity in the family."

        "question": "Wants to marry a\r\n    girl but his father does not approve of her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This question requires that we offer advice to both of you. Firstly, to\n    your father, who you say is preventing you from marrying this girl whom you describe as\n    religious and well-mannered. He has to allow you to marry her, unless he has some\n    legitimate Islamic reason, which he should explain to you to convince you and put your\n    mind at rest. He should also put himself in your shoes: if his own father prevented him\n    from marrying a religious and well-mannered girl whom he liked, would he not feel\n    resentful about this denial of his freedom? If he would not like his father to do such a\n    thing to him, how can he do this to his son? As the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of\n    Allaah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until he likes for his brother\n    what he likes for himself.”\nIt is not right for your father to prevent you from marrying this girl\n    with no legitimate Islamic reason. If there is a reason, he should explain it to you so\n    that you will understand what is going on. \nOur advice to you is this: if you can possibly change your mind and\n    find another girl to marry, in order to please your father, maintain family unity and\n    avoid division, then do so.\nBut you may find that you cannot do that, because your heart is\n    attached to this girl, and you cannot bear the thought of marrying anyone else. You may\n    also be afraid that if you choose another girl, your father might object to that marriage\n    too, because some parents may try to force their son to marry a relative, or a woman whose\n    qualities the father likes but the son does not. Some parents may feel jealousy or envy\n    even towards their own children, so they prevent them from doing what they want to do. If\n    this is the case, then there is no sin on you if you marry her, even if your father\n    objects. Perhaps after you are married, your father may change his mind. We ask Allaah to\n    help you make the right choice.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic culture, the question of marrying someone against a parent's wishes, particularly a father's, can be complex and sensitive. Here are several points to consider regarding such a situation, referencing Qur'anic verses and broader Islamic principles.\n\n### 1. **Parental Authority and Respect**\nIn Islam, honoring and obeying one’s parents is a significant principle. The Qur'an instructs believers to treat their parents with kindness and respect. In Surah Al-Isra (17:23), it is stated:\n\n> \"And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment.\" \n> (Surah Al-Isra, Ayah 23)\n\nThis verse underscores the importance of parental guidance; however, it does not negate the agency of the individual in choosing a spouse, especially if the reasons for parental disapproval are not grounded in Islamic principles.\n\n### 2. **Choosing a Spouse**\nThe Qur'an emphasizes the importance of mutual consent in marriage. In Surah An-Nisa (4:25), it states:\n\n> \"If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman, let him marry a maid who is a believer. God is aware of your faith: The one of you is of the other; so marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry.\" \n> (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 25)\n\nThis suggests that while consent from the family is important, the individual's faith and compatibility with potential partners are also crucial.\n\n### 3. **Mutual Consent and Family Involvement**\nIt is recommended for a person to seek the consent not only of their parents but also of the potential spouse. In the process of marrying, the couple should ideally form a partnership based on mutual understanding and shared values. This concept is reiterated in the same Surah:\n\n> \"...so marry them with consent of their people...\" \n> (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 25)\n\nThis verse emphasizes the necessity of consent, indicating that the family’s involvement and approval are vital in the marriage process, but it does not render the individual powerless in their decision.\n\n### 4. **Personal Choice vs. Family Wishes**\nWhile the Qur'an advises respect for parental wishes, there is also a recognition of individual agency. The hadith literature often notes the importance of marrying for the right reasons—religion and character being paramount. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:\n\n> “A woman is married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty, and her religion. So, choose the one who is religious, may your hands be rubbed with dust!” \n> (Sahih Bukhari)\n\nThis indicates a prioritization of faith and character over other factors, and if a father’s choice does not align with these values, the individual may consider pursuing their desires after respectful dialogue with their family.\n\n### 5. **Conflict Resolution**\nIf there is a strong disagreement, it may be beneficial to engage in respectful and open dialogue with the father. It may also be useful to involve trusted family members or community leaders to mediate and help resolve the conflict constructively.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while respect for parental wishes is a fundamental aspect of familial relations in Islam, individual agency in the choice of a spouse is also highly regarded, particularly when the choice aligns with Islamic values. It is often recommended to seek a balance through respectful dialogue, mutual consent, and an understanding of each party's concerns. If this fails, one may choose to follow their heart while maintaining respect and kindness towards their parents."

        "question": "Consummation of Marriage and Etiquettes",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.How to consummate marriage in Islam\nWhen a Muslim wants to consummate his marriage , a number of things are recommended in the sunnah:\n\nHe should treat his bride kindly and gently, like offering her something to drink and so on, because of the hadith narrated by Asma bint Yazid ibn al-Sakan, who said: “I prepared ‘Aishah as a bride when she married the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). I came to him and invited him to see her (uncover her face). So he came and sat beside her, and a large cup of milk was brought to him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drank some, then offered it to her, but she lowered her head and felt shy. I rebuked her and said: ‘Take it from the hand of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ So she took it and drank a little, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her, ‘Give some to your companion (meaning himself).’” (Reported by Imam Ahmad and deemed sahih by al-Albani)\n\nHe should place his hand on his bride’s head and pray for her, saying “Bismillah” and asking for barakah (blessing), saying the words reported in the hadith narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you marries a woman or buys a servant, let him say: ‘Allahumma inni as-aluka khayraha wa khayra ma jabaltaha ‘alayhi wa a’udhu bika min sharriha wa min sharri ma jabaltaha ‘alayhi (O Allah, I ask You for her goodness and the goodness which You have created in her, and I seek refuge with You from her evil and the evil which You have created in her).’” Abu Dawud said that Abu Sa’id added: “Then let him take hold of her forelock and pray for blessing from this woman or servant.” (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Nikah, Bab fi jami’ al-nikah; classed as hasan in Sahih al-Jaami’, no. 341)\n\nHe should pray two rak’ahs with her, leading her in prayer, because this is reported as being the practice of the salaf (early generations). There are two reports concerning this. (i) from Abu Sa’id, the freed slave of Abu Usayd, which states that a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught him and told him: “When your wife comes in to you, pray two rak’ahs and ask Allah for the goodness of what has come to you, and seek refuge with Him from its evil.” (ii) from Shaqiq, who said: “A man called Abu Hariz came and said (to ‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud, may Allah be pleased with him): ‘I have married a young virgin girl, but I am afraid that she may hate me.’ ‘Abdullah said: ‘Love comes from Allah and hatred comes from Shaytan, who wants to make you hate what Allah has made permissible. When she comes to you, tell her to pray two rak’ahs behind you.’” (These two reports were narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah; see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani).\nWhen he wants to consummate the marriage , he should say the words reported in the hadith reported by Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “When one of you wants to approach (have intercourse with) his wife, if he says: ‘Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna al-Shaytan wa jannib al-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from Shaytan and protect whatever You give to us from Shaytan)’ – then if they are given a child, Shaytan will not harm it.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 3271) (For more information, see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani, p. 91)\n\nIs there a limit to the number of guests in a wedding feast?\nThere is no limit to the number of guests one can invite to a wedding feast (walimah), so invite whoever you wish of your relatives, the bride’s relatives, your friends and anyone you have a good reason to invite.\nMusic in a wedding ceremony: Haram?\nIt is not permitted in Islam to do anything that is haram such as having music , letting men and women mix, or letting women dance in front of men, or other things that earn the wrath of Allah. How can the blessing of Allah be exchanged for disobedience and immorality? \nAt weddings , women can do whatever is allowed in Islam, such as singing acceptable songs with good words or entertaining themselves by playing the daff (a certain kind of drum, resembling a tambourine without the rattles) only, so long as no men are present.\nWho should give the wedding walimah?\nProviding the wedding feast (walimah) is the husband’s responsibility . The sunnah is to slaughter one sheep or more for the guests, if he is able to, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, “Give a wedding feast, even if it is only one sheep.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, no. 2048).\nWe ask Allah to bless you and your bride and to grant you a happy marriage.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Consummation of Marriage and Etiquettes in Islam\n\nIn Islam, the consummation of marriage and the associated etiquettes are addressed in various verses of the Qur'an. Understanding these aspects is crucial for maintaining a healthy and respectful marital relationship. Below, I will outline the important aspects of marriage consummation and the relevant etiquettes, supported by citations from the Qur'an.\n\n#### 1. Consummation and Dowry\n\n**Consummation of marriage** is considered significant in Islam, as it marks the fulfillment of the marital contract. However, prior to consummation, there are rules regarding the marriage contract, specifically about the **dowry (mahr)**.\n\n- The Qur'an states:  \n  **\"There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry; but then provide adequately for them, the affluent according to their means, the poor in accordance with theirs as is befitting. This is surely the duty of those who do good.\"**  \n  *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:236)*\n\nThis verse highlights that even if the marriage is dissolved before consummation, provisions must be made for the woman as a sign of respect and kindness.\n\n#### 2. Waiting Period (Iddah)\n\nIn the event of a divorce or the death of a spouse, women are required to observe a waiting period, referred to as **iddah**. This period is crucial as it allows for emotional and psychological stability, as well as ensuring there are no pregnancies.\n\n- The Qur'an states:  \n  **\"Wives of men who die among you should wait (after their husbands die) for four months and ten days; and when the term is over there is no sin if they do what they like with themselves honourably, for God is aware of all that you do.\"**  \n  *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:234)*\n\nDuring this time, they should not engage in marriage, and it is emphasized that any proposals or intentions during this period should be conducted with propriety.\n\n#### 3. Proposals and Engagement\n\nWhile it is permitted to have thoughts of future engagements during the waiting period, it is important to handle such matters discreetly and honorably.\n\n- The Quran advises:  \n  **\"There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself, but do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper.\"**  \n  *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:235)*\n\nThis encourages a respectful approach to future relationships while acknowledging the sensitivities involved.\n\n#### 4. Treatment of Wives\n\nIslam places a significant emphasis on the kindness and respect that should be afforded to wives. This is particularly relevant during the marriage and the consummation phase.\n\n- The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of good treatment:  \n  **\"And if you divorce them before the consummation of marriage, but after settling the dowry, then half the settled dowry must be paid, unless the woman forgoes it.\"**  \n  *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:237)*\n\nMoreover, this notion of kindness applies throughout the marriage and is expected as a mutual responsibility for both spouses.\n\n#### 5. Advice for Living Together\n\nOnce married, the relationship should be characterized by mutual affection, respect, and fulfillment of each partner’s rights and responsibilities.\n\n- The Qur'an advises:\n  **“When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably.”**  \n  *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:232)*\n\nThis underscores the importance of honoring and respecting the choices of spouses even post-separation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn Islam, the issues of consummation of marriage, dowry, treatment of spouses, and post-marriage etiquette are set within a framework of respect, dignity, and mutual care. The cited verses from the Qur’an inform believers about the importance of adhering to ethical standards in marital relationships, emphasizing kindness and consideration at every stage of the marriage. Through adhering to these principles, Muslims aim to foster healthy and meaningful relationships based on love and respect."

        "question": "Premarital sex, and is it the parents’ obligation to arrange marriage for their\r\n    children?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In answer to your second question, to say that it is permissible for a man\n    to engage in a premarital physical relationship (even if it does not include intercourse)\n    with a woman who is not permissible for him, claiming that he intends to marry her in the\n    future, is total and utter nonsense. This can never be allowed by sharee’ah, and\n    there can be no legitimate relationship until after the completion of a legal marriage\n    contract according to Islamic law (i.e., nikaah).\nI sent your first question to Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd\n    al-Rahmaan al-Jibreen, and he wrote back to me with the following answer: \nYes, it is a duty on the father to keep his children\n    chaste by arranging their marriages, and spending on them and clothing them, if he is able\n    to do so. If he is not able to, but the mother, grandfather or grandmother is able, it\n    becomes that person’s duty to arrange the marriage. If the son cannot afford it but\n    he has the ability to earn a living, it is his obligation to do so, in order to keep\n    himself chaste. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Premarital Sex in Islam\n\nIn Islam, premarital sex, often referred to as zina (fornication or adultery), is explicitly prohibited. The Quran outlines the importance of chastity and promotes the institution of marriage as the legitimate framework for sexual relations. This prohibition aims to protect individuals and families from the potentially harmful consequences associated with sexual relationships outside of marriage.\n\nThe Quran states in Surah Al-Isra (17:32):\n\n> \"And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way.\" \n> (Surah Al-Isra, Ayah 32)\n\nThis verse clearly warns against engaging in any form of unlawful sexual relations, emphasizing the moral and ethical stance that Islam takes regarding sexual conduct.\n\n### The Role of Parents in Arranging Marriages\n\nRegarding the obligation of parents to arrange marriages for their children, Islamic teachings emphasize the importance of familial involvement in the marriage process while also advocating for the autonomy of the individuals being married. Parents are encouraged to assist and guide their children towards suitable partners, as marriage is considered a significant event in one’s life.\n\nIn Surah An-Nisa (4:25), it is suggested that parents should facilitate marriages, particularly for those who may struggle to find spouses:\n\n> \"And whoever among you cannot [find the means to marry] free, believing women, then (he may marry) from those whom your right hands possess of believing maidens. And Allah is Knowing of your faith. You are of one another. So marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due compensation.\" \n> (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 25)\n\nThis verse highlights that marriage should be arranged with the consent and involvement of families, indicating the importance of social structures in the marriage process.\n\nFurthermore, according to a narration (hadith) from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), the consent of both parties is crucial in the marriage contract. Therefore, while parents have a role in arranging a marriage, ultimately the choice lies with the individuals involved:\n\n> \"A woman is married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty, and her religious commitment. So strive for the one with religious commitment.\" \n> (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 62, Hadith 27)\n\nThis hadith illustrates the qualities to consider in a marriage and indirectly emphasizes parental guidance while affirming the importance of the individual's choice.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, premarital sex is strictly prohibited in Islam, reinforcing the need for appropriate conduct and moral behavior. Parents have a significant role in facilitating marriages for their children, but mutual consent and personal agency are vital to the marriage process. Islam advocates for a balance between parental guidance and the autonomy of individuals in selecting their life partners."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.You should treat your mother respectfully, and try to persuade her to\n    agree to your marrying this girl who has repented and is practising her religion. But if\n    your mother does not agree, and you cannot be patient and you fear that you will fall into\n    sin if you do not marry her, then it is still permissible for you to marry her. And Allaah\n    is the source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the scenario where someone wants to marry a girl who has repented of her past but faces disapproval from his mother, we can find relevant guidance in the teachings of Islam based on the Quran and the principles derived from Islamic teachings.\n\n### Key Considerations\n\n1. **Repentance and Forgiveness:**\n   One of the fundamental teachings in Islam is the concept of repentance (توبة). Allah emphasizes that He accepts the repentance of those who sincerely return to Him. This is evident in Surah An-Nisa (4:17), where it states:\n   > \"God does accept repentance, but only of those who are guilty of an evil out of ignorance yet quickly repent...\" (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 17).\n\n   This indicates that if the girl has genuinely repented, her past should not be held against her. \n\n2. **Parental Approval and Relationships:**\n   While parental approval is encouraged in marriage, the faith and character of the prospective spouse should be the primary considerations. Surah An-Nisa (4:25) advises believers to marry those who are devoted in faith:\n   > \"... marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry...\" (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 25). \n\n   This ayah suggests that the focus should be on the character of the individuals involved rather than solely on their past or the opinions of others.\n\n3. **The Importance of Kindness and Justice:**\n   It is emphasized in the Quran that one should treat others with kindness and justice. In Surah An-Nisa (4:19), Allah commands:\n   > \"Live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them...\" (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 19).\n\n   This teaches that relationships should come from a place of understanding and compassion, which is important in any marital relationship.\n\n4. **Overcoming Challenges from Family:**\n   If the mother disapproves, it can create a challenging situation. The Quran encourages believers to act justly and to consider the greater good in matters of faith and righteous companionship. In Surah An-Nisa (4:28), it states:\n   > \"God wishes to make it clear to you and guide you through the example of earlier people...\" (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 28).\n\n   This implies that one should educate and inform family members about the girl’s repentance and good qualities, encouraging them to see beyond her past.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the individual should highlight the girl's sincere repentance and character to his mother, reminding her of the Islamic principle that everyone deserves a second chance, especially those who have shown true remorse. Options like seeking a family discussion or involving an elder from the community to help mediate may also be beneficial. Ultimately, while parental approval is significant, the qualities of faith and character of the individual seeking marriage should take precedence in decision-making according to Islamic principles. \n\nUltimately, happiness and contentment in marriage can often come when choosing a partner based on faith and character, supported by genuine love and understanding."

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the processes and events between engagement, marriage contract, and wedding party are guided by principles that promote respect, honor, and fairness. Here is an overview of these important stages alongside relevant verses from the Quran for support.\n\n### 1. Engagement (Khutbah)\n\nThe period of engagement is often regarded as the time when the couple gets to know each other better but must do so within the guidelines set forth in Islamic teachings. \n\n#### Relevant Verses:\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:235)**: \"There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself: God is aware that you will keep them in mind. Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper...\" \n  - This verse emphasizes the importance of proposing respectfully and maintaining a proper demeanor during the engagement period.\n\n### 2. Marriage Contract (Nikah)\n\nThe Nikah is a sacred contract that formalizes the marriage in the eyes of God and the community. This is when the dowry (Mahr) is agreed upon and given to the bride.\n\n#### Relevant Verses:\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:236)**: \"There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry...\"  \n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:237)**: \"And if you divorce them before the consummation of marriage, but after settling the dowry, then half the settled dowry must be paid, unless the woman forgives it...\" \n  - These verses outline the responsibilities and rights related to divorce and dowry, establishing financial protections for women, even in cases of divorce prior to consummation.\n\n### 3. The Wedding Party (Walima)\n\nThe wedding party or Walima is a celebration to announce the marriage publicly and to share joy with family and friends. There isn’t a direct verse that mandates a wedding party, but the importance of announcing the marriage publicly can be inferred from Islamic teachings.\n\n#### Relevant Verses:\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49)**: \"O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' of them. But provide suitably for them, and let them go with honour.\" \n  - This encourages the practice of public acknowledgment of marriage and honorable treatment, which can extend to the celebration.\n\n### 4. Relationship between the Engagement and Marriage Contract \n\nDuring the engagement, interaction between the couple should be respectful and limited to the guidelines of modesty. The Quran instructs to refrain from public intimacy until after the marriage contract is established, ensuring that interactions remain dignified.\n\n#### Relevant Verses:\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:235)**: \"Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper; and do not resolve upon marriage till the fixed term of waiting is over...\"\n  - This emphasizes the integrity required before formal engagement and marriage, where intentions should be pure and open among both parties.\n\n### 5. Between the Marriage Contract and the Wedding Party\n\nAfter the marriage contract, but before the wedding celebration, there is often a period of preparation where the couple may begin to establish a life together within the guidelines of Islam. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the relationship between engagement and marriage in Islam is closely guided by values of respect and proper conduct. The engagement phase sets a foundation for mutual understanding, and the marriage contract formalizes that bond under Islamic law. The wedding party acts as a public declaration of this bond, reinforcing social and familial ties vital in Muslim communities. The verses from Al-Baqarah and Al-Ahzab help provide a clear understanding of the rights and responsibilities involved in these stages."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If this love is not distracting you from the love of Allah, and will not lead to you doing or saying anything haraam, then there is nothing wrong with this, in sha Allah, or with praying to Allah to make him a part of your future – so long as he is a Muslim who fears Allah.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of loving a man in secret and praying for marriage in the context of Islamic teachings can be explored through several Qur'anic verses. Here’s a comprehensive overview based on the relevant verses provided, along with additional insights from Islamic teachings.\n\n### 1. **Secret Proposals and Intention**\nSurah Al-Baqarah (2:235) states:\n\n> \"There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself: God is aware that you will keep them in mind. Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper; and do not resolve upon marriage till the fixed term of waiting is over. Remember that God knows what is in your hearts; so be fearful of Him, and remember that God is forgiving and forbearing.\" (Quran 2:235)\n\nThis verse indicates that it is permissible to express feelings of love and the intention of marriage to women, even in a secretive manner, particularly in contexts where social norms or rules may require discretion, such as when respecting another’s waiting period or marital status. It highlights the importance of intent while also emphasizing the need for proper dialogue, suggesting that feelings should be approached with respect and integrity.\n\n### 2. **Timing and Consideration for Others**\nThe verse further implies that although expressing love and the intention to marry can be done discreetly, any public commitments or promises should wait until the proper context allows for it—in this case, the waiting period post-divorce or death of a husband has lapsed. This period is essential to ensure that no one else’s rights are infringed upon in the process.\n\n### 3. **Spiritual Aspect of Prayer**\nIn Islam, prayer (dua) is a critical element of seeking guidance and support from Allah. It is encouraged to pray for marital happiness and for the right partner. Surah An-Nisa (4:32) states:\n\n> \"Do not covet what We have bestowed on some of them [disbelievers] over others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of His bounty. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things.\" (Quran 4:32)\n\nThis verse underlines the importance of recognizing that everyone has their own path and blessings from Allah. Thus, in seeking a partner, one should ask Allah sincerely, reflecting trust in His wisdom regarding whom to support in marriage.\n\n### 4. **Seeking Love in a Just Manner**\nAs seen in Surah Al-Nisa (4:25):\n\n> \"If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman (let him marry) a maid who is a believer. God is aware of your faith: The one of you is of the other; so marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry.\" (Quran 4:25)\n\nThis verse signifies that marriage should be approached with sincerity, consent, and ethical considerations. The integrity of intentions is fundamental to the institution of marriage in Islam, including the aspect of seeking the approval and consent of the families involved.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion on Love and Marriage Prayer**\nIn summary, within the framework of Islamic teachings, loving someone in secret and praying for them can be seen as an emotional reality. The essential guidance revolves around maintaining a respectful intention without crossing ethical boundaries, recognizing the timing of commitments, and exercising patience. Praying for guidance in a partner is a positive act, suggesting reliance on and faith in Allah’s plans.\n\nOverall, these teachings emphasize the importance of the heart’s intentions and the ethical and moral framework in courtship and marriage in Islam. It is encouraged to approach love with sincerity, honor, and an awareness of divine guidance."

        "question": "Fighting for love",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.A Muslim man is permitted to marry anyone he likes of the women whom\n    Allaah has allowed him to marry, but he is encouraged to marry a Muslim woman who is\n    religious and has a good moral character (because this is the basis of true happiness).\n    Similarly, he is permitted to marry a chaste woman of the People of the Book, i.e., Jews\n    and Christians. Another basis for a happy marriage is that his parents should be pleased\n    with his choice of bride, and part of the way in which parents show their love and\n    kindness towards their son is by helping him to get married, whether financially or in\n    other ways. As regards what you say about striving and fighting for the sake of love, we\n    should stop and think about this matter carefully. We believe that feeling love for a\n    particular woman is not the be-all and end-all in a Muslim’s life, for which he\n    should give up everything that matters to him. No way! The Muslim is wise and pays\n    attention to everything that is in his interests, such as the woman’s religious\n    commitment and moral character, his parents’ approval, his own honour and reputation\n    among people, the future of the marriage and its potential to endure, whether any bad\n    things will result from his marriage to a particular woman and whether this outweighs his\n    interests, the environment in which the children of the marriage will grow up, the nature\n    of his future in-laws with whom he will have to mix, etc. It is not the matter of a\n    fleeting desire, rather it is the matter of one’s future and eventual destiny. \nFinally, we say that the love of a woman is not\n    some god to be worshipped, rather it is a matter that is governed by the laws of the One\n    God, Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds.",
        "predicted_answer": "The concept of fighting for love in Islam can be primarily understood through adherence to God's will, defense of the oppressed, and striving for justice. In many instances, fighting is presented not as an end in itself but as a necessary action in the face of oppression or injustice. Below are several key points supported by specific verses from the Quran relating to this context:\n\n### 1. **Fighting for God's Cause:**\nIslam emphasizes fighting in the way of God (سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ) especially for the oppressed. This highlights the moral obligation of Muslims to protect those who are unable to defend themselves. \n\n- **Supporting Verse:** \n  - “Those who barter the life of this world for the next should fight in the way of God. And We shall bestow on him who fights in the way of God, whether he is killed or is victorious, a glorious reward. What has come upon you that you fight not in the cause of God and for the oppressed, men, women and children...” \n  - (Surah An-Nisa, 4:74-75)\n\n### 2. **Unity in Faith:**\nThe Quran stresses that genuine love and unity among the believers can only be achieved through God’s grace. True strength lies in faith and mutual support during times of struggle.\n\n- **Supporting Verse:**\n  - “Whose hearts He cemented with love. You could never have united their hearts even if you had spent whatever (wealth) is in the earth; but God united them with love, for He is all-mighty and all-wise.”\n  - (Surah Al-Anfal, 8:63)\n\n### 3. **The Call to Fight:**\nThere is a directive for believers to fight when called upon, especially when faced with oppression or an attack from those who do not adhere to righteousness.\n\n- **Supporting Verse:**\n  - “O Prophet, urge the faithful to fight. If there are twenty among you with determination they will vanquish two hundred...” \n  - (Surah Al-Anfal, 8:65)\n\n### 4. **The Temporary Nature of This World:**\nThe Quran reminds believers that the struggles of this life are fleeting, thus encouraging perseverance in the pursuit of the eternal rewards associated with fighting in God's path.\n\n- **Supporting Verse:**\n  - “Say to them: ‘How short-lived is the commerce of this world; but that of the next is best for those who fear God; and you will not be wronged the breadth of a thread.’”\n  - (Surah An-Nisa, 4:77)\n\n### 5. **Compassion and Peace:**\nWhile there is a strong emphasis on fighting for justice, there is also a call towards peace. When faced with a genuine inclination towards peace, Muslims are encouraged to accept it.\n\n- **Supporting Verse:**\n  - “But if they are inclined to peace, make peace with them, and have trust in God, for He hears all and knows everything.”\n  - (Surah Al-Anfal, 8:61)\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn essence, fighting in the context of Islam can be seen as a manifestation of love—not through violence or aggression, but through the commitment to justice, protection of the vulnerable, and fidelity to the ethical imperatives ordained by God. The various verses articulate a profound connection between faith, love for God, and the ultimate fight for righteousness and compassion in the society we live in."

        "question": "A Christian woman got married in a church then\r\n    became Muslim",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Who has guided them to Islam. We ask Allaah to help us\n    and them to be steadfast in adhering to His religion. In response to your question, if the\n    marriage was contracted through an offer or proposal (eejaab) from the walee\n    (guardian) of the bride and acceptance (qabool) on the part of the groom, with the\n    consent of the bride, in front of two Muslim witnesses of good character (as regards\n    piety, attitude, conduct, etc.), then the marriage contract is valid. Ibn Qudaamah (may\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: “A marriage is not properly contracted unless there\n    are two Muslim witnesses, regardless of whether the bride and groom are both Muslims or\n    only the groom is. This is what Ahmad stated, and it is also the opinion of\n    al-Shaafi’i.” (Al-Mughni, 9/349; al-Mufaddal fi Ahkaam\n    al-Mar’ah, 6/120).\n    If the marriage was conducted as described above, then it is valid,\n    otherwise it must be repeated. It is permissible for a non-Muslim woman to be married by\n    her non-Muslim guardian, but if she becomes Muslim, this role can only be played by a\n    Muslim. If she has no Muslim walee, then this role can be delegated to the director of the\n    Islamic Centre or whoever is acting in his stead. As regards the children who were born\n    during this time, they are the children of the man and should be given his name, as is the\n    ruling in cases where there is uncertainty of this nature.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, a woman who converts to Islam and has previously been married can have her marriage status evaluated in accordance with Islamic law. The Qur'an provides guidance on the matters of marriage, particularly when it involves believers and non-believers, through various verses.\n\n### Marriage After Conversion\n\n1. **Status of the Previous Marriage**: When a woman converts to Islam from Christianity, her previous marriage may no longer hold under Islamic law, especially if her husband is not a believer. This is supported by the verses from Surah Al-Mumtahanah (Qur'an 60:10-12), which state that believing women are not lawful for unbelieving men:\n   - **Surah 60:10-12**: \"O believers, when believing women come over to you as refugees, then examine them. God alone is cognisant of their faith. If you find that they are believers, do not send them back to unbelievers. They are not lawful for them, nor are infidels lawful for believing women...\" (60:10-12).\n\n2. **Right to Remarry**: If the woman’s previous husband is not a believer, she has the right to remarry a Muslim man, and the new relationship is encouraged as long as it follows the Islamic guidelines for dowry and mutual consent:\n   - **Surah 4:25**: \"...So marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry...\" (4:25).\n   - **Surah 60:10**: As mentioned, if they are believing women, it's permitted to marry them (60:10).\n\n3. **Examining Faith**: When a woman converts, it is important to examine her faith, but her previous marital contracts may not be binding under Islamic law if the husband is non-Muslim. The guidance emphasizes that the rights and responsibilities must be respected regardless of prior relationships, as indicated in the verses that talk about providing proper dowries for new marriages:\n   - **Surah 60:12**: \"...there is no sin if you marry them provided you give their dowers to them...\" (60:12).\n  \n4. **Seeking a Muslim Partner**: If she wishes to remarry, she is encouraged to seek a Muslim husband. The Qur'an advises marrying those who share the faith to ensure harmony in beliefs and practices:\n   - **Surah 2:221**: \"Do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith...\" (2:221).\n\n### Considerations After Conversion\n\n- **Kindness to Previous Husband**: Even if the marriage to a non-believer may not continue, Islam encourages kindness and justice, as highlighted in multiple verses:\n   - **Surah 60:8**: \"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you...\" (60:8).\n\n- **Assessment of Relationships**: Each situation may require careful consideration. The statutes stress the importance of mutual respect and the observance of legal formalities when transitioning from one marriage to another.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, for a Christian woman who has converted to Islam and previously married in a church, her marital status must be evaluated based on her new faith. If her prior husband is not a Muslim, she is permitted to remarry a Muslim man, and she should ensure that all Islamic guidelines regarding marriage and dowry are followed. The principles laid out in the Qur'an advocate for kindness and justice in these matters, reflecting the emphasis on faith alignment in marital relationships. \n\nRelevant verses:\n- **Al-Mumtahanah (60:10-12)**\n- **An-Nisa (4:21-25)**\n- **Al-Baqarah (2:221)**"

        "predicted_answer": "In an Islamic marriage ceremony, there are specific religious recitations and practices that are recommended based on guidance found in the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Here are some significant elements to consider, along with citations from the Quran to support the practices:\n\n1. **Recitation of the Quran:**\n   It is traditional to recite verses from the Quran during the marriage ceremony. One of the most commonly recited verses is from Surah Al-Baqarah, which discusses the importance of maintaining good relations and providing for one another:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:236-237)**  \n     \"There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry; but then provide adequately for them, the affluent according to their means, the poor in accordance with theirs as is befitting. This is surely the duty of those who do good.\"  \n     (Quran 2:236-237)\n\n2. **The Proposal (Nikah) Ceremony:**\n   The marriage ceremony, known as Nikah, includes formal proposals and the acceptance from both parties. While it's not required to recite specific Quranic verses, the presence of witnesses and the intention to marry according to Islamic law are essential.\n\n3. **Reciting Al-Fatiha:**\n   It is common practice to recite Surah Al-Fatiha, the opening chapter of the Quran, during the Nikah ceremony. It serves as a prayer for blessings on the couple and signifies the start of their journey together.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Fatiha (1:1-7)**  \n     \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Master of the Day of Judgment. You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help. Guide us on the Straight Path, the path of those who have received Your grace; not the path of those who have brought down wrath upon themselves, nor of those who have gone astray.\"  \n     (Quran 1:1-7)\n\n4. **Du'a (Supplication):**\n   It is encouraged to make supplications (du’as) for the couple, asking Allah for mercy, love, and understanding between the partners. This practice aligns with the principles laid out in Islamic teachings, emphasizing the significance of cooperation and compassion in marital life.\n\n5. **Khutbah (Sermon):**\n   A wedding sermon, or Khutbah, is often delivered, reminding the couple and attendees of the importance of marriage, the rights and responsibilities of spouses, and the Islamic perspective on family life. The preacher may refer to relevant Quranic passages about marriage, unity, and mutual respect:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221)**  \n     \"And do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her... For God loves those who seek pardon, and those who are clean.\"  \n     (Quran 2:221)\n\n6. **Final Blessings:**\n   The ceremony often concludes with a prayer for the couple’s future, asking Allah for success, mercy, and blessings in their marriage, drawing on the Quranic principles of love and kindness:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Rum (30:21)**  \n     “And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed, in that are signs for a people who give thought.”  \n     (Quran 30:21)\n\nThese elements help frame the marriage ceremony within an Islamic context, ensuring that the process aligns with Quranic teachings and the principles of love, compassion, and commitment encouraged in Islam."

        "question": "Asking about a person’s past",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If you want to look for a wife for someone, or a husband for a woman, then\n    you can ask him about his wishes, such as the desired age, level of education, employment\n    situation, country and origin and position of the family, and whether he has any\n    preferences about her general appearance, such as skin colour, height, etc. The most\n    important characteristic to ask about is a person’s level of commitment to Islam.\n    This kind of useful question is fine.\nBut asking for details of a person’s past and wanting to know what\n    sins they might have committed when they were ignorant about Islam – this is not\n    right at all. Allaah covers people’s sins and loves to see them covered (i.e., not\n    dragged out into the open). So long as a person has repented, his sins have been wiped\n    out. Islam deletes whatever came before, so why should we ask questions that will only\n    embarrass people? Allaah accepts people’s repentance without their having to confess\n    or expose their sins to any other person. A number of the Sahaabah had committed adultery\n    and murder repeatedly, or had buried infant girls alive, or stolen things, but when they\n    entered Islam they were the best of people. No one needs to be reminded of a shameful\n    past; it is over and done with, and Allaah is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. What\n    matters when considering a person for marriage is how that person is now: is he righteous\n    or not? Has he cut all ties with his past and his wrong deeds, or not? If he is clearly\n    living a good and righteous life now, then it is wrong to dig up the past. If there is any\n    fear of anything that could have future implications, such as certain diseases and so on,\n    then there are medical tests which can give the answer and put your mind at rest.\nAs far as giving a detailed description of a prospective wife to someone\n    is concerned, this can be done in writing: one of her mahram relatives (i.e. a blood\n    relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden) or a woman who knows her can write\n    down a description, then a trustworthy person can deliver it to one who is seriously\n    considering a marriage proposal. The Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\n    him) said: “No woman should describe another woman to her husband as if he can see\n    her.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4839)\n    The wisdom behind this prohibition is the fact that a\n    husband might like the sound of what he hears, so he may divorce the one who described the\n    other to him, or there may be temptation to do wrong. (Commentary on the above\n    hadeeth in Fath al-Baari).\n    We ask Allaah to help us all to do that which He loves and\n    will earn His pleasure. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "predicted_answer": "Asking about a person's past can be a delicate matter in Islam, and the Quran provides insights on how to approach this topic appropriately, reflecting upon the importance of privacy, respect, and the context of such inquiries. Here are some relevant considerations, supported by Quranic verses:\n\n1. **Inquiring Respectfully**: When seeking to know about someone’s past, it is essential to do so respectfully and not in a manner that is intrusive or harmful. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:101) states:\n   - *“O believers, do not ask about things which, if made known to you, may vex you. But if you ask about them when the Qur'an is being revealed they will be unfolded to you.”*\n   This verse cautions against unnecessary inquiries that could lead to discomfort or distress.\n\n2. **Knowledge of the Heart**: The Quran emphasizes that God knows what is in hearts and minds. Thus, when asking about someone’s past, it should be understood that superficial knowledge might not truly represent a person’s character or circumstances. Surah Al-Taghabun (64:4) mentions:\n   - *“He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you hide and what you disclose; God knows what is in the hearts.”*\n   This suggests that one should be cautious and considerate when discussing sensitive subjects such as past actions or experiences.\n\n3. **Past Actions and Accountability**: Additionally, the Quran discusses the idea that everyone will be accountable for their past actions. In Surah Fussilat (41:21-25), it is mentioned:\n   - *“And they will say to their bodies: ‘Why did you testify against us?’ They will answer: ‘God, who gave all things power of articulation, made us speak.’”*\n   This verse illustrates that ultimately, one's past actions will come to light, and while inquiring about someone's past might be tempting, it is crucial to remember that they will be judged by God.\n\n4. **Avoiding Gossip**: The Quran also warns against spreading rumors or engaging in gossip about others’ pasts. This is particularly highlighted in Surah Al-Hujurat (49:12):\n   - *“O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite each other…”*\n   This highlights the importance of not only being cautious about how we inquire into others' pasts but also maintaining a principle of not prying into their personal matters without necessity.\n\n5. **Repentance and Moving Forward**: Islam encourages believers to repent for their past mistakes and focus on doing good in the present and future. Surah Al-Qasas (28:65-67) addresses this:\n   - *“(God) will ask them on that day: ‘What answer did you give the apostles?’ Then all news will be blacked out for them…’”*\n   This emphasis on accountability and the opportunity to repent suggests a focus on personal growth over judging others for their past.\n\nIn summary, while asking about a person’s past can be an important part of understanding their context and character, Islam encourages an attitude of compassion, respect for privacy, and mindfulness of the potential hurt that such inquiries can cause. The communication must align with the compassionate and understanding nature encouraged by the Quran."

        "question": "Shaking hands etc. after nikaah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nThe answer is, yes, all of this is permitted, even if it happens before the wedding \nparty, so long as the contract has been drawn up according to Sharee’ah, with a \nguardian and two witnesses, and the proposal has been given and accepted, and both \nparties consent to the marriage. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Shaking Hands After Nikaah in Islam\n\nThe practice of shaking hands after a nikaah (Islamic marriage ceremony) is often discussed in light of Islamic jurisprudence concerning gender interactions and modesty. Let's explore the relevant principles and permissions within Islamic texts.\n\n#### Gender Segregation and Interaction\n\nIslam places significant importance on modesty and gender interactions. The Quran emphasizes the need for appropriate behavior between men and women, especially outside the close familial relationships. For instance:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:53)** mentions:\n   > \"O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without awaiting the proper time, unless asked...\" \n   \n   This verse illustrates the need for respect and boundaries when interacting with individuals of the opposite gender, particularly those who are not immediate family.\n\n2. **Surah An-Nur (24:30-31)** advises lower gaze and modesty:\n   > \"Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that is purer for them. Indeed Allah is Acquainted with what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their modesty...\"\n\n   This focus on modesty extends to physical interaction, which includes behaviors like shaking hands.\n\n#### The Cultural Context\n\nIn many Muslim cultures, shaking hands between genders is viewed with caution. While some scholars argue that there is no explicit prohibition against it in the Quran or Hadith, others maintain that due to the principle of lowering gaze and preserving modesty, physical contact should be minimized.\n\n#### Scholarly Opinions\n\nThe scholarly consensus generally varies based on cultural context:\n\n- **Permissibility with Conditions**: Some scholars permit shaking hands if it occurs within a structured environment (like after a nikaah ceremony) and if no inappropriate feelings are aroused, adhering to the overall principles of modesty.\n- **Discouragement**: Others strongly discourage physical contact with non-mahram (those who one is allowed to marry) individuals as a demonstration of Muslim etiquette and the preservation of moral boundaries.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe act of shaking hands following a nikaah can be seen as permissible under certain contexts, but with a strong recommendation to uphold personal and communal modesty principles. The decision often relies on cultural practices, personal beliefs, and the opinions of knowledgeable figures in the community.\n\n### References from the Quran\n\n1. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:53)** - About proper behavior in the presence of the Prophet's household.\n2. **Surah An-Nur (24:30-31)** - Guidance on lowering gaze and maintaining modesty.\n\nGiven the diverse interpretations and practices, it's always best for individuals to consult with a knowledgeable scholar within their community for advice that aligns with their cultural context and personal beliefs."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nIf the son will commit haraam acts if he does not get married, then the father has no \nright to prevent him from getting married for the reason stated in the question. Allaah \nis the Provider and those brothers and sisters are part of His creation; He will never \nforsake them. Allaah has promised to help the one who gets married in order to keep \nhimself chaste. He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\"And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and a \nwoman who has no husband) and (also marry) the saalihoon (pious, fit and \ncapable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be \npoor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His \ncreatures’ needs, All-Knowing (about the state of the people).\"\n[al-Noor 24:32]\nThe Messenger of Allaah \n said: \"There are three to whom Allaah’s help is due: the \nmujaahid who goes out to fight for the sake of Allaah; the slaves who makes a \ncontract with his master to pay installments towards his freedom; and the one who \ngets married because he wants to remain chaste.\" (al-Tirmidhi, no. 1566. Abu ‘Eesaa said: this \nis a hasan hadeeth. See also Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 3050).\nBut if the son is able to be patient and give himself up to working and helping his \nfather to provide for his brothers and sisters, then he will be rewarded, for Allaah \nnever allows the reward of those who do good to be lost.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the relationship between a father and son is deeply rooted in mutual rights, responsibilities, and care for one another. The father, being the head of the family, often has significant influence over family decisions, including marriage. However, it is essential to balance familial obligations with personal rights, and this scenario highlights a conflict between parental responsibility and a child's right to marry.\n\n### Key Principles and Verses Supporting the Right of the Son\n\n1. **Rights and Responsibilities of Parents**:\n   The Qur'an acknowledges the responsibilities of parents towards their children, particularly regarding care, sustenance, and upbringing. For example, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233):\n   > “Mothers may breastfeed their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period]. Upon the father is their portion of the mother's food and their clothing according to what is acceptable. No person is charged with more than his capacity...”  \n   *(Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 233)*\n\n   This verse emphasizes that while parents bear responsibilities towards their children, there should be no undue distress or burden placed upon them that exceeds their capabilities.\n\n2. **The Right to Marry**:\n   Islamic teachings also recognize the individual rights of men and women to choose their partners. For instance, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:232):\n   > “And when you divorce women and they have fulfilled their term, do not prevent them from marrying their former husbands if they agree among themselves in a proper manner...”  \n   *(Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 232)*\n\n   This verse illustrates that individuals should be free to marry after fulfilling their waiting periods post-divorce, thus recognizing their right to pursue relationships.\n\n3. **Seeking the Balance Between Obligations and Rights**:\n   While a father may wish to keep his son close for support in managing his household and siblings, this does not negate the son’s rights. Islam encourages the fair treatment of all family members and balances familial duties with individual needs.\n\n### Advice for the Situation\n\n- **Communication**: The father should discuss his concerns openly with his son, explaining why he feels he needs his help. The son should also express his aspirations and the importance of marriage in his life.\n  \n- **Mutual Understanding**: Both parties should aim for a mutual understanding, respecting each other’s feelings and obligations. The father can seek to find alternative means for managing family needs that may not solely depend on his son remaining unmarried.\n\n- **Consultation with Elders or Scholars**: If disagreements persist, it may be beneficial to consult a mediator, an elder, or an Islamic scholar to provide guidance and help navigate the competing needs of the family.\n\n- **Balancing Piety and Love**: The overriding principle in Islam is to foster love and respect within family dynamics. The father’s obligations to care for his children must be complemented by an understanding of his son’s personal rights and desires.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while the father has legitimate concerns about needing his son’s help for family support, the son’s desire to marry and lead an independent life must also be acknowledged. Islam emphasizes the balance of responsibilities and rights within familial relationships. Both the father and son should strive for open communication and understanding, guided by the principles in the Qur'an. Ultimately, family unity and love should remain the priority, allowing for fulfillment of both sets of needs."

        "predicted_answer": "In the context of Islam, divorce or separation from a spouse due to issues such as the use of sihr (magic or witchcraft) from the wife's family raises significant nuances. Although there are no specific verses in the Quran that directly address the use of sihr as grounds for divorce, one must consider the general principles of marital relations and divorce in Islam, as articulated in the Quran.\n\n### General Principles of Divorce in Islam\n\n1. **Mutual Rights and Responsibilities**: The Quran emphasizes the importance of maintaining mutual respect and kindness in marital relationships. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:227) states:  \n   \"And if they are bent on divorce, God hears all and knows everything.\"  \n   This verse suggests that while divorce is allowed, it should be approached with caution and an understanding of the mutual rights and obligations of both spouses.\n\n2. **Legal Process of Divorce**: Surah Al-Baqarah (2:229-230) outlines the revocable nature of divorce:  \n   \"Divorce is (revocable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honorably, or part with them in a decent way.\"  \n   These verses allow one to seek reconciliation before executing a permanent divorce, which is a process that should be handled with care.\n\n3. **Consideration of Rights**: Surah Al-Baqarah (2:231) further emphasizes respecting the woman's rights after divorce:  \n   \"When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honorably (by revoking the divorce), or let them go with honor, and do not detain them with the intent of harassing...\"  \n   This implies that a charge of harm or mistreatment, such as the invocation of sihr, may necessitate careful consideration of the separation terms.\n\n### The Specific Case of Sihr (Magic)\n\nWhile the Quran does not explicitly mention sihr in the context of divorce, the understanding of such actions affecting the marriage can be derived from other Islamic teachings. Sihr is generally viewed as a serious offense due to its harmful impact on individuals and society, and it is often associated with disbelief (kufr). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) warned against practicing or seeking help from sorcerers and magicians.\n\n- **Seeking Protection from Sihr**: The Quran teaches believers to seek protection from the evils of magic. For example, Surah Al-Falaq (113) and Surah Al-Nas (114) include supplications that ask God for refuge from the harm caused by such practices, which indicates that if a spouse were negatively impacted by external influences such as sihr, it may provide valid grounds for seeking separation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while there are no clear verses that outline sihr specifically as grounds for divorce, the principles of mutual rights, fair treatment during divorce, and the seriousness of the offense of magic suggest that if a wife’s family practices sihr against the husband or negatively impacts the marriage, this could justifiably lead to divorce. The husband would need to approach the situation with compassion, ensuring that every measure for reconciliation is taken before proceeding with separation, adhering to the Quranic principles regarding divorce as found primarily in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:226-232) and Surah Al-Talaq (65:1-9). \n\nFidelity, integrity, and seeking justice through the guidance of the Quran and the Sunnah remain paramount concerns in these sensitive cases. Consulting knowledgeable Islamic scholars or counselors may provide more tailored guidance based on the circumstances at hand."

It remains valid until \nthe husband divorces the wife, the wife gets a divorce (khul), or the Qaadi (judge ruling \naccording to Islamic shariah) annuls the marriage contract.\nAllaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, a wife leaving her husband does not automatically nullify the marriage. It is important to understand the concepts of marriage, divorce, and the respective rights and duties of spouses according to Islamic teachings.\n\n### Key Points Regarding Marriage and Divorce:\n\n1. **Divorce is Revocable**: The Quran explicitly states that divorce can be a revocable process. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:229), it is stated:\n   > \"Divorce is (revokable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honourably, or part with them in a decent way.\" \n   This indicates that the husband has the option to reconcile with his wife within two pronouncements of divorce.\n\n2. **Waiting Period (Iddah)**: After a divorce, a wife must observe a period of waiting (iddah) before she can marry again. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:228) affirms:\n   > \"Women who are divorced have to wait for three monthly periods...\" \n   This emphasizes that the marriage is not immediately dissolved upon a wife's departure or the initiation of a divorce process.\n\n3. **Husband’s Rights and Responsibilities**: The Quran also outlines that both spouses have rights; indeed, the husband is instructed to treat his wife with kindness and respect during and after divorce. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:231), Allah commands:\n   > \"And when you have divorced your wives and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honourably (by revoking the divorce), or let them go with honour.\"\n\n4. **Redemption and Mutual Consent**: If the wife fears that the marriage cannot be maintained, she has the option to return her mahr (dowry), allowing for reconciliation. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:229) states:\n   > \"...If you fear you cannot maintain the bounds fixed by God, there will be no blame on either if the woman redeems herself.\" \n   This suggests that a wife can also seek to part ways if she desires.\n\n5. **Divorce Before Consummation**: The Quran also specifies that divorce before marriage is permissible. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:236) states:\n   > \"There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry...\" \n   This indicates the flexibility within the marriage contract in early stages.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, a wife leaving her husband does not lead to an automatic nullification of the marriage. The Quran emphasizes that divorce can be revocable, outlines the rights and responsibilities of both parties, and allows for reconciliation during the waiting period. The complex nature of marital relationships and the stipulations surrounding divorce signify that the design of Islamic law seeks to protect both parties involved, ensuring that any separation is conducted justly and compassionately."

        "question": "Ruling on Intercourse with a Woman in her rectum",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. \n\nYour apology is accepted. Striving to understand the rulings of Sharee'ah in this and similar matters is not haraam or shameful; it is necessary.\n\nAs regards your question, anal intercourse with one's wife is a major sin, whether it occurs at the time of menstruation or not. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) cursed the one who does this: \"Cursed is the one who approaches his wife in her rectum\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 2/479; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5865).\n\nThe Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) also said: \"The one who has intercourse with a menstruating woman, or with a woman in her rectum, or who goes to a fortune-teller, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1/243; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5918).\n\nIn spite of the fact that many wives of sound nature refuse this, there are some husbands who threaten their wives with divorce if they do not obey them (in this matter), and some even deceive their wives, who are too shy to ask scholars about it, into thinking that it is permissible. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said that a man may approach his wife in any way he likes, from the front or the back, so long as intercourse takes place in the place from through which a child is born. There is no doubt that the rectum is the place from which waste matter is expelled, not the place from which a child is born.\n\nAnother reason why some may commit this immoral act is that they enter upon what should be a clean married life with some jaahili (ignorant) traditions and odd practices, or with memories of scenes from indecent movies, for which they have not repented to Allaah.\n\nIt is known that this act is forbidden even if both partners agree to it. Mutual consent to a haraam deed does not make it halaal.\n\nI ask Allah to bestow upon us a proper understanding of His religion and to make us adhere to its limits, for He is the All-Hearing, the One Who answers prayers.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the issue of sexual relations, including the permissibility of intercourse with a woman in various forms, is guided by teachings from the Quran and Hadith. When discussing the specific topic of anal intercourse, the Quran does not explicitly mention it. However, scholars derive rulings based on broader principles found within Islamic teachings.\n\n1. **General Guidance on Sexual Relations**:\n   Islam encourages sexual intimacy to be expressed in a loving and respectful manner between couples, primarily within the boundaries of marriage. According to Surah Al-Baqarah (2:187), Allah states:\n   - \"They are clothing for you and you are clothing for them...\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:187)\n\n   This verse emphasizes the mutual intimacy and protective nature of the marital relationship, suggesting that sexual relations should be nurturing and respectful.\n\n2. **Scholarly Opinions**:\n   Scholars use the Quranic principles alongside Hadith to analyze permissible and impermissible actions. Although there is no direct command from the Quran regarding anal intercourse, traditional Islamic jurisprudence holds that it is generally viewed as haram (forbidden) or highly discouraged based on various Hadiths from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n   One pertinent Hadith states:\n   > \"Do not have intercourse with your wives in their rectum.\" (Reported by Abu Dawood and others)\n   \n   Given this teaching, the overwhelming consensus among scholars is that anal intercourse is impermissible.\n\n3. **Reasoning**:\n   Many scholars point to the physical and psychological health implications of anal intercourse, as well as its classification as behavior that goes against the teachings of modesty and respect for one's spouse. The discussion of maintaining the purity and sanctity of marital intimacy is a significant concern.\n\n4. **Permissibility of Intimacy**:\n   The practices of intimacy are intended to strengthen the bond between spouses, promote love and mercy, and fulfill one's desires in a lawful manner. The Quran expressly forbids abusive or degrading practices within marital relations:\n   - \"And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.\" (Surah An-Nisa 4:19)\n\nIn summary, while the Quran does not explicitly state the prohibition of anal intercourse, the scholarly consensus based on Hadith and Islamic jurisprudence concludes that it is not permissible. Couples are encouraged to engage in sexual relations that uphold the dignity and respect of one another, within the bounds of what is permissible in Islam."

        "question": "No prescribed period for consummating marriage",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. \n\nIf a man executes a valid marriage contract with a woman then it is\npermissible for the two to do as they please between themselves, even with\nonly the contract.  There is no period prescribed by Islamic shari'ah\nbetween the contract and consummation of the marriage, so this issue is up\nto the two partners as to what they decide is most appropriate and in their\nbest interests. \n\nIt is incumbent upon both parties to consider, respect, and ensure the\nother one's personal comfort and ease.  Thus, if the husband sees that the\nwife needs some time to become acclimated and develop their relationship\nand level of intimacy before consummation, such as 3 months, for example,\nhe should do so, and vice versa.  Likewise, it is incumbent upon the wife\nif she sees that her husband feels an urgent need to guard his chastity by\nconsummating the marriage that she should not prolong the period so that he\ndoes not fall into a state of awkward discomfort and difficulty, and vice\nversa.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, there is no prescribed period stipulated in the Quran for consummating a marriage following its formalization through a contract, which means marriage can be consummated at any time mutually agreed upon by the spouses. The concept of a waiting period (*iddah*) primarily applies to women after divorce, which is specified in the Quran to ensure their emotional and physical well-being during and after the divorce process.\n\n### Relevant Quranic Verses\n\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:227-230)**:\n   - \"There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry; but then provide adequately for them, the affluent according to their means, the poor in accordance with theirs as is befitting. This is surely the duty of those who do good.\" (2:227)\n   - This verse confirms that a marriage can end before it is consummated, and it establishes that a husband is still obligated to provide for the wife post-divorce even if the marriage was never consummated, highlighting that the dissolution of unconsummated marriages requires consideration and respect.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:232)**:\n   - \"When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably.\" (2:232)\n   - This verse illustrates the concept of a waiting period (iddah) that applies specifically after divorce, not concerning periods before consummating a marriage.\n\n3. **Surah At-Talaq (65:1-4)**:\n   - \"O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their appointed period... The prescribed period for those who have not menstruated yet is three months. As for those who are pregnant, their prescribed period is until the delivery of the child.\" (65:1-4)\n   - This reinforces the idea of a waiting period for women in specific conditions (menopause, premenstruation, or pregnancy) after a divorce, which assists in protecting the rights of offspring and ensuring psychological readiness for future relationships.\n\n4. **Surah At-Talaq (65:6)**:\n   - \"House the divorced women where you live, according to your means; but do not harass them...\" (65:6)\n   - This indicates compassion and respect for divorced women during the *iddah* period, enhancing their dignity and well-being even in times of marital dissolution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIslam provides a framework and guidelines regarding the processes surrounding marriage and divorce, allowing for divorce before consummation without setting a mandatory time for the consummation itself after marriage. The rules surrounding *iddah* post-divorce serve to ensure that the woman has the necessary time and space to recover before entering into a new relationship, but there is flexibility before such marriage consummation occurs. The emphasis remains on consideration, justice, and respect in both marriage and divorce circumstances.\n\n### References\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:227-230, 2:232)\n- Surah At-Talaq (65:1-4, 65:6)"
