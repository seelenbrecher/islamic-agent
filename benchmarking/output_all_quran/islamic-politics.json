        "question": "Forsaking Your Muslim Brother because of Differences in Opinion",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to forsake a Muslim, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a man to forsake his Muslim brother for more than three days, each of them turning away from the other when they meet. The better of them is the one who gives the greeting of Salam first.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5727; Muslim, 2560)\nIf the believer is a relative, such as a brother, nephew, uncle or cousin, then forsaking is an even worse sin. \nThis applies unless the person is committing a sin and there is an interest to be served by forsaking him, i.e., it will make him give up the sin. In that case, there is nothing wrong with it because this comes under the heading of removing evil. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; if he cannot then with his heart [by hating it and feeling that it is wrong], and that is the weakest level of faith.” (Narrated by Muslim, 49)  \nThe basic principle is that it is prohibited for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim unless there is a reason to allow it. (See Fatawa Manar Al-Islam, by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 3, p. 732) \nWali Al-Din Al-‘Iraqi said: \n“This prohibition applies in cases where the forsaking is caused by anger with regard to something permissible and has nothing to do with religion. With regard to forsaking someone for a religious reason, such as his committing sin or Bid`ah; this is not prohibited. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded (his companions) to forsake Ka`b ibn Malik, Hilal ibn Umayyah and Mararah ibn Al-Rabi’ (may Allah be pleased with them). Ibn ‘Abd Al-Barr said: This Hadith of Ka`b indicates that it is permissible for a man to forsake his Muslim brother if he commits some act of Bid’ah or immorality, in the hope that forsaking him may discipline him and serve as a rebuke to him. Abu Al-‘Abbas Al-Qurtubi said: With regard to forsaking a person because of sin or Bid`ah, it should be continued until he repents from that and does not go back to it. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr also said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is impermissible for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim for more than three days, unless there is the fear that speaking to him and keeping in touch with him will affect one’s religious commitment or have some harmful effect on one's spiritual and worldly interests. If that is the case, it is permissible to avoid him, because peaceful avoidance is better than harmful mixing.\" (Tarh Al-Tathrib, 8/99)\nWhat you should do, if your brother has done something prohibited, is to advise him and explain that this thing is prohibited, and remind him of Allah. If you see that he is persisting in his sin and you think that forsaking him will serve a purpose, then it is permissible to do so, as stated above. But if he has simply done something that you do not agree with, or it is the matter of different points of view, then you should explain to him that you do not agree with what he has done, or with his mistaken point of view. But if you make forsaking him the sign of your disagreeing with him, this may lead to him rejecting your view completely, let alone the fact that this is not a legitimate Islamic justification for forsaking him for more than three days. We have seen above in the Fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin that the basic principle is that it is prohibited for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim, unless there is a reason to allow it. \nThe Muslim must be forbearing and sincere towards his brothers, he must be tolerant towards them and overlook their mistakes. He should not hasten to adopt a solution that may cause division and prohibited kinds of forsaking. May Allah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. \nFor more details, please see the following answers: 13731 , 11018 , 126918 , 93775 , and 93146 .",
        "predicted_answer": "### Forsaking Your Muslim Brother because of Differences in Opinion\n\nIn Islam, the unity and brotherhood among Muslims is of paramount importance, and the Quran provides clear guidance on the significance of maintaining these ties, even in the face of differences in opinion. The verses you provided offer a rich foundation to explore this topic, emphasizing the need for solidarity, understanding, and the prohibition against division.\n\n#### 1. **Unity Among Believers**\nSurah Al-Imran (3:103-107) states:\n> \"Hold on firmly together to the rope of God, and be not divided among yourselves, and remember the favours God bestowed on you when you were one another's foe and He reconciled your hearts, and you turned into brethren through His grace. ... So be not like those who became disunited and differed among themselves after clear proofs had come to them. For them is great suffering.\" \n\nThis passage highlights the necessity of unity among Muslims and explicitly warns against disunity, stating that one should hold firmly to God's guidance and not become divided due to differences. The repercussions of disunity are described as \"great suffering,\" which serves as a strong admonition to maintain brotherhood.\n\n#### 2. **Brotherhood in Faith**\nSurah Al-Hujurat (49:10) gives the fundamental principle of brotherhood among Muslims:\n> \"The faithful are surely brothers; so restore friendship among your brothers, and fear God that you may be favoured.\"\n\nThis verse reiterates that believers are naturally brothers and emphasizes the need to mend any rifts that might exist due to differences. The Quran urges believers to restore relationships and act out of fear of God, indicating that maintaining friendships and agreements is an act of piety.\n\n#### 3. **Avoidance of Ridicule and Suspicion**\nFurthermore, in Surah Al-Hujurat (49:11-12), it is stated:\n> \"O you who believe, men should not laugh at other men, for it may be they are better than them; and women should not laugh at other women, for they may perhaps be better than them. Do not slander one another, nor give one another nick-names... Avoid most suspicions: Some suspicions are indeed sins. So do not pry into others' secrets and do not backbite.\"\n\nThis guidance suggests that instead of ridiculing or judging one another, believers should engage in constructive criticism and positive reinforcement. It also highlights the social responsibilities of Muslims, which include avoiding gossip, slander, and suspicion, thereby reinforcing unity and brotherhood instead of encouraging division.\n\n#### 4. **The Danger of Factionalism**\nSurah An-Nisa (4:89-92) provides caution against making friends with those who might lead believers away from their faith:\n> \"They wish you to become disbelievers as they are, so that you should become like them. Therefore hold them not as friends until they go out of their homes in the way of God.\"\n\nWhile this passage emphasizes caution against forming alliances with those who oppose the faith, it also serves to underscore the intrinsic communal responsibility Muslims have towards each other, fostering an atmosphere that should discourage feelings of sectarianism.\n\n#### 5. **Addressing Conflict with Wisdom**\nSurah Al-Anfal (8:61) encourages reconciliation:\n> \"But if they incline to peace, you incline to it also, and put your trust in God.\"\n\nThis verse shows that Muslims are urged to seek peace and reconciliation rather than conflict. Emphasizing dialogue over dismissal or alienation can bridge divides and foster a spirit of cooperation among those who might differ in opinion.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn essence, the Quran stresses the importance of unity and brotherhood among Muslims. Forsaking a Muslim brother because of differences in opinion contradicts the teachings of Islam. Believers are encouraged to engage respectfully with one another, work toward reconciliation, and uphold the bonds of faith even amidst disagreements. The overall message is one of compassion, dialogue, and remember God's grace that brought believers together in the first place. \n\nIn times of disagreement, turning towards these teachings can serve as a valuable guide for Muslims to navigate their relationships with wisdom and patience."

        "question": "Is he sinning if he goes against the traffic rules?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Everything that could cause harm to a Muslim or the Muslims is forbidden according to Islamic teachings. If the traffic rules help to protect against harm, then they must be followed.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, obeying the laws of the land, which includes traffic rules, is generally viewed as part of a Muslim's duty to uphold justice and order. This obedience is rooted in the broader Islamic principles of social responsibility and justice.\n\n### 1. **Respect for Authority and Order**\n\nIslam teaches that obeying lawful commands from authorities is a form of obedience to God. The Quran states:\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:59)**: \"O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you; and if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best [way] and best in result.\"\n\nThis verse establishes a clear framework whereby believers are encouraged to respect and obey the authorities, provided their commands do not contradict divine guidance.\n\n### 2. **Avoiding Harm to Others**\n\nTraffic rules are established primarily to maintain safety and order on the roads. Disregarding these rules can lead to accidents, harm to oneself, and endangerment of others, which goes against the Islamic principle of not causing harm. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) stated in a Hadith:\n\n- **Sahih Muslim**: \"There should be neither harming [others] nor reciprocating harm.\" (Referenced in various collections but generally identified in classical Islamic jurisprudence).\n\nThis principle can be interpreted to extend to the realm of public safety, including adherence to traffic laws.\n\n### 3. **Social Responsibility**\n\nIslam emphasizes the importance of overall community welfare and social responsibility. By following traffic laws, individuals contribute to a stable and safe environment for everyone. The Quran highlights this principle:\n\n- **Surah Al-An'am (6:151)**: \"...and do not approach the orphan's property except in a way that is best until he reaches maturity. And fulfill [every] commitment. Indeed, the commitment is ever [that about which one will be] questioned.\"\n\nThe concept of fulfilling commitments and responsibilities extends to all aspects of one’s life, including obeying regulations that ensure public order.\n\n### 4. **Consequences for Transgression**\n\nThe Quran warns against transgressing limits set by God and the law. For instance:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:90)**: \"O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful.\"\n\nWhile this verse speaks specifically about acts of sin, the underlying theme is to avoid actions that can lead to societal chaos. Thus, disobeying traffic rules, which is detrimental to society’s safety and order, may be viewed similarly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, willfully disobeying traffic rules can be considered sinful in Islam as it contradicts the principles of obeying lawful authority, ensuring community welfare, and avoiding harm to others. A Muslim is encouraged to abide by the laws of the land unless they directly contradict Islamic teachings. Following traffic rules is not only a civic responsibility but also an act of fulfilling one's obligations as a Muslim."

        "question": "Ruling on referring cases to a female judge regarding family matters",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a woman to be appointed as a judge, because that is one of the positions of public authority that are restricted to men only. This has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 71338 .\nBut if there is no male judge, and the person has no choice but to refer the case to the court, and there is no one available to refer cases to except a woman, and if not referring the case to her would lead to loss of one’s rights or cause harm, then in that case there is nothing wrong with referring the case to her as a matter of necessity.\nWe put this question to our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Barraak (may Allah preserve him), and he replied: If there is no one available except this female judge, then yes, it is permissible to refer cases to her for judgement as a matter of necessity, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “So fear Allah as much as you are able” [at-Taghaabun 64:16].\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question regarding the ruling on referring cases to a female judge in family matters is nuanced, considering traditional Islamic jurisprudence, gender roles, and the principles of justice enshrined in the Quran.\n\n### Islamic Perspective on Gender and Authority\n\nIn Islam, both men and women hold unique and significant roles in society, including in legal matters. The verses from Surah An-Nisa and Surah Al-Mujadila that you provided highlight the importance of justice and fairness, particularly in family matters.\n\n1. **Justice and Fairness**: \n   - **Surah An-Nisa (4:127)** emphasizes that God has provided guidance regarding women and the need for justice, noting the responsibility of guardianship over orphans and ensuring their rights are upheld. This reflects a broader mandate for fairness in all dealings.\n   - **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:1)** shows that God is attentive to women's grievances, indicating their voices and concerns are integral to Islamic jurisprudence.\n\n2. **Qualifications of Judges**: \n   - The Quran does not explicitly prohibit women from holding positions of authority or acting as judges. Traditional interpretations have varied, but many scholars argue that the primary criterion for any judge should be knowledge, justice, and competency, rather than gender. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) included women in various societal roles, suggesting that females can indeed have a functional role as judges.\n\n3. **Specific References to Female Judges**:\n   - While the Quran does not mention female judges directly, the Hadith literature includes examples of women participating in legal matters. For example, the case of **Fatimah bint Al-Ash'ath** who approached Caliph Ali for justice regarding her inheritance illustrates that women seek legal recourse and participate in discussions that can involve judgments.\n\n4. **Family Matters**: \n   - In family law, where emotional intelligence and understanding of family dynamics are essential, having female judges can potentially offer unique insights. The verses (4:3-7) reiterate the importance of equity and justice in family matters, which a female judge could provide from a distinct perspective, especially dealing with issues relating to women.\n\n5. **Conclusion** on Female Judges:\n   - In conclusion, it is not inherently incorrect in Islamic law to appoint a female judge for family matters; doing so may align with the Qur’anic principles of justice and fair treatment as proclaimed in Surah An-Nisa (4:36) and Surah Al-Mujadila (58:1). Many contemporary scholars advocate for the inclusion of women in all spheres of society based on these foundational texts and the historical precedents set during the formation of the early Islamic state.\n\n### References:\n1. Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 127 - \"And they ask you for judgement about women...\"\n2. Surah Al-Mujadila, Ayah 1 - \"God certainly heard what the woman who argued with you about her husband said...\""

        "question": "Sources of income for the bayt al-maal (treasury) in the Muslim state",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe causes on which zakaah may be spent are defined in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Zakaah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect [zakaah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allah . And Allah is Knowing and Wise”\n[at-Tawbah 9:60].\nFor an explanation of this verse, please see the answer to question no. 46209.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the sources of income of the bayt al-maal (treasury), they are many and varied both in the past and in the modern era.\nIn al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (8/245-248) it says:\nSources of income for the bayt al-maal:\n\nZakaah of all types, which the ruler takes whether it is taken from wealth that is visible or hidden, such as grazing livestock, crops, cash and trade goods.\nOne fifth (khums) of movable booty. Booty refers to all wealth that is taken from the disbelievers by means of fighting, apart from land and real estate. One fifth of this wealth is to be given to the bayt al-maal, to be spent on various prescribed causes. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And know that anything you obtain of war booty - then indeed, for Allah is one fifth of it and for the Messenger and for [his] near relatives and the orphans, the needy, and the [stranded] traveller…” [al-Anfaal 8:41].\nOne fifth of metals and the like extracted from the ground, such as gold, silver, iron and so on. It was said that this also applies to what is extracted from the sea, such as pearls, ambergris and so on.\nOne fifth of buried treasure. This refers to all wealth that was buried underground by human actions. What is meant here is the treasure of the disbelieving people of the Jaahiliyyah (pre-Islamic period of ignorance). If a Muslim finds it, one fifth of it is to be given to the bayt al-maal; the remainder belongs to the finder.\nFay’, which is all movable wealth that is captured from the disbelievers without a fight and without mobilising troops. Fay’ is of different types:\n\n\nLand and property from which the disbelievers fled for fear of the Muslims (at time of war). This is to be made into a waqf, like land that is seized by fighting, and its yield is to be shared out every year. This was stated by the Shaafa‘is, although there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning the matter.\nMovable wealth that is left behind and abandoned by the disbelievers. This is to be divided on the spot, and not turned into a waqf.\nWhat is taken from the disbelievers of taxes or rental of land of which the Muslims have gained possession and rented out to a Muslim or a dhimmi [non-Muslim living under Muslim rule], or rental of land that the Muslims have left in the possession of its original owners, whether it was acquired on the basis of a peace deal or was taken by force then left in their hands on the grounds that they are still its owners and they pay kharaaj (land tax) to us.\nJizyah, which is a poll tax paid by the disbelievers in return for their living in Muslim lands. It is imposed on each adult, able-bodied male, or on a city as a whole, to pay a specific amount of money. If someone pays it who is not obliged to do so, it is regarded as a gift, not as jizyah.\nOne tenth paid by ahl adh-dhimmah [non-Muslims living under Muslim rule]. This is a tax paid on trade goods that they export to dar al-harb [hostile non-Muslim territory] or that they import from dar al-harb to dar al-islam [Muslim territory], or that they move from one city to another within Muslim territory. It is to be paid by them once a year.\n\nSimilar to that is the one tenth paid by traders from dar al-harb, if they come to us with trade goods and seek our protection.\n\nWhat the non-Muslims in a state of war with the Muslims agree to pay in return for a peace deal.\nThe wealth of an apostate if he is executed or dies, and the wealth of a heretic if he is executed or dies. Their wealth is not to be inherited [by their heirs]; rather it comes under the heading of fay’. According to the Hanafis, the wealth of an apostate is subject to further discussion.\nWealth of a dhimmi [non-Muslim living under Muslim protection] who dies and has no heir, or what is left over from his wealth after his heirs have taken their shares.  This is also regarded as fay’.\nLands captured by means of fighting that are agricultural lands, according to those scholars who do not think that such lands are to be divided among the fighters who capture them.\n\n\nThe yield of land belonging to the bayt al-maal, or rent on property owned by the bayt al-maal, and earnings on related trade and business dealings.\nGifts, donations and bequests that are given to the bayt al-maal for jihad or other purposes that are in the public interest.\nGifts that are given to judges who were not given gifts before being appointed to that position, or gifts that are given to judges but the giver has a dispute before the judge. If these gifts are not returned to the giver, they are to be given to the bayt al-maal, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) took from Ibn al-Latbiyah [who was sent out to collect zakaah and gave the zakaah to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) but he wanted to keep what was given to him as gifts] what had been given to him as gifts.\n\nThe same applies to gifts that are given to the ruler by non-Muslims who are hostile towards the Muslim state, and gifts that are given to state workers, unless the recipient pays towards these items from his personal wealth.\n\nTaxes imposed on people in order to take care of their own interests, whether that is for jihad or other purposes. These taxes should not be imposed on them unless there are insufficient funds in the bayt al-maal to serve that interest and it is essential. Otherwise, this is an illegitimate source of income.\nLost wealth; this refers to wealth that is found but it is not possible to know who the owner is, whether it is found in the street, entrusted to someone for safe keeping, given as collateral, found with thieves and their ilk, and similar wealth of which no one claims ownership. It is to be given to the bayt al-maal.\nThe estate of any Muslim who dies and has no heir, or he has heirs who do not inherit all of his wealth, according to the scholars who think that what is left over should not be given to his relatives. In the case of someone who is killed and has no heir, the diyah (blood money) for his killing goes to the bayt al-maal and is to be spent on the same causes as the fay’.\n\nThe right of the bayt al-maal to this kind of wealth is subject to the rulings on inheritance, according to the Shaafa‘is and Maalikis. The Hanbalis and Hanafis say that it is to be given to the bayt al-maal according to the rules on fay’, not inheritance.\n\nPenalties and confiscated wealth. It is narrated in the Sunnah that one who withholds zakaah is to be penalised by having half of his wealth seized. This is the view of Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh and Abu Bakr ‘Abd al-‘Azeez. It was narrated that a penalty is to be imposed on one who picks fruit for free and takes it out [of the garden or orchard]; the penalty is to be double the value of the fruit. This is the view of the Hanbalis and Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh. What appears to be the case is that when such penalties are taken, they are to be spent in the public interest, thus they become due to the bayt al-maal.\n\nIt was narrated that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) took half of the wealth of some people who were appointed to positions of authority when they became rich because of their positions.\nOne of the sources of income for the bayt al-maal in the modern era is the natural resources that were discovered in the lands of Muslim states, namely petroleum, natural gas, minerals and so on. It is very rare to find a state in which there are no resources of that nature.\nAnother source of income is what the state charges in return for what it carries out of agricultural, industrial or commercial projects, or services that it offers to the people, such as electricity, telephones, water and so on.\nThus it will become clear that there are many sources of income for the bayt al-maal.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Bayt al-Maal, or the Islamic treasury, plays a critical role in managing the state's financial matters, particularly in the distribution of wealth and provision for the welfare of the community. The sources of income for the Bayt al-Maal in a Muslim state can be drawn from several Islamic principles as articulated in the Quran. Below are the key sources of income based on relevant verses:\n\n### 1. **Zakat (Obligatory Almsgiving)**\nZakat is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and serves as a mandatory act of charity that purifies wealth. It is typically collected from those who meet certain wealth thresholds.\n\n**Supportive Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:276)**: \"Those who believe and do good deeds, and fulfill their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, have their reward with their Lord, and will have neither fear nor regret.\" This verse emphasizes the importance of zakat in purifying wealth and the benefits for those who pay it.\n  \n### 2. **Sadaqah (Voluntary Charity)**\nSadaqah refers to voluntary charity beyond the obligatory zakat. This can be an important source for the treasury, as it encourages community support and generosity.\n\n**Supportive Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:272)**: \"Whatever you spend you will do so for yourself, for you will do so to seek the way that leads to God; and what you spend in charity you will get back in full, and no wrong will be done to you.\" This verse highlights the rewards of spending in the way of God.\n  \n### 3. **Ghanimah (War Booty)**\nThe spoils of war acquired through lawful means are considered a source of wealth for the Bayt al-Maal and are distributed among the community and those in need.\n\n**Supportive Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Anfal (8:41)**: “And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that Allah has with Him a great reward. And know that the Messenger of Allah and those who have believed with him will be in the highest gardens of Paradise.”\n\n### 4. **Kharaj (Land Tax)**\nKharaj refers to the taxes collected from landowners, particularly from land that was conquered and redistributed.\n\n### 5. **Jizyah (Protection Tax)**\nThis is a tax levied on non-Muslims living in an Islamic state in exchange for protection and exemption from military service. The proceeds contribute to the Bayt al-Maal.\n\n**Supportive Verses:**\n- **Surah At-Tawbah (9:29)**: \"Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture – [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled.\" This verse outlines the procedure for imposing jizyah.\n\n### 6. **Fai (Property Gains Without Warfare)**\nFai refers to wealth or property obtained by peaceful means or without warfare, which also contributes to the state treasury.\n\n**Supportive Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Hadid (57:7)**: \"Believe in Allah and His Messenger and spend out of that in which He has made you successors. And that is best for you, if you should believe.\" This emphasizes the importance of using the wealth accrued as successors for the good of society.\n\n### 7. **Gifts and Bequests**\nGifts and inheritance that are donated to the Bayt al-Maal can provide additional support for community services.\n\nIn summary, the Bayt al-Maal is funded through various means aimed at fostering community welfare and supporting those in need. The Quran outlines these sources, and they form the foundation for the financial obligations of Muslims towards both their community and the state. The combination of zakat, sadaqah, taxes such as kharaj and jizyah, and lawful property gains contributes to the financial health of a Muslim state, ensuring that social and economic justice is maintained."

        "question": "Definition of terrorism and what it means in Islam and in the West",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nTerrorism (Arabic irhaab) is a term that refers to scaring others. In and of itself it is neither good nor bad, unless the one who uses this word intends it to mean something and unless we see the consequences of the actions based on it. Whoever says that terrorism (irhaab) in Islam is synonymous with killing is mistaken, because the linguistic meaning of the word does not reflect that. Terrorism refers to scaring, not killing per se. In terms of Arabic usage, words derived from the same root as irhaab (terrorism) appear in the Qur’an where our Lord, may He be exalted, instructs us to fear Him, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “and fear [only] Me [wa iyyaaya farhaboon]” [al-Baqarah 2:40]. He has also commanded us to prepare to face the enemy from whom we expect plots against us and plans to wage war against us. This preparation is intended to scare (or terrify) the enemy so that we will not become easy prey for him. This is stated clearly in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know [but] whom Allah knows”\n[al-Anfaal 8:60].\nThe unjust colonialist states use this word in conjunction with Islam, intending thereby to distort its image in the sight of all people. Hence they set up conferences and held seminars, and established research institutes in the name of fighting terrorism, but in all of these efforts there was no discussion at all about these criminal colonialist states who are oppressing the weak Muslims, such as the Hindus and their terrorising of Muslims in Kashmir, or the Russians and their terrorising of Muslims in Chechnya, or the Americans and their terrorising of Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Zionists and their terrorising of Muslims in Palestine. Some naïve Muslims have started to use this word to describe anyone they want to fight, and put people off him. They may be right in describing a particular group of Muslims as terrorists, but what about the states that use terrorism, and what about criminal racist organisations that have been spared from having this word used against them, which has become used exclusively in reference to Muslims?!\nThe rulings and teachings of Islam were prescribed by Allah for the purpose of protecting the honour, life and wealth of the Muslim. For that purpose Islam forbids killing, theft, zina (unlawful sex), and slander, and has ordained severe punishments for anyone who commits those crimes. The punishment may go as far as execution – as in the case of the previously-married zaani (adulterer) – so as to protect people’s honour.\nThere is a severe punishment for one who terrorises and frightens people, such as gangs of bandits on the highways and those who do similar deeds within the city. They are the ones who strive to spread mischief and corruption on earth. Allah has prescribed the severest punishments for them, so as to ward off their evil and protect people’s wealth, lives and honour. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment”\n[al-Maa’idah 5:33].\nIn fact, Islam went even further, as it forbids the Muslim to scare his brother, even in jest. It was narrated from as-Saa’ib ibn Yazeed that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No one of you should take his brother’s property in jest or in earnest, and whoever has taken his brother’s staff, let him return it.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2160) and Abu Dawood (5003); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi Layla said: The companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that they were travelling with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey. One of the men fell asleep, and some of them went and took some arrows that he had with him, and when the man woke up he panicked, and the people laughed. He said: What made you laugh? They said: Nothing, but we took this man’s arrows and he panicked. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to scare or alarm another Muslim.” Narrated by Ahmad (23064) and Abu Daawood (4351). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Daawood.\nSecondly:\n“Terrorism” (irhaab) in Islam is of two types:\n\nThat which is praiseworthy\n\nThis refers to scaring an enemy lest he attack the Muslims and occupy their land. That involves being fully prepared, arming themselves with faith, being united, and equipping themselves with weapons. The verse from Soorat al-Anfaal quoted above explains that it is obligatory for the Muslims to do this.\nIslam is not alone in this regard. Rather all nations compete in manufacturing arms and equipping themselves with weapons of mass destruction, establishing huge armies, and holding military parades to show off their troops and weapons. All of that is a show of strength intended to scare their neighbours and enemies, lest they think of attacking them.\n\nThat which is blameworthy\n\nThis refers to scaring those who do not deserve to be scared, Muslims or others whose lives are protected by Islamic law, such as those who have a covenant with the Muslims, those to whom the Muslims have granted protection and safety, and non-Muslims living under Muslim rule (ahl adh-dhimmah)\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council has defined terrorism as: acts of aggression and enmity carried out by individuals, groups or states by way of transgressing against people (affecting their religious commitment, physical and mental well-being, wealth or honour). That includes all ways of scaring, harming and threatening people, or killing them unlawfully, and all actions that are connected to those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, scaring wayfarers and travellers, acts of banditry, and all violent acts or threats that take place in support of criminal objectives, whether they are done by individuals or groups, with the aim of instilling fear and terror in people, scaring them by harming them, or exposing their lives, freedom, sense of security and well-being to danger. Another type of terrorism is damaging the environment, facilities, public or private property, or exposing some national or natural resources to danger. All of these are ways of spreading mischief and corruption on earth, which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has forbidden the Muslims to do in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters”\n[al-Qasas 28:77].\nSixteenth session, Makkah al-Mukarramah, 21-26/10/1422 AH -- 5-10/1/2002 CE\nIn this statement, they pointed out two important issues:\nThe first issue is refuting the argument of those who describe Islam as being a religion of terrorism. Among other things, this statement said:\nThe members of the Council have noted that media campaigns are well orchestrated, and based on lies and nonsense, as they are organised by the types of media that are irrational and hostile, which are directed by the Zionist media organisations to stir up resentment, hatred and discrimination against Islam and Muslims, and to make false accusations against the final religion of Allah, foremost among which is the accusation of terrorism.\nIt became clear to the members of the Council that accusing Islam of terrorism through media campaigns is but an attempt to put people off Islam, as people are showing interest in it and are entering the religion of Allah in crowds.\nThe members of the Council call upon the Muslim World League and other Muslim organisations, and indeed all Muslims, to defend Islam, whilst paying attention to choosing the best methods that are appropriate to the honour that may be attained by undertaking this mission in the context of refuting the lies against Islam, and the accusation of terrorism. It may be noted that terrorism is a global phenomenon that cannot be attributed to a particular religion or people. Rather it is a phenomenon that stems from extremism of which no modern society is free. They explained that there are different types of extremism, such as political extremism, ideological extremism or religious extremism. Extremism that results from exaggeration about some issues of religion is not limited to the followers of a particular religion. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, mentioned the People of the Book exaggerating about their religion, and He forbade them to do that, as He says in His holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say, O People of the Scripture, do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way.\"”\n[al-Maa’idah 5:77].\nThe second issue that the council discussed is terrorism carried out at the level of the state. This is a matter concerning which the global media is silent, and has not exposed the people behind it. Among other things, the council said in a statement:\nThe Council affirms that there is another type of terrorism, which is terrorism carried out at the level of the state. One of its clearest and most abhorrent forms is the terrorism that is perpetrated by the Zionists in Palestine, and what the Serbs did in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Kosova. The Council regards this type of terrorism as posing the gravest danger to security and peace in the world, and regards confronting it as coming under the heading of self-defence and jihad in Allah’s cause.\nEnd quote.\nThirdly:\nWith regard to terrorism perpetrated by the West, it is what we read of and witness of their invasion of weaker states and the plundering of their resources, and what we see of torture, rape and killing, all of which is documented via audio and video media, in documents that cannot be denied. This is a continuation of their historical practice of occupation by means of force, violence and weapons.\nWhat is really strange is that Western states – especially America –have not given a definition of terrorism until now! It is clear that they would implicate themselves by any definition they chose. Therefore they have given this word a vague meaning, to be applied to whoever they decide to accuse of terrorism.\nShaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said:\nFrom ancient times, the disbelievers have waged war against Islam, describing it in the worst of terms, in order to put people off it. “They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it.” [at-Tawbah 9:32]. That includes their description of Islam as terrorism and savagery. They forget that terrorism, savagery, genocide, transgression against people unlawfully, and all other blameworthy attitudes in fact belong to the way of the disbelievers and are part of the disbelievers’ character.\nThe fact that some so-called Muslims have behaved wrongly – either out of ignorance or bad intentions – cannot be attributed to Islam, for Islam forbids such deeds.\nThe way to protect Islam from this accusation is to explain that the actions of these individuals has nothing to do with Islam; rather these are cases of individuals acting badly, and every Muslim is prone to error; no one is infallible except the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAl-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Fawzaan (1/416, question no. 247)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Definition of Terrorism in Islam and the West\n\n**Terrorism Defined:**\n\nIn general terms, terrorism is defined as the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in pursuit of political aims. This definition is applied in both Islamic and Western contexts, but there are significant differences in interpretations and applications influenced by cultural, historical, and political factors.\n\n### Understanding Terrorism in Islam\n\n1. **Opposition and Sin**: From an Islamic perspective, acts that harm innocent lives or create chaos are viewed as sinful. The Quran emphasizes valuing human life and condemns those who engage in acts of violence without justification. For example:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:32)** states: *\"Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely.\"* This verse reflects the sanctity of human life and indicates that taking innocent lives is equivalent to a major sin.\n\n2. **Aggression and Disorder**: The Quran defines the punishment for those who cause disorder or wage war against God and His Messenger:\n\n   - In **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:33-34)**, it is stated: *\"The punishment for those who wage war against God and His Messenger, and strive to make mischief in the land, is none but that they be killed or crucified or their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land.\"* This indicates that violence and chaos against the community lead to severe consequences, but it should be understood in contexts involving systemic oppression or warfare against believers.\n\n3. **Struggle for Justice**: Islam encourages fighting in a context of oppression and injustice but emphasizes that such struggle must uphold ethical conduct. \n\n   - **Surah An-Nisa (4:75)** highlights the duty to fight for the oppressed: *\"What is [the matter] with you that you do not fight in the cause of Allah and for the oppressed among men, women, and children who say, 'Our Lord, take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from Yourself a protector and appoint for us from Yourself a helper'?\"* This identifies fighting as justified when it aims to liberate those who are being wronged.\n\n4. **Defensive Warfare**: Fighting is permitted in self-defense or to protect the oppressed, not as a form of aggression. \n\n   - **Surah Al-Hajj (22:39-40)** states: *\"Permission to fight has been granted to those who are being fought because they were wronged. And surely, Allah is capable of granting them victory.\"* This elaborates the Islamic view that warfare must stem from a defensive stance rather than aggression.\n\n### Understanding Terrorism in the West\n\nIn Western contexts, terrorism is often seen through a legal and political lens, emphasizing the need for national security and the upholding of civil rights. The definitions and examples of terrorism may vary depending on political interests, historical narratives, and media portrayals.\n\n1. **Civic Responsibility**: Western discourse often focuses on the government's obligation to protect its citizens, viewing terror acts as attacks against the state and its citizens, justifying military or police actions against perceived threats.\n\n2. **Legal Definitions**: Western legal systems have specific statutes that define and punish terrorism, focusing on the methodology of violence and the intention behind actions taken.\n\n3. **Media Portrayal**: Media representation can influence public perception, often framing individuals associated with terrorism in a manner that can stigmatize entire communities or religions. This often diverges from the broader ethical teachings that emphasize justice, mercy, and the protection of innocent lives found within Islamic doctrine.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn both Islam and the West, terrorism is condemned and defined by its unjust violence against innocents, though the motivations, contexts, and responses can vary significantly. Islamic teachings prioritize justice, protection of human life, and ethical conduct in fighting against oppression, which stands in contrast to radical interpretations that utilize violence against innocents for any political or ideological ends. Understanding these complexities can foster greater dialogue and bridge gaps in perception across differing cultures. \n\nThe Quran consistently affirms that violence should only be used defensively and always within moral boundaries, a principle that should ideally guide both Islamic and Western discourses on terrorism."

        "question": "Politics from an Islamic perspective",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The word siyaasah (translated above as political outlook) comes from a root (saasa) meaning to become in charge and take care of something, which means looking after something in a manner that maintains its well-being. The phrase sawwasahu al-qawm refers to people appointing someone to run their affairs.\nSee: Lisaan al-‘Arab (6/107); al-Qaamoos al-Muheet (p. 170).\nAl-Bukhaari (3455) and Muslim (1842) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Children of Israel were ruled by the Prophets (tasoosuhum al-Anbiyaa’); every time one prophet died, another prophet would succeed him.”\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“[They] were ruled by the Prophets” means the Prophets took care of their affairs as rulers who are in charge of the people do. Thus siyaasah means to take care of something in a manner that maintains its well-being and serves its interests. End quote.\nIbn Nujaym said:\nSiyaasah refers to an action taken by the ruler as he sees fit, even if there is no partial evidence for the action he takes.\nAl-Bahr ar-Raa’iq (5/11).\nIbn Khaldoon defined as-siyaasah ash-shar‘iyyah [siyaasah on the basis of Islamic teachings] as follows: [It means] to lead the people in accordance with shar‘i guidelines, in a manner that serves their interests in the hereafter as well as in this world, for their interests in this world are connected to and may serve their interests in the hereafter, because the Islamic guidelines concerning the life of this world are connected to what serves people’s interests in the hereafter. Thus as-siyaasah ash-shar‘iyyah, in reality, means acting in the stead of the Messenger in guarding religious affairs and taking care of worldly affairs. End quote from Muqaddimat Ibn Khaldoon (p. 97)\nBased on that, siyaasah is an indivisible part of Islam, and there is no separation between siyaasah (politics) and deen (religion).\nBased on the above and on modern usage of the word siyaasah, we may say that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to conduct the people’s affairs and run the affairs of state on the basis of wise politics (siyaasah), because he brought a set of laws that were aimed at achieving what is in people’s best interests and warding off what is harmful and bad.\nThis is also how the Rightly Guided Caliphs and leaders of guidance after him ran the affairs of the ummah.\nSee also: at-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah by Ibn al-Qayyim (p. 17-20).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Politics from an Islamic perspective is a multifaceted topic encompassing governance, justice, ethics, and community relations. The Islamic framework for governance is not merely political; it is also deeply intertwined with moral and ethical principles that guide individual and collective behavior.\n\n### Key Principles of Islamic Politics\n\n1. **Justice and Fairness**\n   The Quran emphasizes the importance of justice. Muslims are urged to stand firm in justice, not allowing personal feelings or animosities to sway them from fair judgment. This principle is highlighted in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:8):\n   - **\"O you who believe, stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even if it be against yourselves, or parents, or relatives...\"** (5:8)\n\n2. **Collective Responsibility**\n   Islam encourages believers to support one another in righteous endeavors rather than engage in wrongdoing. This is expressed in the same verse (5:2):\n   - **“But help one another in righteousness and piety, and do not assist one another in sin and transgression.”** (5:2)\n\n3. **The Sanctity of Agreements**\n   Fulfillment of obligations and commitments is a recurring theme in the Quran. This not only applies to personal matters but extends to political agreements and governance. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:1):\n   - **“O you who believe, fulfill [all] contracts...”** (5:1)\n\n4. **Consultation (Shura)**\n   The principle of mutual consultation (shura) is emphasized in Islamic governance. The Quran advocates for collective decision-making as demonstrated in Surah Ash-Shura (42:38):\n   - **“And those who have responded to [their] lord and established prayer and whose affair is [determined by] consultation among themselves...”** (42:38)\n\n5. **The Role of Leaders**\n   Leaders in an Islamic context bear a significant responsibility. They are expected to embody the ethical and moral values of Islam, ensuring that they do not abuse their authority. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, “Every one of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock” (Sahih al-Bukhari). This indicates that political leaders should lead with integrity and accountability.\n\n6. **Freedom of Belief and Expression**\n   Islam acknowledges the rights of individuals to follow their beliefs and express themselves. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:256) states:\n   - **“There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion.”** (2:256). This implies that any governmental or political action should respect individual freedoms of belief.\n\n7. **Prevention of Corruption**\n   The Quran warns against corruption and dishonesty, critical concerns in any political framework. Surah Al-Anfal (8:27) states:\n   - **“O you who have believed, do not betray Allah and the Messenger or betray your trusts while you know [the consequence]...”** (8:27).\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom an Islamic perspective, politics should be anchored in principles of justice, ethical governance, community welfare, and mutual respect. The emphasis on justice, fulfilling obligations, and community consultation outlines a framework for political life that promotes ethical conduct and societal harmony. As Muslims engage with political systems, they should strive to implement these principles, ensuring that their actions reflect the core values of Islam. \n\nThis approach ensures that the political practices align with the teachings of the Quran, creating governance that is responsible, ethical, and beneficial for society as a whole."

        "question": "Doubts about the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) and a response to those doubts",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.I.\nThe Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) – even though they are the best of people – were also human, and there occurred among them that which usually occurs among people of disputes and differences of opinion. But they were the swiftest of people in doing good, and they were the foremost in knowledge of the truth, acting upon it and the swiftest to acknowledge and correct their mistakes, if one of them made a mistake, like any other human.\nWhat is required of anyone who is accountable is to refrain from discussing the differences that arose among the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) and to think positively of every one of them.\nWhere could you find any people who are better than those who accompanied the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), migrated with him, strove with him in jihad, and prayed behind him?\nSee the answer to question no. 127028.\nII.\nIt was narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad in as-Sunnah (1312), Ibn Abi ‘Aasim in as-Sunnah (1219) and al-Bayhaqi in al-I‘tiqaad (p. 358) that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said: No one gives me precedence over Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) but I shall flog him with the hadd punishment of one who fabricates lies.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is proven via many isnads from ‘Ali that he said: No man will be brought to me who gives me precedence over Abu Bakr and ‘Umar but I shall flog him with the hadd punishment of one who fabricates lies.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (4/479).\nHe also said:\nIt was narrated from ‘Ali via approximately eighty isnaads or more that he said on the minbar of Kufah: The best of this ummah after its Prophet are Abu Bakr and ‘Umar.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (4/407).\nIII.\nIt is proven in as-Saheehayn that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib swore allegiance to Abu Bakr, even though it was delayed by a few months.\n‘Ali did not show any disagreement towards Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) or express any disapproval of the caliphate of Abu Bakr, and never expressed any dissent. Rather he delayed giving his allegiance to Abu Bakr. The reason for that was that he objected to Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and others among the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) deciding the matter of the caliphate without him, despite his virtue, honour and high status, for he had the right to be present and be consulted about the matter, and that no decision should be taken without him.\nThe excuse that the Sahaabah gave was that they had hastened to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr so as to ward off fitnah and turmoil in the Muslim community, because they feared that disputes and conflicts might arise if they delayed it.\nAnother reason for the delay [in ‘Ali swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr] was the fact that Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) got angry with Abu Bakr’s response to her when she asked him about her inheritance (from the Prophet(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)], and ‘Ali thought that he should show sympathy to her by staying away from Abu Bakr, especially since she was going through sorrow, distress and grief at the passing of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\n‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) did not refuse to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him); rather he delayed doing so for the reasons mentioned above. Then he came and swore allegiance to him without being forced to do so.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\nIt is known via tawaatur reports that no one held back from swearing allegiance to him – namely Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) – except Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah. As for ‘Ali and Banu Haashim, all of them swore allegiance to him, according to consensus, and none of them died until after swearing allegiance to him. But it was said that ‘Ali delayed swearing allegiance to him for six months, or that he swore allegiance to him on the second day. Whatever the case, they swore allegiance to him without being forced to do so.\nEnd quote from Minhaaj as-Sunnah (8/232).\nSee also the answer to question no. 147540.\nIV.\nIt is not proven that ‘Uthmaan beat ‘Ammaar (may Allah be pleased with them both), let alone that ‘Ali saw that and did not object. All of the reports that have been narrated concerning that are not sound in their isnaads (chains of narration).\nIbn Shabbah said in Taareekh al-Madinah (3/1098):\nAl-Qaasim ibn al-Fudayl told us: ‘Amr ibn Murrah told me, from Saalim ibn Abi’l-Ja‘d, who said: ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) called some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), among whom was ‘Ammar, and said: I am going to ask you something; I adjure you by Allah, do you know that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to give precedence to Quraysh over all other people, and he used to give precedence to Banu Haashim over the rest of Quraysh? The people remained silent, so he said: If the keys of Paradise were in my hand, I would give them to Banu Umayyah so that all of them, to the last man, would enter it. By Allah, I would surely give to them and appoint them (to positions of authority), in spite of you. ‘Ammar said: Inspite of me? ‘Uthmaan said: In spite of you. ‘Ammaar said: And in spite of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar? ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) got angry and leapt up, and started to beat him severely, and the people intervened and pushed him away from ‘Ammaar.\n This is a da‘eef (weak) isnad. Saalim ibn Abi’l-Ja‘d did not hear [reports] from ‘Uthmaan. Al-Haafiz al-‘Alaa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Saalim ibn Abi’l-Ja‘d al-Kufi is well known; he narrated many mursal reports from the senior Sahaabah such as ‘Umar, ‘Ali, ‘Aa’ishah, Ibn Mas‘ood and others (may Allah be pleased with them). Abu Zar‘ah said: [Reports narrated by] Saalim ibn Abi’l-Ja‘d from ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and ‘Ali are mursal.\nEnd quote from Jaami‘ at-Tahseel (p. 179)\nIbn ‘Abd Rabbihi said in al-‘Aqd al-Fareed (5/57):\nIn a hadith narrated by al-A‘mash from Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah, he said: The companions of ‘Uthmaan wrote down his mistakes on a page and wrote down people’s criticisms of him. They said: Who will take this to him? ‘Ammaar said: I will. So he took it to him, and when he read it he [‘Uthmaan] said: May Allah cause your disgrace. ‘Ammaar said: And Abu Bakr and ‘Umar too? ‘Uthmaan stood up and beat him until he fell unconscious. Then ‘Uthmaan regretted it, and he sent Talhah and az-Zubayr to him to say to him: Choose one of three: either forgive me, or accept compensation for the injury, or retaliate in kind [qisas]. ‘Ammaar said: By Allah, I will not accept any of them until I meet Allah! Abu Bakr [ibn Abi Shaybah, the narrator of this report] said: I mentioned this hadith to al-Hasan ibn Saalih, and he said: ‘Uthmaan could not have done more than he did (to seek reconciliation).\nThis is a da‘eef (weak) isnad, like the previous report. Al-A‘mash is regarded as being among the junior Taabi‘een; he was born too late to have met ‘Uthmaan or ‘Ali or ‘Ammaar.\nSee: Mizaan al-I‘tidaal (2/224) and at-Tahdheeb (4/196).\nIn fact, Ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi, who quoted this report in his book, did not trace its isnad back to al-A‘mash. As it is possible that this report may be traced to someone who comes before al-A‘mash [in the chain of narration], it is also possible that it may be traced to someone who comes after him,  whom Ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi omitted between Ibn Abi Shaybah and al-A‘mash.\nIbn Abi Bakr al-Maaliqi said: If it is said that ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) beat ‘Ammaar, it should be pointed out that this is not proven. Even if it could be proven, the imam (ruler) has the right to discipline some of his subjects, as he sees fit, even if he is mistaken.\nDo you not see that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) allowed people to settle scores with him. Similarly, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) disciplined some of their subjects slapping and hitting with a stick, and they allowed others to settle the score with them.\nIf someone says that ‘Uthmaan did not allow anyone to settle a score with him,\nIt should be said to him: How can that be true, when he made offers to that effect in an unprecedented manner, especially when he was under siege in his house, when he said: O people, if you find in the Book of Allah that you should put my feet in fetters, then do so.”\nEnd quote from Shubuhaat hawla as-Sahaabah: Dhu’n-Noorayn ‘Uthmaan (p. 144).\nThere are sounder reports which contradict that. It was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in his Musannaf (7/521) and Ibn Shabbah in Taareekh al-Madinah (3/1101), via Husayn ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan who said: Juhaym, a man from Banu Fihr, told me: I witnessed this event. He said: Sa‘d and ‘Ammaar came and sent word to ‘Uthmaan, saying: Please come; we want to remind you of something novel that you introduced, or things that you did. He sent word to them telling them: Leave for today, because I am busy; your appointment is on such and such a day.\nSo Sa‘d left, but ‘Ammaar refused to leave.\nSo ‘Uthmaan’s messenger grabbed him and beat him.\nWhen they and those who were with them gathered at the appointed time, ‘Uthmaan said to them: What grievances do you have against me?\nThey said: Our grievance is your beating of ‘Ammaar.\n‘Uthmaan said: Sa‘d and ‘Ammaar came, and I sent word to them, then Sa‘d left but ‘Ammaar refused to leave, so a messenger grabbed him and beat without me instructing him to do that. By Allah, I did not give any instruction to that effect and I am not pleased with it. This is my hand for ‘Ammaar; let him retaliate.\nThere is nothing wrong with this isnad, and its men are thiqaat (trustworthy). Juhaym is a Taabi‘i from whom two trustworthy narrators narrated, and he was classed as trustworthy by Ibn Hibbaan, so his hadith may reach the level of hasan.\nThis report is the soundest of those that were narrated about ‘Uthmaan beating ‘Ammaar.\nConclusion:\nIt is not proven that ‘Uthmaan beat ‘Ammaar in the first place, let alone any notion that he beat him in the presence of ‘Ali and that ‘Ali remained silent and did not defend him. What is required of us is to acknowledge the high status of the companions of our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), to love them and defend them.\nIt is not permissible to rely on everything that has been narrated in the books of history, except for that which is proven to be sound. How good are the words of Ibn Khaldoon:\nHow often the historians, mufassireen and narrators of reports make mistakes in the stories they narrate, because their method is mere transmission of reports, whether sound or unsound, without examining these reports and their chains of narration, and comparing them to other, similar reports, and without examining them in the light of reason and in the light of human nature. Thus they drifted away from the path of truth and fell into grievous mistakes and errors.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "**Doubts About the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) and Responses to Those Doubts**\n\nThe Sahaabah, or companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), hold a significant and revered position in Islam. However, doubts and misconceptions about their integrity and actions sometimes arise, often fueled by historical accounts or interpretations. To address these doubts, we can refer to the Quranic verses that emphasize the virtues of the Sahaabah and the importance of their role in Islam.\n\n### The Virtues of the Sahaabah\n\n1. **Allah's Satisfaction with Them**:\n   - The Quran explicitly mentions Allah's pleasure with the companions of the Prophet. In Surah Al-Ma'idah, Allah states:\n     > \"And [He] has made you love faith and has made it beautiful in your hearts, and He has made disbelief, wickedness, and disobedience hateful to you. Those are the rightly guided.\" \n     > (Surah Al-Hujurat, 49:7)\n   This verse highlights that the Sahaabah, along with those who followed them, were beloved by Allah and are considered rightly guided.\n\n2. **Protection and Authority**:\n   - In Surah Al-Ma'idah, Allah emphasizes the significance of holding fast to the believers and His Messenger:\n     > \"Your only friends are Allah and His Messenger and those who believe, who establish prayer and give zakat, and who bow [in worship].\" \n     > (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:55)\n   This categorizes the believers, including the Sahaabah, as allies of Allah and the Prophet.\n\n3. **Unity and Brotherhood**:\n   - Allah commands believers to regard each other with respect and companionship. In Surah Al-Hujurat, it is mentioned:\n     > \"Indeed, the believers are but brothers. So make settlement between your brothers. And fear Allah that you may receive mercy.\"\n     > (Surah Al-Hujurat, 49:10)\n   This reinforces the idea that the Sahaabah were an example of unity and mutual support, reflecting the essence of brotherhood in Islam.\n\n### Responding to Doubts Regarding Their Actions\n\n1. **Faith and Loyalty Tested**:\n   - Allah acknowledges that not all companions would be free from trials and doubts. In Surah Saba, it is stated:\n     > \"Thus Iblis found his supposition about them to be true; and except for a section of believers they follow him. He had no authority over them save for the purpose of Our knowing who believed in the world to come, and who doubted it.\" \n     > (Surah Saba, 34:21-22)\n   This verse indicates that the faith of some was tested, which may lead to doubts about their character; however, it is also a reminder that such trials are part of the human experience.\n\n2. **Repentance and Forgiveness**:\n   - The Quran also reassures that the Sahaabah, like all human beings, were capable of error but could seek repentance. In Surah Al-Ma'idah, it states:\n     > \"O you who believe! Repent to Allah with sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow.\" \n     > (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 66:8)\n   This serves as a reminder that those who may have faltered were still eligible for Allah’s mercy through sincere repentance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Sahaabah were instrumental in the early establishment of Islam. Their loyalty, sacrifices, and close companionship to the Prophet (peace be upon him) are essential to the religion's history. While doubts may arise about their actions or decisions, it is vital to understand these within the context of human fallibility and divine mercy. Acknowledging their virtues, their trials, and the significance of their contributions provides a balanced view that protects against misinterpretations.\n\nUltimately, Muslims are encouraged to respect the Sahaabah, recognize their pivotal role in Islam, and learn from both their strengths and the lessons seen in their challenges."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to laws promulgated in non-Muslim countries, one of the following three scenarios must apply:\n1.\nThe laws are contrary to what Allah has prescribed, such as giving the wife the power of divorce, or not giving the father guardianship over his daughter after she reaches puberty, or giving a daughter the same share of the estate as a son, allowing the drinking of alcohol and zina (sex outside of marriage), and so on. It is not permissible to act upon these laws or approve of them.\n2.\nThe laws are in accordance with what is mentioned in Islamic teachings. In this case, one should abide by them, in obedience to Allah and His Messenger.\n3.\nThe Islamic texts have not said anything about the laws, but they are in the best interests of people, such as laws having to do with driving and the age at which driving is allowed. These laws must be adhered to, in accordance with the religious texts which enjoin being faithful to contracts and covenants, such as the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Fulfill (your) obligations” [al-Maa’idah 5:1] and the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Muslims are bound by their conditions, except a condition that forbids something permissible or permits something forbidden.” Abu ‘Eesa [at-Tirmidhi] said: This is a hasan saheeh hadith. It was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Saheeh Ibn Maajah (2353).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether Muslims should abide by the laws of their respective lands, particularly in Western countries, involves a nuanced consideration of Islamic teachings, law, and societal context. The Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad provide insights that help guide this discussion.\n\n### 1. **Obedience to Authority and Justice**\nIslam encourages its followers to abide by the laws of the land as long as those laws do not contradict Islamic principles. The Quran emphasizes justice and the importance of obeying lawful authorities. For instance, in Surah An-Nisa (4:131-135), believers are reminded that everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah, and they are commanded to uphold justice:\n\n> \"All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. We had commanded those who received the Book before you, and have commanded you too, to obey the laws of God. Even if you deny, surely all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God...\" (Surah An-Nisa, 4:131)\n\nThis indicates a recognition of lawful governance and a call to maintain justice, which can be extended to lawful laws of the land where one resides.\n\n### 2. **Engagement with Non-Muslims**\nIn Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:8-12), it is articulated that Muslims should treat those non-Muslims who do not engage in hostility toward them with kindness and justice:\n\n> \"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly toward those who did not fight over faith with you, nor expelled you from your homes...\" (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:8).\n\nThis encourages Muslims to engage constructively with their non-Muslim neighbors and communities, further supporting the concept of valid communal living under local laws.\n\n### 3. **Judgment by Divine Law**\nThe Quran also warns against deviating from divine commandments, highlighting that ruling should be aligned with God's revelations (such as the cases shown in Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:45-49):\n\n> \"And those who do not judge by God's revelations are unjust\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:45).\n\nThis could be interpreted to mean that while Muslims live under legal frameworks, they should assess whether those laws uphold justice and align with Islamic values. Thus, Muslims are encouraged to advocate for just laws while still complying with lawful governance.\n\n### 4. **Respect for the Land’s Laws**\nLiving in a society entails responsibilities, including respecting its laws. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:279-283) highlights fair dealings in financial contracts and emphasizes the need for equity and justice:\n\n> \"Oppress none and no one will oppress you\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:279).\n\nThis principle is crucial in Western legal systems, promoting the idea that Muslims must engage with and uphold the laws that govern their communities unless such laws conflict sharply with Islamic principles.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe ruling on abiding by the laws of the land in Western countries is based on a balance between upholding justice, obedience to authority, and maintaining one’s Islamic identity. Muslims are encouraged to respect and adhere to local laws that do not contradict the tenets of Islam, perform justice, and engage positively within their communities.\n\nAs such, building a cooperative and just community contributes to a peaceful society and reflects the true essence of Islamic teachings. This underlying principle of justice and fairness is essential in navigating between religious obligations and societal laws."

        "question": "Concept of democracy in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      \n      Firstly: \n\n    \n    Democracy is not an Arabic word. Rather it is derived from the Greek, and it \n    is a composite of two words: demos, meaning the masses or the people, \n    and kratia, meaning rule. So what is meant is the rule of the masses \n    or the rule of the people. \n\n    \n    Secondly: \n\n    \n    Democracy is a system that is contrary to Islam, because it gives the power \n    of legislation to the people or to those who represent them (such as members \n    of Parliament). Based on that, in democracy legislative authority is given \n    to someone other than Allah, may He be exalted; rather it is given to the \n    people and their deputies, and what matters is not their consensus but the \n    majority. Thus what the majority agree upon becomes laws that are binding on \n    the nation, even if it is contrary to common sense, religious teaching or \n    reason. In these systems legislation has been promulgated allowing abortion, \n    same-sex marriage and usurious interest (riba); the rulings of sharee‘ah \n    have been abolished; and fornication/adultery and the drinking of alcohol \n    are permitted. In fact this system is at war with Islam and its followers. \n\n    \n    Allah, may He be exalted, has told us in the His Book that legislative \n    authority belongs to Him alone, and that He is the wisest of those who issue \n    rulings and judge. He has forbidden the association of anyone with Him in \n    His authority, and no one is better than Him in ruling. \n\n    \n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “So \n    the judgement is only with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great!”\n\n    [Ghaafir \n    40:12]\n\n    “The \n    command (or the judgement) is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you \n    worship none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight \n    religion, but most men know not”\n\n    [Yoosuf \n    12:40]\n\n    “Is \n    not Allah the Best of judges?”\n\n    \n    [at-Teen 95:8]\n\n    “Say: \n    ‘Allah knows best how long they stayed. With Him is (the knowledge of) the \n    unseen of the heavens and the earth. How clearly He sees, and hears \n    (everything)! They have no Walee (Helper, Disposer of affairs, Protector, \n    etc.) other than Him, and He makes none to share in His Decision and His \n    Rule’”\n\n    [al-Kahf \n    18:26]\n\n    “Do \n    they then seek the judgement of (the Days of) Ignorance? And who is better \n    in judgement than Allah for a people who have firm Faith?”\n\n    [al-Maa’idah \n    5:50]. \n\n    \n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Creator of all things and He \n    knows what is good for them and what is in their best interests of rulings. \n    Human beings vary in intellect, attitude and customs, and they are unaware \n    of what is best for them, let alone what is best for others. Hence in \n    societies that are ruled by the people in terms of legislation and laws, one \n    sees only corruption, immorality and disintegration of the social fabric. \n\n    It \n    should be noted that in many countries this system has changed into \n    something that has no reality behind it, and it is mere slogans by which \n    people are deceived; in fact the real ruler is the head of state and his \n    helpers, and the people are suppressed and have no say in anything. \n\n    There \n    is nothing more indicative of that than the fact that when this democracy \n    produces results that do not suit the desires of the rulers, they crush it \n    underfoot. Cases of election fraud, suppression of freedoms and silencing of \n    the voices of those who speak the truth are well known to everyone and do \n    not need further proof. \n\n    This \n    is very clear in many countries and does not need any proof. \n\n    It \n    says in Mawsoo‘ah al-Adyaan wa’l-Madhaahib al-Mu‘aasirah (2/1066): \n\n    \n    Representative democracy: \n\n    This \n    is one of the democratic systems in which the people exercise authority \n    through a council of elected representatives of the people. In this system \n    the people retain the right to exercise some aspects of authority directly \n    by various means, the most important of which are: \n\n    1.\n    \n    The right to propose laws, which is done when a number of \n    people propse a law in general terms or in detail, which the parliament will \n    then discuss and vote upon.\n\n    2.\n    \n    The right to a referendum, whereby a law that has already \n    been approved by Parliament is presented to the people so that they can have \n    their say.\n\n    3.\n    \n    The right of objection, whereby a number of voters defined by \n    the Constitution have the right to object to a law within a certain period \n    after it has been passed, which will result in taking the matter to the \n    people for a general referendum; if the people agree with it, it will be \n    promulgated, otherwise it will be annulled. This is included in most modern \n    constitutions.\n\n    \n    Undoubtedly democratic systems are one of the modern forms of shirk, in \n    terms of obedience and submission, or in legislation, as it disregards the \n    authority of the Creator, may He be glorified and exalted, and His absolute \n    right of legislation, and regards that as one of the rights of created \n    beings. But Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “You \n    do not worship besides Him but only names which you have named (forged), you \n    and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. The command \n    (or the judgement) is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you worship \n    none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, \n    but most men know not.”\n\n    [Yoosuf \n    12:40]\n\n    “Say \n    (O Muhammad SAW): \"I am on clear proof from my Lord (Islamic Monotheism), \n    but you deny (the truth that has come to me from Allah). I have not gotten \n    what you are asking for impatiently (the torment). The decision is only for \n    Allah, He declares the truth, and He is the Best of judges.”\n\n    \n    [al-An ‘aam 6:57].\n\n    End \n    quote. \n\n    \n    Thirdly: \n\n    Many \n    people think that the word democracy means freedom! But this is incorrect \n    because freedom is one of the by-products of democracy. What we mean by \n    freedom here is freedom of belief, freedom of decadence, and freedom of \n    expression, and these also have many negative impacts on Muslim societies, \n    because matters have gone so far that aspersions are cast upon the \n    Messengers and the messages, and upon the Qur’an and the Sahaabah, on the \n    grounds of freedom of opinion; and wanton display and uncovering are \n    tolerated, and indecent images and movies are propagated on the grounds of \n    freedom. Many such things are happening, of which there is a long list, all \n    of which are playing a part in the corruption of the ummah, morally and \n    spiritually. \n\n    Even \n    that freedom for which countries are calling by means of democratic systems \n    is not absolute. We see whims and desires, and vested interests, behind the \n    limitations on those freedoms. At the time when their systems tolerate \n    aspersions upon the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) and the Qur’an, on the grounds of freedom of expression, we find that \n    this freedom is denied when speaking about matters such as the “Nazi \n    Holocaust of the Jews”! In fact anyone who denies this Holocaust is treated \n    as a criminal and put in prison, even though it is a historical matter that \n    may be denied. \n\n    If \n    these people really are promoting freedom, then why do they not let the \n    Muslim peoples choose their own path and religion? Why did they colonize \n    their lands and play a role in changing their religion and beliefs? What do \n    these freedoms have to do with Italy’s slaughter of the Libyan people, or \n    with France's slaughter of the Algerian people, or with Britain’s slaughter \n    of the Egyptian people, or with America’s slaughter of the Afghan and Iraqi \n    peoples? \n\n    \n    According to those who promote it, freedom may be subject to several \n    restrictions, including the following: \n\n    1.\n    \n    The law. Man does not have absolute freedom to drive in the \n    opposite direction to traffic in the street, or to open a shop without a \n    license, and if he says “I am free,” no one will pay any attention to him.\n\n    2.\n    \n    Custom. A woman in their countries – for example – cannot go \n    to offer condolences to the bereaved wearing a bathing suit. If she says “I \n    am free”, the people will look down on her and throw her out, because it is \n    contrary to custom.\n\n    3.\n    \n    Public taste. One of them – for example – cannot eat and pass \n    wind in front of people, or even burp! The people will look down on him even \n    if he says, “I am free.”\n\n    \n    Furthermore, we say: \n\n    Why \n    shouldn’t our religion restrict our freedom, as their freedom is restricted \n    by things that they cannot deny? Undoubtedly what is taught by Islam is that \n    which is in people’s best interests. If a woman is forbidden to make a \n    wanton display, or if the people are forbidden to drink alcohol and eat \n    pork, and so on, all of that is in their best interests, physically and \n    mentally, and for their general welfare. But they refused to restrict their \n    freedom if the injunction comes from religion, but they say “we hear and we \n    obey” if it comes from human beings like them or from a (man-made) law. \n\n    \n    Fourthly: \n\n    Some \n    people think that the word democracy is equivalent to shoora (consultation) \n    in Islam! This is a mistaken notion for many reasons, including the \n    following: \n\n    1.\n    \n    Shoora has to do with new matters that arise or with matters \n    that are not explained in detail in the texts of the Qur’an or Sunnah. With \n    regard to the “rule of the people”, the people may discuss what is \n    well-established in religion, which may lead to refusing to acknowldge the \n    prohibitions on that which is forbidden, and to forbidding that which Allah \n    has permitted or made obligatory. So the sale of alcohol is permitted \n    according to these laws, as are fornication/adultery and riba (usury), but \n    these laws put pressures on Islamic organizations and the activities of \n    those who call people to Allah. This is diametrically opposed to sharee‘ah, \n    so what does this have to do with shoora?\n\n    2.\n    \n    The majlis ash-shoora (consultative committee) is to be \n    formed of people who have a deep knowledge of fiqh, Islam and sharee‘ah, \n    fahm, and have a high level of piety and good character. So no one who is of \n    bad character or foolish, or is a disbeliever or atheist, is to be consulted \n    or involved in the shoora process. As for the democratic councils of \n    representatives, they pay no attention to any of the con ditions mentioned \n    above. The representative may be a disbeliever, or of bad character or \n    foolish. What does this have to do with shoora as prescribed in Islam?\n    \n\n    3.\n    \n    Shoora is not binding upon the ruler; the ruler may give \n    precedence to the view of one member of the council that is supported by \n    proof, and prefer his view over that of the other council members, whereas \n    in the case of representative democracy, the agreement of the majority \n    becomes legally binding upon the people.\n\n    Once \n    this is known, then what the Muslims must do is be proud of their religion \n    and trust that the rulings of the Lord are best for them in this world and \n    in the Hereafter, and they should disavow systems that go against the laws \n    of Allah. \n\n    What \n    all other Muslims must do – rulers and ruled alike – is adhere to the laws \n    of Allah, may He be exalted, in all their affairs. It is not permissible for \n    anyone to follow a system or methodology other than Islam. One of the \n    indications of their acceptance of Allah as their Lord, Islam as their \n    religion, and Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as their \n    Prophet and Messenger, is that the Muslims adhere to Islam outwardly and \n    inwardly; they respect the laws of Allah and follow the Sunnah of the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). \n\n    We \n    ask Allah to honour us with Islam and to cause the plots of the traitors to \n    fail. \n\n    And \n    Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The concept of democracy in Islam is not straightforward and can be interpreted in various ways. While Islam does not specifically define a political system akin to modern democratic practices, it emphasizes principles of justice, consultation (Shura), and the welfare of the community, which can be aligned with democratic ideals. Below, I explore these concepts, supported by relevant verses from the Quran as cited in your request.\n\n### Principles of Justice and Fairness\n\n1. **Justice (Adl)**: The Quran emphasizes the importance of justice in all interactions, which can be fundamental to democratic governance. For example, Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:8) instructs believers to \"stand up as witnesses for God in all fairness\" and warns against letting hatred lead to injustice. This reflects the democratic principle that justice should prevail, regardless of personal biases.\n\n   **Reference**:  \n   Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:8)  \n   *\"O you who believe, stand up as witnesses for God in all fairness, and do not let the hatred of a people deviate you from justice. Be just: this is closest to piety...\"*\n\n2. **Obligation to Speak Truth**: In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:67), the Prophet Muhammad is reminded to deliver God's message, emphasizing the duty of leaders to be truthful in their responsibilities and fostering openness. This can also be seen as a foundation for accountability in governance, a core component of democracy.\n\n   **Reference**:  \n   Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:67)  \n   *\"O Prophet, announce what has reached you from your Lord, for if you do not, you will not have delivered His message.\"*\n\n### Consultation (Shura)\n\nThe principle of Shura (consultation) is central to the concept of decision-making in Islam. While not a direct democratic process, it embodies the spirit of mutual consultation and collective decision-making that is essential in democratic governance.\n\n3. **Consultation**: Surah Al-Imran (3:159) highlights the importance of consulting with the community, indicating that decisions should not be made unilaterally. This process fosters inclusivity and collective responsibility among members of the society.\n\n   **Reference**:  \n   Surah Al-Imran (3:159)  \n   *\"It is due to the mercy of Allah that you are gentle with them. And if you had been rude in speech and harsh in heart, they would have disbanded from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter...\"*\n\n### Community Welfare\n\nIslam places a strong emphasis on the welfare of the community (Ummah), which resonates with democratic ideals that aim for the common good and social justice.\n\n4. **Community and Welfare**: Surah Al-Hajj (22:77) reinforces the idea of doing good and fulfilling social responsibilities. The call for believers to strive for goodness aligns with the democratic notion of serving the public interest.\n\n   **Reference**:  \n   Surah Al-Hajj (22:77)  \n   *\"O you who believe, bow in adoration, worship your Lord, and do what is good that you may find success.\"*\n\n5. **Accountability**: The Quran warns against corruption and emphasizes listening to the will of the people in governance. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:49) admonishes those in power to rule according to what God has revealed, which can be interpreted as a call for leaders to be accountable to the higher principles of justice and morality.\n\n   **Reference**:  \n   Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:49)  \n   *\"Judge between them in the light of what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims.\"*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while the Quran does not outline a specific political system of democracy as understood today, it advocates for principles that can be reconciled with democratic values. These include justice, consultation, community welfare, and accountability. The key Islamic principles of fairness and mutual respect in decision-making processes support the notion of governance that listens to the voices of the people and prioritizes the common good. \n\nThe incorporation of these principles can lead to a political environment that upholds the spirit of democracy while remaining true to Islamic teachings."

        "question": "There is nothing wrong with reporting criminals, even in an non-Muslim country",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Naasir al-Barraak (may Allah preserve him) and he answered as follows: \nDealing in hashish is an evil action according to all Islamic and rational standards. Hence it is prescribed to report such crimes, as it is also prescribed to report criminals such as murderers, thieves and rapists, so long as we are certain that dealing in hashish is an evil and harmful action. \nIf the one who is dealing in hashish is a Muslim, then he is spreading corruption in the land and is also harming himself, because he is the one who is giving the disbelievers a reason to pursue him and pass judgement against him according to laws other than Islamic sharee‘ah and to subject him to a punishment other than that which Allah has revealed. As for reporting him, that comes under the heading of combatting evil and corruption. \nI have no doubts whatsoever concerning this matter. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the question regarding the permissibility of reporting criminals, even in a non-Muslim country, the concept of justice and accountability is central to Islamic law. The Quran emphasizes the importance of justice, fairness, and truthfulness, which are values that remain universal regardless of the jurisdiction.\n\n### Key Points and Supporting Verses\n\n1. **Justice is Fundamental**:\n   The Quran repeatedly emphasizes the importance of justice, which is at the heart of this matter. As Muslims, engaging in just actions, including reporting crimes or harmful activities, is a responsibility.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Mumtahanah 60:8-9**: \n     > \"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you, nor expelled you from your homes. God indeed loves those who are just. He only forbids you from making friends with those who fought over faith with you and banished you from your homes, and aided in your exile.\" \n     (60:8-9)\n\n2. **Concealment of Evidence is Sinful**:\n   This emphasizes that one should not conceal evidence or commit acts of injustice. Reporting crimes contributes to societal safety and upholds justice.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:283**: \n     > \"And do not suppress any evidence, for he who conceals evidence is sinful of heart; and God is aware of all you do.\"\n     (2:283)\n\n3. **Promotion of Good and Prevention of Harm**:\n   The Quran promotes actions that foster good and prevent wrongdoing. Reporting criminals aligns with this principle as it seeks to protect the community from harm.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:2**: \n     > \"But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God. Surely God is severe in punishment.\"\n     (5:2)\n\n4. **The Lawfulness of Engaging with Non-Muslim Authorities**:\n   The principles of coexistence and interaction with non-Muslims are inherent in Islamic teachings. Seeking justice through lawful means, including reporting to authority, is permissible.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:177**: \n     > \"Piety does not lie in turning your face to East or West. Piety lies in believing in God, the Last Day, and the angels, and the Scriptures and the prophets, and disbursing your wealth out of love for God among your kin and the orphans, the wayfarers and mendicants, freeing the slaves, observing your devotional obligations, and in paying the zakat...\"\n     (2:177)\n\n5. **Accountability in Society**:\n   Islam emphasizes that every individual is responsible for their actions and must contribute to society's collective welfare.\n\n   - **Surah An-Nisa 4:135**: \n     > \"O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even if it be against yourselves or your parents and relatives.\"\n     (4:135)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe act of reporting criminals, even in a non-Muslim context, aligns with Islamic principles that call for justice, accountability, and the protection of society. The relevant verses of the Quran provide a strong basis for believers to engage with law enforcement as a means of upholding justice and societal good. Islam encourages protecting the community and acting justly, reinforcing that these values transcend cultural or religious boundaries."

        "question": "Oath of allegiance (bay‘ah) of ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with them both)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThe swearing of allegiance (bay‘ah) by ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) [to Abu Bakr] is proven in as-Saheehayn (al-Bukhaari and Muslim), even though it happened a few months late. \nIt was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that her father Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) entered upon ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) after he requested a meeting with him:\n‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib recited the Tashahhud, then he said: O Abu Bakr, we acknowledge your virtue and what Allah has given you. We do not envy you for any favour that Allah has bestowed upon you, but you did it without consulting us and we thought that we had the right (to be consulted) because of our kinship with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He kept speaking to Abu Bakr until Abu Bakr’s eyes filled with tears. When Abu Bakr spoke, he said: By the One in Whose hand is my soul, kinship with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is dearer to me than kinship with my own people. As for this dispute that occurred between me and you concerning these properties, I have not deviated from the right path with regard to them, and I have not given up something that I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do with them, rather I have done it too.\n‘Ali said to Abu Bakr: Your appointment for my oath of allegiance is this afternoon. When Abu Bakr had prayed Zuhr, he ascended the minbar and recited the tashahhud, and he spoke of ‘Ali and his delay in swearing allegiance, and the excuse that he had given, then he prayed for his forgiveness. And ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib recited the tashahhud and spoke highly of Abu Bakr, and said that what he had done was not due to jealousy of Abu Bakr, or a refusal to accept the favour that Allah had bestowed upon him, but we thought that we should have had a share in the matter, but it had been decided without consulting us, and we were upset with that. The Muslims were pleased with this and said: You have done the right thing. Then the Muslims became closer to ‘Ali, when he did the right thing.\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (3998) and Muslim (1759). \nAccording to another version narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh:\nThen ‘Ali stood up and spoke highly of Abu Bakr, and he mentioned his virtue and the fact that he had been one of the first to enter Islam. Then he went to Abu Bakr and swore allegiance to him, and the people came to ‘Ali and said: You have done the right thing, you have done well. And the people became close to ‘Ali when he did the right thing. \nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWith regard to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) delaying swearing of allegiance (to Abu Bakr), ‘Ali mentioned it in this hadith and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) apologised to him.  \nMoreover, this delay on ‘Ali’s part did not undermine the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr and it did not undermine ‘Ali himself. \nWith regard to swearing allegiance, the scholars are unanimously agreed that for an oath of allegiance to be valid, it is not essential that all the people, or even all the decision-makers and prominent people, should swear allegiance. Rather there should be a group of scholars, leaders and prominent figures who do so. \nWith regard to it not undermining ‘Ali or his character, that is because it was not essential for everyone to come to the leader, put his hand in his and swear allegiance to him; rather once the decision-makers and prominent figures have sworn allegiance to the leader, the individual is required to accept his leadership, not show dissent and not rebel against him. \nThat was the case with ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) during that period, before he swore allegiance, because he did not show dissent towards Abu Bakr or rebel against him. But he was held back from coming to him for the reason mentioned in the hadith. In order for swearing allegiance to be valid and proper, that did not depend on him being present, and neither he nor anyone else was required to attend for that purpose. As it was not required, he did not come. \nNothing has been narrated from him to suggest that he thought that the oath of allegiance was not valid, and he never expressed any objection (to Abu Bakr being appointed caliph). However he did have some misgivings in his mind, hence his coming was delayed until that matter had been dealt with. \nThe reason for his misgivings was that, because of his high status and the fact that he himself was a person of virtue in all aspects, and was closely related to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and so on, he thought that no decision should be made without him being consulted and being present. But the excuse given by Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and the rest of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them all) was quite clear: it was because they thought that hastening to swear allegiance was in the greater interest of the Muslims, and they were afraid that if they delayed it, that could lead to problems and disputes that would in turn lead to serious negative consequences. Therefore they delayed burying the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) until they had sworn allegiance, because that was the most important matter, so as to ensure that no dispute would arise concerning his burial, shrouding, ghusl, funeral prayer and so on, without having anyone who could have the final say on such matters. Hence they thought that giving precedence to swearing allegiance was the most important issue at that time. End quote. \nSharh Muslim (12/77-78) \nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nIt was as if they excused him for not coming to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr whilst Faatimah was still alive, because he was preoccupied with caring for her during her illness, and consoling her for the grief she felt at the loss of her father (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Moreover, when she got upset with Abu Bakr’s response when she asked him about inheritance, ‘Ali decided to go along with her in keeping away from him.\nEnd quite. Fath al-Baari (7/494) \nSecondly: \nThere is also a report which says that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) swore allegiance to Abu Bakr at the very beginning, and he did not delay doing so, but there is some doubt as to whether the report which mentions that can be confirmed.\nThe hadith was narrated via Wuhayb ibn Khaalid, from Dawood ibn Abi Hind, from Abu Nadrah, from Abu Sa‘eed. \nThe hadith was taken from Wuhayb ibn Khaalid by four of his companions, three of whom narrated a brief version which does not mention ‘Ali and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) at the beginning of his caliphate. These three are: \n1.‘Affaan ibn Muslim\nas we shall see the report narrated from him, and we will explain that anyone who narrated from ‘Affaan ibn Muslim concerning the issue of the oath of allegiance ( bay‘ah) was mistaken \n2.Abu Dawood at-Tayaalisi in al-Musnad (1/495, no. 603)\nAnd it was narrated via him by Ibn ‘Asaakir in Tareekh Dimashq (19/314) \n3.Zuhayr ibn Ishaaq\nwho is a da‘eef narrator, as it says in Mizaan al-I‘tidaal (2/82). He narrated it via Ibn ‘Adiyy in al-Kaamil (3/223) and said: I do not know that anyone narrated it from Dawood apart from Zuhayr ibn Ishaaq and Wuhayb. Zuhayr has some strong hadiths, and the one who narrated the most from him among the Basris was Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr al-Maqdimi. I hope that there is nothing wrong with him. Ibn Ma‘een only objected to him for an interrupted hadith, as I have mentioned. As for his hadiths that have isnaads, most of them are sound. End quote. \nAs for the fourth narrator from Wuhayb ibn Khaalid, he narrated a lengthy version which mentions ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them all).\nThis narrator was al-Mugheerah ibn Salamah Abu Hishaam al-Makhzoomi, who was trustworthy, as it says in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (10/261). Imam al-Bayhaqi narrated it from him in as-Sunan al-Kubra (8/143) and said: \nAbu’l-Hasan ‘Ali ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Haafiz al-Isfaraa’eeni said:  Abu ‘Ali al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali al-Haafiz told us: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ishaaq ibn Khuzaymah and Ibraaheem ibn Abi Taalib informed us: Bandaar ibn Bashaar told us: Abu Hishaam al-Makhzoomi told us: Wuhayb told us: and he mentioned a similar report. \nAbu ‘Ali al-Haafiz said: I heard Muhammad ibn Ishaaq ibn Khuzaymah say: \nMuslim ibn al-Hajjaaj came to me and asked me about this hadith, and I wrote it for him in a document, and read it to him, and he said: This hadith is worth a camel. I said: Worth a camel? It is worth a pearl the size of the full moon! End quote. \nThe words “and he mentioned a similar report” refer to the report which mentions the oath of allegiance, as was clearly stated in the report of Ibn ‘Asaakir in Tareekh Dimashq (30/277), via Imam al-Bayhaqi himself. \nImam adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after quoting the report which mentions the oath of allegiance:\nAlthough its isnaad is good, it contains some objectionable matters, so think about it. End quote. \nAl-Muhadhdhab (6/3239) \nWith regard to the difference of opinion concerning ‘Affaan ibn Muslim, there follow some details concerning this matter: \nThe difference of opinion concerning ‘Affaan ibn Muslim was due to two reasons: \n-1-\nthe first reason was that it was narrated by senior imams who had learned the brief version of the report from ‘Affaan, in which there is no mention of ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them all). The wording of this report is as follows: \nWhen the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, the spokesmen of the Ansaar stood up and some of them said: O Muhaajireen, when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent a man from among you, he would pair him with a man from among us, so we think that two men should take charge of this matter, one man from among you and one man from among us. \nZayd ibn Thaabit stood up and said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was one of the Muhaajireen, and we were the helpers of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). So the leader should only be from among the Muhaajireen, and we will be his helpers as we were the helpers of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)). \nAbu Bakr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: May Allah reward you with good, O Ansaar, and may He keep your spokesman steadfast. By Allah, if you had said something other than this, we would not have accepted it from you. \nNarrated from him by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (7/430) \nAnd by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (35/489) – Mu’sasat ar-Risaalah edn. \nAnd by Ibn Sa ‘d in at-Tabaqaat (3/212) \nAnd by al-Balaadhuri in Ansaab al-Ashraaf (3/318) \nAhmad ibn al-Qaasim ibn al-Musaawir al-Jawaahiri, as narrated by at-Tabaraani in al-Mu‘jam al-Kabeer (5/114) \nJa‘far as-Saayigh, as narrated by Ibn ‘Adiyy in al-Kaamil (3/223). He said: ‘Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Marwaan narrated it to us: Abu’s-Saqr al-Warraaq, who is Yahya ibn Dawood al-Baghdaadi, narrated it to us, and Muhammad ibn Muneer ibn Sagheer told us: Ja‘far as-Saayigh told us: ‘Affaan told us. \nAdh-Dhahabi said concerning this report: \nThis is a saheeh isnaad. End quote. \nSiyar A‘laam an-Nubala’ (2/433) \nAl-Haythami said concerning this report: \nIt was narrated by at-Tabaraani and Ahmad, and its men are the men of as-Saheeh. End quote. \nMajma‘ az-Zawaa’id (5/183) \n-2-\nthe second reason is that it was narrated by one of the companions of ‘Affaan ibn Muslim, who narrated the longer report which mentions ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with them all). The wording is as follows: \nWhen the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, the spokesmen of the Ansaar stood up and one of them said: O Muhaajireen, when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed a man from among you, he would pair him with a man from among us, so we think that two men should take charge of this matter, one of them from among you and the other from among us. \nAnd the spokesman of the Ansaar began to speak, one after another, along the same lines. \nThen Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allah be pleased with him) stood up and said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was one of the Muhaajireen; the leader should only be from among the Muhaajireen, and we will be his helpers as we were the helpers of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). \nAbu Bakr (may Allah have mercy on him) stood up and said: May Allah reward you with good, O Ansaar, and may He keep your spokesman steadfast. Then he said: If you had done something other than this, we would not have accepted it from you. \nThen Zayd ibn Thaabit took Abu Bakr’s hand and said: This is your leader, so swear allegiance to him; so they began to swear allegiance to him. \nWhen Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) sat on the minbar, he looked at the faces of the people, and he did not see ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), so he asked about him, and some of the Ansaar got up and brought him. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: O son of the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his son-in-law, do you want to cause division among the Muslims? \n‘Ali said: Not at all, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. And he swore allegiance to him. \nThen he did not see az-Zubayr ibn al-‘Awwaam (may Allah be pleased with him), so he asked about him and they brought him, and he said: O son of the paternal aunt of the Messenger of Allah and his disciple, do you want to cause division among the Muslims? He said the same as ‘Ali had said: Not at all, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. And they both swore allegiance to him. \nNarrated by Ja‘far ibn Muhammad ibn Shaakir from ‘Affaan in this lengthy version. It was also narrated thus by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak (3/80), and from him and from his shaykh Abu Muhammad al-Muqri’, by al-Bayhaqi in as-Sunan al-Kubra (8/143). Al-Haakim said: This hadith is saheeh according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, although they did not narrate it. End quote. Adh-Dhahabi did not say anything about it in at-Talkhees. \nAlthough Ja‘far ibn Muhammad ibn Shaakir was classed as thiqah (trustworthy) by al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi, Ibn Manaadi and Maslamah ibn Qaasim – as it says in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (2/102) – he differed from the senior imams who had memorised the hadith of ‘Affaan ibn Muslim better than he did. The correct version of the hadith from ‘Affaan ibn Muslim is the shorter version, in which there is no mention of ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) at that time. \nSa‘d ibn Iyaas al-Jareeri followed Dawood ibn Abi Hind in narrating from Abu Nadrah, and his version mentions ‘Ali and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them all), as it says in Tareekh Dimashq (30/278). But its isnaad includes ‘Ali ibn ‘Aasim ibn Suhayb al-Waasiti, who made a lot of mistakes in narration. ‘Ali ibn al-Madeeni said concerning him: ‘Ali ibn ‘Aasim made a lot of mistakes, but if he made a mistake and someone pointed it out, he would not repeat it. This was the verdict of all the critics concerning him.\nEnd quote from Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (7/348) \nThirdly: \nConclusion: the oath of allegiance of ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) which is proven is that which is mentioned in the Saheehs of al-Bukhaari and Muslim. As for the earlier oath of allegiance which is mentioned in the hadith of Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri, there is some doubt as to whether it is proven. \nWith regard to the claim of the Raafidi liars, that the oath of allegiance given by ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) was sworn under compulsion, this is a false and fabricated claim that stems from obvious stubbornness and wilful blindness to the facts narrated with sound isnaads. If someone is like this, you cannot debate with him, because he is ignoring all rational, logical principles that you should both agree on as a reference point. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “and turn away from the ignorant” [al-A ‘raaf 7:199]. And Allah knows best. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nIt is known from mutawaatir reports that no one refrained from swearing allegiance to him – namely Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) – except Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah. As for ‘Ali and Banu Haashim, all of them swore allegiance to him, according to scholarly consensus, and none of them died without having sworn allegiance to him. However it was said that ‘Ali delayed his oath of allegiance for six months; it was also said that in fact he swore allegiance to him on the second day. Whatever the case, they swore allegiance to him without being forced to do so. End quote. \nMinhaaj as-Sunnah (8/232) \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The oath of allegiance (bay‘ah) of 'Ali ibn Abi Taalib to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq is an important event in Islamic history that took place after the death of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This event is often discussed in the context of the early leadership of the Muslim community and the principles surrounding allegiance and submission in Islam.\n\n### Context of Bay‘ah\n\nThe concept of bay‘ah can be understood through various verses in the Quran that stress the importance of obedience to God, acceptance of prophets, and the covenant between God and believers. When interpreting this concept, we can refer to the following key verses:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Imran (3:81-83)**:\n   - This passage highlights God's covenant with the prophets and emphasizes the responsibility placed upon them and their followers to believe in and support the sent prophets. It states: \n     - \"Remember when God covenanted the prophets (and said): 'If after I have given you the Law and the judgement there comes an apostle to you who confirms the truth already with you, you will surely believe him and help him...'”\n   - This verse underscores the importance of following righteousness and fulfilling one's commitments to God's commands.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Imran (3:64)**:\n   - This verse invites the People of the Book to come to a common agreement, essentially urging them to worship God exclusively. It underlines unity in submission to God, which also extends to following the leaders chosen to guide people in the faith.\n   - \"O people of the Book, let us come to an agreement on that which is common between us... If they turn away, you tell them: 'Bear witness that we submit to Him.'\"\n\n3. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:44-48)**:\n   - Here, the qualities of the Prophet and the duties of believers are further emphasized. It highlights the importance of giving allegiance and the trust inherent in that relationship.\n   - \"O Prophet, We have sent you as a witness and a bearer of glad tidings and an admonisher, and to call (men) to God by His leave...\"\n\n### The Allegiance of ‘Ali to Abu Bakr\n\nAfter the death of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), there was a need for leadership among the Muslim community. Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq was chosen to be the first caliph. Supporting the appointment of Abu Bakr was crucial for maintaining unity among Muslims during this sensitive time. \n\n**Ali's Allegiance**: Despite initial hesitance regarding the political circumstances surrounding the appointment, ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib eventually pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr. This act of bay‘ah can be seen in light of the principles discussed in the Quran—a demonstration of loyalty to the Muslim community and obedience to leadership as long as it aligns with Islamic principles.\n\n1. **Significance of Leadership**: The Quran encourages believers to support their leaders (as long as such leaders embody justice and righteousness). The support of leaders is essential for the community's stability and coherence. \n\n2. **Unity and Community**: The event signifies the importance of unity after the death of the Prophet. The allegiance of 'Ali to Abu Bakr is viewed as a pivotal moment to prevent divisions and conflicts among the nascent Muslim community.\n\nIn conclusion, the bay‘ah of ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq is a critical event illustrating loyalty, community support, and adherence to God’s covenant as expressed in the Qur'an. The verses from Surah Al-Imran reinforce the importance of this allegiance, emphasizing the need for believers to support the rightful leadership within the boundaries of Islamic teachings. \n\n### Key Verses Reference\n- Surah Al-Imran (3:81-83)\n- Surah Al-Imran (3:64)\n- Surah Al-Ahzab (33:44-48)"

        "question": "The story of ‘Umar’s exiling of Nasr ibn Hajjaaj from Madinah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The \n    report of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) exiling Nasr \n    ibn al-Hajjaaj to Basra lest the women of Madinah be tempted by him has been \n    narrated in many reports, in brief and at length. \n\n    It \n    was narrated by Ibn Shabbah in Tareekh al-Madinah (2/762) from \n    Qataadah, by al-Kharaa’iti in I‘tilaal al-Quloob (2/392), and by Ibn \n    al-Jawzi in Dhamm al-Hawa (p. 123), from Muhammad ibn al-Jahm ibn \n    ‘Uthmaan ibn Abi’l-Jahm, from his father, from his grandfather, at length. \n\n    It \n    was narrated by Abu Nu‘aym in Hilyat al-Awliya’ (4/322), and by Ibn \n    ‘Asaakir in Tareekh Dimashq (62/21), from ash-Sha‘bi; and by Ibn Sa‘d \n    in at-Tabaqaat (3/216), from ‘Abdullah ibn Buraydah; by Ibn ‘Asaakir \n    in Tareekh Dimashq (62/23) from Muhammad ibn Sireen. \n\n    To \n    sum up this story: ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) was \n    patrolling in Madinah when he heard a woman chanting some verses of poetry \n    in which she was saying: “Is there a way to get some wine to drink, and is \n    there a way to be with Nasr bin Hajjaj?” He summoned him and found that he \n    was a handsome youth, so he shaved his head, but it only made him better \n    looking. So he exiled him to Basra lest the women be tempted by him. Then he \n    sent word asking to return to his homeland, and stated that he had done \n    nothing wrong, but ‘Umar refused to give him permission and said: Not so \n    long as I am alive. \n\n    The \n    story was mentioned by more than one of the scholars, including as-Sam‘aani \n    in al-Ansaab (3/156), Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in several places \n    in  Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (11/552, 15/313, 28/109, 28/371), Ibn al-Qayyim \n    in I‘laam al-Muwaqqi‘een (4/284), al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in al-Isaabah \n    (6/382), Ibn Muflih in al-Adaab ash-Shar‘iyyah (3/132), and others. \n\n    Ad-Daaraqutni \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mu’talif wa’l-Mukhtalif \n    (4/2205): \n\n    It \n    was said that Nasr ibn al-Hajjaaj was the son of al-Hajjaaj ibn ‘Alaat as-Sulami. \n    He lived at the time of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and was described as very \n    handsome. He is the one concerning whom it was said: “Is there a way to get \n    some wine to drink, and is there a way to be with Nasr bin Hajjaj?” End \n    quote. \n\n    \n    Something similar was mentioned by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in al-Isti‘aab \n    (1/326); Ibn Makoola in al-Ikmaal (1/560) and Ibn al-Atheer in \n    Asad al-Ghaabah (1/456)\n\n     Al-Haafiz \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    In \n    the book al-Mughribeen by Abu’l-Hasan al-Madaa’ini, I came across (a \n    report) via al-Waleed ibn Sa‘eed who said: ‘Umar heard some people saying: \n    Abu Dhu’ayb is the most handsome of the people of Madinah. He summoned him \n    and said: You are indeed very handsome; you must leave Madinah. He said: If \n    you must expel me, then (send me) to Basra, to which you expelled Nasr ibn \n    Hajjaaj. And he mentioned the story of Nasr ibn Hajjaaj, which is well \n    known.\n\n    End \n    quote from Fath al-Baari (12/159-160) \n\n    This \n    story is well-known and widely narrated in the books of the scholars. It was \n    narrated via many chains of narration, but not one of them is free of \n    reservations. The soundest of its chains of narration is the mursal chain of \n    ‘Abdullah ibn Buraydah, but the fact that it is widespread and mentioned in \n    the books of the leading scholars of the Muslims and those who are most well \n    versed in history and biography, along with the fact that it has been \n    transmitted through numerous chains of narration, indicate that it has some \n    solid basis. \n\n    \n    Secondly: \n\n    From \n    the fiqhi point of view, this story comes under the heading of giving \n    precedence to the public interest over private interests; allowing \n    undermining of a personal interest for the purpose of protecting the public \n    interest is a must in general terms. \n\n    Badr \n    ad-Deen az-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Manthoor \n    fi’l-Qawaa‘id al-Fiqhiyyah (1/348-349): \n\n    Ibn \n    ‘Abd as-Salaam said: They were unanimously agreed that the greater evil may \n    be warded off by means of the lesser. Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eid said: One of the \n    holistic general principles is that the greater of two evils may be warded \n    off by allowing the lesser, if there is no option but to allow one of them \n    to occur, and that the greater of two interests may be served by foregoing \n    the lesser, if only one option is inevitable. I mean: this is a general \n    rule, but it is not absolute and is not applicable in all cases. \n\n    \n    Shaykh ‘Izz ad-Deen said: \n\n    If \n    there is a conflict between two interests, the greater interest is to be \n    attained by foregoing the lesser. \n\n    As-Sarkhasi \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mabsoot (9/45): \n\n    If it \n    is proven (in a story) that a person was banished, then this is by way of \n    achieving a purpose and interest, not by way of applying a hadd punishment. \n    The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) banished \n    the effeminate man from Madinah, and ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) \n    banished Nasr ibn Hajjaaj from Madinah when he heard a woman saying: “Is \n    there a way to get some wine to drink, and is there a way to be with Nasr \n    bin Hajjaj?” So he banished him, although good looks do not dictate that one \n    should be banished; rather he did that in the public interest. End quote. \n\n    Al-Aloosi \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The \n    ruler may banish someone in the public interest, as he sees fit, as it was \n    soundly narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) \n    banished Nasr ibn Hajjaaj to Basra because of his good looks, as some of the \n    women were tempted by him.\n\n    End \n    quote from Tafseer al-Aloosi (9/280). \n\n    If it \n    is said: The women of Basra would be tempted by him after he moved there, so \n    what should we do? We have only transferred the problem from one place to \n    another, and we have not dealt with the root of the problem! The answer is: \n\n    \n    Firstly: banishing him from his homeland and exiling him in a way that looks \n    like a punishment would cause the motive of fitnah (temptation) in his heart \n    andin the heart of others to be weakened, and it will teach the people to \n    resist whims and desires, and will serve as a condemnation of immorality. If \n    the people at the time of ‘Umar – whom the Shaytaan feared and was afraid of \n    encountering him – realised that this man was only banished because of fear \n    of fitnah, they would take precautions and be on guard against being tempted \n    by him. So it is as if it was said to the people of Basra: I have banished \n    this man to your land so that he will not be resident in the same city as \n    me, so beware of being tempted by him. \n\n    \n    Secondly: the one who is in exile is a stranger and is not like a resident, \n    for he is in a strange land where he will be distracted by his own affairs \n    or by working and earning a living, which will keep him away from the life \n    of ease and luxury that he used to enjoy in his homeland, when he was among \n    his family and clan. This will reduce his good looks and distract him from \n    taking care of himself and of his appearance. \n\n    \n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    ‘Umar \n    ibn al-Khattaab banished Nasr ibn Hajjaaj from Madinah, from his homeland, \n    to Basra, when he heard women composing poetry expressing their infatuation \n    with him. Before that, he had issued orders that his hair be shaved off, so \n    as to reduce his good looks by which the women were tempted. But after that \n    he saw that he was one of the most handsome of people in terms of his \n    cheeks, and that upset him, so he banished him to Basra. This was not \n    because he had done anything wrong or committed some immoral deed for which \n    he was to be punished; but among the women there were some who were tempted \n    by him, so ‘Umar issued orders that something be done to reduce his stunning \n    good looks. By moving him from his homeland, his ambition and physical \n    strength would be weakened, and he would feel that he was being punished. \n    This is by way of protective measures for fear of immorality and infatuation \n    before they take place; it was not by way of punishment.\n\n    End \n    quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (15/313). \n\n    \n    Thirdly: the fact that this happened and was narrated, and people knew of \n    it, teaches the new generation to fight temptation and teaches people in \n    authority how to run people’s affairs from a shar‘i point of view, and how \n    to give the public interest precedence over private interests. It also \n    demonstrates that the temptation of women is one of the greatest \n    temptations. \n\n    \n    Fourthly: the sanctity of Madinah requires the banishment of anyone who is a \n    source of temptation to women; he should be made to leave and go to some \n    other land, out of respect for its sanctity. \n\n    For \n    more information, please see the answer to question no. \n    \n    151671\n\n    And \n    Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The story of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab's decision to exile Nasr ibn Hajjaj from Madinah reflects the principles of justice and community welfare in Islam, as well as the importance of leadership that maintains moral and ethical standards. While this specific incident is not directly mentioned in the Quran, it aligns with the broader Islamic principles of justice, accountability, and the responsibilities of a leader.\n\n### Background Context\n\n‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, the second caliph of Islam, is known for his rigorous application of justice during his leadership. Nasr ibn Hajjaj was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad who had allegedly committed a wrong that led to his exile. The underlying principles of leadership that ‘Umar exemplified are crucial to understanding this incident.\n\n### Relevant Quranic Verses\n\n1. **Justice**: Justice is a fundamental tenet in Islamic governance. Allah commands believers to uphold justice even if it is against oneself. This is signified in Surah An-Nisa (4:135):\n   - **Verse**: \"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses in [the name of] Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives.\"\n   - **Surah and Ayah**: Al-Nisa, 4:135\n\n2. **Accountability**: The concept of accountability for one's actions is emphasized throughout the Quran. Leaders and individuals in positions of authority are reminded that they will be questioned about their actions. This is apparent in the following verse:\n   - **Verse**: \"And [beware the Day] when the soul will [suddenly] be confronted with what it has brought [to the Judgment], and the heart will be [filled with] anguish.\"\n   - **Surah and Ayah**: Al-Fajr, 89:23\n  \n3. **Community Welfare**: The welfare of the community is paramount, and leaders are expected to prioritize it above all. The Qur'an emphasizes the need for mutual help and cooperation:\n   - **Verse**: \"And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.\"\n   - **Surah and Ayah**: Al-Ma'idah, 5:2 \n\n### Analysis of the Incident\n\nIn the case of Nasr ibn Hajjaj, ‘Umar's decision to exile him is understood within the framework of maintaining the integrity of the Muslim community and upholding justice. ‘Umar feared that Nasr's wrongdoings could create discord within the community, and exile was seen as a necessary measure of accountability. This decision reflects the balance that Islamic leadership seeks to maintain between compassion and enforcement of law.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe exile of Nasr ibn Hajjaj by ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab serves as an illustration of just governance where leaders are compelled to protect the interests of the community, ensuring that justice prevails. While the narrative may not have direct Quranic verses pertaining to it, the principles of justice, accountability, and communal welfare from the Qur’an underpin the actions of ‘Umar. \n\nBy adhering to these principles, Islamic leadership aims to cultivate a society where members are held accountable for their actions, thereby nurturing a community founded on righteousness and support."

        "question": "He was Muslim, then he went back to his country and apostatised, then he came back to a Muslim country; is he a mu‘aahad (non-Muslim living under Muslim protection)? How should we deal with him?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    If a person was a Muslim, then he apostatised from Islam and \n    became an atheist, he is an apostate, and there is no confusion about that. \n    The one who apostatises from Islam to another religion is not regarded as a \n    follower of that religion and does not come under the same rulings as \n    followers of that religion. Rather he is an apostate, like the atheist \n    mentioned above, and is to be treated as such. He is to be asked to repent \n    and come back to Islam; if he repents and comes back (all well and good), \n    otherwise he is to be executed because of his disbelief (kufr). \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said: \n\n    If anyone apostatises and becomes a Jew or a Christian, we do \n    not accept that, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.” Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari (2854). In other words: whoever changes from being a Muslim, we \n    should execute him. \n\n    Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ ‘ala Zaad al-Mustaqni‘, \n    11/306 \n\n    Based on that, if a person was Muslim then he became a \n    Christian or a Jew, meat slaughtered by him is not permissible because he is \n    not a kitaabi (one of the People of the Book); rather he is an apostate \n    whose meat cannot be eaten. If such a person is a woman, it is not \n    permissible to marry her, for the same reason. These people cannot be dhimmi \n    or mu‘aahad or musta’man (one who is granted protection and security by the \n    Muslims), because these statuses can only be granted to one who was \n    originally a kaafir, not to an apostate. The one who apostatised from Islam \n    has no choice but to return to his religion or to be executed as a kaafir, \n    if he persists in his apostasy. \n\n    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said: \n\n    In shar‘i terminology, the apostate (murtadd) is the \n    one who disbelieved willingly after having been a Muslim, by words, beliefs, \n    doubts or actions. \n\n    There are rulings concerning the apostate in this world and \n    in the hereafter. \n\n    With regard to this world, it was explained by the Messenger \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: “Whoever changes his \n    religion, execute him.” The scholars are unanimously agreed on that and on \n    what results from it of his wife being separated from him and his being \n    prevented from disposing of his wealth before he is executed. \n\n    With regard to the hereafter, that is stated by Allah, may He \n    be exalted, in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever \n    of you turns back from his religion and dies as a disbeliever, then his \n    deeds will be lost in this life and in the Hereafter, and they will be the \n    dwellers of the Fire. They will abide therein forever” [al-Baqarah 2:217]. \n    Apostasy occurs when one commits any of the actions that nullify Islam, \n    whether that is done in earnest or in jest or in mockery. Allah, may He be \n    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “If you ask them (about \n    this), they declare: \"We were only talking idly and joking. Say: Was it at \n    Allah ( ), and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, \n    revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (SAW) that you were mocking? Make no \n    excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed” [at-Tawbah 9:65]. \n\n    Al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi, 2/565, \n    566 \n\n    See also the answer to question no.\n    20060 for further information. \n\n    We should point out that the hadd punishment for apostasy – \n    like all other hadd punishments – cannot be carried out except by the caliph \n    or his deputy, according to scholarly consensus. It is not permissible for \n    individuals to carry out the hadd punishments themselves. \n\n    We have discussed this in the answers to questions no.\n    107105,\n    12461 and\n    8980. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    With regard to the way he should be dealt with, that is the \n    same as any other disbeliever: he should be called to Islam with kindness, \n    reminding him of his past when he was a Muslim, and that he must inevitably \n    feel the difference between his life in Islam and his life outside of it. \n    Help may be sought in doing that from those who know his language and come \n    from his country, so that it will be easier for him to understand. Giving \n    gifts also has a good impact on people’s hearts, so give him things that he \n    needs, by means of which you will be able to reach his heart. If he has some \n    difficulties in some worldly matters you can help him with them and make \n    things easier for him. All of that will make him think again about what he \n    has done, and perhaps he will come back to Islam before he dies, and that \n    will be recorded among your good deeds. \n\n    All of that has to do with interacting with him. With regard \n    to the ruling, we have stated above that he is not like one who was \n    originally a kaafir. It is not permissible for a Muslim to inherit from an \n    apostate or for him to inherit from a Muslim, and the apostate woman cannot \n    marry a Muslim. If a Muslim woman is married to the apostate, her marriage \n    contract is rendered invalid. And there are other rulings. But we should \n    differentiate between the rulings and how we treat the individual. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question regarding the status of a former Muslim who apostatized and then returned to a Muslim country raises several important Islamic considerations based on the Qur'an and jurisprudential principles. \n\n1. **Understanding Apostasy and Its Consequences**: Apostasy (irtidad) has serious implications in Islamic law. Traditionally, apostasy is viewed as a rejection of the faith that might warrant punishment under certain interpretations of Sharia. However, the decision to punish or not is also contingent upon various factors including the individual's intent, actions, and the context of their return to the Muslim community.\n\n2. **Status as a Mu‘aahad (Non-Muslim Under Muslim Protection)**: The verses in Surah Al-Mumtahanah inform how Muslims should interact with non-Muslims, especially in contexts where they seek refuge or protection. Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:8-10) states: \n\n   - \"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you, nor expelled you from your homes. God indeed loves those who are just...\" (Qur'an 60:8).\n   \n   This verse implies that those who have not actively opposed the Muslim community or sought to harm it can still receive kindness and justice from Muslims. The individual in question, having returned to a Muslim country possibly without intending harm, might be considered under this category of protection. \n\n   - Further in the same Surah, it is specified to not return believing women who come seeking refuge back to unbelievers (Qur'an 60:10), indicating a duty of care towards those seeking safety.\n\n3. **Protection of Non-Muslims**: Surah At-Tawbah (9:6) highlights how Muslims are required to provide asylum to those who seek protection, stating: \n\n   - \"If an idolater seeks protection, then give him asylum that he may hear the word of God. Then escort him to a place of safety, for they are people who do not know.\" (Qur'an 9:6).\n   \n   If this former Muslim recounts his story of coming back without hostile intent, there may be grounds for him being treated with protection and kindness, thereby establishing an assumption of non-hostility unless evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n4. **Assessment of Intent and Actions**: While the Qur’an lays out foundational principles regarding treatment and protection, it is crucial in this case to assess the individual’s intentions and actions upon return. For instance, if there is no evidence that he is inciting discord or returning to harm the community, he can be treated more leniently.\n\n5. **Community Considerations**: Although the Qur'an promotes kindness, it also encourages community vigilance, especially concerning individuals who may have shown hostile intentions. Surah An-Nisa (4:88-92) implies that if individuals do not wish to engage in peaceful coexistence, then Muslims should be cautious in their dealings with them:\n\n   - \"If they keep aloof and do not fight, and offer peace, God has left you no reason to fight them.\" (Qur'an 4:91).\n\nIn summary, the individual in question could potentially be categorized as a mu‘aahad if he is deemed non-hostile and if he seeks to coexist peacefully within the community. The primary approach to dealing with him should emphasize kindness, protection, and justice as outlined in the Qur’an, provided he demonstrates peaceful intent and does not threaten the community. Ultimately, community leaders or scholars should guide the final decision based on the specific context and individual circumstances."

        "question": "Is it permissible for ordinary people to label as a kaafir one who reviles Islam, without referring to the scholars concerning that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    There is no doubt that reviling Allah, may He be exalted – \n    Allah forbid – or reviling His Messenger or His religion – Allah forbid – \n    comes under the heading of disbelief in Allah the Almighty. The one who does \n    that has committed major kufr that puts one beyond the pale of Islam. If he \n    dies in that state without having repented from it, then he will be one of \n    the people of Hell who will abide therein for all eternity. \n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The scholars are unanimously and definitively agreed that if \n    a Muslim reviles Islam, or criticises it, or he reviles the Messenger \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or criticises or mocks him, then \n    he is an apostate and a kaafir and it is permissible to sentence him to \n    death and seize his wealth.\n\n    End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn Baaz, \n    p. 139 \n\n    Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\n\n    What is the ruling on one who reviles Allah and His Religion? \n    What is the expiation for that? Please note that the man concerned is \n    married; does his wife become haraam for him or is she divorced? \n\n    He replied:\n\n    There is no doubt that this is apostasy from Islam and \n    disbelief in Allah for which the person who does it deserves to be sentenced \n    to death unless he repents; his wife is divorced from him and his ties of \n    kinship with his relatives are severed, so he does not inherit from them and \n    they do not inherit from him. But if he repents, regrets it, prays for \n    forgiveness and acknowledges his mistake, Allah will accept his repentance \n    and he can take his wife back if her ‘iddah has not ended; if it has ended \n    then it is up to her, and it is not permissible for him to take her back \n    except with her consent.\n\n    End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/533 \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    If a person hears someone clearly reviling Allah, or shar‘i \n    proof is established to that effect, then there is nothing wrong with him \n    believing that this person is a kaafir. This is the most abhorrent and \n    serious kind of reviling, and no one does that except one who has gone far \n    astray and has no respect for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, or one \n    who has lost his mind and does not know what he is saying. \n\n    This kind of reviling is not one of the obscure issues that \n    need a ruling from the scholars or need to be subjected to examination; \n    rather it is something very clear and obvious that can be recognised by \n    ignorant and knowledgeable alike, and old and young will be disgusted by \n    it. \n\n    But at the same time it is essential to bear in mind the \n    shar‘i purpose behind denouncing that and regarding it as repugnant, which \n    is to remove and ward off that evil and to strive to make the one who said \n    it repent and come back to his Lord, even if he has apostatised and gone \n    beyond the pale of Islam. Asking the apostate to repent is something that is \n    well known and well established. So efforts should be made to exhort him in \n    a manner that is appropriate to his situation, explaining the abhorrent \n    nature of what he has done and to discuss with him the shar‘i way that is \n    appropriate to his situation. \n\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee said: \n\n    Reviling Islam – Allah forbid – is kufr according to the \n    texts and scholarly consensus. Allah, may He be exalted, said \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, \n    lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (SAW) that you were \n    mocking?\n\n    Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had \n    believed”\n\n    [at-Tawbah 9:65].\n\n    And there are other similar texts. \n\n    It is essential to advise him and denounce him for that; if \n    he responds, praise be to Allah, otherwise it is not permissible to initiate \n    the greeting of salaam with one who has reviled Islam, or to return his \n    greeting if he initiates the greeting; it is not permissible to accept his \n    invitation and he must be shunned completely until he repents or until the \n    ruling of Allah, which is to be sentenced to death, is carried out on him by \n    the authorities, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.” Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, 3017.\n\n    End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah, 2/12 \n\n    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n    If a person repents from any sin, even if that was reviling \n    Islam, his repentance will be accepted, if he fulfils the conditions that we \n    have mentioned. However it should be noted that a word may constitute kufr \n    or apostasy, but the one who utters it does not (necessarily) become a \n    kaafir thereby, because of the presence of some factor that prevents him \n    being labelled as a kaafir. In the case of this man who said that he reviled \n    Islam in a moment of anger, we say to him: If your anger was so severe that \n    you did not know what you were saying, and you did not know whether you were \n    in the sky or on the ground, and you said something without thinking and not \n    knowing what you were saying, there is no ruling that is applicable to these \n    words and you are not to be labelled an apostate, because this is something \n    that was said involuntarily and without thinking, and if anything is said \n    involuntarily and without meaning to, Allah, may He be glorified and \n    exalted, will not bring one to account for it. Allah, may He be exalted, \n    says concerning vows (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah will not \n    call you to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths, but He \n    will call you to account for that which your hearts have earned” [al-Baqarah \n    2:225].\n\n    End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, 24/2 \n\n    For more information on the guidelines on labelling anyone as \n    a kaafir, please see the answer to question no.\n    85102 \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the act of labeling someone as a \"kaafir\" (disbeliever) for reviling Islam is a serious matter, and traditionally, it has been regarded as a judgment that should be left to scholars and those qualified to make such determinations. The Quran emphasizes the importance of knowledge and understanding in matters of faith and community.\n\n1. **Knowledge and Authority:** The idea that ordinary individuals should refrain from labeling someone as a kaafir without scholarly input can be understood from the Quran's emphasis on knowledge and the consequences of misjudgment. For instance, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:170) states:\n\n   > \"And when it is said to them, 'Follow what Allah has revealed,' they say, 'Rather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers.' Even if their fathers understood nothing, nor were guided?\" \n   \n   (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:170)\n\n   This verse indicates the danger of following blind tradition without proper understanding, suggesting that using one’s discretion based on knowledge is crucial before labeling someone as a kaafir.\n\n2. **The Role of Scholars:** In matters of belief, the Quran encourages seeking knowledge and guidance from those who are knowledgeable. For example, Surah Al-Nahl (16:43) states:\n\n   > \"And We did not send before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that there is no deity except Me, so worship Me.\" \n\n   This verse indirectly points to the need for prophetic guidance, teaching that understanding one's faith and the faith of others requires knowledge of divine principles.\n\n3. **Guarding Against Judgement:** In Surah Al-Hujurat (49:12), there is a directive against suspicion and backbiting, which underscores the sensitivity of permissible judgments in Islam:\n\n   > \"O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite each other. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother while he is dead? You would dislike it. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Accepting of Repentance and Merciful.\"\n   \n   (Surah Al-Hujurat, 49:12)\n\n   This verse emphasizes that hastily judging others without complete knowledge—and especially to declare someone a kaafir—or engaging in negative assumptions about them can lead to greater sins.\n\n4. **Consequences of Mislabeling:** The seriousness of mislabeling is also highlighted in Surah Al-Munafiqun (63:2):\n\n   > \"They have made their oaths a shield in order to obstruct others from the way of God. It is certainly evil what they do. That is because they came to believe, and then renounced (their faith). So their hearts were sealed; and now they do not understand.\" \n   \n   (Surah Al-Munafiqun, 63:2)\n\n   The consequences of hypocrisy or mislabeling can lead to serious repercussions on both individual and community levels. Misjudging someone's faith can distance them from Allah’s mercy.\n\n5. **Highlighting Respect and Dialogue:** In addressing non-believers or those who revile Islam, the Quran encourages respectful dialogue rather than confrontation. Surah Al-Kafirun (109:1-3) exemplifies this:\n\n   > \"Say: 'O disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship.'\" \n   \n   (Surah Al-Kafirun, 109:1-3)\n\n   This chapter shows an approach of standing firm in one’s belief without enmity, focusing on dialogue rather than derogation.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the complexity of faith judgments in Islam and the emphasis on knowledge, understanding, and careful consideration of actions, it is generally not deemed permissible for ordinary people to label someone as a kaafir without proper scholarly understanding and guidance. Instead, Muslims are encouraged to engage in dialogue, seek knowledge, and refrain from making hasty judgments."

        "question": "How to Treat Non-Muslims",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islamic view of humanity\nThe Islamic view of humanity is filled with mercy and compassion, and it cannot be otherwise, because the Islamic religion is the last of the religions that were prescribed by Allah, may He be exalted, and He commanded all of mankind to enter this religion. He revealed this religion and sent it down to the most compassionate of mankind, Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is confirmed in the Book of Allah, where He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We have sent you (O Muhammad) not but as a mercy for the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).” [al-Anbiya 21:107].\nHow to treat non-Muslims \n1- With regard to that, there are commands in the Quran and Sunnah to the Muslims, instructing them to call people to affirm the Oneness of Allah (Tawhid ), and to offer their wealth, time and selves for that purpose. \nThis is only out of compassion and mercy towards all people, so as to save them from worshipping people and calling them to worship the Lord of all people; to save them from the constraints of this world and bring them to the abundance of this world and the Hereafter. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Let there be a group among you who call ˹others˺ to goodness, encourage what is good, and forbid what is evil—it is they who will be successful.” [Al `Imran 3:104]\n2- Showing kindness to parents even if they are non-Muslims and even if they (parents) were to try hard to keep their children away from Islam and tell them to associate others with Allah and to disbelieve. Concerning that Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years; give thanks to Me and to your parents, unto Me is the final destination.\nBut if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.” [Luqman 31:14-15]\n2- Islam advises us to treat neighbours kindly , even if they are not Muslim. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Worship Allah ˹alone˺ and associate none with Him. And be kind to parents, relatives, orphans, the poor, near and distant neighbours, close friends, ˹needy˺ travellers, and those ˹bondspeople˺ in your possession. Surely Allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful.” (An-Nisa' 4:36)\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nI say: based on that, kind treatment of neighbours is enjoined and is recommended, whether they are Muslim or not. And this is the right thing to do. Kind treatment may be in the sense of helping or it may be in the sense of being kind, refraining from annoyance and standing by them. Al-Bukhari narrated from ‘Aishah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril kept urging me to treat neighbours kindly until I thought that he would make them heirs.” And it was narrated from Abu Shurayh that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By Allah, he does not believe; by Allah, he does not believe; by Allah, he does not believe.” It was said: O Messenger of Allah, who is that? He said: “The one whose neighbour is not safe from his annoyance.” This is general in meaning and applies to all neighbours, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) affirmed that the neighbour should not be annoyed by swearing three times and stating that the one who annoys his neighbour is not a believer in the complete sense. So the believer should avoid annoying his neighbour and refrain from doing what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden; he should strive to do that which pleases Him and encourage others to do likewise.\n4- Ensuring justice and showing kindness to non-Muslims who are not fighting Muslims. \nConcerning that Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.” [al-Mumtahanah 60:8]\n“In other words, Allah does not forbid you to be kind, uphold ties, return favours and be fair towards the mushrikeen (polytheists), whether they are relatives and others, so long as they are not fighting you because of your religion or seeking to drive you out of your homes. \nSo there is nothing wrong with you upholding ties with them, because upholding ties with them in this case does not involve anything that may lead to negative consequences.” (Tafsir al-Sa'di, p. 856) \n5- Islam prohibits killing non-Muslims living under Muslim rule.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever kills a mu‘ahid (a non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) will not smell the fragrance of Paradise, although its fragrance may be detected from a distance of forty years.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2995\n“What is meant is one who has a deal with the Muslims, whether that is by paying jizyah or a peace treaty with the Muslim ruler or a guarantee of safety from a Muslim.” (Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar, 12:259)\n6- Islam prohibits wronging a mu‘ahid, detracting from his rights, or burdening him with more work.\nThere is a hadith that speaks of that. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If anyone wrongs a mu‘ahid, detracts from his rights, burdens him with more work than he is able to do or takes something from him without his consent, I will plead for him (the mu‘ahid) on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3052; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawud.\n“If any non-Muslim come to our country for work or business, and has permission (from the authorities), he is either a mu‘ahid (one who has a treaty with the Muslims) or a mustamin (one who has been granted security by the Muslims). So it is not permissible to transgress against him. It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever kills a mu‘ahid will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.” We are Muslims who submit to the command of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and we respect those whom Islam instructs us to respect of those who have treaties and guarantees of security. Whoever transgresses against them has misrepresented Islam and has given Islam an image of terrorism, treachery and betrayal. The one who adheres to the rulings of Islam and respects treaties and covenants is one for whom it is hoped that he will do well and succeed.” (Fatawa Ibn Uthaymin, 15:493)\n7- Islam prohibits committing transgression and commands justice.\nConcerning that Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from Al-Masjid al-Haram (at Makkah) lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part).” [al-Maidah 5:2]\n“and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety.” [al-Maidah 5:8].\n“Look at what these verses contain of noble characteristics and the command to respond to the one who disobeys Allah concerning you by obeying Allah concerning him.” (Adwa al-Bayan by Al-Shinqiti 3:50)\nFacts about Islam\nHowever, in addition to what has been stated above, it is essential to confirm some important points:\n1- There is no comparison whatsoever between what this world has seen the “non-Muslims” do and what the Muslims have done. The two World Wars in which 70 million people were killed were “Christian” wars.\n2- Then there is the occupation of Muslim lands and the exploitation of their resources, which was and still is happening at the hands of “non-Muslims” of all religions. This should be borne in mind when speaking of the Islamic view of humanity and of love and compassion. Fair-minded historians should compare the Islamic conquests of other lands with the Crusades, for example, and what happened in each case. They will see a clear difference between compassion and cruelty, love and hatred, life and death.\n3- What was mentioned above about Islam and how it regards non-Muslims, and what was mentioned about rulings is the highest level of love, compassion and mercy. However, that does not mean that we should neglect some rulings that some ignorant people want us to neglect.\nFor example:\n1- In Islam it is forbidden to love non-Muslims and take them as close (intimate) friends. Anyone who has common sense can distinguish between kindness, fairness, compassion and mercy, on the one hand, which we have been enjoined to show towards a non-Muslim who is not in a state of war with us, and love on the other hand, which we are not allowed to feel towards disbelievers because of their disbelief in Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and because of their not being Muslims.\n2- It is not permissible for us to give our daughters, sisters and other womenfolk in marriage to any non-Muslim, no matter what his religion is, whereas it is permissible for us (Muslim men) to marry only women from the People of the Book, Jews and Christians, who are chaste. Undoubtedly ‘aqidah (belief) and tawhid (affirming the Oneness of Allah) play a major role in this ruling, because it is very likely and possible that a kitabi (Jewish or Christian) woman who is married to a Muslim may become Muslim, whereas it is very possible and likely that a Muslim woman may be tempted away from her religion by marrying a non-Muslim. This ruling is entirely in accordance with the compassion and mercy of the rulings of this great religion: it represents compassion towards the Jewish or Christian woman in the hope that she might become Muslim and towards the Muslim woman lest she leave her religion.\n3- It is not part of Islam to force the non-Muslim to enter this religion , because sincerity is one of the conditions of accepting Islam. And Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“There is no compulsion in religion.” [al-Baqarah 2:256]\n4- Islam prescribes stoning for the married adulterer, cutting off the hand for the thief, and flogging for the one who slanders the honour of a woman who is chaste (all following due process, of course). We do not feel ashamed of these laws; rather we firmly believe that the whole world is in need of application of these laws. If they do that, they will live in an atmosphere of safety with regard to their honour, their wealth and their lives, safe from transgressions against them. \nAny wise person who ponders these rulings will realise that they were prescribed, first of all, so that no one will dare to do these things. Anyone who looks at the state of other nations, and sees how widespread the crimes of rape, theft and murder are, will realise that there is an urgent need to put a stop to that, and that the rulings of Islam are based on wisdom, mercy, justice and care.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the treatment of non-Muslims is guided by various principles and specific verses from the Quran. The approach emphasizes justice, kindness, and understanding, while distinguishing between those who engage in hostility against Muslims and those who seek peaceful coexistence. Here’s a detailed discussion on how to treat non-Muslims, supported by relevant Quranic verses.\n\n### 1. Emphasizing Kindness and Justice\n\nIslam encourages Muslims to be kind and just towards non-Muslims, especially those who do not show hostility. The Quran states:\n\n- **Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:8-9)**: \n  > \"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you, nor expelled you from your homes. God indeed loves those who are just.\"\n\nThis verse highlights the importance of maintaining a good and respectful relationship with non-Muslims who are peaceful and do not persecute Muslims.\n\n### 2. Prohibition of Aggression\n\nMuslims are instructed not to let their feelings towards a people result in aggression, even when there are conflicts. \n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2)**:\n  > \"And do not let your hatred of a people who had barred you from the Holy Mosque lead you to aggression. But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God.\"\n\nThis indicates that Muslims should respond with righteousness and integrity, even in adverse situations.\n\n### 3. Interactions with Non-Muslims\n\nThe Quran acknowledges the lawful interactions Muslims can have with the “People of the Book” (Jews and Christians), including provisions concerning food and marital relations.\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:5)**:\n  > \"Today [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage] are chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you...\"\n\nThis allows Muslims to share meals with and marry chaste women from the People of the Book, fostering a spirit of collaboration and respect.\n\n### 4. Holding Non-Muslims as Allies\n\nMuslims are encouraged to have non-Muslims as allies, provided there is no evidence of hostility.\n\n- **Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:8)**:\n  > \"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you, nor expelled you from your homes.\"\n\nThis verse underscores the potential for peaceful coexistence and cooperation, regardless of religious differences.\n\n### 5. Caution Against Hostile Relations\n\nWhile fostering good relations with peaceful non-Muslims, there is also a caution regarding those who would act hostilely towards Muslims.\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:51)**:\n  > \"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are, in fact, allies of one another. And whoever among you takes them as allies – then indeed, he is one of them...\"\n\nThis verse indicates a distinction between friendly relations and alliances with potential adversaries, serving as a warning against making alliances that could compromise one’s faith or community.\n\n### 6. The Common Goal of Belief and Good Deeds\n\nIn the context of believers and non-believers, the Quran emphasizes that those who believe in God and perform good deeds will find favor.\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:69)**:\n  > \"Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabians – those who believed in God and the Last Day and did righteousness – will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.\"\n\nThis fosters an inclusive approach where good actions, rather than mere beliefs, are the criteria for earning God’s mercy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Quran sets a foundational guideline for the treatment of non-Muslims, stressing justice, kindness, and the importance of peaceful coexistence. It clearly delineates the difference in attitude towards non-hostile individuals versus those who are adversarial. Engaging with compassion while being aware of potential hostility helps maintain harmony in diverse societal settings. Through Muslims' conduct towards non-Muslims, fundamental Islamic principles of justice and ethics are expressed, reinforcing the call to be exemplars of good character in all interactions."

        "question": "Ruling on democracy and elections and participating in that system",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nDemocracy is a man-made system, meaning rule by the people for the people. Thus it is contrary to Islam, because rule is for Allaah, the Most High, the Almighty, and it is not permissible to give legislative rights to any human being, no matter who he is. \nIt says in Mawsoo’at al-Adyaan wa’l-Madhaahib al-Mu’aasirah (2/1066, 1067): \nUndoubtedly the democratic system is one of the modern forms of shirk, in terms of obedience and following, or legislation, as it denies the sovereignty of the Creator and His absolute right to issue laws, and ascribes that right to human beings. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have named (forged) — you and your fathers — for which Allaah has sent down no authority. The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism); that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not”\n[Yoosuf 12:40] \n“The decision is only for Allaah”\n[al-An’aam 6:57]\nEnd quote. \nThis has been discussed in detail in the answer to question no.  98134.\nSecondly: \nThe one who understands the true nature of the democratic system and the ruling thereon, then he nominates himself or someone else (for election) is approving of this system, and is working with it, is in grave danger, because the democratic system is contrary to Islam and approving of it and participating in it are actions that imply apostasy and being beyond the pale of Islam. \nBut as for the one who nominates himself or nominates others in this system in order to join the parliament and enjoin good and forbid evil, and establish proof against them, and reduce its evil and  corruption as much as he can, so that people of corruption and disbelievers in Allaah will not have free rein to spread mischief in the land and spoil people’s worldly interests and religious commitment, this is a matter that is subject to ijtihaad, according to the interests that it is hoped will be served by that. \nSome scholars are even of the view that getting involved in these elections is obligatory. \nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on elections, and he replied: I think that elections are obligatory; we should appoint the one who we think is good, because if the good people abstain, who will take their place? Evil people will take their place, or neutral people in whom there is neither good nor evil, but they follow everyone who makes noise. So we have no choice but to choose those who we think are fit. \nIf someone were to say: We chose someone but most of the parliament are not like that, \nWe say: It does not matter. If Allaah blesses this one person and enables him to speak the truth in this parliament, he will undoubtedly have an effect. But what we need is to be sincere towards Allaah and the problem is that we rely too much on physical means and we do not listen to what Allaah says. So nominate the one who you think is good, and put your trust in Allaah. End quote.  \nFrom Liqaa’aat al-Baab al-Maftooh, no. 210 \nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: \nIs it permissible to vote in elections and nominate people for them? Please note that our country is ruled according to something other than that which Allaah revealed? \nThey replied: \nIt is not permissible for a Muslim to nominate himself in the hope that he can become part of a system which rules according to something other than that which Allaah has revealed and operates according to something other than the sharee’ah of Islam. It is not permissible for a Muslim to vote for him or for anyone else who will work in that government, unless the one who nominates himself or those who vote for him hope that by getting involved in that they will be able to change the system to one that operates according to the sharee’ah of Islam, and they are using this as a means to overcome the system of government, provided that the one who nominates himself will not accept any position after being elected except one that does not go against Islamic sharee’ah. End quote. \nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood. \nFataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (23/406, 407 \nThey were also asked: \nAs you know, here in Algeria we have what are called legislative elections. There are parties which call for Islamic rule, and there are others that do not want Islamic rule. What is the ruling on one who votes for something other than Islamic rule even though he prays? \nThey replied: \nThe Muslims in a country that is not governed according to Islamic sharee’ah should do their utmost and strive as much as they can to bring about rule according to Islamic sharee’ah, and they should unite in helping the party which is known will rule in accordance with Islamic sharee’ah. As for supporting one who calls for non-implementation of Islamic sharee’ah, that is not permissible, rather it may lead a person to kufr, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And so judge (you O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) among them by what Allaah has revealed and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they turn you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) far away from some of that which Allaah has sent down to you. And if they turn away, then know that Allaah’s Will is to punish them for some sins of theirs. And truly, most of men are Faasiqoon (rebellious and disobedient to Allaah).\n50. Do they then seek the judgement of (the days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith”\n[al-Maa'idah 5:49-50].\nHence when Allaah stated that those who do not rule in accordance with Islamic sharee’ah are guilty of kufr, He warned against helping them or taking them as allies or  close  friends, and He commanded the believers to fear Him if they were truly believers. He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O you who believe! Take not as Awliyaa’ (protectors and helpers) those who take your religion as a mockery and fun from among those who received the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before you, and nor from among the disbelievers; and fear Allaah if you indeed are true believers”\n[al-Maa’idah 5:57]\nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. End quote. \nStanding Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas \nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan \nFataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (1/373).",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of Islam's position on democracy, elections, and participation in such systems is complex and varies among scholars and communities. However, a thorough analysis of the relevant Quranic verses helps in understanding the core principles that can guide Muslims in this context.\n\n1. **Judgment by Divine Law**: The Quran emphasizes the importance of adhering to God's law in governance. For instance, Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:44) states: \n   - \"Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light. By it the prophets who submitted [to Allah] judged the Jews, as did the rabbis and the scholars, by that which they were entrusted of the Scripture of Allah, and they were witnesses thereto. So do not fear the people but fear Me and do not trade My verses for a small price. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers.\"\n   This verse highlights that governance should be based on divine revelations rather than human whims. It also suggests that any system which does not judge based on God's law can be deemed unjust or disbelieving.\n\n2. **The Principle of Justice**: The emphasis on justice in governance is recurrent. In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:42), it is mentioned:\n   - \"And if you judge, judge between them with justice. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.\"\n   This reinforces the idea that any participation in a governance system must align with principles of justice as ordained by God.\n\n3. **Allegiance and Interactions with Non-Muslims**: In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:51), believers are cautioned regarding alliances with Jews and Christians:\n   - \"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are allies of one another. And whoever of you takes them as allies - then indeed, he is one of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.\"\n   This suggests there may be a caution against forming political alliances that could compromise one's faith and adherence to Islamic principles.\n\n4. **Seeking Guidance from Divine Law**: In Surah Ali 'Imran (3:79-83), it is emphasized that those who are entrusted with divine knowledge should guide others toward God's path:\n   - \"It is not for a man that Allah should give him the Scripture and authority and prophethood and then he would say to the people, 'Be my worshippers rather than Allah's.' But [he would say], 'Be divinely devoted scholars because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied.'\"\n   This underscores the responsibility individuals have in guiding others not toward human-made systems, but towards divine truths.\n\n5. **Diversity of Law and Ways**: The Quran acknowledges diversity in ways of life and laws across different communities. In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:48), Allah mentions:\n   - \"And to you We have revealed the Book in truth, confirming that which was before it and distinguishing it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed...\"\n   This indicates that while different laws may exist, Muslims are called to judge and act according to the guidance provided in the Quran.\n\n6. **Responsibility and Accountability**: Ultimately, the Quran emphasizes personal responsibility and accountability before God, which aligns with democratic principles of civic engagement. In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:49-50), it advises:\n   - \"And if they do not respond to you, then know that they are only following their desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.\"\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Islamic perspective on democracy and participation in elections is nuanced, centering around the principles of justice, adherence to divine law, and the importance of individual responsibility. While these Quranic verses illustrate caution regarding governance systems that diverge from Islamic principles, the interpretation and application of these tenets can vary widely among scholars and communities. Ultimately, Muslims might assess their participation in democratic systems through the lens of these principles, striving to align civic duties with their faith."

        "question": "Advice to the Muslims in Finland",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    We have read more about the country – Finland – in which you \n    are living; some of it saddened us, but other things made us happy.  We are \n    saddened by the division that there is among you, and by the fact that many \n    neglect to call people to Allaah or pay attention to their families and \n    children. We are also saddened to learn that some Muslim women have married \n    Christian men in that country, as these are invalid marriages; and that many \n    people have failed to obey Allaah and adhere to His religion. All of that \n    makes the burden of the people of knowledge and goodness even greater, and \n    lays upon them a huge responsibility towards the Muslim community in that \n    European land. \n\n    But what made us happy is the news that the number of Muslims \n    in that country is increasing, and the Muslim community is now one hundred \n    thousand strong, according to some reports, although we do not know how many \n    of them are Sunnis. And we are happy to learn that many of the people of \n    that country have entered the religion of Allaah. \n\n    What we advise you, and we hope that our words will have a \n    good effect on your hearts and actions: \n\n    1.\n\n    First and foremost, every Muslim should try to return to his \n    homeland, and those who have become Muslim should move to a Muslim country \n    where they can practise their religion safely. They should leave that \n    country where the religious commitment, minds and hearts of many Muslims \n    have been corrupted, whenever they are able to do so. \n\n    2.\n\n    Those who cannot leave or who do not want to should fear \n    Allaah with regard to themselves and the members of their household; they \n    should advise them sincerely and take good care of them, and protect \n    themselves and their families from the Fire of Allaah. \n\n    3.\n\n    You must strive to establish study circles for learning \n    Qur’aan and (Islamic) knowledge, in which the ignorant may be taught and the \n    young Muslims (?) may learn to obey Allaah. It is not permissible for you to \n    be careless about this matter. We have read how the Tatars in Finland \n    preserved their language and culture; your Islam and Arabic language are \n    more important and you must take great care of them in your daily lives.  \n\n    4.\n\n    Try to invite scholars and seekers of knowledge to come to \n    you, so that they can undertake the duties of calling people to Islam, \n    exhorting, guiding and teaching. Such meetings will play a part in uniting \n    you and helping you adhere to the rulings of sharee’ah which have to do with \n    the realities of your lives. \n\n    5.\n\n    Do not leave any room for the devils among mankind and the \n    jinn to cause division in your ranks and spread disunity among you. You have \n    to be aware that you are living in a Christian society, a Christian country, \n    whose flag bears the cross! You have to remember that what happens between \n    Muslims who have differences is not like your differences with other \n    religions. The difference between Muslims who pray in the same direction \n    (ahl al-qiblah) is may be a difference between Sunnah and bid’ah, and in \n    some cases it may be the difference between a correct view and a less \n    correct view, but the difference between you and the other religions is the \n    difference between Islam and kufr. These are two different issues.  \n\n    6.\n\n    With regard to this party that is trying to establish an \n    Islamic state in Finland, they should think on the basis of reason and not \n    emotion; they should look at reality and not turn a blind eye to it. You \n    cannot even bury a Muslim in a graveyard that is just for Muslims, so would \n    you be able to close liquor stores and establish an Islamic state there?! \n\n    What is this, O slaves of Allaah?! This is imaginary dreams \n    and farfetched thinking, which may be excused in a man who does not know the \n    reality of where you live and does not know anything about the difficulties \n    that you face. But a man who sees what you see and knows what you know \n    should think soundly on the basis of fitrah, sharee’ah and reason, and his \n    efforts should be aimed at achieving whatever he is most able to of the \n    Muslims’ interests in your country, and warding off whatever evils, harm and \n    oppression he can. \n\n    Based on that, if those people have an Islamic party, they \n    should invest their efforts in establishing Islamic institutions, schools, \n    Muslim graveyards, and stop thinking about establishing an Islamic state, \n    because in fact that is virtually impossible and is just an illusion, based \n    on what we have seen of the Muslims’ inability to achieve that, even in \n    their own countries, so how can they do it in a non-Muslim country? Just \n    demanding an Islamic state will bring evil consequences such as only Allaah \n    knows, so how about if they took practical steps towards it? If the state is \n    unable to stop them – which is not the case – then let them imagine their \n    fate if the European Union were to get involved in stopping that. What would \n    be the fate of all the efforts that have been made for decades?  We have \n    read about the situation of Muslim men and women in your country after \n    September 11th, so how about if the anti-Islam establishments \n    were to spread the idea that the Muslims only want to rule in order to apply \n    Islam and limit freedoms and oppress women? Yes, they are exaggerating and \n    lying, but we are giving them the ammunition that they are throwing in our \n    faces.  \n\n    7.\n\n    One of the priorities of that Islamic party should be to \n    preserve Islamic identity and strive to spread the message of Islam, free of \n    distortions; they should present it to the Muslims so as to bring them back \n    to commitment and righteousness, and you should prove to non-Muslims that \n    your religion is a religion of unity, brotherhood and cooperation in \n    righteousness and piety. \n\n    8.\n\n    The Muslim brothers who are of that land should continue to \n    call people to Allaah among their families and relatives, and tell others of \n    the joy they have found by entering Islam. It seems that they will have more \n    impact on the people of that land than Muslims who have migrated from other \n    countries. \n\n    9.\n\n    Strive to buy a piece of land as soon as possible to be used \n    for graves for Muslims who believe in Tawheed (the oneness of Allaah), and \n    try to move the Muslims who were buried with non-Muslims to these Islamic \n    graves. \n\n    10.\n\n    It should be a priority of Islamic groups and political \n    parties, especially those that are trying to establish an Islamic state, as \n    we said, to preserve the identity of the Muslims who are living there. One \n    of the most important means of preserving their identity is for Muslim men \n    to marry Muslim women and to strive to create an Islamic atmosphere in their \n    social lives. In the Islamic parties and organizations there should be \n    people who direct the Muslims’ private matters such as marriage, divorce and \n    social relationships in accordance with the laws of Allaah, without trying \n    to impose that on everyone in the Christian country which, as we have said, \n    is a very farfetched idea, the consequences of which will be bad for you. \n\n    11.\n\n    We advise everyone to be gentle in calling people to Allaah \n    and to follow the way of the Prophets and Messengers and successful \n    daa’iyahs. You should direct your da’wah to leaders, politicians, decision \n    makers, journalists, writers and all classes of people. Perhaps Allaah will \n    guide one of them who will become very influential. And strive to remove \n    evils from the lives of Muslims in the way that is best. \n\n    12.\n\n    You should always be in contact with your Muslim brothers in \n    Europe and in the Muslim world, so that you can consult them about your \n    affairs and ask the scholars about issues and problems that you are facing. \n    The Muslim is the mirror of his brother, and two brothers together are \n    stronger than one on his own. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Advice to the Muslims in Finland\n\nAs Muslims living in Finland, it's essential to maintain a balance between adhering to the teachings of Islam and integrating into the local society. Given the unique situation faced by Muslims in non-Muslim majority countries, here are some pieces of advice drawn from the Quran, along with supportive verses to guide your practice of faith and community involvement.\n\n#### 1. Maintain Your Faith\n\nIt is crucial to remain steadfast in your faith and practice your religious obligations even in the face of challenges. The Quran encourages believers to uphold their faith rigorously, highlighting the importance of sincerity and steadfastness:\n\n**Verse Support**: \n- \"O believers, do not let your hatred of a people lead you to aggression. Help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God. Surely God is severe in punishment.\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:2)\n\nThis verse emphasizes maintaining your principles and working together for good rather than allowing external pressures to influence your behavior negatively.\n\n#### 2. Community and Brotherhood\n\nIt is vital to foster a sense of community among Muslims in Finland. The Quran encourages believers to hold on to the bond of brotherhood and to work together towards righteousness.\n\n**Verse Support**:\n- \"And hold firmly to the rope of God all together and do not become divided.\" (Surah Ali 'Imran 3:103)\n\nBy supporting one another, organizing community activities, and encouraging participation in social responsibilities, you strengthen your community ties.\n\n#### 3. Respect and Fairness \n\nAs you navigate living in a predominantly non-Muslim society, it is essential to display respect and fairness to all members of the community, including non-Muslims.\n\n**Verse Support**:\n- \"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight you over your faith and did not expel you from your homes.\" (Surah Al-Mumtahanah 60:8)\n\nThis verse reinforces the idea of showing kindness and justice towards everyone, fostering a positive image of Muslims in society.\n\n#### 4. Engaging in Dialogue\n\nInitiating open dialogues with your neighbors and colleagues can pave the way for mutual understanding and respect. Being a good representative of Islam through your actions and words can help dispel misconceptions.\n\n**Verse Support**:\n- \"Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best.\" (Surah An-Nahl 16:125)\n\nThis encourages proactive engagement and respectful dialogue with others about your faith.\n\n#### 5. Practicing Tolerance\n\nIn a diverse society, tolerance is crucial. Striving to understand and respect different beliefs while firmly holding onto your own faith is essential.\n\n**Verse Support**:\n- \"To you be your religion, and to me my religion.\" (Surah Al-Kafirun 109:6)\n\nThis verse underlines the importance of respecting the choices of others while being secure in one's own beliefs.\n\n#### 6. Being Grateful\n\nFinally, amidst challenges, it is essential to maintain a sense of gratitude for your blessings. It serves as a reminder of God’s mercy.\n\n**Verse Support**:\n- \"If you are grateful, I will surely increase your favor; but if you deny, indeed, My punishment is severe.\" (Surah Ibrahim 14:7)\n\nBeing grateful can help maintain a positive outlook and foster resilience in challenging circumstances.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMuslims in Finland are encouraged to thrive both in faith and community engagement. By adhering to the teachings of Islam and integrating with society positively, you can exemplify the values of Islam while contributing to the broader community. Remember to always seek Allah’s guidance, remain steadfast, and support one another in the pursuit of righteousness."

        "question": "How the caliph of the Muslims is appointed",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The Muslim ruler must appoint people who are qualified to \n    hold positions of high office in the state, and he must also hold \n    consultations with people of knowledge and those who are specialized in \n    various fields. That should not be left to the common folk or the masses for \n    everyone to elect his relative or a member of his party, or to elect the one \n    who will pay the most. \n\n    Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) said: \n\n    Official positions that are lower than that of caliph or \n    ruler: Appointing people to these positions was the job of the caliph or \n    ruler. He had the authority to select for them people who were competent and \n    had integrity. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, \n    Allaah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom \n    they are due; and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice” \n    [al-Nisa’ 4:58]. This is addressed to rulers and those in authority. \n    Trusts (amaanaat) here refers to official positions and positions of \n    high office in the state, which Allaah made a trust that is entrusted to the \n    ruler. The way in which it is to be fulfilled is by choosing people who are \n    competent and have integrity, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) and the caliphs who came after him and the Muslim rulers \n    after them appointed to various positions those who were fit to hold those \n    positions and were able to fulfil these duties as prescribed in sharee’ah. \n\n    With regard to elections as they are known today in different \n    states, they are not part of the Islamic system and they may lead to \n    disorder and chaos and personal ambitions. They are subject to favouritism \n    and greed, and may lead to fitnah (tribulation) and bloodshed. They do not \n    achieve the purpose they are meant to achieve; rather they are more like \n    auctions, buying and selling, and false propaganda. End quote. \n\n    Al-Jazeerah newspaper, issue no. \n    11358. \n\n    The imam (ruler) or caliph was appointed to lead the Islamic \n    state by one of three methods: \n\n    1-\n\n    He was chosen and elected by the decision makers (ahl al-hall \n    wa’l-‘aqd). For example, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq became caliph when he was \n    elected by the decision makers, then the Sahaabah unanimously agreed with \n    that and swore allegiance to him, and accepted him as caliph. \n\n    ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) became \n    caliph in a similar manner, when ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) delegated the appointment of the caliph to come after him \n    to a shoora council of six of the senior Sahaabah, who were to elect one of \n    their number. ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf consulted the Muhaajireen and Ansaar, \n    and when he saw that the people were all inclined towards ‘Uthmaan, he swore \n    allegiance to him first, then the rest of the six swore allegiance to him, \n    followed by the Muhaajireen and Ansaar, so he was elected as caliph by the \n    decision makers. \n\n    ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) became \n    caliph in a similar manner, when he was elected by most of the decision \n    makers. \n\n    2-\n\n    Appointment to the position by the previous caliph, when one \n    caliph passes on the position to a particular person who is to succeed him \n    after he dies. For example, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab became caliph when the \n    position was passed on to him by Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased \n    with him). \n\n    3-\n\n    By means of force and prevailing over others. When a man \n    becomes caliph by prevailing over the people by the sword, and he \n    establishes his authority and takes full control, then it becomes obligatory \n    to obey him and he becomes the leader of the Muslims. Examples of that \n    include some of the Umayyad and ‘Abbasid caliphs, and those who came after \n    them. This method is contrary to sharee’ah, because it is seized by force. \n    But because great interests are served by having a ruler who rules the \n    ummah, and because a great deal of mischief may result from chaos and loss \n    of security in the land, the one who seizes authority by means of the sword \n    should be obeyed if he seizes power by force but he rules in accordance with \n    the laws of Allaah. \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said: \n\n    If a man rebels and seizes power, the people must obey him, \n    even if he seizes power by force and without their consent, because he has \n    seized power. \n\n    The reason for that is that if his rule is contested, it will \n    lead to a great deal of evil, and this is what happened during the Umayyad \n    period when some of them seized power by means of force and gained the title \n    of caliph, and people obeyed them in obedience to the command of Allaah.

        "predicted_answer": "The appointment of a caliph in Islam is a significant topic, as it pertains to the leadership and governance of the Muslim community (Ummah). This has been a fundamental issue since the time of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and several Quranic verses and historical traditions help to illuminate this matter.\n\n### Key Points on the Appointment of the Caliph\n\n1. **Divine Choice and Leadership**: \n   The Quran emphasizes the notion that God chooses leaders among His creation, including messengers and those in positions of authority. In Surah Al-Hajj (22:75), it states, \"God chooses messengers from the angels and human beings.\" This suggests that the appointment of a leader, including a caliph, is fundamentally a matter of divine selection:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Hajj (22:75)**: \"God chooses messengers from the angels and human beings. Verily God is all-hearing and all-seeing.\" \n\n2. **Consensus and Community Decision**:\n   The caliphate, post-Prophet Muhammad, was marked by an emphasis on the consensus of the community. The Prophet's last days indicated that the leadership was not to be inherited but chosen among those qualified and respected within the community. Moreover, in the case of the Prophet Muhammad himself, he was chosen by divine decree and then accepted by the people.\n\n3. **Obedience to Authority**:\n   Surah Al-Ahzab provides insight into the importance of obeying those in authority as long as they align with guidance from God and His Prophet. It suggests that once leadership has been established through a legitimate means, the community must adhere to it, which implies a need for a system of governance that has the community's support:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:36)**: \"No believing men and women have any choice in a matter after God and His Apostle have decided it.\"\n\n4. **Characteristics of a Leader**:\n   A caliph is expected to convey God’s messages and uphold justice and righteousness. This is echoed in Surah Al-Hajj where Muslims are urged to do good and strive in the way of God, which is crucial for anyone assuming a leadership role:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Hajj (22:77)**: \"O you who believe, bow in adoration, worship your Lord, and do what is good that you may find success.\"\n\n5. **Historical Precedents**:\n   Historically, the first caliph, Abu Bakr, was chosen through a process of consultation (Shura) among the companions of the Prophet, illustrating that leadership was not only about divine appointment but also community recognition and support. This practice has been reflected in the governance of the caliphate throughout Islamic history.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe caliph of Muslims is appointed through a combination of divine choice and community consensus. Key Quranic verses emphasize God's selection of leaders and the importance of obedience to authority, illustrating that the role of a caliph is not merely a title but a significant responsibility requiring adherence to the principles of Islamic governance, justice, and accountability. Historical practices further reinforce the necessity for consultation and approval from the community in leadership selection. \n\n**References:**\n- Al-Hajj (22:75-78)\n- Al-Ahzab (33:36)"

        "question": "Muslim taking part in elections with non-Muslims",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This issue is one that is subject to ijtihaad. And we must weigh up the interests and benefits that we hope the Muslims may attain from this participation and the harm that may result from it. \nIf the benefits outweigh the harms, then it is permissible to take part, but if the harms outweigh the benefits, then it is not permissible to take part. \nBased on this, the ruling differs depending on the country, the system of voting and the people involved. Taking part may be beneficial to the Muslims in one country, and not in another. The same applies to individuals.  \nThe Fiqh Council has issued a statement on this issue: Participation of Muslims in elections with non-Muslims, the text of which is as follows: \nalone, and blessings and peace be upon the one after whom there is no Prophet, our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and companions. \nThe Islamic Fiqh Council in its nineteenth session, which was held in the headquarters of the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah between 22 and 27 Shawwaal 1428 AH (3 to 8 November 2007 CE) has examined the issue of “Participation of Muslims in elections with non-Muslims in non-Muslim countries.” This is one of the topics on which discussion was deferred in the sixteenth conference which was held between 21 and 26 Shawwaal 1422 AH in order that it may be examined more thoroughly. \nAfter listening to the research that was presented and the discussions concerning it, the Council has determined the following: \n1.\nMuslim participation in elections with non-Muslims in a non-Muslim country is one of the shar’i political matters in which the ruling is determined in the light of weighing up the pros and cons, and fatwas concerning it differ according to time, place and circumstances. \n2.\nit is permissible for a Muslim who enjoys the rights of citizenship in a non-Muslim country to take part in elections and the like because it is more likely that his participation will bring benefits such as presenting a true picture of Islam, defending Muslim issues in that country, supporting the rights of religious and other minorities, strengthening their role in circles of influence, and cooperating with reasonable, fair-minded people on a basis of truth and justice. That should be in accordance with the following guidelines: \n(i)The Muslim participants should intend thereby to serve the interests of the Muslims and ward off evil and harm from them.\n(ii)The Muslim participants should think it most likely that their participation will have positive effects that will benefit the Muslims in that country, such as supporting their position, conveying their requests to the decision makers and those who are in charge of the country, and protecting their religious and worldly interests.\n(iii)The Muslim’s participation in these elections should not lead to him neglecting his religious duties.\nAnd Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah send blessing and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. \nhttp://www.themwl.org/Fatwa/default.aspx?d=1&cidi=167&l=AR&cid=17\nFor more information please see the answers to questions no. 3062 and 107166. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the topic of Muslims participating in elections with non-Muslims can be interpreted in various ways based on Quranic guidance and scholarly interpretations. Below is a thorough discussion on the matter, incorporating relevant verses from the Quran.\n\n### Participation in Elections with Non-Muslims\n\n1. **Principle of Justice and Kindness**:\n   Surah Al-Mumtahanah (Surah 60), verses 8-9, state: \n   - \"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you, nor expelled you from your homes. God indeed loves those who are just. He only forbids you from making friends with those who fought over faith with you and banished you from your homes, and aided in your exile. Whoever makes friends with them is a transgressor.\" (60:8-9)\n\n   This verse emphasizes that Muslims are encouraged to act justly and kindly towards those who have not persecuted them for their faith. Participation in civic matters and elections can be seen as acting justly within a cooperative framework with non-Muslims.\n\n2. **Collaborative Governance**:\n   Surah Al-Ma'idah (Surah 5), verse 2 implies a collective responsibility for good and piety: \n   - \"But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God.\" (5:2)\n\n   This principle supports the idea that Muslims can work together with others for the common good and participate in political processes to promote justice and piety.\n\n3. **Maintaining Faith While Engaging Politically**:\n   The Quran does have prohibitions regarding close alliances with those who oppose Islam (such as in Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:51). However:\n   - \"O believers, do not hold Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies of one another; and anyone who makes them his friends is surely one of them...\" (5:51)\n   This verse, often cited as a caution about friendships, may not directly apply to participation in civic duties such as voting, which can be seen as a neutral action aimed at societal welfare rather than an alliance in faith.\n\n4. **Willingness to Interact**:\n   Verses from Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:7) express that we should expect alliances based on mutual benefits, signaling an openness towards engagement:\n   - \"It may be that God will create love between you and your enemies...\" (60:7).\n   \n   This can pave the way for understanding the political landscape in which Muslims might find themselves engaging with non-Muslims.\n\n5. **Community Dynamics**:\n   Believers are encouraged to recognize the diversity of their environment. Many Muslims live in pluralistic societies where cooperation with non-Muslims is essential for harmonious living. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:5) allows for interfaith dynamics, stating:\n   - \"And made lawful for you is the food of the people of the Book, as your food is made lawful for them. And lawful are the chaste Muslim women, and the women of the people of the Book...\" (5:5).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile navigating the complex relationship between personal faith and communal responsibility, particularly with regard to political participation, it is vital to draw from Quranic principles that advocate justice, kindness, and balanced cooperation. Muslim participation in elections with non-Muslims can be seen as aligning with these principles, fostering a society built on common good, while maintaining one’s faith. Ultimately, individual motivations and the context of the political system will play significant roles in shaping a Muslim's approach to such participation. \n\nFor further reflection, Muslims must consider local interpretations and scholarly opinions, which may also address any specific cultural or historical contexts relevant to their communities."

        "question": "Is it permissible to swear allegiance to a kaafir ruler?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Allegiance (bay’ah) is a pledge to obey. And it is a shar’i \n    contract between the one who swears allegiance and the one to whom \n    allegiance is sworn, namely the ruler or caliph. \n\n    Allegiance is sworn to a caliph after the decision makers (ahl \n    al-hill wa’l-aqd) select him; they are the ones who meet the conditions \n    of being trustworthy and of sound opinion. \n\n    In al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (9/274) it says: \n\n    Bay’ah or allegiance, as defined by Ibn Khuldoon in his \n    Muqaddimah, means: a pledge to obey; it is as if the one who swears \n    allegiance is promising his ruler that he will accept his authority with \n    regard to his own affairs and the affairs of the Muslims, and he will not \n    dispute with him with regard to any of that, and he will obey him in any \n    duties that he assigns to him, whether at times of ease or at times of \n    hardship. When they swore allegiance to a ruler and made this pledge, they \n    would put their hands in his as confirmation of the pledge. That is akin to \n    what the seller and purchaser do, so bay’ah or allegiance was accompanied by \n    a handshake. End quote. \n\n    It also says (9/278): \n\n    The selection by the decision makers of the ruler and their \n    swearing allegiance to him (bay’ah) is the basis of his taking that \n    position. The decision makers (ahl al-hill wa’l-‘aqd) are the scholars and \n    people of wisdom and high status, whose knowledge is accompanied by other \n    essential conditions: trustworthiness, good character and wisdom. End \n    quote. \n\n    Just as there are conditions that must be met by the decision \n    makers, there are also conditions that must be met by the caliph to whom \n    allegiance is sworn. Some of these conditions are the subject of scholarly \n    disagreements, but on others there is consensus. Not one of the scholars \n    disagreed with the condition that the ruler must be a Muslim, because what \n    is implied by bay’ah (swearing allegiance) is the implementation of the laws \n    of Allaah, carrying out of hadd punishments and guarding the borders of \n    Islam, so how can a kaafir implement the laws of Allaah and do these things? \n    Rather if the ruler is a Muslim and becomes a kaafir, he must be removed \n    from office because of his kufr. \n\n    Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, discussing the \n    conditions of leadership: \n\n    He should be a Muslim, because Allaah says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): “And never will Allaah grant to the disbelievers a way (to \n    triumph) over the believers” [al-Nisa’ 4:141]. Rulership is the greatest \n    of such ways. And Allaah has enjoined us to put the people of the Book in \n    their place and to take the jizyah from them. End quote. \n\n    Al-Fasl fi’l-Milal wa’l-Ahwa’ wa’l-Nihal \n    (4/128). \n\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    Al-Qaadi said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that a \n    kaafir should not be appointed as ruler, and that if the ruler becomes a \n    kaafir, he must be deposed. End quote. \n\n    Sharh Muslim (12/229). \n\n    In al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (6/218) it says: \n\n    The fuqaha’ stipulated conditions for the ruler, on some of \n    which there is consensus and concerning others there is a difference of \n    opinion. \n\n    The conditions of rulership on which there is consensus are: \n\n    1 – Islam (i.e., the ruler should be a Muslim), because this \n    is a condition of testimony being acceptable and guardianship being valid, \n    which are much less serious issues than rulership. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): “And never will Allaah grant to the \n    disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers” [al-Nisa’ 4:141]. \n    And rulership, as Ibn al-Qayyim said, is the greatest of such ways. And he \n    is to take care of the interests of the Muslims. End quote. \n\n    Based on this, it is not permissible to swear allegiance to a \n    kaafir ruler, and if the ruler becomes a kaafir then he should be deposed, \n    according to the conditions that are known to the scholars. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing whether it is permissible for Muslims to swear allegiance to a kaafir (non-believer) ruler, we can derive insights from several verses of the Qur'an, along with interpretations from Islamic jurisprudence.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n1. **Allegiance to Authority**:\n   The Qur'an emphasizes a general principle of obedience to authority. Surah Al-Furqan (25:57) indicates that the Prophet Muhammad was not asking for recompense but was guiding people towards their Lord. This can be interpreted as promoting loyalty to righteous leadership.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Furqan (25:57)**: \"Tell them: 'I do not ask any recompense of you for this other than (urging) whoever likes may take the way to his Lord.'\"\n\n2. **Allegiance and Accountability**:\n   The notion that allegiance includes accountability is further reiterated in Surah Al-Fath (48:10). Here, the text conveys that allegiance is also a commitment with God. Breaking such a promise could be a source of personal loss.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Fath (48:10)**: \"Those who swear allegiance to you indeed swear allegiance to God; and God's protection is over them. Then whosoever breaks the promise breaks it to his own loss...\"\n\n3. **Limits of Allegiance**:\n   The limits to this allegiance include not supporting transgression and maintaining justice. In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2), believers are instructed to assist each other in goodness and piety, implying that allegiance cannot come at the expense of moral or spiritual integrity.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2)**: \"But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God...\"\n\n4. **Muslim Identity**:\n   The Qur'an asserts that Muslims must maintain their identity and not follow those who turn against the teachings of Islam. Surah Al-Furqan (25:30) highlights that the Prophet laments that his community has neglected the Qur'an, suggesting that allegiance should be to those who uphold the faith.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Furqan (25:30)**: \"The Prophet will say: 'O my Lord, my people had fettered the Qur'an.'\"\n\n5. **Coexistence with Non-Believers**:\n   Islam acknowledges the need for coexistence with non-believers in a manner that does not compromise belief. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:51) warns against taking disbelievers as allies over believers, establishing that one's primary loyalty should be to those who share the faith.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:51)**: \"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies; they are allies of one another. And whoever among you takes them as allies – then he is one of them.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, swearing allegiance to a kaafir ruler can be complex and is contingent on various factors, including the ruler’s behavior toward Islam, justice, and the welfare of the Muslim community. Allegiance should ultimately not compromise a Muslim's principles or duties towards God. Therefore, while it may be permissible in certain contexts (e.g., when seeking peace, protection, etc.), it requires careful consideration of the individual circumstances and should always be guided by Islamic tenets. \n\nThe verses cited express the need for maintaining one's Muslim identity while urging collaboration and upholding righteousness, even in dealings with non-believers. Thus, the permissibility hinges upon the conditions under which such allegiance is given."

        "question": "Trying to avoid being appointed as a judge",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThe position of judge is a \n    noble position, which brings great virtue for the one who is able to \n    undertake that role. The Prophets (peace be upon them), some of the senior \n    Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) and some of the prominent \n    Tabi’een and others who came after them took on this role. By judging justly \n    one is enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and supporting \n    those who have been wronged. \nMuhammad al-Khaadimi (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nKnowledge of judicial \n    matters is one of the noblest and most sublime branches of knowledge, \n    because it is a high position and prophetic role. Through it blood may be \n    protected or shed; it may determine which marriages are valid and invalid; \n    it may confirm ownership or loss of wealth; and it may show which dealings \n    are permissible or forbidden, disliked or recommended. The evidence that \n    knowledge of judicial matters is not like other (branches of knowledge) is \n    the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And (remember) Dawood (David) \n    and Sulaymaan (Solomon), when they gave judgement in the case of the field…” \n    [al-Anbiya’ 21:78]. For that reason the Messengers were sent and on the \n    foundation of justice the heavens and the earth are established. The Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described it as one of the \n    blessings for which envy (hasad) is permitted, as he said: “There should be \n    no envy except in two cases: a man to whom Allaah has given wealth and \n    granted him the authority to spend it in a rightful manner and a man to whom \n    Allaah has given wisdom and he judges and acts on the basis of it.” And it \n    was narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him): “If I were \n    to judge for one day, that would be dearer to me than worshipping for \n    seventy years.” Hence judging justly between people is one of the best of \n    righteous deeds that brings the highest status in the Hereafter. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): “And if you judge, judge with justice \n    between them. Verily, Allaah loves those who act justly” [al-Maa’idah 5:42]. \n    And what can be better than the love of Allaah? \nBareeqah Mahmoodiyyah fi \n    Sharh Tareeqah Muhammadiyyah wa Sharee’ah Nabawiyyah \n    (4/2,3). \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) said: \nThere is a great deal of \n    virtue in it for the one who is able to do it properly, hence Allaah has \n    decreed reward for it even if one errs, and has forgiven him for passing a \n    wrong judgement. It is also enjoining what is good, supporting the one who \n    is wronged, giving rights to those who are entitled to them, deterring the \n    wrongdoer from doing wrong, reconciling between people, settling disputes \n    between them, and these are among the best means of drawing close to Allaah. \n     \nHence the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the other Prophets before \n    him assumed the position of judge and they judged their nations. \nThe Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent ‘Ali to Yemen as a judge, and he sent \n    Mu’aadh as a judge. \nIt was narrated from Ibn \n    Mas’ood that he said: To sit between two people as a judge is dearer to me \n    than worshipping for seventy years. \nAl-Mughni \n    (11/376). \nIn al-Mawsoo’ah \n    al-Fiqhiyyah (33/289) it says: \nBecause of its high status \n    and great virtue, Allaah has decreed reward for it even if one errs, and has \n    forgiven him for passing a wrong judgement. The Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If the judge rules and \n    strives his utmost to work it out and gets it right, he will have two \n    rewards, and if he rules and strives his utmost to work it out and gets it \n    wrong, he will have one reward.” (Agreed upon) He is rewarded for his \n    ijtihaad and efforts, not for his mistake. End quote. \nSecondly: \nTaking up a position as a \n    judge may be obligatory, or it may be permissible, or it may be haraam. It \n    is haraam for the one who takes up such a position when he is ignorant of \n    the rulings of sharee’ah. It is permissible for the one who can judge well \n    but there are others who can also do it. And it is obligatory for the one \n    who can judge well when there is no one else who can judge between people. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \nPeople fall into three \n    categories with regard to judging: \n\n    1.The one for whom it is not \n    permissible to get involved with it. He is the one who is not qualified for \n    it and does not fulfil all its conditions. It was narrated that the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Judges are of three \n    types,” and he mentioned among them a man who judges between people on the \n    basis of ignorance, and he will be in Hell. And because the one who is not \n    qualified for it cannot be just, so he will take rights from the one who is \n    entitled to them and give them to someone else.\n\n    2.The one for whom it is \n    permissible, but not obligatory. This is the one who is of good character \n    and is able to engage in ijtihaad, but there are others who are like him. So \n    he may take up a position as a judge based on his situation and suitability \n    for the post, but it is not obligatory for him, because he is not the only \n    one who can do it. According to one view of Ahmad, it is not recommended for \n    him to enter into it, because of the dangers and risks involved, whereas \n    there is safety in not doing it, and because of the reports which speak \n    sternly about it, and because the way of the salaf was to avoid it. ‘Uthmaan \n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) wanted to appoint Ibn ‘Umar as a judge but \n    he refused. Abu ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Haamid said: If a man is unknown and people \n    do not refer to him concerning the rulings of sharee’ah, and he is not \n    known, then it is better for him to accept this post so that the people may \n    refer to him concerning the rules of sharee’ah and the truth may be \n    established by means of his rulings and the Muslims may benefit from him. \n    But if he is famous among the people for his knowledge, and people refer to \n    him for knowledge and fatwas, then it is better for him to keep busy with \n    that, because of the benefit involved, and because it is also safe from \n    risks. Something similar was said by the companions of al-Shaafa’i. They \n    said: If he is in need, and can earn a living from working as a judge, then \n    it is better for him to do that, and it may be better than other ways of \n    earning a living because it is an act of worship and obedience.\n\n    3.The one for whom it is \n    obligatory. This is the one who is suited to be a judge, and there is no one \n    apart from him. In this case it is an individual obligation, because it is a \n    communal obligation that no one else is able to undertake, so it becomes an \n    individual obligation for him, like washing and shrouding the deceased \n    [which becomes an individual obligation for the one who knows how to do it \n    when no one else knows that].\n\n    There is a report narrated from Ahmad which indicates that it is not an \n    individual obligation in this case. He was asked: Is the judge sinning (by \n    refraining from judging) if there is no one else (who can judge)? He said: \n    He is not sinning.\n\n    This may be understood according to its apparent meaning, that it is not \n    obligatory for him, because of the danger that it brings to him, so he does \n    not have to harm himself in order to benefit others. Hence Abu Qilaabah \n    refused it, although it was said to him, There is no one else. Or it may be \n    understood as referring to one who cannot do what is required because of \n    injustice on the part of the ruler and so on, because Ahmad said: The people \n    need a judge; we cannot let the people’s rights be lost? \nAl-Mughni \n    (11/376). \nSome scholars stated that \n    the issue of working as a judge is subject to the five rulings and it may be \n    either prohibited, obligatory, recommended, disliked or permissibley. \nSee: Mu’een al-Hukkaam \n    fima yataraddadu bayna al-Khasmayni min al-Ahkaam by Shaykh ‘Ala al-Deen \n    al-Taraabulsi (may Allaah have mercy on him) (p. 10). \nThirdly: \nSome of the imams warned \n    against being appointed as a judge and warned of the danger of this post. \n    For example: \n1-\nIt was narrated that ‘Ali \n    ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If the people knew what \n    is involved in judging they would not judge concerning the price of a piece \n    of camel dung. But the people need judges and rulers, whether they are \n    righteous or immoral. \nAkhbaar al-Qudaah \n    by Abu Bakr al-Dabbi who is known as al-Wakee’ (p. 21).  \n2-\nIt was narrated that \n    Mu’alla ibn Rawbah said: Raja’ ibn Haywah said to me: Today the ruler \n    appointed ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mawhab as a judge. If I had a choice between being \n    carried to my grave or being appointed to that to which Ibn Mawhab has been \n    appointed, I would (choose to) be carried to my grave. I said to him: The \n    people say that you nominated him. He said: They are speaking the truth, \n    because I was thinking about the people and not thinking about him.  \nAkhbaar al-Qudaah \n    (p. 23, 24). \n3-\nIt was narrated that \n    Mak-hool said: To go forth and have my neck struck is dearer to me than \n    being appointed as a judge. \n4-\nIt was narrated from Raafi’ \n    that ‘Umar ibn Hubayrah summoned him to appoint him as a judge, and he said: \n    I would not like to be appointed as a judge, even if the pillars of this \n    mosque were turned into gold for me.  \n5-\nal-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad said: \n    If a man is appointed as a judge, let him allocate one day for judging and \n    one day for weeping. \n6-\nIt was narrated that Ibn \n    Shubrumah said: Do not dare to assume the position of judge until you dare \n    to be exposed to the sword. \nAkhbaar al-Qudaah \n    (p. 24). \nFourthly: \nMany of the imams sought to \n    avoid being appointed as judges, and some of them even accepted beatings and \n    imprisonment instead of being appointed, and some fled from their homelands \n    in order to avoid being appointed as judges. The reasons why these imams \n    avoided being appointed as judges may be summed up as follows: \n1-\nHe (the imam) thought that \n    he was not qualified to be a judge. It is well known that acting as a judge \n    requires a great deal of patience, intelligence and astuteness, and the imam \n    who turned down an appointment as a judge may have thought that he did not \n    fulfil these conditions. \nShaykh ‘Ala al-Deen \n    al-Taraabulsi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nOne of the imams said: The \n    sign of the pious is that they avoid this and flee from it. A number of \n    exemplary imams endured hardship in order to keep away from this and they \n    bore it with patience. \nLook at the case of Abu \n    Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy on him) and how he refused it and bore the \n    hardship with patience until he was relieved of that, as did other imams. \nAbu Qilaabah fled to Egypt \n    when he was asked to become a judge, where he was met by Ayyoob who tried to \n    encourage him to do it by saying: If you get it right you will attain a \n    great reward. Abu Qilaabah said to him: The one who is drowning in the sea, \n    how long can he swim?  \nThese words of Abu Qilaabah \n    and other imams, which speak of warnings and fear, are the words of one who \n    acknowledges his own weakness and inability to fulfil the necessary \n    conditions. The same applies to one who thinks he is qualified to act as a \n    judge but other people do not think he is qualified for that. \nOne of the scholars said: \n    There is nothing good in a person who thinks that he is qualified for \n    something for which the people do not think he is qualified. \nWhat is meant by the people \n    here is the scholars. It is obligatory for such a person to avoid being \n    appointed as a judge, and seeking to protect himself is essential. \nMu’een al-Hukkaam fima \n    yataraddadu bayna al-Khasmayni min al-Ahkaam by \n    Shaykh ‘Ala al-Deen al-Taraabulsi (may Allaah have mercy on him) (p. 9) \n2-\nHe thought that it was not \n    obligatory or mustahabb for him. Indeed, a comment by Imam Ahmad may be \n    understood as meaning that it is not obligatory for him even if it becomes \n    unavoidable for him and there is no one else [who is qualified for it]. \n3-\nThere is the danger of \n    passing an incorrect judgement and the scholars fear being appointed as a \n    judge because of that. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \nIn acting as a judge there \n    is grave danger and a huge burden for the one who does not do it properly. \n    Hence the salaf (may Allaah have mercy on them) would refuse it \n    emphatically, fearing its dangers. \nAl-Mughni \n    (11/376) \nIn al-Mawsoo’ah \n    al-Fiqhiyyah (33/289, 290) it says: \nMany of the righteous salaf \n    avoided being appointed as judges and refused it emphatically, even if they \n    were harmed as a result, because they feared its grave danger, as is \n    indicated in many ahaadeeth, in which a stern warning is issued to the one \n    who is appointed as a judge and does not do the job properly, such as the \n    hadeeth, “Allaah is with the judge so long as he is not unjust, but once he \n    becomes unjust He forsakes him and the shaytaan stays with him” [narrated by \n    al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majaah; classed as hasan by al-Albaani] and “Whoever is \n    appointed as a judge or is made a judge has been slaughtered without a \n    knife” [narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majaah; classed as \n    saheeh by al-Albaani] and “Judges are of three types, two of whom will be in \n    Hell and one in Paradise: a man who judges unjustly and knowingly, who will \n    be in Hell; a judge who has no knowledge and destroys people’s rights, who \n    will be in Hell; and a judge who judges in accordance with the truth, who \n    will be in Paradise” [Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3/604) and al-Haakim (904) from the hadeeth of Buraydah; this version was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as saheeh by al-Haakim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him.]. End quote. \n4-\nNot being able to put up \n    with the trials of judging. \nShaykh Abu’l-Hasan \n    al-Nabaahi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\nBecause of the trials \n    involved in being a judge, many virtuous people fled from it and avoided it \n    until they were no longer asked to do it, and others were imprisoned for \n    their refusal, such as Abu Haneefah, whose name was al-Nu’maan ibn Thaabit. \n    ‘Umar ibn Hubayrah summoned him to become a judge, but he refused, so he \n    imprisoned him and had him beaten for several days, ten lashes every day, \n    but he persisted in refusing it, until he let him off.  \nTareekh Qudaat \n    al-Andalus (p. 7) \n5-\nThey were preoccupied with \n    things that were more important, such as travelling in pursuit of knowledge, \n    or teaching people. \nFinally, although the four \n    imams refused to be appointed as judges – as was narrated from them – the \n    noble Prophets (peace be upon them) and the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs did \n    take on this task, but those who want to err on the side of caution may do \n    so.  \nIn al-Mawsoo’ah \n    al-Fiqhiyyah (33/290) it says: \nAfter the time of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the Rightly-Guided \n    Caliphs also acted as judges; they were the leaders of the Muslims, and they \n    judged between people on the basis of truth and their involvement in it is \n    indicative of the high status of this post and the great reward that may be \n    attained thereby, because they are example for the Muslims to follow, and \n    after them many prominent Muslims and senior Taabi’een also took on this \n    role. \nThe fact that some of the \n    scholars refused to become involved in it, despite the fact that they were \n    virtuous, qualified for the post and pious, may be understood as taking \n    extreme precautions in order to protect themselves and erring on the side of \n    caution. Perhaps they thought that they were lacking in some way or they \n    were afraid that it would distract them from acquiring more knowledge. End \n    quote. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of avoiding being appointed as a judge in Islam touches upon various themes including justice, the responsibilities of leadership, and adherence to divine guidance. Based on the verses from Surah Al-Ma'idah (Surah 5), particularly verses 41-49, we can draw several insights.\n\n### Understanding the Role of a Judge\n\n1. **The Mandate to Judge Justly:**\n   In Islam, the role of a judge is significant because it involves making decisions based on justice, as outlined in the divine legislation. Surah Al-Ma'idah states the import of judging fairly:\n   > \"So, if they come to you, judge between them or decline. And if you decline, they can do you no harm; but if you judge, you should do so with justice, for God loves those who are just.\"  \n   *Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:42*.\n\n   This verse highlights that while one has the option to decline, if they choose to judge, it must be done justly, reflecting the ethical and moral gravity that accompanies such a responsibility.\n\n2. **Accountability to Divine Law:**\n   The subsequent verses emphasize the importance of adherence to God's revelations in all judgments:\n   > \"Those who do not judge by God's revelations are infidels indeed...\"  \n   *Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:44*.\n\n   This indicates that judgment must not diverge from divine guidance, further increasing the responsibility of the judge to reflect true justice based on the Quran and previous scriptures.\n\n3. **Judgment as a Test:**\n   The Quran indicates that being entrusted with a position of authority comes with a test:\n   > \"If God had pleased He could surely have made you one people (professing one faith). But He wished to try and test you by that which He gave you.\"  \n   *Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:48*.\n\n   The role of a judge is not merely one of authority but is seen as a test of one's faith and ability to deliver justice. \n\n4. **Avoiding Judge Role:**\n   If an individual feels unprepared or unwilling to take on the seriousness of this position, it is permissible to decline:\n   > \"... So, if they come to you, judge between them or decline.\"  \n   *Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:42*.\n\n   This is a crucial point—acknowledgment of one’s limitations and the option to decline reflects a responsible approach to such a heavy responsibility.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn Islam, the role of a judge is deeply rooted in principles of justice, accountability, and adherence to divine law. While one has the right to decline the role due to various valid reasons, if they take up the mantle of judging, they must do so with an unwavering commitment to justice as prescribed by God. The verses from Surah Al-Ma'idah reinforce the significance of this role while providing a pathway to decline if one is unable to fulfill the requirements suitably. Thus, the avoidance of being appointed a judge could be framed as a humble recognition of one's limitations and a commitment to upholding justice without jeopardizing it. \n\n### Supporting References\n\n- Surah Al-Ma'idah, Ayah 42-45 (5:42-45)\n- Surah Al-Ma'idah, Ayah 44-49 (5:44-49)"

        "question": "Western human rights organizations and the ruling on referring to them for judgement",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Muslim should not be deceived by the so called western and European “human rights” organizations, because although they outwardly appear to support the oppressed and to take a stance against torture and undermining of human dignity in prisons and detention centres – which in general terms are good ideas – they also play other roles, and support other principles which are aimed at destroying the family, and opening the door to slander against Islam and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and all his fellow-Prophets. They are opposed to the rule of sharee’ah which enjoins hadd punishments such as stoning for the adulterer, execution for the apostate and cutting off the hand for the thief, becoming part of legislation and being implemented, which is in fact very rare. These organizations are also opposed to the shar’i rulings that have to do with women, such as the necessity of her wali’s consent for marriage, the command to observe hijab, and the prohibition on her mixing, in addition to other principles where they claim that they want to liberate man from religious obligations and to make man free in the way he conducts his affairs, not restricted by good morals or sublime shar’i rulings.  \nTo sum up what these organizations promote: it is that man should be able to do whatever he wants, no matter how perverse. They support lesbians, homosexuals and bisexuals, and religious deviance. They regard it as a human right to disbelieve in whatever religions one wants and to express one’s opinion – even about the Prophets – without any fear or shame, and they also support the liberation of woman from the control of her father, husband or religion. \nSecondly: \nThere follow some of the articles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which was approved by the United Nations on 10/12/1948 CE, which we are quoting from their website: \nArticle 2.\nEveryone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. \nArticle 18.\nEveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. \nArticle 19.\nEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. \nThese so called rights and freedoms which they call for all people to enjoy regardless of religion make the monotheist and the polytheist equally entitled to these rights and freedoms, so the slave of Allaah and the slave of the Shaytaan are placed on the same level, and every worshipper of rocks, idols or people is given the complete right and freedom to enjoy his kufr and heresy. This is contrary to the laws of Allaah in this world and the Hereafter. \nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Shall We then treat the Muslims (believers of Islamic Monotheism, doers of righteous deeds) like the Mujrimoon (criminals, polytheists and disbelievers)?\n36. What is the matter with you? How judge you?”\n[al-Qalam 68:35, 36] \n“Shall We treat those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds as Mufsidoon (those who associate partners in worship with Allaah and commit crimes) on earth? Or shall We treat the Muttaqoon (the pious) as the Fujjaar (criminals, disbelievers, the wicked)?”\n[Saad 38:28] \n“Is then he who is a believer like him who is a Faasiq (disbeliever and disobedient to Allaah)? Not equal are they”\n[al-Sajdah 32:18].\nIt is a call to abolish the ruling on apostasy, and to openly flaunt the principles of kufr and heresy. It is a call to open the door to everyone who wants to criticize Islam or the Prophet of Islam Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and to have the freedom to criticize and express oneself with no restrictions. \nThese are corrupt principles. Even if they suit their lives, values and religion, they do not suit us and they are contrary to our pure sharee’ah, which brought rulings that are suited to individuals and societies, and establish noble morals, and protect minds, honour, physical well being and wealth, and show people the religion which Allaah loves and is pleased with. \nArticle 3.\nEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. \nIt is from this Article that the calls of these organizations come to protect criminals against execution, and started to give bad publicity to the nations which carry out the hadd punishments of Allaah by stoning married adulterers and executing bandits and those who spread mischief in the land. Now these organizations proudly claim that they have convinced many nations to abolish the death penalty for killers, rapists and criminals. This is contrary to sound human nature, reason and sharee’ah, and it is a message that gives peace of mind to those criminals that their lives will never be lost because of their deeds, which is a way of spreading mischief on earth. \nThey claim that the individual has the right to life and liberty, even if it is a bestial life, and even if that freedom leads to corruption, sicknesses and loss of security for the family and society. \nArticle 16.\nMen and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. \nThis article annuls the role of the woman’s guardian (wali) which is to protect the woman’s rights in marriage, and to help his daughter or sister to make a good choice, and to ask about the religious commitment and character of the suitor. It is by His wisdom that Allaah has prescribed this. If marriage was left up to the woman without her guardian’s consent, you would see most girls marrying those who enchant them of the wolves of men, who are eager to rob them of their chastity then throw them aside.  \nThey also give the wife the same rights of divorce as the husband has. This is something that causes women to turn against their husbands and leads to the break up of their families. The one who knows the nature of men and women will not be able to agree to such nonsense. Western families are not so intact that we can say: Look at how they were destroyed. The call for homosexual rights and the rights of women to form any relationship she wants and women’s rights in marriage and divorce – what families can be built on such shaky foundations?  \nIt is worth noting that these organizations are used for political purposes to put pressure on the Muslim states that care about virtue, modesty and morals, or that apply all or some of the rulings of sharee’ah. Some Muslim nations have abolished the death penalty, and they have introduced strict laws about marriage at an early age for both genders, but they pay attention to woman’s rights to khula’ and maintenance, etc, which causes widespread mischief and evil in many areas of life.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the question about referring to Western human rights organizations for judgment can be addressed through the teachings in the Quran regarding judgment, law, and morality. Several key verses illustrate the Islamic perspective on applying God’s law and the importance of aligning judgments with divine instructions rather than human or secular standards.\n\n### Key Principles from the Quran:\n\n1. **Judgment According to Divine Law**:\n    - Allah emphasizes the importance of adhering to the revelations that He has provided. For instance, in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:49), it states:\n      > \"Judge between them in the light of what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, and beware of them lest they lead you away from the guidance sent down to you by God. If they turn away, then know that God is sure to punish them for some of their sins; and many of them are transgressors.\" \n    This verse underscores that believers are expected to judge by God's revelations and not be swayed by human preferences or systems.\n\n2. **Obedience to God's Commands**:\n    - In Surah An-Nisa (4:58), it is mentioned:\n      > \"God enjoins that you render to the owners what is held in trust with you, and that when you judge among the people, do so equitably. Noble are the counsels of God, and God hears all and sees everything.\"\n    This emphasizes fairness and just judgment as key attributes that should guide a believer’s decisions.\n\n3. **Seeking Divine Guidance vs. Human Authority**:\n    - In Surah An-Nisa (4:60), Allah warns against turning to other than His guidance:\n      > \"Have you never seen those who aver they believe in what has been revealed to you and had been to others before you, yet desire to turn for judgment to evil powers, even though they have been commanded to disbelieve in them? Satan only wishes to lead them astray, far away.\"\n    This serves as a caution against relying on non-Islamic systems of justice, as doing so can indicate hypocrisy in one’s professed faith.\n\n4. **Accountability in Judgment**:\n    - Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:45) indicates that those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are unjust:\n      > \"And those who do not judge by God's revelations are unjust.\"\n    This serves as a reminder that accountability lies with God, and turning to secular frameworks can lead to unjust outcomes.\n\n5. **Friendship and Alliances**:\n    - In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:51), it is advised:\n      > \"O believers, do not hold Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies of one another; and anyone who makes them his friends is surely one of them; and God does not guide the unjust.\"\n    While this verse is often interpreted in the context of political alliances, it further reinforces the notion of maintaining fidelity to Islamic principles, especially when it comes to legal and ethical matters.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the outlined verses, it becomes clear that Islam encourages its followers to rely on divine guidance for judgment and ethical behavior. Referring to Western human rights organizations for judgment may conflict with the fundamental Islamic directive to adhere strictly to and apply God's laws. While there can be common ground in many aspects of human rights, any framework that diverges from the Quranic principles should be approached with caution and critical consideration. This does not negate the value of understanding and discussing human rights universally but places emphasis on prioritizing Islamic teachings as the ultimate guide in matters of judgment and morality."

        "question": "Should he shave off his beard if he travels to a country where those who have beards are persecuted?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.First of all we should remember that it is forbidden to travel to the lands of the mushrikeen or lands where there is a great deal of corruption and promiscuity. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I disavow myself of every Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, why?” He said: “They should not be able to see one another’s fires.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1604; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. \nPlease see also question no 21344 and 8919. \nIf a person needs to travel to such countries and cannot avoid doing so, or if that will serve the public interest of the Muslims, then it is permissible to travel, but he has to learn enough of the rulings of Islam that he needs in this country, and he should avoid places of fitnah (temptation, tribulation) that may affect his religious commitment, as much as he can, whether that has to do with physical temptations that are available in the kaafir land or it has to do with doubts and specious arguments that the enemies of Islam throw at him, overtly or otherwise, to shake the faith that is in people’s hearts. See question no. 6154. If this trip requires him to shave off his beard, such as if he needs to go to a place where wearing a beard is forbidden, or he will exposed to mistreatment because of his beard, and he cannot bear it, then Shaykh Ibn Jibreen tells us that: \nIf he has no alternative but to go to that country, or if his going there will strengthen the Muslims, then there is nothing wrong with him shaving off his beard. But if he is going there only for some worldly gain or the mistreatment to which he will be exposed is something that he can bear, then it is not permissible for him to shave it off. \nIt should also be noted that if trimming his beard a little will be sufficient to ward off harm from himself, then doing that will be less serious than shaving it off. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether one should shave off their beard while traveling to a country where those who have beards are persecuted can be approached from both a theological and a practical perspective in Islam.\n\n### Theological Basis\n\n1. **Preservation of Life and Safety:**\n   Islam places a strong emphasis on the preservation of life and safety. The Quran addresses conditions wherein a Muslim is permitted to make compromises regarding certain practices if their safety is at risk. This principle can be derived from **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:195)** which states: \n   > \"And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good. And spend in the way of Allah and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining].\" (Quran 2:195)\n\n   Here, the phrase \"do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction\" can be interpreted as an instruction to avoid situations that could lead to danger or harm.\n\n2. **Adapting to Circumstances:**\n   Moreover, **Surah An-Nisa (4:100)** mentions:\n   > \"And whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to Allah and His Messenger and then death overtakes him - his reward has already been decreed by Allah. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\" (Quran 4:100)\n\n   This verse reassures believers that even in challenging situations, such as emigrating or traveling under threat, their faith and the sacrifices they make will be recognized by Allah.\n\n3. **Shortening Prayers (Qasr):** \n   Additionally, the Quran allows certain accommodations for prayer when traveling. As stated in **Surah An-Nisa (4:101)**:\n   > \"And when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer, if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt [or attack] you...\" (Quran 4:101)\n\n   This provides a basis for flexibility in religious observances during times of insecurity.\n\n### Practical Considerations\n\nGiven the context of potential persecution, if keeping a beard could lead to physical harm, a person may consider shaving it off for the sake of safety. This is not a trivial act, as maintaining a beard can be viewed as an expression of one's faith. However, the priority of preserving life and avoiding harm is given precedence in Islamic ethics.\n\n1. **Consultation with Scholars:**\n   It can be beneficial for the individual to consult knowledgeable scholars or local religious authorities who can provide guidance based on their understanding of the situation. They may offer tailored advice considering the specific circumstances at hand.\n\n2. **Intention and Awareness:**\n   In such circumstances, the intention behind the action again becomes crucial. If a person decides to shave their beard out of fear for their life or safety, their intention (niyyah) is vital. Actions in Islam are judged by intentions, as stated by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): \"Actions are judged by intentions.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while maintaining a beard is an important practice in Islam, if its presence poses a risk to one's safety in a context of persecution, it may be permissible to shave the beard. The principles of prioritizing life and safety, coupled with the allowance for flexibility in religious observances during times of hardship, support this viewpoint. The decision should always be made with consideration of the individual’s circumstances, and when possible, in consultation with knowledgeable authorities in the faith."

        "question": "The situation of the Muslims in Palestine",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly what is happening to the Muslims \n    in the Holy Land of hardship, torture, expulsion, killing and harm is a matter which causes sorrow to every Muslim, and indeed to every non-Muslim \n    who is reasonable, fair-minded and compassionate, when they see the blatant persecution inflicted upon innocent people, with the intention of \n    driving them out of their homes so that the enemy can take their place, which is an enemy that possesses the most advanced weapons, with which \n    they attack unarmed people who are deprived of the means of defending themselves. \nThis Muslim people has endured for more than \n    fifty years, facing unending Zionist arrogance and aggression, which pays no heed to human dignity or any covenant or treaty, or any law, except \n    that to which their own whims and desires make them inclined and in which their evil rabbis and warlords encourage them. \nThe outcome of that is well known to Muslims \n    as well as Jews, which is that the consequences will be in favour of the pious and the party of God will be the victors. The wrongdoer will never \n    enjoy security, stability and prosperity, rather he will be faced with fear, anxiety, grief and shame, until the day comes when the Muslims come \n    back to their religion and are governed by the sharee’ah of their Lord, then they will meet the Jews in battle, where the two sides will face one \n    another, and victory will go to the people of faith. \nAl-Bukhaari (2926) and Muslim (2922) narrated \n    from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until the Muslims \n    fight the Jews and kill them, until a Jew will be hiding behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say, ‘O Muslim, O slave of Allaah, \n    here is a Jew behind me, come and kill him!’ except for the box-thorn (al-gharqad), for it is one of the trees of the Jews.” \nWe ask Allaah to hasten the Muslims’ return \n    to their religion and to grant them the means of victory. May He grant us the joy of seeing His religion prevail and His enemies humiliated, and \n    may He raise the status of those who are persecuted, tortured or killed for His sake. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The situation of Muslims in Palestine is complex and multifaceted, deeply intertwined with historical, political, and religious dimensions. Understanding it from an Islamic perspective requires insights into the obligations of Muslims under these circumstances, as well as the moral and ethical principles set forth in the Quran.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nThe land of Palestine holds profound significance for Muslims due to its religious sites, primarily Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which is considered the third holiest site in Islam. The political struggle in this region has led to various conflicts, notably the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has seen considerable tension and violence.\n\n### Religious Perspectives\n\nThe Quran outlines principles related to justice, community, and the divine protection of places of worship. For instance:\n\n1. **Protection of Places of Worship**:\n   - In Surah Al-Hajj (22:39-40), it is stated: \"Permission is granted to those who fight because they were oppressed... God will surely help those who help Him.\" This verse indicates that Muslims are permitted to defend themselves and their places of worship from oppression.\n\n2. **Justice and Governance**:\n   - Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:49) advises Muslims to judge in accordance with what has been revealed by God, emphasizing the importance of divine guidance in governance and social justice. This is particularly relevant in discussions surrounding state policies and the treatment of individuals in conflict scenarios.\n\n3. **Community and Solidarity**:\n   - In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:55-56), it highlights that true allies of believers are God and those who invoke Him and strive in righteousness. This reflects the need for unity among Muslims, especially in times of hardship and conflict, underlining the importance of support and solidarity.\n\n4. **Oppression**:\n   - Surah Al-Fath (48:22-26) discusses the inevitability of God's victory for those who are oppressed: \"Had the unbelievers fought you, they would have turned their backs and not found a protector.\" This can be seen as a source of hope for Muslims facing persecution and oppression in Palestine, highlighting that justice and divine support will ultimately prevail.\n\n5. **Striving in Faith**:\n   - The Quran encourages Muslims to maintain their faith and good deeds, as in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:109) which states, \"Fulfil your devotional obligations and pay the zakat,\" highlighting community responsibilities during trying times.\n\n### Current Situation\n\nThe ongoing conflict impacts not only the political and social dimensions for Palestinians but also influences how Muslims around the world perceive their responsibilities towards those affected by the situation in Palestine. The plight of Palestinians, as viewed through Islamic teachings, maintains a call for justice, empathy, and support for the oppressed.\n\nThe verses from Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:62-66) describe different peoples' responses to oppression and loss, offering guidance on how to navigate relations while standing firm in faith. This further reiterates the importance of maintaining Islamic values in interacting with others and striving for justice.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe situation of Muslims in Palestine is emblematic of broader themes of oppression, justice, and righteousness as woven throughout the Quran. Engaging with this context requires not only an understanding of the political landscape but also a commitment to uphold the principles of justice, protection of the oppressed, and maintaining one's faith amidst adversity."

        "question": "To whom should ba’yah (allegiance) be given?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Bay’ah can only be given to the leader of the Muslims, and bay’ah \n    is given by the decision makers – i.e., the scholars and people of virtue and status. Once they give their allegiance to him, his position of \n    leadership is confirmed, and the common folk do not have to give allegiance to him themselves, rather they have to obey him so long as that does \n    not entail disobedience towards Allaah.  \nAl-Maaziri said: With regard to bay’ah being given to the leader \n    of the Muslims, it is sufficient for the decision makers to give him their bay’ah. It is not essential for each individual Muslim to come to him \n    and put his hand in his, rather it is sufficient to commit oneself to obeying him and submitting to him by not going against him or rebel against \n    him.  \nQuoted from Fath al-Baari. \nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said \n    in Sharh Saheeh Muslim: \nWith regard to bay’ah (oath of allegiance): \n    the scholars are agreed that in order for it to be valid it is not essential for all the people or all the decision makers to give their bay’ah. \n    Rather, if bay’ah is given by those scholars and people of virtue and status who are present, that is sufficient. It is not obligatory for each \n    person to come to the leader and put his hand in his and give his oath of allegiance to him. Rather what is required of each individual is to \n    submit to him and not go against him or rebel against him. \nWhat is narrated in the ahaadeeth narrated in \n    the books of Sunnah about bay’ah refers to giving allegiance to the Muslim leader, such as when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: “Whoever dies and did not make an oath of allegiance (to the Muslim leader) has died a death of jaahiliyyah.” (Narrated by Muslim, \n    1851). \nAnd he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: “Whoever gives his oath of allegiance to a leader and gives him his hand and his heart, let him obey him as much as he can. If \n    another one comes and disputes with him (for leadership), kill the second one.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1844) \nAnd he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: “If allegiance is given to two khaleefahs, then kill the second of them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1853). \nAll of that undoubtedly has to do with giving \n    allegiance to the Muslim leader. \nShaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve \n    him) said, answering a question about giving allegiance to the various groups: Bay’ah only has to do with the leader of the Muslims; these various \n    bay’ahs are innovated and they are among the causes of division. The Muslims who are living in one country or one kingdom should have one \n    allegiance to one leader; it is not permissible to have several kinds of bay’ah. al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, 1/367 \nWith regard to how the allegiance should be given to the leader, \n    in the case of men it is done in word and in deed, namely with a handshake. In the case of women, it is done by word only. This is proven in the \n    ahaadeeth which speak of how allegiance was given to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). \nFor example, ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased \n    with her) said: “No, by Allaah, the hand of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never touched the hand of any \n    (non-mahram) woman. Rather he would accept their allegiance (bay’ah) in words only.”\n(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5288; Muslim, \n    1866) \nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said \n    in his Sharh (commentary): “This indicates that for women, allegiance is given in words only, without taking the hand of the leader, and \n    for men it is done in words and by taking his hand. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of bay'ah, or allegiance, is a significant one, as it pertains to the loyalty and support that believers owe to their leaders and to one another in the faith. The following details outline to whom bay'ah should be given, supported by relevant verses from the Quran.\n\n### 1. Bay'ah to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)\n\nThe primary figure to whom bay'ah was given during the time of the Prophet Muhammad was, of course, the Prophet himself. Believers were encouraged to follow and obey the commands of the Prophet as he represented the message of Allah.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- Surah Al-Ahzab (33:6): \"The Prophet is closer to the faithful than they are themselves...\" \n  - This shows the unique position of the Prophet in terms of allegiance and the relationship of love and closeness between him and the believers.\n\n### 2. Bay'ah to Leaders of the Muslim Community\n\nAfter the Prophet, bay'ah is to be given to the rightful leaders of the Muslim community, who are expected to govern according to Islamic principles. This includes the caliphs and, by extension, legitimate rulers who apply Sharia (Islamic law).\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- Surah Al-Imran (3:32): \"Say, 'Obey Allah and the Messenger, and do not turn away from him while you are hearing.'\"\n  - This verse emphasizes the necessity of obedience to those in authority as they stand as representatives of the guidance given to the Prophet.\n\n### 3. Bay'ah to Fellow Believers\n\nAllegiance and loyalty should also extend among fellow believers, particularly those who strive in God’s path, including those who have emigrated for their faith. This sense of brotherhood and mutual support is essential.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- Surah Al-Anfal (8:72-74): \"Those who accepted the faith and set out of their homes, and fought in the way of God are friends of one another... \"\n  - This highlights the mutual support and solidarity that believers owe one another in their faith, reinforcing the community ties.\n\n### 4. Initiation of Bay'ah\n\nBay'ah is initiated in the context of trust and shared values. It should be given to someone who is trustworthy and embodies piety and righteousness in their actions. \n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:55): \"Your only friends are God and His Messenger, and those who believe and are steadfast in devotion,... \"\n  - This verse underlines the criteria for friendship and allegiance, which is based on shared faith and devotion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBay'ah, therefore, should be given to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), legitimate leaders of the Muslim community, and fellow believers. The nature of this allegiance is built upon principles of trust, mutual respect, and shared commitment to Islamic values. The Quran encapsulates the essence of such allegiances, guiding the believers to uphold unity and loyalty in their faith.\n\n### References\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:6)**\n- **Surah Al-Imran (3:32)**\n- **Surah Al-Anfal (8:72-74)**\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:55)**"

        "question": "Role of the khaleefah of the Muslims?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Al-Maawirdi said, describing the tasks that the imam or ruler is obliged to do:\n    There are ten things that he is obliged to do that have to do with public affairs:\n    1 – He must preserve the religion according to its established bases and that on which the salaf of the ummah was unanimously agreed. If an \n    innovator or deviant or one who is confused about some issue emerges, he has to explain the proof to him and tell him what is correct, and deal \n    with him according to the set rights and punishments so that the religion will be protected against being undermined and the ummah will be \n    prevented from deviance.\n    2 – He must judge between disputing parties and put an end to arguments so that justice and fairness will prevail, aggressors will not get carried \n    away and no person who is wronged will feel helpless.\n    3 – He must guarantee public safety and security and protect the women and children of the ummah so that people can go about their business and \n    travel around in safety, with no danger to their persons or their wealth.\n    4 – He must carry out hadd punishments so that the sacred limits of Allaah will not be transgressed and so that the rights of His slaves will be \n    protected.\n    5 – He must reinforce the borders with equipment and forces so that the enemy will not find any opportunity to violate the borders of the Muslims \n    or shed their blood or the blood of non-Muslims living under the protection of the Islamic state.\n    6 – He must strive in jihad against those who stubbornly reject Islam after being called to it, until they become Muslim or agree to live under \n    Muslim protection and pay jizyah, so that the rights of Allaah will be fulfilled and His religion will prevail over all others.\n    7 – He must collect zakaah and charity money in the manner enjoined by the texts and scholarly consensus, without causing fear or being unjust.\n    8 – He must work out what benefits etc are to be given to those who deserve them from the treasury of the Islamic state (bayt al-maal), without \n    being either extravagant or stingy; he must pay them on time, neither early nor late.\n    9 – He must appoint people who are honest and sincere to different positions, so that things will be done efficiently and wealth will be kept with \n    trustworthy people. \n    10 – He should supervise matters directly himself, and check on things so that the ummah will be led in a proper manner. He should not rely on \n    delegating to others because he is too busy indulging in physical pleasures or worship, for he may end up delegating to a supposedly trustworthy \n    person who then betrays him, or a supposedly sincere person who then cheats him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n    “O Dawood (David)! Verily, We have placed you as a successor on the earth; so judge you between men in truth (and justice) and follow not your \n    desire * for it will mislead you from the path of Allaah”\n    [Saad 38:26]\n    Allaah did not allow him to delegate to others without supervising them or excuse him from that; He even described that as misguidance. Even \n    though these are the duties of the khaleefah as stated in religion, these are also the duties of everyone who has anyone under his care. The \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.”\n    If the imam fulfils the rights of the ummah that we have mentioned above, then he has discharged his duty towards Allaah and to them, and so he is \n    owed the two duties of obedience and support, unless he changes.",
        "predicted_answer": "The role of the khaleefah (caliph) in Islam is multifaceted and deeply rooted in religious and historical significance. As the leader of the Muslim community, the khaleefah is tasked with spiritual leadership, administration, and upholding Islamic law (Sharia). The concept of khilafah is derived from the Quran and the Sunnah, where it reflects the broader Islamic principle of leadership and governance among the believers.\n\n### Responsibilities of the Khaleefah\n\n1. **Implementing Divine Law**: The primary role of the khaleefah is to implement the laws of Islam as prescribed in the Quran and Hadith. This includes enforcing justice, upholding moral and ethical standards, and ensuring that the community adheres to the teachings of Islam.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:256** emphasizes the choice faced by individuals but implies that once one has accepted Islam, the community expects adherence to the faith. \"There is no compulsion in matters of faith. Distinct is the way of guidance now from error\" (Al-Baqarah 2:256).\n\n2. **Providing Guidance and Leadership**: The khaleefah serves as a leader who guides the community spiritually and socially. They are expected to make decisions that reflect the welfare of the people and in accordance with divine guidance.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Ahzab 33:39-40** indicates the role of the prophet as a messenger and leader, a role that the khaleefah must continue in the community: \"Those who convey the messages of God, and fear Him and no one else, God is sufficient to keep account\" (Al-Ahzab 33:39).\n\n3. **Maintaining Unity and Order**: The khaleefah has the responsibility to maintain unity among Muslims. This involves reconciliation efforts, leading prayers, and being a figure of stability within the community.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Hajj 22:78** speaks to the unity and collective worship expected of Muslims: \"O you who believe, bow in adoration, worship your Lord and do what is good that you may find success\" (Al-Hajj 22:78).\n\n4. **Defending the Community**: The khaleefah must protect the Islamic community from internal and external threats, ensuring the security and safety of all believers.\n\n   - The concept of khilafah also involves a mandate to protect the faith and its followers, which is implied throughout the Quran, such as in **Surah Al-Fath 48:29** where the believers are described as \"severe with infidels but compassionate among themselves\" (Al-Fath 48:29).\n\n5. **Spiritual Role**: The spiritual leadership of the khaleefah is fundamental. They are seen as a spiritual guide and a model of piety for the community.\n\n   - In **Surah Al-Ahzab 33:41-43**, Allah emphasizes the importance of remembering and praising Him, as it is essential for the khaleefah to lead the community in worship and remembrance (dhikr) of Allah.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe role of the khaleefah in Islam encompasses various dimensions, including spiritual leadership, governance according to divine law, maintaining community order, and defending the faith. It is a position that not only requires administrative skills but also a deep commitment to the principles of Islam laid out in the Quran and exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The khaleefah acts as a custodian of the teachings of Islam, guiding the community while upholding justice, morality, and the welfare of all Muslims. The importance of this role is underlined through various Quranic injunctions regarding leadership, community, and justice."

        "question": "Solution to the Palestinian issue",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Muslim is deeply grieved and filled with sorrow as the Palestinian situation goes from bad to worse, and gets more complicated, until it has ended up in the state we have seen in recent days, because of differences among neighbouring nations and their failure to stand together as one against the enemy and their failure to adhere to the rule of Islam on which Allah has made victory dependent, and has promised those who adhere to it that they will gain power and become powerful in the land, and has warned of grave danger and a severe punishment, if the neighbouring nations do not hasten to unite once more and adhere to the Islamic ruling concerning this matter,  which concerns them and the entire Islamic world. \nIt is worth pointing out in this context that the Palestinian issue is an Islamic issue, first and last, but the enemies of Islam are striving their utmost to remove it from the Islamic map and make the non-Arab Muslims think that it is an Arab issue that does not concern the non-Arabs. It seems that they have succeeded in that to some extent. \nHence I think that a solution cannot be reached in this matter unless it is regarded as an Islamic issue and the Muslims cooperate to find a solution, and wage an Islamic jihad against the Jews, until the land is given back to its people and the Jewish immigrants go back to the countries from which they came, and the original Jewish inhabitants stay in their towns under Islamic rule, not communist or secular rule. In this manner truth will prevail and falsehood will be defeated, and the people whose land it is will return to their land under Islamic rule and none other. And Allah is the source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Palestinian issue is a complex and multifaceted conflict involving historical, political, religious, and social dimensions. While Islamic teachings can provide valuable insights into how justice, peace, and coexistence are viewed, they do not offer a singular solution to the political aspects of the conflict. However, certain Quranic principles can inform Muslim perspectives and actions related to justice, peace, and human dignity. Here are some key concepts derived from the Quran that may provide a foundational ethical framework for addressing the situation in Palestine.\n\n### 1. The Sanctity of Life\n\nOne of the fundamental principles emphasized in the Quran is the sanctity of human life. As stated in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:32):\n\n> \"That is why We decreed for the children of Israel that whosoever kills a human being, except (as punishment) for murder or for spreading corruption in the land, it shall be like killing all humanity; and whosoever saves a life, saves the entire human race.\" (Quran 5:32)\n\nThis verse underscores that taking a life unjustly is a grave sin and that saving lives is paramount. In the context of the Palestinian issue, this principle can call for an end to violence and loss of life.\n\n### 2. Justice and Fairness\n\nIslam places a high value on justice and fairness, as illustrated in Surah An-Nisa (4:135):\n\n> \"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses in justice, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives.\" (Quran 4:135)\n\nThis highlights the obligation to uphold justice, regardless of personal biases or affiliations. A just solution to the Palestinian issue must be sought, taking into account the rights and concerns of all parties involved.\n\n### 3. Reconciliation and Forgiveness\n\nThe Quran encourages reconciliation and forgiveness among people. In Surah Al-Imran (3:134), it is stated:\n\n> \"And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a garden as wide as the heavens and earth, prepared for the righteous.\" (Quran 3:133)\n\nForgiveness is an important aspect of conflict resolution. For peace to be achieved in Palestine, there may need to be a focus on dialogue, understanding, and reconciliation, rather than ongoing hostility and revenge.\n\n### 4. Cooperation in Goodness\n\nThe Quran advocates for cooperation among people in acts of goodness and righteousness. In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2), it states:\n\n> \"And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.\" (Quran 5:2)\n\nThis verse supports the idea that all parties should work together to promote justice, aid those in need, and build a peaceful society rather than engage in acts that perpetuate violence and injustice.\n\n### 5. Respect for Treaties and Agreements\n\nFulfillment of obligations and respect for treaties is an important principle in Islamic teachings. In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:1), it is emphasized that believers should uphold agreements:\n\n> \"O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts.\" (Quran 5:1)\n\nMutual respect for agreements and conditions set between conflicting parties may be essential for establishing a sustainable peace in the region.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the Quran does not provide a specific political solution to the Palestinian issue, it does articulate principles of justice, the sanctity of life, reconciliation, cooperation, and the fulfillment of agreements. These principles can serve as important guidelines for Muslims and all people of goodwill seeking a just and peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\nIn discussing sensitive issues like the Palestinian conflict, it is crucial to approach them with a commitment to empathy, justice, and mutual understanding, recognizing the humanity of all involved. More importantly, international dialogue, diplomacy, and the engagement of regional stakeholders will be necessary to navigate the complexities of this enduring issue."

May Allah help them and grant them victory over their enemies, and may He enable the Muslims to help them and stand firm with them until Allah grants them victory over their enemy, for He is the best of supporters.",
        "predicted_answer": "The uprising of the Palestinian people can be viewed through the lens of struggle and perseverance against oppression, a theme that resonates deeply in Islamic teachings. Many Quranic verses address the plight of those who face tyranny and emphasize reliance on God, as well as the eventual triumph of the oppressed.\n\n### Key Themes and Verses\n\n1. **Divine Support for the Oppressed**: \n   The Quran frequently reminds believers to remain steadfast in the face of oppression. A poignant example comes from Surah Al-A'raf (7:127-131), where Moses encourages his people to seek God's help amidst their struggles against Pharaoh's tyranny. The verse states:\n\n   > \"Invoke the help of God and be firm. The earth belongs to God: He can make whom He wills among His creatures inherit it. The future is theirs who take heed for themselves.\" (Al-A'raf 7:128)\n\n   This highlights the belief that perseverance is vital and that God is ultimately in control of the fate of nations.\n\n2. **Historic Example of the Children of Israel**: \n   The oppression faced by the Children of Israel at the hands of Pharaoh serves as a significant parallel to the Palestinian struggle. The verses describe how Moses reassures the oppressed that God will grant them success over their oppressors:\n\n   > \"And We then made the people who were weak (and oppressed) successors of the land to the East and the West which We had blessed.\" (Al-A'raf 7:137)\n\n   This assurance serves as a reminder that those who endure hardship with faith may inherit the land and prevail against injustice.\n\n3. **Oppression and Its Consequences**: \n   In Surah Al-Dukhan (44:30), the Quran discusses the downfall of tyrants and reinforces the idea that oppression leads to divine retribution. The verse reads:\n\n   > \"So We saved the children of Israel from degrading suffering.\" (Al-Dukhan 44:31)\n\n   This reinforces the belief that God supports the oppressed and will ultimately ensure justice is served.\n\n4. **Call for Perseverance and Faith**: \n   The concept of patience and faith in the face of adversity is further echoed in Surah Ash-Shu'ara where it states:\n\n   > \"But my Lord has given me wisdom, and made me an apostle. But the favour you oblige me with is that you have enslaved the children of Israel.\" (Ash-Shu'ara 26:21)\n\n   Here, it is noted that God's support for Moses and his people came from their endurance and faith during their trials.\n\n5. **Consequences of Injustice**: \n   The final outcome for those who commit injustices is reiterated throughout the Quran. In Surah Al-A'raf (7:136-139), it states that the oppressors faced destruction:\n\n   > \"So We took vengeance on them, and drowned them in the sea for rejecting Our signs and not heeding them.\" (Al-A'raf 7:136)\n\n   This passage serves as a reminder that the punishment for oppression is inevitable, and those who commit unjust acts will face consequences.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe uprising of the Palestinian people embodies a struggle against overwhelming odds and is firmly rooted in historical narratives found in the Quran. The verses deliver powerful messages of hope, support for the oppressed, and the ultimate triumph of justice. The steadfastness of the oppressed, as illustrated by the stories of Moses and the Children of Israel, serves as a source of inspiration for those facing their own struggles today. These Qur'anic teachings call for faith, patience, and reliance on God, promising that those who endure will witness the fulfillment of God's promise."

        "question": "Muslim attitudes towards violence and how to react to kaafir aggression against the Muslim community",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah. \nWhat we have heard about what our Muslim brothers are going through in kaafir countries in the north and the south, where they are being harassed and persecuted for something in which they did not take part and in which they played no role, is not strange, given the wrongdoing and hatred of the kuffaar, even though they claim to be the people of justice, fairness and freedom. What is the crime of a Muslim woman who walks down the street in her hijaab? What is the crime of a Muslim who leaves his home to go and pray, not to spread mischief in the land? What is the crime of a Muslim employee who goes to his company or a student who goes to his university or a schoolgirl who is walking to her school, not going out to bomb and destroy? If the western man in the street was fair-minded – at least with himself – he would go and take revenge on the people who plotted and took part in harming him. But one who does not fear God could do anything, and the very least that the Muslims will be faced with is curses and insults. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to Allaah; but if you persevere patiently, and become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious) then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:186]\nOur attitude must be clear; we must explain to the kuffaar the ruling of Islamic sharee’ah concerning harming and killing others. We should tell them that Islam forbids harming innocent people in any way, whether that involves harming their bodies, their wealth or their honour. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.” It is not permissible to kill a kaafir who is not hostile or who has a legitimate peace treaty with the Muslims; rather treating a non-hostile kaafir with kindness is part of the Islamic religion, especially if that is done to call him to Islam and soften his heart (towards Islam). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who deal with equity”[al-Mumtahinah 60:8]\nAt times of war against the kuffaar, it is not permissible for a Muslim to deliberately kill a kaafir child or woman who is not bearing arms against the Muslims or helping in the fight. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the Muslim army: “Go out in the name of Allaah and by the help of Allaah, following the way of the Messenger of Allaah. Do not kill any old man, infant, child or woman… spread goodness and do good, for Allaah loves those who do good.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2614; its isnaad includes Khaalid ibn al-Faraz, of whom Ibn Hajar said in al-Taqreeb, he is maqbool (acceptable) i.e., if there are corroborating reports) \nThis is supported by the advice which Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him) gave to the commander of his army: “I advise you of ten things: do not kill a woman, or a child, or any old person, or cut down any fruit trees…” (al-Muwatta’, 982, Kitaab al-Jihaad). \nThe kaafirs whom the Muslims fight and inflict harm and loss upon are the kaafirs who fight the Muslims and drive them out of their homes, or help to drive them out of their homes and punish and mistreat them, and who stand in the way of calling people to Islam and prevent people from following the path of Allaah, and prevent the spread of Islam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allaah forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers those who disobey Allaah).”[al-Mumtahinah 60:9]\nSuch people are to be fought against when [the Muslims] have the power to do so, and when fighting them and declaring jihad against them is more likely to serve a purpose. But when you can achieve your purpose with gentleness and kindness, it is not right to resort to violence and force. Muslims should only use force when they are compelled to, and as a last resort. They should not initiate fighting, unless there is some cause on the part of the kaafirs, such as their fighting the Muslims, or helping other enemies of the Muslims, or preventing them from following the path of Allaah and establishing the law of Allaah in the land. \nWe should also remind these kaafirs of the massacres which have been carried out and are still being carried out against Muslims in all parts of the world, in Bosnia, Kosova, Chechnya, Palestine and Kashmir, which are being supported by Jews, Christians and others. Is the blood of the Muslims cheaper than the blood of others? Should there be mourners for non-Muslims who are killed and not for Muslims who are killed? \nMoreover, when the Orthodox Christians carried out massacres in Bosnia and Kosova, in which the numbers of those killed exceeded 200,000, apart from those who were wounded or raped, and the economic losses that resulted, did the Muslims in the Arab and Islamic countries launch attacks against the Orthodox Christians who live in their countries, or kill any of them, or open fire against their churches and subject them to terror?! What does this tell you? \nIt is very important for Muslims to explain these things to non-Muslims, in order to establish proof against the kuffaar. This is something that Allaah wants. Secondly, among the kuffaar there are intelligent and fair-minded people, and people who are receptive to the guidance of Islam; perhaps they will be affected by a clear explanation. Thirdly, no Muslim should permit himself to be accused without explaining his innocence. The distorted image of Muslims is one of the things that is keeping the kaafirs away from the truth and being affected by the Muslims; indeed it may make them treat the Muslims like outcasts, resulting in additional wrongdoing towards the Muslims. \nWith regard to the question, it is permissible for a Muslim at times of tribulation, when they cannot walk safely through the streets or reach the mosque safe and sound, to pray at home and not attend prayers in jamaa’ah. But we must examine the situation more carefully before deciding not to attend Jumu’ah prayer because of its extreme importance. So we should not stop praying in jamaa’ah or stop attending Jumu’ah prayers on the grounds of mere speculation or an unlikely possibility of aggression. Rather if a person is certain or believes it to be most likely that he will be attacked if he goes to the mosque, then it is permissible for him not to go.\nAmong the opinions of the scholars concerning the permissibility of refraining from going to Jumu’ah prayers or prayers in jamaa’ah because of fear is the comment of Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) who said: “The one who is sick and the one who is afraid is excused from attending them – i.e., Jumu’ah and prayers in jamaa’ah – according to the view of most of the scholars. Ibn ‘Abbaas narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever hears the call to prayer and is not prevented from responding by an excuse –’ They said, ‘What is the excuse, O Messenger of Allaah?’ He said, ‘Fear or sickness, (otherwise) the prayer that he offers will not be accepted.’” (narrated by Abu Dawood, 1/130. Shaykh al-Albaani classed this version of the hadeeth as da’eef (weak), but he classed as saheeh (sound) the version narrated by Ibn Maajah, 793, which says: “Whoever hears the call and does not come, his prayer is not valid, except for one who has an excuse.” Al-Irwaa’ 2/337). And Bilaal used to give the call to prayer; one day the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came when he was sick, and said, ‘Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.’” (al-Bukhaari, 633; Muslim, 418) \nFear is of three kinds: fear for oneself, fear for one’s wealth, and fear for one’s family. The first kind means fearing capture by an oppressive ruler, or an enemy, or a thief, or attack by wild animals, or a flood, etc., which may cause harm to oneself.\n The second kind means fear for one’s wealth if one leaves home, as we have mentioned, such as oppressive rulers, thieves and the like, or fear that one’s house may be broken into or burned down or something like that; in such cases one is excused from attending Jumu’ah and prayers in jamaa’ah.  \nThe third kind means fear for one’s child and family. In all such cases one is excused from attending Jumu’ah and prayers in jamaa’ah. This was the view of ‘Ataa’, al-Hasan, al-Oozaa’i and al-Shaafa’i, and we know of no difference of opinion concerning this matter.”\n(summarized from al-Mughni, 2/376). \nIn Fataawa al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, when a man asked him about refraining from attending prayers in jamaa’ah because he was afraid for his wife, he said, “If there is some danger to your wife (at home) and she is not safe, and she is surrounded by things which give rise to fear, then he is excused for praying at home because of his fear for his wife…” Then he said: “But if your wife is not safe and the place is not safe, and danger is present, then it is o.k. for you to pray at home; this is a legitimate excuse…” \nMajmoo’ Fataawa Samaahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), 12/42 \nWith regard to Muslim women, they should stay in their homes and not go out – as much as they can – lest they be exposed to harm. Their relatives and neighbours should help them to meet their needs so that they will not be forced to go out. This is a means of earning great reward by helping those who are in desperate need. \nWith regard to Muslim men giving up distinctive Islamic dress and wearing the clothes commonly found in the kaafir society in which he lives, that is o.k., especially at times of persecution and harassment. Imaam Ibn Taymiyah said: \n“The Muslim in a kaafir country that is at war with the Muslims or otherwise is not commanded to differ from them in outward appearance, because of the harm that may result from that. Rather it is recommended or obligatory for men to resemble them sometimes in his outward appearance, if that serves a religious purpose such as calling them to Islam, or finding out about their true state of affairs in order to inform the Muslims of that, or warding off their harm from the Muslims, and other righteous goals.” (Iqtidaa’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, p. 176). \nThe words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah must be understood correctly. He is speaking of special circumstances or cases of necessity; he does not mean at all that Muslims should become assimilated with the kaafirs and do evil things or drink alcohol with them or that Muslim children should go to churches and lose their Islamic identity. Rather what is meant is that it is permissible to forego distinctive Islamic dress – for example – and wear clothing of the type prevalent in the kaafir country, and to speak the language of the kaafirs, etc., in order to ward off the harm of the kaafirs, especially in an atmosphere that is charged with hostility, such as that mentioned in the question. \nPerhaps these events will give the Muslims who are living in kaafir lands unnecessarily and for no shar’i purpose the opportunity to review their situation and consider going back to the Muslim world and making hijrah from the land of the kaafirs. \nWe ask Allaah to protect us and all our Muslim brothers from harm, wrongdoing and evil, and guide us to the right path. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and grant him peace.",
        "predicted_answer": "Muslim attitudes towards violence and the reaction to aggression against the Muslim community are complex concepts embedded deeply within Islamic texts. Let's explore these themes through the lens of **Quranic verses** and their interpretations, primarily focusing on principles that guide Muslims in the context of conflict and peace.\n\n### 1. **Self-Defense and Non-Aggression**\nThe Quran clearly establishes that violence is permissible only in self-defense, particularly in the context of oppression. This is delineated in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:190-194):\n\n> \"Fight those in the way of God who fight you, but do not be aggressive: God does not like aggressors. And fight those (who fight you) wheresoever you find them, and expel them from the place they had turned you out from. Oppression is worse than killing...\" (Al-Baqarah 2:190-193)\n\nThis verse emphasizes that fighting is a response to aggression, but it prohibits preemptive violence, highlighting a principle that Muslims are expected to engage in conflict only when provoked.\n\n### 2. **Ending Hostility**\nThe call to cease fighting if the adversary retreats or ceases aggression is particularly poignant. The continuation of combat is conditioned upon the enemy's active hostility:\n\n> \"...If they desist, God is forgiving and kind. Fight them till sedition comes to an end, and the law of God prevails. If they desist, then cease to be hostile, except against those who oppress.\" (Al-Baqarah 2:193)\n\nThis underscores the Islamic expectation of seeking peace as soon as aggression stops, indicating a preference for reconciliation over conflict.\n\n### 3. **Drugging the Cycle of Violence**\nIn Surah Al-Nisa (4:91-95), the Quran speaks about avoiding violence against those who do not wish to fight:\n\n> \"If they keep aloof and do not fight, and offer peace, God has left you no reason to fight them.\" (Al-Nisa 4:90)\n\nThis suggests that peaceful coexistence is encouraged whenever possible. If an individual or group turns hostile, then they can be dealt with according to their actions, but peace remains a priority.\n\n### 4. **Engagement in Internal Conflicts**\nWhen facing internal strife, the Quran instructs Muslims to promote peace:\n\n> \"...If two groups of believers come to fight one another, promote peace between them. Then if one of them turns aggressive against the other, fight against the aggressive party till it returns to God's authority.\" (Al-Hujurat 49:9)\n\nThis verse advocates for justice and peacemaking within the community, highlighting the importance of unity and the avoidance of unnecessary conflict among Muslims.\n\n### 5. **Limitations on Violence**\nThe Quran places significant restrictions on violence, especially towards other believers. Surah Al-Nisa (4:92-93) illustrates these limits clearly:\n\n> \"It is not for a believer to take a believer's life except by mistake...\" (Al-Nisa 4:93)\n\nThis indicates the sanctity of life within the Muslim community. Killing a believer intentionally is seen as a severe transgression with dire consequences.\n\n### 6. **Response to Hostility from Non-Believers**\nAs the Quran explains, the relationship with non-believers can be intricate, relying on their actions toward Muslims. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2) advises against allowing hatred to incite aggression:\n\n> \"But do not let your hatred of a people who had barred you from the Holy Mosque lead you to aggression...\" (Al-Ma'idah 5:2)\n\nThis indicates that Muslims should refrain from retaliating out of hatred, advocating instead for mutual respect and justice.\n\n### 7. **The Call to Justice**\nMuslims are called to uphold justice and fairness in all dealings, including conflicts. Justice is pivotal and is emphasized repeatedly in the Quran:\n\n> \"Verily God loves those who are just.\" (Al-Hujurat 49:9)\n\nThis serves as a guiding principle not just in warfare, but in everyday interactions and in how Muslims respond to aggression.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overarching attitude in Islam towards conflict emphasizes self-defense, proportionality, the pursuit of peace, and strict limits on violence. Alongside these tenets lies a strong belief in justice, mercy, and the holiness of life. Muslims are encouraged to bear these principles in mind when faced with both internal community strife and external hostilities, advocating for peaceful resolutions wherever possible while maintaining a firm stance against oppression. \n\nEach of these concepts is underpinned by a rich tapestry of Quranic revelation that promotes a balanced approach in understanding and responding to aggression, guiding Muslim conduct towards moderation and righteousness."

        "question": "Reconciling the fact that the khaleefah should be from Quraysh with the hadeeth about obeying an Abyssinian slave",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth about the rulers being \n          from Quraysh is a saheeh hadeeth which was narrated through many isnaads. \n          The basic principle is that the leader should be from Quraysh. But in \n          the case where the khaleefah has seized power by force and is ruling \n          the people by force, the people have to obey him and it is haraam to \n          rebel against him, even if he is an Abyssinian slave as it says in the \n          hadeeth.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question involves reconciling two key aspects of Islamic thought: the requirement for a khaleefah (caliph) to be from the Quraysh tribe and the Islamic principles of leadership that allow for obedience to those in authority, regardless of their background (as illustrated by the mention of obeying an Abyssinian slave).\n\n### 1. **The Requirement for the Khaleefah to be from Quraysh**\nHistorically, it has been established among Islamic scholars that the leader (khaleefah) should preferably be from the tribe of Quraysh. This notion is derived from several hadiths and the practice of the early Muslim community. The importance of Quraysh is often cited based on their status and role during the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). A pertinent hadith states: \n\n> \"The leadership will always be from Quraysh.\" (Sahih Muslim)\n\nThe Qur'an also emphasizes the favored status of Quraysh through verses that highlight their role:\n\n> \"Since the Quraysh have been united, united to fit out caravans winter and summer, let them worship the Lord of this House.\" (Surah Al-Quraysh, 106:1-3)\n\n### 2. **Obedience to an Abyssinian Slave**\nOn the other hand, the hadith about obeying an Abyssinian slave refers to the well-known saying of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him):\n\n> \"Even if a slave from Abyssinia were to lead you, you must listen to him.\" (Sahih Bukhari)\n\nThis hadith indicates that the quality of leadership is not dependent on lineage, ethnicity, or social status but rather on righteousness and capability. Islam places significant value on moral and ethical qualifications rather than tribal affiliation.\n\n### **Reconciliation of the Two Concepts**\nThe reconciliation of these two principles can be understood through the lens of Islamic egalitarianism and the essential qualities that define effective leadership. While it is preferable for a khaleefah to come from the Quraysh tribe—due to their proven leadership qualities, tribal connection to the Prophet, and experience in governance—Islam also emphasizes that true authority comes from piety, capability, and justice.\n\n1. **Moral and Ethical Landscape**: The aforementioned hadith about obeying an Abyssinian slave underscores that the basis for leadership in Islam is not merely tribal lineage but the character and righteousness of the individual. This reflects the underlying ethical framework of the faith, which values personal virtue over social status.\n\n2. **Pragmatic Governance**: The requirements for a khaleefah being from Quraysh can be seen as a practical guideline to ensure stability and continuity in leadership, particularly in the early community that might have valued more established tribal leadership. In contrast, the allowance to follow a capable leader of any background reflects a more dynamic aspect of governance within Islamic tradition. \n\n3. **Evolution of Leadership**: The circumstances of the Muslim community and its expansion necessitated a shift in understanding who can be a leader. The initial preference for Quraysh may have adjusted as the community matured and the relevance of tribal affiliation became less significant than the qualities of justice and ability.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nBoth concepts find a place in Islamic thought; the preference for Quraysh as leaders offers a historical context, while the broad acceptance of capable individuals from any background reflects Islam's core values of justice and righteousness. Hence, the essence of leadership in Islam is more about the qualities of the individual rather than their lineage, enabling a more flexible understanding of authority that can adapt to changing circumstances within the Muslim community. \n\nFor references, you can review Surah Al-Quraysh (106) for the Qur'an’s stance on Quraysh and the hadith collections of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim for the sayings related to leadership and obedience."

What he should do, if he is advised, is to thank the person who has offered the advice, then he should look at himself and if the advice was justified, then he should avoid the haraam thing and do what is obligatory. As far as his comment “you are a fanatic” is concerned, fanaticism, laxity and moderation are all to be understood in reference to sharee’ah. Whatever is in accordance with sharee’ah is moderate; whatever exceeds that is extreme and whatever falls short of that is laxity. The standard in all cases is sharee’ah and the meaning of moderation is that which is in accordance with the sharee’ah. Whatever is in accordance with sharee’ah is moderate.",
        "predicted_answer": "The notion of fanaticism within Islam can be complex, as Islamic teachings emphasize balance, compassion, and justice. It's essential to approach this subject with an understanding of the context of various Quranic verses and the overall ethos of the religion. \n\n### Understanding Fanaticism in Islam\n\nThe Quran promotes moderation and understanding while advising against excessive zeal or fanaticism. Here are several points that support this:\n\n1. **Moderation in Faith**: Islam teaches that believers should not go to extremes in their practice of faith. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:87) instructs that believers should not confuse lawful and unlawful practices. It emphasizes a balanced approach to religious obligations:\n   - **Reference**: \"O you who believe! Do not prohibit the good things which Allah has made lawful for you and do not exceed the limits. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors.\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:87)\n\n2. **Guidance and Wisdom Over Fanaticism**: The Quran acknowledges the presence of differing views and encourages believers to seek wisdom rather than succumb to fanaticism. In Surah Al-An'am (6:68), it advises believers to avoid those who engage in frivolous discourse about the faith:\n   - **Reference**: \"And when you see those who engage in false conversation about Our verses, turn away from them until they engage in another topic.\" (Surah Al-An'am, 6:68)\n\n3. **Respect for Others' Beliefs**: In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:256), it is clearly stated that there is no compulsion in religion. This underscores the importance of respect for individual belief systems, promoting tolerance rather than fanaticism:\n   - **Reference**: \"There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:256)\n\n4. **The Dangers of Division and Hatred**: Surah Al-‘Imran (3:118) advises against taking non-believers or those who harbor enmity towards believers as friends, indicating that believers should be cautious about forming alliances based on superficial affinities that could lead to fanaticism:\n   - **Reference**: \"O you who have believed, do not take as friends those beyond you, or they will not fail to cause you harm.\" (Surah Al-‘Imran, 3:118)\n\n5. **Encouragement to Show Kindness**: The Quran repeatedly underscores kindness and forgiveness over aggression. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2) warns against hatred leading to aggression, encouraging instead mutual cooperation in good deeds:\n   - **Reference**: \"And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:2)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Quran and the teachings of Islam emphasize moderation, understanding, and respect for others, which stands in stark contrast to the concept of fanaticism. It is essential for believers to navigate their faith in a balanced manner that promotes harmony and goodwill, thus adhering to the true spirit of Islam. \n\nThis understanding encourages Muslims to foster a peaceful coexistence with all, reject hatred and aggression, and embrace a compassionate approach in their interactions. In essence, true Islamic practice fosters a sense of community, engagement, and love rather than division and hostility."

        "question": "Appointing an ameer (leader)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The reports that have been narrated concerning\n    appointing an ameer refer specifically to when people are travelling, because when people\n    are travelling they need to be able to refer their opinions to a leader or ameer. But when\n    people are not travelling, usually each individual is busy with his own affairs and they\n    do not need an ameer.\nBut they may appoint someone to be the head of their society or group,\n    so if for example they are living in a flat, they may say” we need someone to\n    organize our affairs in this flat, so we will appoint So and so to be our head or\n    ameer.” Then they can discuss with him the running of this household’s affairs,\n    such as what kind of food to have, setting times of rest, deciding what needs to be\n    bought, and so on, so they discuss these things with him and agree to accept what he says.\n    This is correct, in sha Allaah.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Appointing an Ameer (Leader) in Islam\n\nIn Islam, the appointment of a leader, or \"ameer,\" is a vital element for maintaining order, governance, and guidance within the Muslim community (Ummah). The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of leadership, obedience to God and the Prophet, and the fulfillment of responsibilities by those who hold positions of authority. Let's delve into several relevant Quranic verses that outline the significance of appointing leaders and the responsibilities associated with leadership.\n\n#### 1. **The Role of Guardianship and Leadership**\nIn **Surah Al-An'am (6:165)**, Allah states: \n> \"It is He who made you trustees on the earth, and exalted some in rank over others in order to try you by what He has given you. Indeed your Lord's retribution is swift, yet He is forgiving and kind.\" \n- This verse alludes to the concept that God has placed some in positions of authority and leadership to guide and be responsible for their communities.\n\n#### 2. **Obedience to God and His Messenger**\nThe Qur'an in **Surah An-Nur (24:54-55)** declares:  \n> \"Say: 'Obey God and obey the Apostle. If you turn away, then for him is his duty to fulfill, and for you the burden that you carry; yet if you obey him you will be rightly guided. The duty of the Messenger is to convey the message clearly.' God has promised to make those of you who believe and do the right, leaders in the land, as He had made those before them...\"\n- This indicates that obedience to appointed leaders, who are expected to follow divine guidance, is essential for spiritual and communal success.\n\n#### 3. **Leadership Promised to the Righteous**\nContinuing from the previous verse, **Surah An-Nur (24:55)** reinforces the idea that belief and good deeds are prerequisites for leadership:\n> \"God has promised to make those of you who believe and do the right, leaders in the land...\"\n- This promise emphasizes that it is not merely the position that denotes leadership, but the moral and ethical behavior of the individual.\n\n#### 4. **Obedience as a Key Principle For Success**\nIn **Surah An-Nur (24:51)**, we read: \n> \"The answer of the believers when they are called to God and His Apostle that he may judge between them, is: 'We hear and obey.' And they are the ones who will prosper.\"\n- This affirms that true believers demonstrate their faith through obedience, which is fundamental for maintaining justice and order within the community.\n\n#### 5. **The Importance of Just Leadership**\n**Surah Al-An'am (6:48)** highlights the responsibilities of those chosen as leaders: \n> \"We do not send apostles but to give good tidings and to warn. Then those who believe or reform will have neither fear nor regret.\"\n- Leaders, akin to messengers, have the duty of guiding their followers towards righteousness, thus reinforcing the moral fabric of society.\n\n#### Conclusion\nIn summary, the appointment of an ameer in Islam is a matter of significant responsibility, involving leadership that is deeply rooted in obedience to God and His Messenger. The verses from the Qur'an delineate a clear principle: leaders must be just, righteous, and rooted in Islamic values, as they are given a sacred trust (amanah) to guide their communities. Belief and good actions are essential prerequisites for leadership, with the assurance that those who undertake these responsibilities rightly will ultimately find success in this life and the hereafter."

        "question": "Is it permissible for sisters who are working in Da’wah to\r\n    choose an Ameerah (leader) for themselves?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih\n    al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:\n, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and blessings be\n    upon the most noble of the Prophets and Messengers, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon all his\n    family and companions. They have to have an Ameerah to organize their affairs so that they\n    will not be disorganized. This is the case with every group of people, whether on a\n    journey, in the home, etc. If they appoint someone as an Ameerah, then they have to obey\n    her, because the point of making someone an Ameer is to obey him. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the question of whether sisters who are working in Da’wah can choose an Ameerah (leader) for themselves is multifaceted and can be understood through various principles in Islamic jurisprudence, which emphasize consultation, consent, and collective decision-making.\n\n### 1. **Consultation (Shura)**\n\nIslam places significant importance on the concept of consultation (Shura) as highlighted in the Quran. It encourages believers to consult one another in affairs. This can be extrapolated to mean that a group of women engaged in Da’wah can discuss and decide on leadership to guide their activities.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Ash-Shura (42:38)**: \"And those who have responded to [their] lord and established prayer and whose affair is [determined by] consultation among themselves...\"  \n  (This verse emphasizes the importance of mutual consultation in decision-making.)\n\n### 2. **Equality and Capability of Women**\n\nThe Quran acknowledges the capabilities and contributions of women. Women have been active participants in various aspects of society, including religious duties. This participation suggests that they can hold leadership roles within their own communities, including in Da’wah.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:35)**: “Indeed, the Muslim men and women, the believing men and women, the devout men and women, the truthful men and women, the patient men and women, the humble men and women, the charitable men and women, the fasting men and women, the chaste men and women, and those who remember Allah frequently - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.”  \n  (This verse indicates the shared virtues and spiritual roles of both genders in Islam.)\n\n### 3. **Role of Leadership in Da’wah**\n\nIt is known from Islamic history that women like Aisha (RA) and Fatimah (RA) played prominent roles in religious guidance and community leadership. Their examples suggest that women can and have made significant contributions to Da’wah.\n\n**Supporting Idea:**\nThe leadership role of an Ameerah in a Da’wah context can serve to stimulate and organize efforts among the sisters, ensuring that they have a clear direction and purpose in their activities.\n\n### 4. **Community Decision**\n\nThe act of choosing a leader can also be seen as an expression of collective will, as opposed to unilateral decision-making. Having an Ameerah reflects a structured approach to their Da’wah efforts, which can enhance mutual support and collaboration.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the principles outlined above, it is permissible for sisters involved in Da’wah to choose an Ameerah for themselves. This aligns with the Islamic concepts of consultation, the recognition of women's contributions, and the structured approach to community leadership. The Quranic emphasis on Shura and the acknowledgment of women's roles in society supports this understanding. \n\nThus, such a decision should ideally be made collectively, ensuring that the leadership is recognized and supported by the community of sisters engaged in Da’wah activities."

        "question": "Is it permissible    for Muslims to vote for kaafirs who seem to be less evil?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is a matter concerning which rulings may differ according to different circumstances in different times and places. There is no absolute ruling that covers all situations, both real and hypothetical.\nIn some cases it is wrong to vote, such as when the matter will have no effect on the Muslims, or when the Muslims have no effect on the outcome of the vote. In this case voting or not voting is all the same. The same applies in cases where all the candidates are equally evil or where they all have the same attitude towards Muslims…\nIt may be the case that the interests of Islam require Muslims to vote so as to ward off the greater evil and to reduce harmful effects, such as where two candidates may be non-Muslims but one of them is less hostile towards Muslims than the other, and Muslims’ votes will have an impact on the outcome of the election. In such cases there is nothing wrong with Muslims casting their votes in favour of the less evil candidate.\nIn any case, this is the matter of ijtihaad based on the principle of weighing up the pros and cons, what is in the interests of Islam and what is detrimental. With regard to this matter, we have to refer to the people of knowledge who understand this principle. We should put the question to them, explaining in detail the circumstances and laws in the country where the Muslim community is living, the state of the candidates, the importance of the vote, the likely benefits, and so on.\nNo one should imagine that anyone who says that it is OK to vote is thereby expressing approval or support for kufr. It is done in the interests of the Muslims, not out of love for kufr and its people. The Muslims rejoiced when the Romans defeated the Persians, as did the Muslims in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) when the Negus defeated those who had challenged his authority. This is well known from history. Whoever wants to be on the safe side and abstain from voting is allowed to do so. This response applies only to elections for influential positions. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether it is permissible for Muslims to vote for non-Muslims (kaafirs) who appear to be less evil requires a nuanced examination of Islamic teachings, particularly in light of the verses you have provided. Let's analyze the relevant scriptural texts and their implications for such a decision.\n\n### Key Verses and Their Interpretations\n\n1. **Friendship and Alliances with Non-Muslims**:\n   - Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:51): *\"O believers, do not hold Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies of one another; and whoever makes them his friends is surely one of them; and God does not guide the unjust.\"*\n   - This verse advises against forming friendships or alliances with non-believers who oppose the Muslim community. It suggests that such alliances can lead to compromising one's faith and integrity.\n\n2. **Justice Towards Non-Hostile Non-Muslims**:\n   - Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:8): *\"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you, nor expelled you from your homes. God indeed loves those who are just.\"*\n   - This verse underscores that Muslims can treat non-Muslims kindly and justly as long as they are not hostile. Voting for a candidate who is less evil may fall under the category of acting justly if they do not oppose Islam or Muslims.\n\n3. **Responsibility to Fulfill Obligations**:\n   - Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2): *\"But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God. Surely God is severe in punishment.\"*\n   - This verse promotes assisting one another in good deeds. Voting for someone who promotes good, even if not a Muslim, could be seen as part of this encouragement toward goodness, depending on the broader consequences of that vote.\n\n4. **Promotion of Goodness**:\n   - Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:8): *\"And let not the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is more in conformity to righteousness.\"*\n   - The principle here is that Muslims should not allow animosity toward non-believers to prevent them from being just. If voting for a less evil candidate serves the greater good, then it may align with this teaching.\n  \n5. **The Fear of Misguidance**:\n   - Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:49): *\"Judge between them in the light of what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, and beware of them lest they lead you away from the guidance sent down to you by God.\"*\n   - This instructs Muslims to adhere closely to divine guidance when making judgments. Therefore, the decision to vote must be made carefully, ensuring that it does not compromise religious values.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while the Quran warns against forming alliances with non-Muslims who are hostile towards the Muslim community, it also calls for justice and kindness towards those who do not fight against Muslims. If Muslims find themselves in a situation where they must vote and the candidates are non-Muslims, they can lean towards voting for the one who seems less evil, particularly if that candidate supports policies that align with Islamic values and benefit the community. The ultimate decision should be made cautiously and in adherence to Islamic principles of justice and righteousness.\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:51)**\n- **Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:8)**\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2, 5:8, 5:49)**\n\nThese verses collectively offer a framework for making decisions that align with Islamic ethics while navigating complex social and political landscapes."

These, not the ignorant masses whose opinion is worthless, are \nthe ones who select the khaleefah. May Allaah help you to do that which will please Him.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Proportional Representation in Islamic Centers\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe concept of proportional representation in Islamic contexts can be understood through various principles exemplified in the Qur'an, which emphasizes justice, consultation, and collaboration among believers. It can be derived from certain verses that highlight the importance of treating all individuals fairly and ensuring inclusive participation in community decisions, particularly in Islamic centers or assemblies.\n\n**Key Principles & Supporting Verses**\n\n1. **Importance of Inclusivity and Respectful Engagement**:\n   - Surah Al-Mujadila (58:11) reflects the importance of making room for everyone in discussions and assemblies. This encourages believers to be inclusive and support one another in communal matters. The verse states:\n     > \"O you who believe, when you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room; God will give you more room to spread. When you are told to rise, then rise; God will raise those of you who believe, and those who have knowledge, in position. God is aware of what you do.\" \n     - **Reference**: Al-Mujadila (58:11)\n\n2. **Consultation (Shura)**:\n   - The principle of Shura, or mutual consultation, is a fundamental concept in Islam that supports proportional representation. The Qur'an underscores the importance of consulting among one another while making decisions affecting the community. While this specific verse does not explicitly mention Shura, the context suggests the necessity of involving various voices for guidance:\n     > \"Those who have responded to [their] lord and established prayer and whose affair is [determined by] consultation among themselves...\" \n     - **Reference**: Al-Imran (3:159)\n\n3. **Upholding Justice**:\n   - The commandment to uphold justice is prevalent throughout the Qur'an. Justice should be equitably served to maintain harmony in the community. In Surah An-Nisa (4:135), it states:\n     > \"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses in justice, or witnesses to Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives...\"\n     - **Reference**: An-Nisa (4:135)\n\n4. **Protection of the Rights of All**:\n   - Ensuring that everyone’s rights are respected is essential in a community. Surah Al-Hajj emphasizes treating others with dignity and fairness:\n     > \"And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.\" \n     - **Reference**: Al-Hajj (22:77)\n\n5. **Addressing the Diversity of Society**:\n   - The Qur'an acknowledges diversity among people and encourages believers to act with understanding:\n     > \"And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors. Indeed, in that are signs for those of knowledge.\" \n     - **Reference**: Ar-Rum (30:22)\n\n6. **Promoting Harmony and Avoiding Division**:\n   - The Qur'an advises maintaining harmony during discussions and conversations, avoiding division among the community:\n     > \"And do not be like those who divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment.\" \n     - **Reference**: Al-Imran (3:105)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nProportional representation in Islamic centers can be viewed through the lens of inclusivity, justice, and communal decision-making as outlined in the Qur'an. It is important for leaders and attendees at Islamic centers to ensure that all voices are heard and respected, consistent with the spirit of unity and cooperation encouraged in Islam. Such an approach not only enhances community ties but also aligns with the teachings of the Qur'an that emphasize justice and mutual respect in all affairs of the Muslim community."
