        "question": "Should the supplication for hearing thunder be repeated if the thunder is continuous?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is no proven report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he used to say this dhikr when hearing thunder. Rather it was narrated with a sound isnad from ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) that if he heard thunder, he would stop speaking and say: “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi wa’l-mala’ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him.” Then he would say: This [thunder] is a stern warning to the people of the earth.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (723) and Malik in al-Muwatta’ (3641). Its isnad was classed as sahih by an-Nawawi in al-Adhkar (235) and al-Albani in Sahih al-Adab al-Mufrad (556).\nIt was also narrated from others among the Sahabah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: We were with ‘Umar on a journey and suddenly there was thunder, lightning and hail. Ka‘b said to us: Whoever says three times when he hears thunder “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi wa’l-mala’ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him” will be protected from that thunder. We said it and we were protected.\"(Al-Adhkar by an-Nawawi  p. 181).\nIbn ‘Allan said: al-Hafiz said: This isnad is hasan and mawquf [meaning that it stops at the Sahabi]. Even though it was narrated from Ka‘b, Ibn ‘Abbas and ‘Umar approved of it, which indicates that it has a basis.  \nEnd quote from al-Futuhat ar-Rabbaniyyah ‘ala al-Adhkar an-Nawawiyyah (4/286).\nHence it is recommended (mustahabb) to say this dhikr when hearing thunder.\nIt was narrated in a marfu‘ report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that when he heard the sound of thunder and lightning, he would say: “Allahumma la taqtulna bi ghadabika wa la tuhlikna bi ‘adhabika, wa ‘afina qabla dhalika (O Allah, do not kill us with Your wrath and do not destroy us with Your punishment and protect us before that).”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (3450), who said: This is a gharib hadith; we only know it through this isnad. It was classed as da‘if (weak) by an-Nawawi in al-Adhkar (p. 181) and by al-Albani in Da‘if at-Tirmidhi (3694).\nEven though this hadith is da‘if, as at-Tirmidhi himself said, when it comes to the hadiths that encourage virtuous deeds in general, and supplications (du‘a’s) in particular, the matter is flexible, and the scholars usually took a lenient approach towards their isnads.\nIn al-Mustadrak it was narrated that ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Mahdi said: If we narrated a report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speaks about what is halal and haram, or about rulings, we are strict in examining its isnad and its narrators. But if we narrate hadiths that speak of the virtue of various deeds, reward and punishment, permissible matters and supplications, we are lenient in examining their isnads.\nAl-Mustadrak ‘ala as-Sahihayn (1/666).\nAl-Qadi Abu Ya‘la (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from Imam Ahmad that he said: When we narrate [reports] from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speak of halal and haram, we are very stringent in examining the isnads. But when we narrate reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speak of the virtue of various deeds and reports that do not affirm or abrogate a ruling, we are lenient in examining the isnads.\"(Tabaqat al-Hanabilah 1/425).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We have previously noted that the scholars are agreed that one may act on a da‘if hadith that speaks of righteous deeds, but not matters of halal and haram.\"(Al-Majmu‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab  3/248).\nAl-Hattab said: Even though this is da‘if, the scholars are agreed that it is permissible to act in accordance with a da‘if hadith that speaks of the virtue of a particular deed.\"(Mawahib al-Jalil  1/17).\nIbn Hajar al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is permissible to act in accordance with a da‘if hadith that speaks of the virtue of a deed, because if it turns out to be sahih, then the one who accepted it will have acted as is required, and if it does not turn out to be sahih, there will be no negative consequences for having acted upon it, such as making something haram halal and vice versa, and there will be no transgression against the rights of others.\"(Al-Fath al-Mubin bi Sharh al-Arba‘in  p. 109).\nThe claim that there is unanimous scholarly agreement on this issue is not accurate, as we have stated previously that the scholars differed in the conditions that they stipulated for acting in accordance with a da‘if hadith (question no. 44877 ).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When it comes to hadiths in which there is some weakness, it is either due to a narrator whose memory was poor, or a narrator who has committed some mischief, or other, similar reasons for which it was said that his hadith is da‘if. A da‘if hadith may be quoted by scholars in the context of encouraging people to do righteous deeds that are established and well-known in Islamic teachings, such as the da‘if hadiths that speak of giving charity, because charity is something that is well-known in Islamic teachings, there are verses of the Quran which highlight the importance of charity, and there are sahih hadiths which speak about it. So if there are some da‘if hadiths which speak about the virtue of charity, the scholars quote them. The same applies if there are da‘if hadiths which speak about the virtue of supererogatory (nafil) prayers, or about the virtue of tasbih (saying Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah)) and tahlil (saying La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah)), and of dhikr. All these matters are established and well-known in Islamic teachings, so the scholars may be lenient regarding da‘if hadiths that speak of them, because the original deeds of which the da‘if hadiths speak are rooted in the Quran and Sunnah, and because acts of worship that are mentioned in da‘if hadiths are already well known from the Quran and Sunnah.\"(shaykh’s website).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the issue of repeating the dhikr mentioned in the question – “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi ...” –\nIt is clear from the action of Ka‘b and the approval of ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them all) that he used to say it three times.\nAnd it is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that it is recommended to repeat supplications three times. When he offered supplication, he would say it three times, and when he asked of Allah, he would ask three times.\nBased on that, if this dhikr is repeated three times, that is good.\nIf he repeats it every time he hears thunder, what appears to be the case is that there is nothing wrong with that, as it is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would sometimes repeat a supplication more than three times. It was narrated that Jarir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) blessed the horses of (the tribe of) Ahmas and their men five times. Al-Bukhari (4099).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that he used to repeat supplications an odd number of times, and he sometimes repeated them more than three times. This is an exception to the general meaning of the words of Anas, “When he offered supplication, he would repeat it three times.” That is to be understood as referring to what he usually did, and when he said it more than three times, there must have been a reason which dictated that he should say it more than three times. This is clear in the case of the tribe of Ahmas, because of their efforts in standing up to disbelief and supporting Islam, especially with regard to their own people to whom they belonged.\"(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar  8/73-74).\nSo if there is a reason for repeating it, such as if the reason for saying the dhikr is repeated, then there is nothing wrong with repeating it.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, when it comes to supplication (dua) related to thunder, there are traditional practices, but the key principle is that heartfelt and sincere invocation towards Allah should always be encouraged. Specifically addressing your question about whether the supplication for hearing thunder should be repeated if the thunder is continuous requires some consideration of the significance of the act and the context of what is being said.\n\n### Thunder and Praise\nThe Quran mentions the nature of thunder and its relationship to Allah. In Surah Ar-Ra’d (Chapter 13), verse 13, it states:\n>The thunder sings His praises, and the angels too, for awe of Him. (Quran 13:13)\n\nThis verse emphasizes that thunder itself is a sign of Allah’s power, and it is part of His magnificent creation that glorifies Him.\n\n### Supplication\nThe concept of supplication is emphasized throughout the Quran, notably in a context of returning to Allah in times of need. The same chapter, Surah Ar-Ra'd, acknowledges that true supplication is towards Allah alone, stating:\n>To call on Him is true (supplication). For those they invoke other than Him do not answer them at all... (Quran 13:14)\n\nThis reinforces that turning to Allah with sincerity is a crucial element of supplication.\n\n### Continuous Thunder\nAs for the supplication during continuous thunder, it is prudent to remember the significance of engaging with Allah in prayer when one witnesses the signs of His creation, such as thunder and lightning. While there is no specific requirement in the Quran or Hadith that dictates that one must repeat the supplication for the sound of thunder each time it occurs, the attitude toward continual acknowledgment and gratitude can be beneficial from a spiritual perspective. \n\n#### Example of Actions\nFor instance, when hearing continuous thunder, one can continue to invoke:\n>O Allah, may this thunder remind me of Your might and glory, and may it be a sign of Your mercy upon us.\n\nFurthermore, there are narrations outside of the Quran that suggest when making supplications, Muslims can do so repeatedly. They can draw from other sources of supplications (Du’a) that remain appropriate in the context of seeking mercy, guidance, or assistance, particularly when facing natural phenomena like thunderstorms.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, while there are no strict rules mandating repetition of the supplication during continuous thunder, utilizing such moments to engage sincerely with Allah through invoking Him is encouraged, fostering a continuous connection with the divine through love and remembrance. One may repeat the supplications as often as one feels the need to do so, emphasizing the spirit of worship and the beauty of spirituality inherent in these exchanges.\n\n### References\n- **Surah Ar-Ra'd (The Thunder)**: \n    - **Verse 13**: \"The thunder sings His praises, and the angels too, for awe of Him.\" (Quran 13:13)\n    - **Verse 14**: \"To call on Him is true (supplication). For those they invoke other than Him do not answer them at all...\" (Quran 13:14)"

        "question": "Is it permissible to have the dua of entering toilet on the door of the bathroom",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to display Adhkar for the purpose of remembrance, but they should be placed in a suitable location, to preserve their dignity and prevent disrespect. For example, the Dhikr for entering the washroom should not be placed on the bathroom door, but rather on the side of the door from the outside, to the right or left of the person entering.\nSheikh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\n\"Is it correct to place verses or reminders Adhkar from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) on the walls in rooms for the purpose of remembering Allah the Almighty and for contemplation? Please guide us, may Allah reward you with good.\"\nHe replied: \"The correct view is that there is no harm; if it is for the purpose of remembrance, placing verses on the wall, or hadiths for remembrance, there is nothing wrong with that, if it is for the purpose of remembrance and benefit, like hadiths about greeting (salam), supplication (du`a), hadiths about forbidding what Allah has forbidden, or encouraging obedience to Allah, or verses; there is no harm in that in a gathering or in an office,\" End quote from the website of Shaykh Ibn Baz.\nAnd Sheikh Ibn `Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) says: \"As for - writing hadiths - in the house: there is nothing wrong with writing a hadith that has a benefit, like the expiation of the gathering: (Subhanaka Allahumma Rabbana wa bihamdika, ash-hadu an la ilaha illa ant, astaghfiruka wa atubu ilayk) this contains a reminder,\" Eng quote from \"Liqa' Al-Bab Al-Maftuh\" (197 / 13).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the conduct regarding prayers, invocations (dua), and etiquette related to the toilet (cleaning and hygiene) is significant. As for having the dua of entering the toilet displayed on the door of the bathroom, it can be assessed based on the general principles of respect for sacred words and the cleanliness required in these matters.\n\n### Importance of Cleanliness and Respect for Sacred Words\n\n1. **Respect for Sacred Words**: \n   Having religious texts, including dua, in a place that may become impure or is considered unclean (like a toilet) is generally discouraged in Islam. Sacred texts and divine names are held in high regard, and placing them in a disrespectful context can be seen as lacking proper etiquette.\n\n   According to the Quran:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:222)**: \"Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves.\" This emphasizes the importance of cleanliness in Islamic practice.\n  \n2. **Privacy and Etiquette**: \n   The Quran emphasizes permission before entering private spaces, reinforcing the need for respect and privacy:\n   - **Surah An-Nur (24:27)**: \"O you who believe, do not enter other houses except your own without first asking permission and saluting the inmates.\"\n\n### Conclusion on the Question\n\nGiven the above principles, many scholars would generally argue against placing a dua on the entry door of a toilet due to the potential dishonor of sacred words and the context in which they are displayed. The toilet is a place meant for cleaning, and maintaining the purity of the word of Allah is deemed important. \n\nTo summarize, while it is important to remember the dua and recite it while entering the toilet (such as \"Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min al-khubthi wal-khaba'ith\" meaning \"O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the male and female devils\"), displaying it on the door can be considered inappropriate. \n\nIf one wants to maintain the dua's presence, keeping it in a clean and respectful place, such as a notebook or an app on a device, would be more appropriate. This respects the reverence required for the words of Allah and protects them from being in an impure or inappropriate context."

        "question": "Ruling on giving gifts or charity to the servant",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with giving a gift to the servant, of giving her charity if she needs it.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to give charity to the servant from zakah, noting that we give her a regular salary too?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with a person giving his zakah to his servant, whether the servant is a man or a woman, if he or she has a family in his home country who are in need, and the salary that he receives is not sufficient for them. But if the salary is sufficient, meaning that it is sufficient for the family, then it is not permissible to give them zakah, because Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect [zakah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allah . And Allah is Knowing and Wise} [at-Tawbah 9:60]. And because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Mu‘adh ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen: “Teach them that Allah has enjoined upon them charity from their wealth, to be taken from their rich ones and given to their poor ones.” End quote.\nFatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb.\nIf this is permissible in the case of zakah on one’s wealth, then it is more appropriate that it should be permissible in the case of voluntary charity.\nBut we should point out that it is not permissible for the one who is giving zakah to benefit from giving it to his servant, such as if he gives it to her instead of increasing her salary or instead of giving her some bonus that he had promised her, or to ask her to do more than was agreed upon, and the like.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 67926 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the act of giving gifts or charity to a servant (or anyone in need) is regarded as a commendable and virtuous act. The Qur'an encourages generosity and kindness towards those who are less fortunate, including servants, orphans, and the needy. Below is a comprehensive exploration of the rulings and principles regarding gifting or giving charity to a servant, supported by specific verses from the Qur'an.\n\n### 1. **Charity and Generosity**\n\nIslam emphasizes the importance of giving charity (sadaqah) and supporting those in need. Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), verses 177 and 267 highlight that charitable acts are essential expressions of faith:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:177** states: \n  > \"Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is in one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, and the Prophets and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves...\" \n   *(Al-Baqarah 2:177)*\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:267** underscores the quality of what should be given in charity:\n  > \"O believers, give in charity from the good things that you have earned and of what We have produced from the earth...\" \n  *(Al-Baqarah 2:267)*\n\nFrom these verses, it is clear that giving to those in need, including servants, is considered an act of righteousness. \n\n### 2. **Secrecy in Charity**\n\nIt is recommended to give charity discreetly. This is indicated in Surah Al-Baqarah verses 271-272:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:271-272**:\n  > \"If you give alms openly, it is well; but if you do it secretly and give to the poor, that is better.\" \n  *(Al-Baqarah 2:271)*\n\nThis verse suggests that while public charity is commendable, the act of giving in secret is even more virtuous, reflecting humility and sincerity in the act of charity.\n\n### 3. **Rewards of Charity**\n\nThe Qur’an promises rewards for those who help others in need. In Surah Al-Baqarah, it states that spending in the way of Allah will earn one a significant reward:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:274**:\n  > \"Those who spend of their wealth in the way of God, night and day, secretly and openly, will have their reward with their Lord, and they will have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.\" \n  *(Al-Baqarah 2:274)*\n\nHence, giving gifts or charity to a servant not only assists them materially but also benefits the giver spiritually.\n\n### 4. **Principles of Giving**\n\nIslamic teachings emphasize that one should give what is good and valuable. **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:267** also emphasizes:\n- \"Give in charity from the good things that you have earned...\"\n  \nThis ensures that the act of giving is beneficial and dignified, both for the giver and the recipient.\n\n### 5. **Care for Servants and Orphans**\n\nIn Surah An-Nisa (Chapter 4), there are explicit instructions regarding the treatment of orphans and those who cannot fend for themselves, which would also apply to servants:\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa 4:2**:\n  > \"Give to the orphans their possessions and do not substitute defective things for good ones...\" \n  *(An-Nisa 4:2)*\n\nThis underlines the importance of treating servants, akin to orphans, with fairness and kindness in all transactions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, giving gifts or charity to a servant is a highly encouraged act in Islam. The various verses from the Qur'an illustrate that generosity towards those in need is a cornerstone of righteous conduct. Such acts not only fulfill a social obligation but also yield spiritual rewards. As Muslims engage with their servants, the principles of kindness, dignity, and sincerity should always guide their actions, reflecting the core values of Islam."

        "question": "What is the ruling on likening someone to the Companions?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The status of the Companions\nIt is a well-established fact that the Companions enjoy a great and lofty status , for Allah praised them and described them as having good qualities and sublime characteristics, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and those who followed them with good conduct - Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment} [at-Tawbah 9:100]\n{So those who emigrated or were evicted from their homes or were harmed in My cause or fought or were killed - I will surely remove from them their misdeeds, and I will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow as reward from Allah , and Allah has with Him the best reward} [Al ‘Imran 3:195]\n{For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from Allah and [His] approval and supporting Allah and His Messenger, [there is also a share]. Those are the truthful\nAnd [also for] those who were settled in al-Madinah and [adopted] the faith before them. They love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what the emigrants were given but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful} [al-Hashr 59:8-9]\n{Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that Allah may enrage by them the disbelievers. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward} [al-Fath 48:29].\nIbn Mas‘ud said: Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, looked into the hearts of His slaves and chose Muhammad, then He sent him with His message, for He chose him on the basis of His knowledge. Then He looked into the hearts of people after him, and chose for him his companions, who He made the supporters of His religion and the helpers of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nNarrated by at-Tayalisi in his Musnad (1/199) and by Ahmad in his Musnad (3600).\nFor more information, please see question no. 159184 .\nRuling on emulating the Companions\nEmulating the Companions is a great good deed and an immense blessing. Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whoever among you wants to take someone as an example, let him take the Companions of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as an example, for they were the purest in heart of this ummah, the deepest in knowledge, the most down to earth, the most guided and the best in attitude. They were people whom Allah, may He be exalted, chose to accompany His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so acknowledge their virtue and follow in their footsteps, for they followed right guidance.\"(Jami‘ Bayan al-‘Ilm  2/947).\nAl-Hasan said: The companions of Muhammad were the purest in heart of this ummah, the deepest in knowledge, and the most down to earth. They were people whom Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose to accompany His Prophet and establish His religion. So imitate their attitude and conduct, for – by the Lord of the Ka‘bah – they followed right guidance.\"(Ash-Shari‘ah by al-Ajurri  4/1685).\nLikening someone to the Companions\nThere is nothing wrong with likening someone to one of the Companions in any of his characteristics, actions of physical appearance. There does not seem to be any reason to disallow that, because he will resemble him in some ways and not others. So if you liken someone [to one of the Companions] by saying that he is courageous like Khalid, or knowledgeable like Mu‘adh, or strong like So-and-so among the Companions, or he has a beautiful voice like Abu Musa, that is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it.\nIn fact, if someone is likened to one who is greater and nobler, namely the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), there is nothing wrong with that, if what is meant is likening him to one of the characteristics, actions or manners of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that is not something that is a unique characteristic of Prophethood.\nMany of the Companions made comparisons of this nature.\nIt was narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: No one resembled the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) more than al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali. Narrated by al-Bukhari (3752).\nAnd he said regarding al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali: He was the one who most resembled the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Narrated by al-Bukhari (3748).\nIbn al-Jawzi said: Among the Tabi‘in there was a man called Kabis ibn Rabi‘ah as-Sami, who resembled [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)]. Mu‘awiyah sent for him, then he kissed him on the forehead and allocated some land to him. When Anas ibn Malik saw him, he would weep. End quote from Kashf al-Mushkil min Hadith as-Sahihayn (1/42).\nSimilarly, they might also liken people to him in terms of conduct and attitude.\nHudhayfah ibn al-Yaman said: The one who most closely resembled the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in dignity, physical appearance and conduct was Ibn Umm ‘Abd. Narrated by al-Bukhari (6079); he was ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him).\nIt was narrated that ‘A’ishah the Mother of the Believers said: I never saw anyone who more closely resembled the Messenger of Allah in bearing, dignity and conduct, and the way in which she stood and sat, than Fatimah the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (lettings and peace of Allah be upon him). Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3762), who said: This is a hasan sahih hadith. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nThe words translated above as dignity, bearing and conduct are close in meaning; they refer to outward appearance, conduct, being at ease with oneself, and so on. See: ‘Awn al-Ma‘bud (14/87).\nIt is as if she was referring to what could be seen of a person’s humbleness and humility towards Allah, and what he may possess of dignity, calm, a good attitude and gentle speech.\"(Mirqat al-Mafatih Sharh Mishkat al-Masabih  7/2969).\nSee also the answer to question no. 179497 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In discussing the ruling on likening someone to the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), it's essential to understand the status of the Companions (Sahabah) within Islamic tradition and the implications of such comparisons.\n\n### Status of the Companions\n\n1. **Belief and Devotion**: The Companions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) are esteemed as the first to accept Islam, providing unwavering support to the Prophet during his mission. This merits a special respect in Islam, as highlighted in Surah Al-Ahzab (33:6):\n   > \"The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are (as) their mothers. And those of blood-relationships are closer to one another in the decree of Allah than (other) believers and the emigrants, except that you may do good to your friends...\" (Al-Ahzab 33:6).\n\n2. **Examples of Good Character**: The Companions displayed exemplary behavior and faithfulness to Islamic teachings. Their understanding and application of Islam have set a standard for subsequent generations. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:55) emphasizes the importance of true companionship:\n   > \"Your only allies are Allah and His Messenger and those who have believed...\" (Al-Ma'idah 5:55).\n\n3. **Avoiding Negative Comparisons**: When likening contemporary individuals to the Companions, one must tread carefully. The Companions of the Prophet are unique in their experiences and sacrifices. Any derogatory comparison can undermine their esteemed status in Islam.\n\n### Ruling on Comparisons\n\n1. **Respect and Caution**: Comparisons made in the context of good behavior and dedication to God can be acceptable, as long as it is clear that it is an ideal to strive toward, not an absolute equivalence. For instance, one could say that someone shows qualities akin to the patience of Job or the faith of Abu Bakr, not claiming that they hold the same status. Surah Ali 'Imran (3:79) advises caution in leadership and authority:\n   > \"...It is not for a mortal to whom Allah has given the Book and judgment and prophethood that he should say to the people, 'Be my worshippers besides Allah.' Rather, (he should say), 'Be devoted servants of your Lord because of what you teach of the Scripture and because of what you study.'\" (Ali ‘Imran 3:79).\n\n2. **Unique Position of the Companions**: It is crucial to highlight the irreducible nature of what the Companions achieved. Any individual today doesn’t possess the same role or the direct relationship they had with the Prophet. Surah An-Nisa (4:48) underscores the gravity of associating others with the unique status of prophethood and divine guidance:\n   > \"Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating others with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills.\" (An-Nisa 4:48).\n\n3. **Unity and Brotherhood**: It’s important to focus on the underlying message of unity and brotherhood in Islam, as described in Al-Ahzab (33:4):\n   > \"Allah has not made for a man two hearts in his interior...call them by [the name of] their fathers.\" (Al-Ahzab 33:4).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while it may be well-intentioned to liken someone to the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in terms of their virtues or contributions to Islam, such comparisons should be made with caution and respect, recognizing the unique status of the Sahabah and their unmatched contributions to the early Muslim community. The essence of the guidance from the Qur'an reflects a balance of appreciation for moral qualities while maintaining the distinguished position of the Prophet and his companions in the Islamic faith."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt was narrated by an-Nasaa’i in as-Sunan al-Kubra (11067) and in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah (308), and by at-Taaraani in ad-Du‘aa’ (1912) that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never sat in any gathering, or recited Quran, or offered any prayer, but he concluded that with certain words. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I see that you never sit in a gathering, or recite Quran, or offer any prayer, but you conclude it with these words. He said: “Yes. Whoever spoke good words, that will be like a seal on what he did of good and whoever spoke ill, it will be an expiation for him: “Subhaanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika, laa ilaaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk (Glory and praise be to you, O Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You).”\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (3164).\nIn this hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained that the dhikr of expiation for a gathering should be said at the end of any gathering in which a man sits, whether it was a gathering of dhikr or a gathering in which there was some ill or idle talk, for if it was a gathering of dhikr, it will be a seal on it for him.\nAs-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant is that it will be an affirmation of what he did of good, and will raise his deed to such a level that Allah will accept it, and it will like a guarantee that it will not be rejected, and if it was otherwise, then it will be an expiation for him. See: Mir‘aat al-Mafaateeh (8/204).\nBased on that, it is mustahabb for the Muslim to end any gathering with these words, no matter what kind of gathering it was. If it was a gathering to read Quran or to offer a prayer, or he sat with his friends, or with his family members, or to reconcile between people, or any other gathering, then he wants to leave, he should recite this dhikr just before he gets up to leave, then he should get up.\nSecondly:\nThere is no proven supplication specifically for completing the Quran, neither this supplication nor any other. From what has been explained above, it is clear that this dhikr and du‘aa’ is not specifically for completing the Quran or anything else; rather it is general and may be recited in any gathering.\nHowever, the scholars have stated that it is mustahabb to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. An-Nawawi said: It is strongly encouraged (mustahabb)  to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. At-Tibyaan fi Aadaab Hamlat al-Quran (159).\nIbn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (2/126): It is mustahabb to gather one’s family and others when completing the Quran to listen to the supplication.\nAhmad said: When Anas completed the Quran, he would gather his family and his children.\nThat was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood and others.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 65581 and 37683 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, supplication (dua) after reciting the Quran is considered a commendable practice. It is a means for the believer to seek closeness to Allah, ask for guidance, forgiveness, and help in various aspects of life. There are several Quranic verses that emphasize the importance of supplication, humility, and the connection between prayer and the awareness of the divine.\n\n### Key Reasons for Supplication After Reciting the Quran:\n\n1. **Acknowledgment of Allah's Presence and Mercy**:\n   The Quran emphasizes that true believers are those who bow and prostrate to Allah, expressing their humility and soliciting His mercy. This can be noted in Surah As-Sajdah (32:15-16):\n\n   > \"Only they believe in Our revelations who, when they are reminded, bow in adoration, and give praise to their Lord, and do not become arrogant. Their backs do not rest on their beds, and they pray to their Lord in fear and hope, and spend of what We have given them (in charity).\"  \n   (Surah As-Sajdah, 32:15-16)\n\n   This verse highlights that true faith involves active worship and supplication, reinforcing a posture of humility before Allah.\n\n2. **The Purpose of Reciting Quran**:\n   The Quran itself is described as a guidance, and individuals are encouraged to be mindful of its teachings. In Surah Al-Isra (17:108), it is stated:\n\n   > \"And weeping they kneel down, and this increases their humility. Say: 'Call Him Allah or call Him Ar-Rahman; whatever the name you call Him by, all His names are beautiful.'\"  \n   (Surah Al-Isra, 17:109)\n\n   After reciting the Quran, which is filled with divine wisdom, it is fitting to engage in supplication to express gratitude and seek guidance.\n\n3. **Invitation to Reflect and Call Upon Allah**:\n   Surah Al-A'raf (7:204) instructs believers to listen attentively when the Quran is recited, implying the importance of reflection and supplication:\n\n   > \"When the Qur'an is recited listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.\"  \n   (Surah Al-A'raf, 7:204)\n\n   This command underscores the seriousness of the occasion and the necessity for a response through prayer and supplication.\n\n4. **Spiritual Connection and Reward**: \n   It is reported in various Hadith literature (though not quoted in your provided verses) that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) encouraged the act of supplication, particularly after prayer and recitation of the Quran. Muslims are urged to ask for their needs and to be persistent in their supplications, reflecting their reliance on Allah’s mercy.\n\n5. **Model of the Prophets**: \n   Many of the Quranic narratives about the prophets illustrate instances where supplication was integral to their communication with Allah. For example, upon receiving His guidance or after significant moments, they would fervently supplicate.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe practice of making supplications after reciting the Quran is a meaningful way for Muslims to connect with Allah, express their needs, and reflect on the teachings of the Quran. Believers are encouraged to be not only listeners of the divine message but also active participants in a dialogue through their prayers, thereby enriching their spiritual lives. \n\nBy engaging in supplication, one embodies the essence of humility and recognition of Allah's sovereignty, as reinforced throughout the Quran."

        "question": "How can we reconcile between the idea of competing in doing good and loving good for others?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nPart of the practice of the Muslim that Allah, may He be exalted, and His Messenger taught him is the importance of brotherhood among the believers, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): “The believers are but brothers” [al-Hujuraat 49:10].\nThere is no contradiction between the verse (interpretation of the meaning) “So for this let the competitors compete” [al-Mutaffifeen 83:26] and what is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “No one of you truly believes until he loves for his brother – or for his neighbour – what he loves for himself.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (13) and Muslim (45).\nThe scholars have several views with regard to dispelling this apparent contradiction:\n1- That the hadith has to do with matters of this world and the verse has to do with matters of the hereafter. See: Saheeh Muslim bi Sharh al-Abi wa’s-Sanoosi (1/244).\n2- It was said that what is meant by that is loving good in general terms, but not in a specific or detailed way such as a person may seek for himself. Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If it is said: How can this be imagined when everyone wants to be ahead of others with regard to what he chooses for himself, and he loves to surpass others in virtues, and ‘Umar competed with Abu Bakr? The answer is: that what is meant is to wish for good for them in general terms and wish that evil be warded off from them in general terms. The individual should love that for his brother as he loves it for himself. As for excelling in some specific virtue and attaining a high level of some specific characteristic, there is nothing wrong with the individual wanting to surpass others in that regard.\nEnd quote from Kashf al-Mushkil min Hadith as-Saheehayn (3/222). See also: al-Qabas Sharh al-Muwatta’ by Ibn al-‘Arabi (929) and al-Masaalik Sharh al-Muwatta’ (6/406-417).\n3- This is a command to compete in doing more acts of worship, which will prompt others to join him and compete in doing good and righteous deeds. However, the hadith is general in meaning and includes matters of both this world and the hereafter. Hence the believer does not dislike others to join him in that; rather he loves for all people to join him in that competition and urges them to do so. This is a sign that he is very sincere towards people of faith.\nIbn Rajab said in Jaami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam (1/327-335):\nThe point is that this is one of the characteristics of faith that one is obliged to have: the individual should love for his believing brother what he loves for himself, and hate for him what he hates for himself. If he fails to attain that, then his faith is undermined.\nAll of this can only be achieved if one’s heart is sound and free of rancour, insincerity and envy, for envy makes the envier hate to see anyone excel him in any good characteristic, or even equal him in it, because he wants to stand out among the people in his virtues, and be distinct from them. But faith requires the opposite of that, which is that all believers should share in what Allah has granted him of good, without that detracting from what he has.\nIn general, the believer should love for the believers what he loves for himself, and hate for them what he hates for himself. If he sees any shortcoming in his brother in terms of religious commitment, he should strive to advise him.\nNevertheless, the believer should feel sad if he misses out on any religious virtue. Therefore he is instructed, with regard to issues of religious commitment, to look at those who are above him and to strive to compete in increasing in that as much as he can, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):  “So for this let the competitors compete” [al-Mutaffifeen 83:26]. He should not resent it if anyone shares his virtues with him; rather he should like all people to compete in that, and should urge them to do so. This is a sign that he has attained perfect sincerity towards his brothers.\nAl-Fudayl said: If you love for people to be like you, then you are not being sincere towards your brother. So how about if you want them to be inferior to you in that regard?\nThis indicates that being sincere towards all believers means that you like them to be better than you. This is a high level and lofty degree of sincerity, but that is not obligatory. Rather what is enjoined in Islamic teachings is that you should love for them to be like you, yet if someone surpasses you in some religious virtue, you should strive to catch up with him and feel sad for falling short or falling behind those who have surpassed you – not out of envy for what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has given them by His grace , but because you are competing with them, and because you wish to attain what they have attained, without any ill-feeling towards them, and because you feel sad because of your falling behind and failing to attain the same level as those who have surpassed you.\nThe believer should always think of himself as falling short and not attaining high ranks. He will benefit from that in two important ways: striving to attain those virtues and increase in that, and regarding himself with dissatisfaction. That will result in him loving for the believers to be better than him, because he does not want them to be just like him. He will also be discontent with himself as he is, and will strive to better himself. Muhammad ibn Waasi‘ said to his son: As for your father, may Allah not increase his ilk among the Muslims.\nIf someone is not content with himself as he is, how can he wish for the Muslims to be like him, if he is sincere towards them? Rather he should love for the Muslims to be better than him, and he should love for himself to be better than he is.\nEnd quote.

        "predicted_answer": "Reconciling the concepts of competing in doing good (ijtihad) and loving good for others in Islam involves an understanding of intentions, community, and personal responsibility. The Quran provides guidance on how both can coexist harmoniously.\n\n### Competing in Good Deeds\n\nThe Quran emphasizes the importance of striving and competing in good deeds. This notion is clearly articulated in Surah Al-Baqarah, where Allah encourages believers to rush towards forgiveness and a paradise vast as the heavens and the earth:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:148)**: \"And for all there is a direction to which he turns; so race to good deeds. Wherever you may be, Allah will bring you all together on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, Allah over all things is Competent.\"\n\nThis verse highlights the necessity of directing competition towards positive actions and good deeds. It encourages believers not only to act righteously but to do so with a sense of urgency and enthusiasm.\n\n### Loving Good for Others\n\nIn Islam, loving good for others is a fundamental aspect of faith. Believers are taught to wish for others what they wish for themselves:\n\n- **Surah Al-Anfal (8:61)**: “And if they incline to peace, then incline to it and put your trust in Allah. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing.”\n\nThis mandate for peace and goodwill extends beyond mere tolerance to an active desire for the welfare of others. The Quran frames this as a duty of faith.\n\n### Integration of the Concepts\n\nThe relationship between competing in good deeds and loving goodness for others is underpinned by the intention behind actions. When believers compete in doing good, it should reflect a sincere desire to benefit the community and promote goodness overall:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:261)**: \"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed of grain that sprouts seven ears; in every ear is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allah is All-Encompassing and Knowing.\"\n\nThis verse illustrates how individual efforts to do good not only benefit oneself but can also yield multiplied blessings for the entire community. When one competes to do good, the intent should be to elevate the community, thus intertwining personal ambition in good deeds with love for others' welfare.\n\n### Warning Against Hypocrisy\n\nHowever, the Quran cautions against hypocrisy that can arise in acts of charity or goodness when intentions are not pure:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:264-265)**: \"O believers, do not nullify your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury, as does one who spends his wealth to be seen by the people and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. His example is like a large rock upon which is a layer of soil; then a downpour strikes it, leaving it bare...\"\n\nThis emphasizes that the act of doing good should be genuine; competing in good should not be for show but for the sake of Allah and the benefit of others.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the reconciliation between competing in doing good and loving good for others lies in the intention and the understanding that genuine efforts in goodness have communal benefits. Striving to excel in goodness enhances one’s spiritual status while also contributing positively to society. Thus, personal ambition and communal love can coexist, leading to a harmonic balance upheld by sincere intentions. This comprehensive approach captures the essence of Islamic teaching on good deeds and communal welfare."

        "question": "How can he make seeking Allah’s pleasure – and not seeking people’s pleasure – his main concern?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The greatest goal a believer can pursue is seeking the pleasure of the Lord of the Worlds.\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence; but approval from Allah is greater. It is that which is the great attainment” [at-Tawbah 9:72].\nIt was narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (6549) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (2829) that Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to the people of Paradise: ‘O people of Paradise!’ They will say: ‘Here we are at Your service, our Lord.’ He will say: ‘Are you pleased?’ They will say: ‘How could we not be pleased, O Lord, when You have given us that which You have not given to anyone else among Your creation?’ He will say: ‘Shall I not give you something even better than that?’ They will say: ‘O Lord, what can be better than that?’ He will say: ‘I bestow My pleasure upon you and I will never be angry with you after that.’”\nThe main goal of the believer’s life is that he seeks the pleasure of Allah alone, with no partner or associate, even if that displeases people. The sign of the hypocrites is that they are keen to please people, even if that angers the Lord of the Worlds.\nAllah says regarding the hypocrites (interpretation of the meaning): “They swear by Allah to you [Muslims] to satisfy you. But Allah and His Messenger are more worthy for them to satisfy, if they should be believers” [at-Tawbah 9:62].\nThings that will help a person to seek the pleasure of Allah alone include the following:\nFirstly: Learning about his Lord, so that he will be certain that all things are in His hand, and He alone is the One Who controls all things; He alone is the One Who brings low and raises high; He alone is the One Who grants honour and humiliates; no one can withhold what He gives and no one can give what He withholds; all people have no power to benefit or harm him or themselves, or to cause death, give life or anything else.\nOnce a person believes in that with certainty, his heart will be attached to his Lord, because he believes that people cannot benefit him except by his Lord’s leave, and they cannot harm him except by his Lord’s leave alone.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Know that if the nation were to come together to benefit you with something, they would not benefit you except with something that Allah has already decreed for you, and if they were to come together to harm you with something, they would not harm you except with something that Allah has already decreed for you.”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi in his Sunan (2516); classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (5/497).\nSecondly: being certain that people’s loving him and being pleased with him only happens with the permission of his Lord, so if he pleases his Lord, He will instill love for him in the hearts of His believing slaves.\nAt-Tirmidhi narrated in his Sunan (3267) that al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah, if I praise someone then he is praiseworthy, and if I criticize someone then he is blameworthy. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “That is only for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.”\nThis hadith was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi (2605).\nAllah alone is the One Who, if He praises someone, then he is praiseworthy, and if He is angry with someone and criticizes him, then he is blameworthy. As for people, they have no power in that regard except by Allah’s leave.\nIn the hadith it says that it is Allah Who instills love or hate of someone in people’s hearts.\nIt was narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (3209) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (2637) that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah loves a person, He calls Jibreel and says: ‘I love So and so, so love him.’ So Jibreel loves him, then he calls out to the people of heaven, ‘Allah loves So and so, so love him.’ So the people of heaven love him and he finds acceptance on earth. If Allah hates  someone, He calls Jibreel and says: ‘I hate So and so, so hate him.’ So Jibreel hates him, then he calls out to the people of heaven: ‘Allah hates So and so, so hate him.’ So they hate him and he is hated on earth.”\nThirdly: being certain that focusing on pleasing people and not the Lord of the Worlds is a sign of failure, and the one who does that will end up blameworthy, with no one to praise him; Allah will abandon him and he will have no one to support him. But if he seeks to please Allah alone, Allah will suffice him and he will have no need of people.\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Do not make [as equal] with Allah another deity and [thereby] become censured and forsaken” [al-Isra’ 17:22].\nIbn Hibbaan narrated in his Saheeh (277) from ‘Aa’ishah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever pleases Allah by angering the people, Allah will suffice him, but whoever angers Allah by pleasing the people, Allah will leave him to the people.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (2311).\nLook at Ka‘b ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) and how his focus was on speaking the truth and pleasing Allah alone, because he believed that Allah would suffice him if he spoke the truth, and that if his main concern was to avoid angering the people by telling lies, then Allah would soon cause people to be angry with him.\nKa‘b (may Allah be pleased with him) said, in the story of his repentance, that he said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Indeed, by Allah, if I sat before anyone in this world other than you, I would have saved myself from his anger with an excuse, for I have been given the ability to argue persuasively, but by Allah, I know that if I were to tell you a lie today that you accepted, soon Allah would make you angry with me, but if I tell you the truth today that may make you upset with me, then I hope that Allah will pardon me. No, by Allah, I had no excuse. By Allah, I was never stronger or more well off than when I stayed behind and did not accompany you [on the campaign to Tabook]. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “As for this one, he has spoken the truth. Get up and leave until Allah decides concerning you.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (4418) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (2769).\nFourthly: knowing that there is no way to please people, for man is basically unfair and ignorant, and pleasing people is a target that cannot be achieved, for people are not even pleased with their Lord, so how can you think that they will be pleased with you?!\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated in az-Zuhd al-Kabeer (180) with a saheeh isnaad from al-Hasan al-Basri that it was said to him: People come to your gathering to pick on any error you may make, so that they can make it a reason to gossip about you. He said: Do not worry about it, for I thought of the pleasure of being close to Allah and I hope for that; I thought of Paradise and I hope for that; I thought of al-hoor al-‘een and I hope for that; I thought of being safe from people, and I found no way to achieve that. When I saw that people are not pleased with their Creator, I realized that they will never be pleased with a created being like themselves.\nAsh-Shaafi‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said to Yoonus ibn ‘Abd al-A‘la: O Abu Moosa, if you were to strive your utmost to please all the people, there is no way to do that. As that is the case, then make your deeds and your intention sincerely for Allah (may He be glorified and exalted) alone.\nNarrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan (6518).\nSo let each person’s main concern be to seek the pleasure of his Lord alone, for if He is pleased, that is sufficient for you.\nLet your slogan in life and your main concern before the Lord of the worlds be as the poet said:\nI hope that my relationship with You is sweeter and life is bitter; I hope that You are pleased and that people are angry.\nI hope that what is between You and me is in order, and that what is between me and people is in ruins.\nIf You love me then everything else is insignificant, and everyone on earth is as dust.\nWith regard to books, we do not know of any book that has been written specifically about this topic, but we advise the questioner and all Muslims to learn more about Allah, for the more a person comes to know about his Lord, the more his concern will be on seeking the pleasure of his Lord alone, and he will not worry about the displeasure of people.\nOne excellent book on this topic is an-Nahj al-Asma fi Sharh Asma’ Allah al-Husna, by Dr. Muhammad al-Humood an-Najdi.\nWe also advise you to read widely in the books of Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali and Ibn al-Qayyim, for their words on this topic are among the most beneficial.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Focusing on seeking Allah's pleasure rather than the pleasure of people is a fundamental principle in Islamic teachings. It encourages believers to align their actions and intentions toward fulfilling the will of Allah, which leads to true happiness and success both in this life and the hereafter. Here’s how believers can make seeking Allah’s pleasure their main concern, supported by relevant Quranic verses.\n\n### 1. **Understanding the Nature of Sincerity in Worship**\nBelievers are taught to perform acts of worship and good deeds sincerely for the sake of Allah. The Quran emphasizes that deeds done to show off to others or to gain their approval are empty of true reward:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:264)**: \"O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury, as one who spends his wealth only to be seen by the people. And he does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. So his example is like that of a smooth stone upon which is dust and is struck by a downpour, so it leaves it bare. They are unable to keep anything of what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.\"\n\nThis verse highlights the importance of intention in actions and warns against showing off.\n\n### 2. **Seeking Knowledge and Understanding**\nEngaging in the pursuit of knowledge is critical in understanding how to please Allah. Knowledge helps one differentiate between right and wrong:\n\n- **Surah Al-Furqan (25:57)**: \"Say, 'I do not ask of you for it any reward, nor am I of the pretentious.'\"\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized sincerity in seeking knowledge and acting upon it, which ultimately should be for the sake of Allah.\n\n### 3. **Focusing on the Hereafter**\nTrue believers recognize the temporary nature of this life and strive for what is eternal. They understand that seeking worldly pleasures can lead them away from Allah:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:201-202)**: \"And among them are some who say, 'Our Lord, give us in this world.' And they have no share in the Hereafter. But among them are some who say, 'Our Lord, grant us good in this world and good in the Hereafter and save us from the punishment of the Fire.' It is those for whom there is a portion that is determined.\"\n\n### 4. **Avoiding Materialism**\nBelievers are urged to not covet what others have, as it can distract them from remembering Allah:\n\n- **Surah Taha (20:131)**: \"And do not covet what We have given some of them to enjoy, nor grieve over them. And lower your wings to the believers who follow you.\"\n\nThis verse serves as a reminder that material possessions are not the ultimate goal.\n\n### 5. **Perseverance in Trials**\nThe Quran assures believers that they will face trials, but those who remain steadfast and continue to seek Allah’s pleasure will be rewarded:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:155-156)**: \"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient, who, when disaster strikes them, say, 'Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.'\"\n\n### 6. **Placing Trust in Allah**\nBelievers need to have complete trust in Allah's wisdom and plan, which keeps them focused on seeking His pleasure rather than the approval of people:\n\n- **Surah Al-Furqan (25:58)**: \"And rely upon the Ever-Living who does not die and exalt Him with His praise. And sufficient is He to be Aware of the sins of His servants.\"\n\n### 7. **Correcting Intentions**\nSeeking Allah’s pleasure also requires regular self-reflection on one’s intentions:\n\n- **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:10)**: \"Indeed, the plotting of Satan is weak.\"\n\nBy placing trust in Allah and ensuring that all actions are directed towards earning His pleasure, believers can dispel doubts that may arise from seeking social approval.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn essence, making seeking Allah’s pleasure the main concern requires sincere worship, continuous education, a focus on the hereafter, avoidance of materialism, perseverance through trials, trust in Allah, and correcting one’s intentions. This is the path that leads not only to personal fulfillment but is aligned with the ultimate goal of achieving closeness to Allah and success in both worlds. The Quran serves as a guide in every step along this path, reiterating the importance of sincerity and understanding the transient nature of worldly life."

        "question": "Between habit and worship",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nHabit is a neutral concept, so it is a good thing if a person gets used to doing good and to being steadfast when doing it, without finding it burdensome. It was narrated in the hadith: “Doing good is a habit [that one may acquire easily] and evil is stubbornness [and man persists in it only out of stubbornness].” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (221) and by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh (310).\nIt was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that she said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had a reed mat with which he used to make a booth at night and pray in it, and the people started to follow his prayer, and he used to spread (that mat) out during the day. One night they gathered and he said: “O people, you should only do deeds that you are able for, for Allah does not grow weary but you do. The most beloved of deeds to Allah is that which is done persistently, even if it is little.” And if the family of Muhammad started to do something, they would persist in it. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5861) and Muslim (782).\nAs Abu’t-Tayyib said: Each person will gain of his life that which becomes a habit for him.\nIt is well-known that one of the greatest means of a person becoming steadfast in his journey towards Allah is having acts of worship to which he commits himself, remains steadfast in doing them, and becomes accustomed to doing them, and he does not neglect them, become heedless concerning them or feel too lazy to do them. This was always the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); in other words, he would do them constantly and persistently. And if his family did something, they would persist in it.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to habit in the sense that a person does not have presence of mind when doing an act of worship, so he does it automatically, with no spirit or focus, that is something very dangerous, and he should be concerned about that.\nThe reward for worship is connected to presence of mind and humility whilst doing it, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Certainly will the believers have succeeded:\nThey who are during their prayer humbly submissive”\n[al-Mu’minoon 23:1-2].\nIt is very important that the heart should be focused when doing an act of worship, and not be distracted from it.\nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nI have read some advice in a book which says: do not make worship a habit. How can a Muslim make worship of Allah truly for Allah, and not a mere habit? May Allah reward you with good.\nHe replied:\nWhat is meant is: do not do the prayer as a habit; pray as an act of worship so that you may draw closer to Allah thereby, and not because it is a habit that you have got used to. If you pray Duha, then pray it for the purpose of drawing closer to Allah, not because it is a habit. By the same token, if you pray tahajjud at night, pray it because it is an act of worship and obedience, not because it is merely a habit or because your father or mother used to do it.\nThirdly:\nAmong the things that may help one to attain focus of mind when doing acts of worship are the following:\n1. Variation in acts of worship. The individual should do a variety of acts of worship, including prayer, reading Qur’an, dhikr, giving charity, honouring his parents, upholding ties of kinship, visiting the sick and attending funerals. By the mercy and grace of Allah, acts of worship are many and varied.\n2. Persistence in keeping the intention in mind when doing the acts of worship.\nIbn al-Qayyim said in ‘Umdat as-Saabireen (60-65):\n… Being persistent whilst doing the good deed, so the person should persist in warding off any shortcomings or negligence in the action. He should persist in keeping his intention in mind and continue to be focused when standing before his Lord, and not be absent-minded when carrying out His command. What matters is not only doing what is enjoined; rather what matters above all is not forgetting the One Who enjoined it when doing what He enjoined. Rather he should persist in remembering Him whilst carrying out His command.\nThis is the worship of the true and sincere slaves of Allah. It requires patience and perseverance in order to be able to do acts of worship in the proper manner, by performing the act with all of its essential, obligatory and Sunnah parts. It also requires persevering in remembering the One Whom he is worshipping when doing that act of worship, and not letting himself be distracted from that by his worship. So his presence of mind with Allah should not distract him from carrying out the physical actions of the act of worship properly, and focusing on doing the physical actions in the proper manner should not distract him from presence of mind when standing before Allah, may He be glorified. End quote.\n3. Striving hard in du‘aa’ (supplication).\nThis is one of the greatest means that help one to keep in mind the fact that Allah is with him and is helping His slave.\n4. Not giving up acts of worship.\nThat is one of the means by which the Shaytaan discourages a person from doing acts of worship, on the grounds that he is not able to focus. So let the believer be aware of that, and let him continue to do the acts of worship.\n5. Preparing oneself for a particular act of worship and getting ready for it, and keeping away from anything that may distract him from it.\nIt was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray when food has been served and do not pray when resisting the urge to relieved oneself.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (89).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "**Title: Between Habit and Worship in Islam**\n\nIn Islam, the distinction between habit and worship is crucial for understanding the concept of faith and practice. Worship (Ibadah) is an act of devotion dedicated to God, while habits can sometimes become routine actions devoid of spiritual significance. The Qur'an emphasizes the necessity of understanding and intention behind our actions, reminding believers that true worship must involve sincerity and recognition of God's sovereignty.\n\n### Key Differentiations:\n\n1. **Intention (Niyyah)**:\n   - Central to distinguishing habit from worship is the intention behind the action. Actions performed with the intention of seeking God’s pleasure are considered acts of worship. For example, the verse:\n     - “When My devotees enquire of you about Me, I am near, and answer the call of every supplicant when he calls. It behoves them to hearken to Me and believe in Me that they may follow the right path.” (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:186)\n   - Here, the emphasis is on the engagement in worship with conscious intention and authenticity.\n\n2. **Sincerity in Worship**:\n   - Worship must be exclusive to Allah alone, without duplicity or polytheism. For instance:\n     - “And when God will ask: 'O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to mankind: 'Worship me and my mother as two deities apart from God?'” (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:116)\n   - This verse highlights that true worship focuses solely on God and not on any created beings.\n\n3. **Reverence and Action**:\n   - Believers should embody worship in their actions, maintaining respect for the rituals embodied in Islam. The Qur'an often encourages charitable actions, prayers, and good deeds as forms of worship:\n     - “So observe your devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey the Apostle so that you may be shown mercy.” (Surah An-Nur, 24:56)\n   - Actions taken out of habit need to be injected with reverence and a desire to please Allah.\n\n4. **Guidance on Righteousness**:\n   - The Qur'an urges believers to act righteously and to help one another in good deeds, transcending habitual behavior:\n     - “But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God. Surely God is severe in punishment.” (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:2)\n   - This portrayal allows believers to reflect on whether their actions are driven by faith or merely repeated out of necessity.\n\n5. **Accountability and Reward**:\n   - The Qur'an assures believers that every individual will be judged according to their deeds:\n     - “Surely your Lord will reward everyone in accordance with his deeds. He is certainly aware of all they do.” (Surah Hud, 11:111)\n   - Understanding accountability can motivate individuals to shift their habits toward worshipful actions that earn divine reward.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn Islam, the transition from habit to worship is facilitated by the intention behind actions and the pursuit of sincerity. Believers are encouraged to reflect on their routine practices and ensure they align with the principles of faith, understanding the vital importance of their connection with God. This prompts individuals to elevate their habits into acts of worship fueled by intention, devotion, and a commitment to live a righteous life, ultimately acknowledging that God’s grace and mercy await those who do so. \n\nThe verses cited serve as reminders of the need for intentional worship, the exclusivity of devotion to God, and the rewards that come from genuine acts of faith."

        "question": "He is heedless about sins, on the grounds that the Sahaabah also committed sins",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Such talk stems from the deceit of the Shaytaan, by means of which he makes sins seem insignificant to people, so that they will get carried away in sin and not repent from it.\nThis notion is false on several counts:\n-1- The perfect example for the Muslim is the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often” [al-Ahzaab 33:21].\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis verse is an important principle, which is following the example of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his words, deeds and character. Hence Allah commanded the people to follow the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the day of al-Ahzaab, in terms of his patience, steadfastness, perseverance, striving in jihad and awaiting help and support from his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and may Allah send blessings and peace upon him constantly until the Day of Judgement.\nEnd quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer (6/391).\nBy the same token, we must adhere to what he brought of commands and prohibitions.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from. And fear Allah ; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty” [al-Hashr 59:7].\nWhoever goes against his prohibitions has failed to achieve the level of piety (taqwa) that is required of him, and he has exposed himself to the punishment of Allah, may He be exalted.\n-2- The Muslim is enjoined to follow the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) in their good deeds, and not otherwise.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and those who followed them with good conduct - Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment” [at-Tawbah 9:100].\nMuhammad ibn Ka‘b al-Qurazi said:\n“and those who followed them with good conduct” – this is an condition that is required of those who follow them, which is that they should follow them in their good deeds and not their bad deeds. End quote.\nSee: ad-Durr al-Manthoor (4/272) and Tafseer al-Baghawi (4/88).\nSo the Muslim should strive to follow the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) in their good deeds, so that he may be included among the people mentioned in the verse quoted above. As for any errors that they (may Allah be pleased with them) made, we are not enjoined to follow them in that.\nAmong the good deeds of theirs in which the Muslim should follow their example is the fact that if they made any mistakes, they would hasten to repent, and their repentance was so great and sincere that Allah erased their sins thereby. The hadiths that speak of that are very well known, such as the repentance of Maa‘iz and of the Ghaamidi woman (may Allah be pleased with them).\nSo the Muslim should strive to obey Allah, may He be exalted, and to keep away from disobeying Him. Then if he slips up, he must hasten to repent sincerely and not try to excuse himself by referring to the mistakes made by some of the Sahaabah, because they would repent and they would not persist in sin.\n-3- Even though some of the Sahaabah committed some major sins, that did not happen very often; in fact it was rare. In most cases, they (may Allah be pleased with them) adhered to the command of Allah and strove hard to attain His pleasure. So why would this person referred to in the question ignore what was usually the case with the actions of the Sahaabah, and try to use that which rarely happened as an excuse?\nMoreover, if he is sincere, then let him do what they did: they used to hasten to repent, and they did not persist in sin, as noted above.\nThen let him follow the example of the one who surrendered her life for the sake of Allah, and [admitted the sin of adultery] so that the hadd punishment would be carried out on her.\nThen let him follow their example with regard to worship, attitude, effort, striving, acts of charity, fasting and voluntary prayers at night.\nIn his attitude and actions, let this poor man strive to emulate the attitude and actions of the Sahaabah.\nThen let him see, in that case, whether the Shaytaan will try to entice him with such notions!\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the notion that one can become heedless about sins by citing that the Sahaabah (companions of the Prophet Muhammad) also committed sins, it is essential to explore the conceptual understanding of sin, repentance, accountability, and the nature of those who are faithful in Islam, as highlighted in the Qur'an.\n\n### Understanding Sin and Repentance \n\n1. **Accountability for Actions**: \n   The Qur'an emphasizes that every individual is accountable for their actions, and no one can make excuses based on others' behavior. In Surah At-Tawbah (9:66-70), Allah warns the hypocrites and those who turn away from faith after believing. It states:\n   > \"Do not make excuses: You turned unbelievers after having come to faith. If We pardon a section of you (for being frivolous), We shall punish the other for being guilty (of deliberate sin).\" (9:66)\n   \n   This passage illustrates that acknowledging one’s sins and not making excuses when they are evidenced is crucial for one’s standing before God.\n\n2. **The Nature of Sin**:\n   In Surah An-Nisa (4:48), it is mentioned that:\n   > \"God does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to Him, though He may forgive aught else if He please.\" (4:48)\n   \n   Associating partners with God is portrayed as gravely sinful, emphasizing the significance of upholding the principle of Tawheed (the oneness of God).\n\n3. **Perpetual Forgiveness**:\n   The Qur'an, however, also conveys the message of hope for sinners, indicating that ultimate forgiveness is available for those who repent sincerely. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:39) states:\n   > \"But those who repent after a crime and reform, shall be forgiven by God, for God is forgiving and kind.\" (5:39)\n   \n   This reinforces the expectation of turning back to God rather than being complacent in sin because others, even revered figures, have sinned.\n\n### The Position of the Sahaabah\n\n1. **Infallibility**:\n   While Sahaabah indeed made mistakes, they were known for their commitment to seeking forgiveness and striving for righteousness. They embraced repentance and accountability profoundly. The Qur’an underscores that:\n   > \"He who earns the wages of sin does so for himself; and God is aware of everything.\" (4:111) (4:111)\n   \n   This indicates personal responsibility, regardless of historical context.\n\n2. **Importance of Reform**:\n   Repentance is a continuous journey. Surah An-Nisa (4:112-116) speaks on the consequences of ascribing blame unjustly and reminds believers of the mercy of God. The Qur'an reinforces the mercy of God towards those who sincerely seek to reform:\n   > \"Great have been the blessings of God on you. Their confidential counsels are seldom for the good...\" (4:114) \n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while it is true that the Sahaabah were human and capable of sin, relying on their transgressions as a justification for neglecting one’s own sins stands in contrast to Islamic teachings of accountability and the pursuit of righteous conduct. Both the Qur’an and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad advocate for sincere repentance, personal responsibility, and a continuous effort towards moral integrity, rather than complacency in sin. The pursuit of righteousness is a personal duty that transcends the behavior of others, including respected historical figures. Thus, it is imperative for a believer not to fall into heedlessness but to maintain vigilance over their actions and continuously seek forgiveness from God."

        "question": "Holding fast to Allah and His religion",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The ‘holding fast” that is mentioned in the Qur’an is of two types: holding fast to Allah, and holding fast to the rope of Allah.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:103]\n“and hold fast to Allah. He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper”\n[al-Hajj 22:78].\nImam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nI‘tisaam (holding fast) means adhering to that which will protect you and will ward off from you that which you dread and fear. ‘Ismah means protection and i‘tisaam means seeking protection. Hence fortresses are called ‘awaasim (sing. ‘aasimah) because they give protection and safety.\nWell-being and happiness in this world and the hereafter are based on holding fast to Allah and holding fast to His rope. There is no salvation except for the one who adheres to these two means of protection.\nWith regard to holding fast to His rope, it protects one from going astray.\nHolding fast to Him protects one from doom and destruction, for the one who is journeying towards Allah is like one who is travelling on a path towards his intended destination. Hence he needs guidance on the road and he needs to be safe whilst travelling; he cannot reach his intended destination except after attaining these two things.\nThe guide will protect him from losing his way, and will guide him to the right path; and equipment, physical strength and weapons will help him to be safe from bandits and any other troubles he may encounter on the road.\nSo holding fast to the rope of Allah will lead him on the path of guidance and help him to follow the guide.\nHolding fast to Allah will give him the strength, equipment, weapons and anything else that he will need [to protect himself] on his journey.\nHence the salaf [early generations] used a variety of phrases to explain what is meant by holding fast to the rope of Allah, even though these phrases all refer to the same idea.\nIbn ‘Abbaas said: Adhere to the religion of Allah.\nIbn Mas‘ood said: It is the jamaa‘ah (main body of the Muslims). And he said: You should adhere to the jamaa‘ah, for it is the rope of Allah that He has enjoined us to hold fast to. What you may find of things you dislike when you are with the jamaa‘ah is better than what you may find of things you like when you are scattered.\nMujaahid and ‘Ataa’ said: It means adhering to the covenant of Allah. Qataadah, as-Saddi and many of the scholars of tafseer said: It means adhering to the Qur’an.\nThen he said: As for holding fast to Him, it means putting one’s trust in Him, seeking strength with Him, seeking protection with Him, and asking Him to protect the individual, give him strength and ward off harm from him. For the result of holding fast to Him is that He will ward off harm from His slave, for Allah defends those who believe. So He will ward off from his believing slave, if he holds fast to Him, any cause that could lead to problems, and He will protect him from that. So He will protect him from doubts and desires, and from the schemes of his enemies both apparent and hidden, and from the evil of his own self. He will ward off from him the consequences of that which may lead to problems and troubles after the causes thereof are all present, commensurate with the strength with which he holds fast to Him, so that the causes of troubles and problems will be removed in his case, and thus Allah will protect him from what could result from that and the causes thereof. He may ward off from him something that He had decreed by means of another decree, and something that He willed by means of something else that He wills, thus protecting him from it.

        "predicted_answer": "Holding fast to Allah and His religion is a fundamental theme in Islam, encouraging believers to act with faith, engage in righteous deeds, and maintain unity and steadfastness in their beliefs. The Qur'an emphasizes this through various verses that highlight the importance of faith, obedience, and communal responsibility among believers. Below are key aspects related to holding fast to Allah and His religion, supported by relevant Qur'anic verses.\n\n### 1. **Unity in faith and community**\n\nBelievers are encouraged to hold firmly to the \"rope of Allah,\" which symbolizes unity in faith and practice. This is articulated in Surah Ali 'Imran (3:103):\n\n- **\"And hold fast, all of you together, to the rope of Allah, and do not become divided.\"** (Surah Ali 'Imran 3:103)\n\nThis verse calls believers to adhere to Islam collectively, reminding them of the importance of community and mutual support in faith. \n\n### 2. **Obedience to Allah and His Messenger**\n\nThe Qur'an stresses that true believers are those who submit to Allah and His Messenger without hesitation. Surah Al-Ahzab (33:36) states:\n\n- **\"No believing man or woman have any choice in a matter after God and His Apostle have decided it.\"** (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:36)\n\nThis verse underscores the necessity of adhering to divine commandments and the authority of the Prophet as a guide.\n\n### 3. **Striving in the Path of Allah**\n\nBelievers are urged to actively engage in good deeds and enjoin what is right. Good actions are essential as demonstrated in Surah Al-Hajj (22:37):\n\n- **\"It is not their meat or blood that reaches God: It is the fealty of your heart that reaches Him.\"** (Surah Al-Hajj 22:37)\n\nThis highlights that sincere devotion and righteous actions form the core of one’s worship, resulting in God's support for the believers.\n\n### 4. **Faithfulness and sincerity in belief**\n\nTrue believers are those who maintain their faith even in the face of trials. This is outlined in Surah Al-Hujurat (49:15):\n\n- **\"They alone are believers who come to believe in God and His Apostle, then never doubt again, and struggle with wealth and soul in the way of God.\"** (Surah Al-Hujurat 49:15)\n\nSuch faithfulness is key to proving one's commitment to Allah and should be cherished and nurtured.\n\n### 5. **Divine Support and Protection**\n\nAllah promises protection to those who uphold their commitment to Him. Surah Al-Hajj (22:40) reminds us of divine assistance:\n\n- **\"God will certainly defend the believers.\"** (Surah Al-Hajj 22:40)\n\nThis serves as a reassurance that Allah is on the side of those who steadfastly hold onto their faith.\n\n### 6. **Acts of Charity and Community Welfare**\n\nEngaging in acts of charity (zakat) and promoting goodness in society are central to Islamic practice. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:267) emphasizes this:\n\n- **\"Spend in the way of Allah and do not destroy yourselves by your own hands.\"** (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:267)\n\nThis verse encourages believers to be proactive in their community, helping those in need as an extension of their faith.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHolding fast to Allah and His religion is underscored by unity, obedience, active engagement in good deeds, sincerity, divine support, and the promotion of communal welfare. Surah Al-Hajj (22:78) concludes by affirming:\n\n- **\"So be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and hold on firmly to God. He is your friend: How excellent a friend is He, how excellent a helper!\"** (Surah Al-Hajj 22:78)\n\nThis encapsulates the essence of faithfulness in Islam, invoking believers to remain steadfast and draw strength from their connection to Allah and the larger community of Muslims."

        "question": "How can he acquire social intelligence?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Improving one’s level of social intelligence requires intellectual effort and acquisition of knowledge, as well as practical, behavioural effort.\nWith regard to intellectual effort and acquiring knowledge, it is attained by learning the noble characteristics that have to do with dealing with people in general terms, and learning the ideal ways of dealing with transgression and hypocrisy, and bad characteristics in particular.\nWith regard to practical, behavioural effort, it is attained by persisting and steadfastly interacting with people on the basis of noble characteristics; developing self-restraint when dealing with transgressors, hypocrites and ill-mannered people; and repelling with that which is better and bearing with patience the evil of wrongdoers.\nThe best and noblest path that one may follow in terms of both knowledge and behaviour in this regard is the teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on how to deal with people of all types, ages, religions, races, classes and statuses.\nA useful book that we advise you to read in this regard is the book Kayfa ‘Aamaluhum by Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid, which clearly explains the teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) regarding how to interact with people of different types.\nhttps://www.almunajjid.com/9468\nSee also the answer to question no. 71184, which speaks concisely about the character of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAnd Allah is the source of help.",
        "predicted_answer": "Acquiring social intelligence, the ability to understand and manage interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically, is a key component of both personal growth and social interaction in Islam. The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of wisdom, understanding, and ethical conduct, which are crucial for developing social intelligence. Here are some avenues through which an individual can cultivate this quality, supported by relevant verses from the Qur'an:\n\n1. **Seeking Knowledge and Wisdom**: Wisdom is highly regarded in Islam. It is stated in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:269):\n\n   > \"He gives wisdom to whomsoever He pleases; and those who are bestowed wisdom get good in abundance.\"\n\n   This verse emphasizes that wisdom is a gift from God, and those who seek it are rewarded. A person can enhance their social intelligence by continually seeking knowledge and learning from experiences.\n\n2. **Practice Empathy and Understanding**: The Qur'an advises believers to understand others' situations and respond with compassion. This is highlighted in Surah 'Abasa (80:3-6):\n\n   > \"What made you think that he will not grow in virtue, Or be admonished, and the admonition profit him? As for him who is not in want of anything, You pay full attention.\"\n\n   Understanding that everyone has unique struggles allows one to communicate effectively and supportively, which is essential for social intelligence.\n\n3. **Engaging in Community Welfare**: Actively participating in community and providing help to those in need fosters social relationships and promotes a sense of belonging. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:272) states:\n\n   > \"If you give alms openly, it is well; but if you do it secretly and give to the poor, that is better.\"\n\n   Engaging with the community encourages interaction and builds social skills necessary for developing social intelligence.\n\n4. **Moral Integrity and Ethical Conduct**: Surah Yusuf (12:22) discusses how Allah provided Joseph with wisdom and knowledge, enabling him to act justly:\n\n   > \"When he reached the prime of life We gave him wisdom and knowledge.\"\n\n   By adhering to moral principles and behaving ethically, one cultivates trust and positive relationships, which are foundational to social intelligence.\n\n5. **Reflecting on Human Nature**: Recognizing the shared experiences and struggles of humanity can enhance one’s social sensitivity. Surah Al-Insan (76:1-3) states:\n\n   > \"Was there not a time in the life of man when he was not even a mentionable thing? Verily We created man from a sperm to bring out his real substance, then gave him hearing and sight. We surely showed him the way that he may either be grateful or deny.\"\n\n   This reminder of our humble beginnings encourages humility and encourages empathy toward others.\n\n6. **Effective Communication**: Understanding the importance of how one communicates can significantly affect relationships. In Surah Al-Mulk (67:13-14), it mentions:\n\n   > \"Whether you say a thing secretly or openly, He knows the innermost secrets of your hearts.\"\n\n   Being cognizant of what and how one communicates enhances social intelligence, as it builds respectful and honest interactions with others.\n\n7. **Patience and Perseverance**: Developing social intelligence takes time and effort, and patience is essential. Surah Al-Qasas (28:80-82) contrasts the fate of the proud with the value of humility and belief in God’s wisdom:\n\n   > \"But those who knew better said: 'Alack-a-day! God's guerdon is better for those who believe and do the right. Only those who persevere will receive it.'\"\n\n   This verse emphasizes the importance of perseverance and patience in recognizing and acting upon moral and socially intelligent decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, acquiring social intelligence in Islam is about seeking wisdom, developing empathy, volunteering for community welfare, practicing moral integrity, reflecting on human nature, communicating effectively, and exercising patience. By adhering to these principles derived from the Qur'an, one can foster deeper and more meaningful social interactions with others."

        "question": "How can we make ourselves feel when reading Qur’an that Allah is addressing us thereby?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Making yourself feel that Allah is addressing you in the Qur’an is attained by listening attentively to the Qur’an, reflecting properly upon it, and acting in accordance with it, as the Muslim believes that Allah is addressing His slaves in the Qur’an, issuing commands and prohibitions to them; sometimes He addresses a particular group in some contexts, and sometimes He addresses humanity as a whole.\nWhen He addresses the believers, then the Muslim should reflect on that and say: We hear and we obey. Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When you hear Allah saying “O you who believe”, then pay attention, for it is something good that He is enjoining or something bad that He is forbidding.\nTafseer Ibn Katheer (1/374).\nWhen Allah addresses humanity as a whole, then you should think that Allah is addressing you in particular, so if it is a command then do it, and if it is a prohibition then refrain from it, and if it is an exhortation then act upon it.\nThe individual should reflect upon what Allah says throughout the entire Qur’an, but that reflection varies according to the context of what is being recited of the text. If obedience is mentioned, then he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to obey. If disobedience is mentioned, then he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the prohibition on disobedience. If people of faith (believers) are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to take them as friends and allies and love them. If the people of disbelief and hypocrisy are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to hate them and regard them as enemies.\nIf the Shaytaan is mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to regard him as an enemy, go against him and not to follow him, and to strive to obey Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy –\nAnd that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path”\n[Yaa-Seen 36:60-61].\nIf truthfulness and those who speak the truth are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to strive to be one of them.\nIf allies and liars are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to strive to not be one of them.\nImam Abu Bakr al-Aajurri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n… Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, urges people to reflect upon the Qur’an, as He, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon [their] hearts?”\n[Muhammad 47:24].\nAnd Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it had been from [any] other than Allah , they would have found within it much contradiction”\n[an-Nisaa’ 4:82].\nMuhammad ibn al-Husayn [al-Aajurri] said: Do you not see, may Allah have mercy on you, how your most generous Lord urges His creation to reflect upon His words? Whoever reflects upon His words will come to know the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and will come to know the greatness of His might and power, and will come to know the greatness of His grace and bounty towards the believers, and will come to know his duty to worship Him, so he will commit himself to do what is obligatory, and will beware of whatever his most generous Lord has warned him against, and will be eager to do what He has urged him to do.\nWhoever has this attitude when reciting Qur’an, and when listening to someone else reciting it, the Qur’an will be healing for him, and he will become independent of means even if he does not have wealth; he will feel honoured and proud even if he does not have a large family around him; and he will feel at ease in situations where others feel worried. His main concern, when starting to read or recite a soorah, will be “when will recitation of Qur’an have an impact on me?”, not “when will I finish the soorah?” Rather his concern will be: when will I understand and pay heed to what Allah is saying to me? When will I rectify myself, when will I learn the lesson? Because recitation of Qur’an is an act of worship, and an act of worship cannot be done properly when there is heedlessness and a lack of attention. May Allah help and guide us all.\nEnd quote from Akhlaaq Hamalat al-Qur’an (3)\nThis is how the attitude of the one who recites Qur’an should be.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "To feel that Allah is addressing us personally while reading the Qur'an, there are several practices and reminders that can enhance our connection with the text and foster a sense of direct communication with the Divine. Below are some suggestions complemented by relevant verses from the Qur'an.\n\n### 1. Approach with Humility and Sincerity\n\nWhen we approach the Qur'an, we should do so with humility and an open heart. This means setting aside distractions and preparing ourselves spiritually. The Qur'an encourages listening attentively and reflecting on its verses:\n\n**Surah Al-A'raf (7:204-206):**\n\"When the Qur'an is recited listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed. Meditate on your Lord inwardly with humility and trepidation, reciting His Book softly, morning and evening, and be not negligent.\" (7:204-206)\n\n### 2. Recognize the Qur'an as a Personal Message\n\nUnderstanding that the Qur'an is not just historical text but divine guidance meant for every individual can help in making the reading more personal. Allah speaks to those who believe, and we should position ourselves within that framework:\n\n**Surah Al-Isra (17:44-47):**\n\"Too glorious and high is He, too exalted for what they say! The seven skies, the earth, and all that lies within them, sing hallelujahs to Him. There is nothing that does not chant His praises, but you do not understand their hymns of praise.\" (17:44)\n\n### 3. Reflect on Personal Relevance\n\nAs you read, ponder how each verse applies to your own life. What emotions or thoughts arise? Reflecting on your experiences in light of various Quranic teachings can create a profound sense of personal connection:\n\n**Surah Al-Qasas (28:52-56):**\n\"Those to whom We gave the Book before this do believe in it; and when it is read out to them, they say: 'We believe in it. It's the truth from our Lord.'\" (28:52-56)\n\n### 4. Regular Recitation and Reflection\n\nConsistent reading and recitation of the Qur'an helps cement its teachings in our hearts. Designating specific times for recitation fosters a deeper bond, allowing the messages to resonate more profoundly:\n\n**Surah Al-A'la (87:6-10):**\n\"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, unless God may please. He knows the visible and knows what is hidden. We shall take you slowly towards ease. So remind them if reminder is profitable.\" (87:6-10)\n\n### 5. Seek Understanding and Application\n\nEngaging with Tafsir (interpretation) and studying the meanings of the verses will provide more depth, allowing one to understand how to apply the teachings in daily life:\n\n**Surah Al-Furqan (25:57-61):**\n\"...Ask those who are well-informed.\" (25:57-61)\n\n### 6. Pray for Guidance\n\nAsking Allah for help in understanding and feeling His presence in the Qur'an can provide focus and openness. This intention is critical in ensuring we do not take the recitation lightly but see it as a direct conversation with our Creator:\n\n**Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:18-20):**\n\"Verily this is a reminder. So let him who desires take the way to his Lord.\" (73:18-20)\n\n### 7. Avoid Neglect\n\nDo not turn away from the guidance provided within the Qur'an. Engaging consistently and resisting the urge to become complacent allows for an ongoing, dynamic relationship with the text:\n\n**Surah Al-Baqarah (2:144-148):**\n\"The truth is from your Lord, so be not among those who are skeptics.\" (2:144-148)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy approaching the Qur'an with humility, reflecting on its messages, engaging in consistent recitation, and praying for understanding, one can deepen the feeling that Allah is directly addressing them through the verses. The Qur'an is not merely a book; it is a living guide that offers wisdom and solace tailored to every believer's journey. Engaging with it in these ways can foster a deeper personal connection with its divine message."

        "question": "Ruling on recording university lectures without the permission of the lecturer",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim who pays attention to matters of trust and hates betrayal to record the words of a speaker without his permission or without his knowledge, no matter what the type of speech, whether it is religious or worldly, such as fatwas, scientific discussions, financial matters, and so on.\nIt is proven in the hadith of Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillah al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one man speaks to another and looks around (to make sure no one is listening), then that is a trust (amaanah).” Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood and at-Tirmidhi.\nWhat is meant by his looking around is that it is clear from the actions of the speaker that he is being cautious, by looking around, right and left, to make sure that no one can hear what he is saying. Thus what your companion says to you is a trust for the listener, that he has entrusted him with. If he tells someone else about it, then he has gone against the command of Allah, as he has disclosed the trust to people who are not entitled to receive it, and thus he becomes a wrongdoer. What he should do is conceal it, because when the person who told it to him looked around, that was like a gesture telling him not to tell anyone else. They said: This is a very concise expression, yet full of meaning, because the word translated here as looked around is very concise, and is encouraging us to observe good etiquette when mixing with people, to treat people well, to conceal secrets and maintain friendships, and it is a warning against spreading malicious gossip that could lead to resentment, as is quite clear.\nAr-Raaghib said: Confidential talk is that which is meant to be kept private, which may be understood directly, such as if you say to someone else: Keep what I tell you to yourself; or it may be indirect or circumstantial, such as if the speaker takes the opportunity of being alone with you, or he lowers his voice, or tries to conceal it from others in the gathering. This is what is meant in this hadith. End quote.\nIf you record his words without his permission or his knowledge, then this is a kind of treachery and a breach of trust.\nIf you then spread these words to other people, this exacerbates the treachery and violation of the trust.\nConclusion: Recording someone’s words – on a phone or otherwise – without the knowledge or permission of the speaker is evildoing and a betrayal, and undermines one’s good character and dignity.\nEnd quote from Adab al-Haatif by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (may Allah have mercy on him), p. 28\nI put this question to our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Barraak (may Allah preserve him), and he replied:\nThey have no right to record without his consent or knowledge.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The ruling on recording university lectures without the permission of the lecturer can be explored through various principles in Islam regarding privacy, respect, and honesty.\n\n### 1. **Respect for Privacy and Trust**\nIn Islam, respecting the privacy of others is paramount. The act of recording a lecture without the express permission of the lecturer can be seen as a violation of their privacy and trust. The Quran addresses the importance of respecting confidences and the harm caused by breaching trust in various contexts.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:9)** mentions that believers should converse in a manner that does not lead to iniquity, reflecting the importance of respectful communication:  \n  \"O you who believe, when you converse privately, do not talk of iniquity, rebellion, and disobedience to the Prophet, but talk of goodness and piety, and fear God before whom you will be gathered.\"\n  \n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:283)** encourages writing agreements to avoid suspicion and harm, highlighting the importance of trust in transactions, which can be extended to the respect of agreements in other contexts, such as education:  \n  \"But do not neglect to draw up a contract, big or small, with the time fixed for paying back the debt. This is more equitable in the eyes of God...\"\n\n### 2. **Command of Justice**\nThe act of recording a lecture without permission can stem from a mindset of entitlement against others' rights. Islamic teachings emphasize justice and fairness, advising against actions that may violate those principles.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:42-46)** highlights the importance of justice, “But if you judge, you should do so with justice, for God loves those who are just.” Recording without permission may lead to unjust consequences against a lecturer's rights.\n\n### 3. **Integrity and Honesty**\nIslam places great emphasis on honesty and integrity in all dealings. Recording someone without their knowledge can lead to a breach of this principle, as it may not represent the content in the way intended by the lecturer.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:279-280)** stresses fairness, “Oppress none and no one will oppress you.” Making recordings without consent could be seen as an oppression of the lecturer's intellectual property and personal choice.\n\n### 4. **Seeking Permission and Transparency**\nIn Islam, seeking permission and being transparent in actions are strengths. Asking for permission aligns with Islamic manners and virtues.\n\n**Supporting Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:53)** advises believers to be respectful when interacting with the Prophet and, by extension, with authority figures. This verse underscores the significance of consent and respectful engagement:  \n  \"O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without awaiting the proper time...\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on these principles drawn from the Quran, recording university lectures without the lecturer's permission can be considered impermissible as it undermines respect for privacy, honesty, and the practice of justice. To uphold the Islamic principles of trust and respect, one should always seek prior consent before engaging in such activities. If a lecturer allows recording, then it would be permissible; otherwise, it would violate Islamic ethical standards. \n\n### References:\n- Surah Al-Mujadila (58:9)\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:283)\n- Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:42-46)\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:279-280)\n- Surah Al-Ahzab (33:53)"

        "question": "If a person dies in the bathroom, is that indicative of a bad end?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    In such cases, if a person dies \n    in such circumstances, it has nothing to do with being praiseworthy or \n    blameworthy in and of itself, and there is no Islamic ruling connected to \n    that. Islamic rulings only have to do with the deeds of those who are \n    accountable. If a person dies in a particular place, or at a particular \n    time, or in a particular posture, that is not part of his deeds and it is \n    not within his control, so there is no ruling that is connected to it. \n\n    With regard to the death of one \n    who is fasting, this is the matter concerning which there are reports which \n    point to its virtue, not because death in this situation was within his \n    control, but because he died whilst doing a righteous deed and his life \n    ended with that. It is the righteous deed that is within his control and is \n    connected to the ruling of Allah. If a person dies doing such a deed, that \n    is a blessing granted by Allah, may He be exalted, to His slave, and it is \n    encouraged to constantly do such deeds, in the hope that one might die doing \n    such a thing. \n\n    It was narrated that Hudhayfah \n    (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of \n    Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts one day, seeking the Countenance of \n    Allah, and his life ends with that, will enter Paradise.”\n\n    Narrated by Ahmad (no. 22235). \n    Shaykh al-Arna’oot said: It is saheeh because of corroborating evidence. \n\n    It was also narrated by al-Bazzaar \n    in his Musnad (1/436) as follows: “If a person’s life ends with a day \n    of fasting, he will enter Paradise.” Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani. \n\n    Al-Mannaawi (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said: The words “If a person’s life ends with a day of \n    fasting” mean: if a person’s life concludes with a day of fasting, in the \n    sense that he dies when he is fasting or after breaking his fast. \n\n    The words “will enter Paradise” \n    mean: with those who enter it first, or without prior punishment.\n\n    End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer \n    Sharh al-Jaami‘ as-Sagheer (6/160) \n\n    Muslim narrated in his Saheeh \n    (5126) that Jaabir said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace \n    of Allah be upon him) say: “Each person will be resurrected in the condition \n    in which he died.” \n\n    Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said: If a person dies in a particular condition, then his \n    life ends with that, and in that condition he will be resurrected.\n\n    End quote from Kashf al-Mushkil \n    min Hadeeth as-Saheehayn (1/751) \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, the circumstances of a person's death can carry implications for their eventual judgment, but it is necessary to approach the question of dying in the bathroom—and indeed any circumstance of death—with caution and an understanding that only Allah ultimately knows the state of an individual's heart and deeds.\n\n### Dying in Specific Circumstances\n\nWhile there are narrations in Islamic tradition (Hadith) that discuss the merits of dying in certain states or places, the Qur'an does not explicitly outline a condemnation or merit for dying in a bathroom. In traditional Islamic understanding, the bathroom is a place for purification, and many scholars argue that it does not intrinsically indicate a bad end. \n\nThe Qur'an reminds believers that everyone has an appointed time of death:\n- **Surah Ali 'Imran (3:145)**: \"No one can die except by the permission of Allah at a term appointed. And whoever desires the reward of this world, We give him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We give him thereof. And We will reward the grateful.\" \n\nThis verse emphasizes that one's time of death is decreed by Allah, which can serve as a reminder that the place of death should not solely dictate one's fate in the Hereafter.\n\n### Understanding Death and Accountability\n\nAnother important aspect regarding death is the accountability that everyone will face:\n- **Surah Al-Jathiyah (45:21-22)**: \"Do those who commit evil think We will make them equal to those who believe and do righteous deeds? How bad is the judgment they make! And Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth, so that He may reward each soul according to what it has earned; and they will not be wronged.\"\n\nThis indicates that it is the deeds and beliefs of an individual throughout their life that will ultimately determine their position in the afterlife, rather than the specifics of their death.\n\n### The Integration of Belief and Deeds\n\nIslam emphasizes that those who do good, regardless of their circumstances at death, can expect mercy from Allah. The Qur'an makes this clear:\n- **Surah An-Nahl (16:30-31)**: \"And those who feared their Lord will be led to Paradise in groups. When they arrive there, and its gates are opened, and the guardians of Paradise say to them, 'Peace be upon you! You have become pure, so enter to dwell therein eternally.'\"\n\nThe key takeaway here is the importance of one's faith and deeds. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile cultural interpretations might lead some to think that dying in a bathroom suggests a bad end, Islamic teachings emphasize that the final judgment lies with Allah and that behaviors, intentions, and compliance with Islamic teachings throughout life are what determine a person's fate. Therefore, a person who dies in a bathroom—if they were a believer and lived a righteous life—would not be judged unfavorably simply based on the circumstances of their death.\n\nUltimately, we have no way to determine the status of any individual’s soul, as Allah alone knows the depth of one's faith and actions. As such, whilst the act of dying in a bathroom is not explicitly mentioned as being detrimental in the Qur'an, it is essential to live a life of righteousness, as it is these qualities that will ultimately hold significance in the Hereafter."

        "question": "Annulling engagement because of a dream",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to rulings and his understanding of life and circumstances, and his evaluation of the experiences he goes through, the Muslim bases all of that on the reasoning, wisdom and measures that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has enjoined us to pay attention to and follow. This is what Islam teaches us; it instructs us to examine, contemplate and weigh up reason and experience, then to make our decisions after that regarding people and actions. \nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Thus Allah makes clear His Ayat (Laws) to you, in order that you may understand”\n[al-Baqarah 2:242]. \nThere is nothing in our religion to suggest that we should rely on dreams and visions, either with regard to worldly matters or religious rulings. Knowledge that is obtained via dreams is subjective, is not reliable and there is no certainty about it. rather it is subject to doubt, and it is not possible that Islam would instruct people to refer for knowledge to sources that are imaginary and cannot meet the least academic standards. \nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Dreams are of three types: a good dream which is glad tidings from Allah, a dream from the Shaytaan which causes distress, and a dream that comes from what a man is thinking of to himself…”\n Narrated by Muslim (2263). \nthe Shaytaan plays a role in what people see in their dreams, just as a person's own self does, and it is difficult for one to be certain of the source of his dream at all times. So how can a Muslim feel comfortable with a dream that he has seen and base his decisions on it, when he knows that the Shaytaan may have played the greatest role in producing it? \nThat also applies to the case of marriage. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has set out for us the characteristics on which we should base our decision of accepting or rejecting a suitor, as he said:\n“If there comes to you one with whose character and religious commitment you are pleased, then marry (your female relative under your guardianship) to him, for if you do not do so, there will be tribulation and great mischief on earth.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, even if there are some reservations concerning him?? He said: “If there comes to you one with whose character and religious commitment you are pleased, then marry (your female relative under your guardianship) to him,” three times  Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1085); he said: It is hasan ghareeb. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. \nSo he defined character and religious commitment as the standards on which people should base their decisions when rejecting or accepting a suitor. Hence the questioner should not pay attention to anything else or respond to whatever she sees in her dreams of things in which the Shaytaan may have played a part, seeking to divide spouses and cause division and conflict. \nShaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked the following question in Liqa' al-Baab al-Maftooh (no. 5/question no. 17):\nA man proposed marriage to a woman, and in a dream she saw him clean-shaven. Should she agree to marry him or not? In real life he appears to be good, and he does not shave his beard; he is religiously-committed, but Allah knows best about him.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\nIf a woman sees a man who has proposed to her as clean-shaven in a dream, when in reality he does not shave his beard, what she sees in her dream does not matter, and that should not prevent her from marrying him, so long as he is upright in his religious commitment and character. End quote.\nMoreover, we should point out that istikhaarah has nothing to do with seeing dreams – as many people think – because the purpose of istikhaarah is to ask Allah, may He be exalted, to make easier the better of two options, and turning to Him, may He be glorified, for guidance to the best of affairs. Istikhaarah is a du'aa' (supplication) and when Allah answers it, He makes easy the thing that the person has chosen, after thinking and reflecting. The du'aa' has nothing whatsoever to do with dreams.\nOur advice to the sister is to think again, and not try to ruin her marital ties just because of a dream. Rather she should let religion and reason govern the issue of her engagement, then take an appropriate stance after that.\nSee also the answer to question no. 25793 and 34726.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, dreams are often considered to be a reflection of one's thoughts, concerns, or experiences, but they are not a basis for significant life decisions such as annulling an engagement. The Quran does not explicitly provide guidance that associates the validity of engagement or marriage with dreams. However, various principles can be derived from Islamic teachings regarding contracts and serious commitments.\n\n### Engagement and Hearts’ Intentions:\n1. **Intentions Matter**: In Islam, the intention (niyyah) is crucial for any action, including engagements and marriages. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:225) states: \n   > \"God will not call you to account for that which is senseless in your oaths, but only for what is in your hearts; for God is forgiving and forbearing.\" \n   (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:225)\n\n   This implies that what truly matters in commitments are the intentions and decisions taken consciously rather than decisions based on dreams.\n\n### Conditions for Engagement:\n2. **Valid Engagement**: An engagement is a commitment that should be treated with respect. Surah An-Nisa (4:21) emphasizes the seriousness of such commitments, indicating that one should not take engagements lightly or dismissively:\n   > \"How could you do that having slept with one another, and when they had taken a solemn pledge from you?\" \n   (Surah An-Nisa 4:21)\n\n   This verse emphasizes the weight of a pledge taken between individuals, highlighting that engagements should not easily be undone without sincere reasons.\n\n### Wisdom and Discernment:\n3. **Seeking Guidance**: In matters unclear or troubling, individuals are encouraged to seek guidance from God through prayer. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:186) reminds believers that God is close and responds to those who seek Him:\n   > \"And when My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me.\"\n   (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:186)\n\n4. **Using Reason and Wisdom**: Surah At-Talaq (65:10-12) advises believers on the importance of wisdom and patience in matters of life:\n   > \"So you men of wisdom, and those who believe, take heed for yourselves and fear God.\" \n   (Surah At-Talaq 65:10)\n\n   This emphasizes the necessity of using sound judgment in all affairs, particularly in decisions as serious as engagement and marriage.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, while dreams can sometimes provide insight or provoke contemplation, they should not serve as the primary basis for annulling an engagement in Islam. Engagement is a deliberate and sacred commitment, and decisions regarding it should be grounded in thoughtful consideration, sincerity, and strong intentions rather than transient feelings or dream interpretations. The Quran reiterates the importance of knowledge, intention, and wisdom in all actions pertaining to relationships and commitments."

        "question": "She committed an immoral action with a young man, then he left her; should she wait for him to marry her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThis relationship that developed between the young man and the young woman, which usually starts with a look and infatuation, and often ends with immoral actions, is a haraam and sinful relationship which can only lead to evil, corruption and temptation. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)), and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him)” [al-Isra’ 17:32]. \nShaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe prohibition on coming near it is more eloquent than simply prohibiting this action, because that includes the prohibition on all the things that lead to it and promote it. The one who plays with fire will soon get burnt, especially with regard to this matter which many people have a strong desire for.\nEnd quote from Tafseer as-Sa‘di, p. 457 \nFor a young man to get to know a girl who is not his mahram, and for them to fall in love with one another, and what that leads to of meetings and conversations and strong emotions and so on  – all of these are among the most easily accessible doorways to mischief and fitnah. Anyone who has ears to hear or eyes to see will know that for certain. \nThe issue here is not a case of magic that was done by his sister, or anything else; rather the issue is that this relationship was built on a false foundation from the outset. The first step to putting things right, and the most essential obligatory duty for both of them in this case is to repent to Allah; both the young man and the young woman should repent from that illicit relationship, then they should turn over a new page with Allah. One of the conditions of repentance for the sinner is that he should regret the sin that has passed, give it up, and resolve not to go back to it again. All of these steps mean that each of them is required to cut off ties with the other, because this is an invalid relationship that was based on haraam. \nSecondly: \nThere is no room here for praying istikhaarah, because salaat al-istikhaarah is only prescribed concerning permissible matters that a person may be confused about and not know which is better for him. With regard to obligatory or mustahabb (encouraged) matters, there is no istikhaarah for them at all, because it is enjoined to do them according to Islam. By the same token, there is no istikhaarah for haraam and makrooh (disliked) matters either, because it is forbidden to do them according to Islam. \nSee the answer to question no. 11981 \nOnce it is understood that there is no room for istikhaarah in this case, according to Islam, and that what is required from both parties is to repent sincerely to Allah and put an end to the bad relationship between them, any wise person will realise that holding onto far-fetched notions and relying on a human being who has gone away is foolish and is contrary to what is in one’s best interests in both religious and worldly terms. Hence it is said: Whoever referred you to someone who is absent has not been fair to you. This young man turned away from marrying that girl, even though he lived close to her in the same city, so how can she wait for him after he has left her and gone far away? \nIf both of them repent, and cut off ties between them, then after that he wants to marry her, there is nothing wrong with that, but that is on condition that you do not wait for him; rather you should erase that dark page from your life, and start a new page, in the hopes that Allah will accept your repentance, help you to carry on with your life, conceal your past mistake, and give you some one better than him. \nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 117567 and 148528 \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the question of whether a woman who has committed an immoral action with a young man should wait for him to marry her, it is essential to consider the Islamic teachings regarding relationships, the nature of repentance, and the principles of marriage.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n1. **Repentance and Forgiveness**:\n   Islam places a strong emphasis on sincere repentance (Tawba) for those who have committed sins. It is believed that anyone who truly repents for their actions, regardless of the nature of the sin, can attain forgiveness from Allah. The Quran encourages believers to repent and return to righteousness.\n\n   Relevant Verse:\n   - Surah Al-Furqan (Surah 25), Ayah 70: \n     > \"Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work.

And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.\" \n   - Reference: Surah 25, Ayah 70.\n\n2. **Marriage and the Waiting Period**:\n   As per Islamic teachings, a woman has the right to marry after she has completed her waiting period (Iddah) following a divorce or the death of her spouse. The rules about waiting periods emphasize that a woman should not be forced to remain single if she wishes to find a lawful partner.\n\n   Relevant Verses:\n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (Surah 2), Ayah 232:\n     > \"When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably. This warning is for those among you who believe in Allah and the Last Day.\" \n   - Reference: Surah 2, Ayah 232.\n\n3. **Focus on the Future**:\n   After repentance, if the young man has not expressed any intention to marry her, it would not be appropriate for her to wait indefinitely. Instead, she should engage in self-improvement, seek forgiveness for her past actions, and express her desires for a lawful marriage within the realm of Islamic guidelines.\n\n4. **Legal and Moral Perspective**:\n   Islam encourages individuals to seek lawful relationships, promoting stability and commitment through marriage. If the young man shows no intention of marrying her, she is encouraged to pursue lawful prospects for marriage with other individuals.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe woman should focus on her repentance and seek to better herself spiritually and morally. If the young man has moved on and shown no intention to marry her, it is permissible for her to seek marriage opportunities elsewhere. The emphasis in Islam is on lawful relationships governed by mutual respect, commitment, and compliance with Islamic principles. \n\nIn summary, while she should wait for a reasonable period to see if there is any intention on his part, she should not feel compelled to wait indefinitely if there are no signs of commitment from him. Islamic teachings encourage individuals to heal, forgive, and move forward in their lives in a manner that aligns with the values of the faith.\n\n### References:\n- Surah Al-Furqan (25:70)\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:232)"

        "question": "Khalwah if Another Woman is Present",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) are unanimously \n    agreed that it is haram (impermissible) to be alone with a non-mahram (a \n    woman whom one is allowed to marry according to Islamic law) woman \n    (khalwah), because of the saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration): “No man \n    should be alone with a woman unless there is a mahram (male relative whom \n    she could never marry) with her.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5233; Muslim, \n    1341. \n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a non-mahram \n    man is alone with a non-mahram woman, with no third person present, this is \n    haraam according to scholarly consensus.\n\n    End quote from Sharh Saheeh Muslim, 9/109 \n\n    As-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth \n    indicates that it is haram to be alone with a non-mahram woman, and there is \n    consensus on this point.\n\n    End quote from Subul as-Salam. 1/608 \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    There is nothing wrong with a woman allowing a non-mahram man \n    to enter her husband’s house when he is absent, as long as two conditions \n    are met:\n\n    1.     Her husband should have given her permission to do so.\n\n    2.     There should be no khalwah (i.e., she should not be \n    alone with him); rather there should be a mahram with her such as her father \n    or brother, or anyone for whom it is permanently forbidden to marry her. \n\n    If she does not have a mahram with her, but there is another \n    woman with her, khalwah may be avoided thereby, but it is not permissible \n    for a woman to put herself in such a situation unless the woman is \n    trustworthy and the man who is with them in that place is also trustworthy \n    and there is no fear that he could overpower the two women. \n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a non-mahram \n    man is alone with a non-mahram woman, without a third person being present \n    with them, this is haram according to scholarly consensus; this is different \n    from if a man is with a number of non-mahram women, in which case the \n    correct view is that it is permissible.\n\n    End quote from Sharh Saheeh Muslim, 9/109 \n\n    As-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It says in the \n    hadeeth that “the third one present with them is the Shaytan”. Can someone \n    other than the mahram take his place in that regard, so that there will be \n    someone with them in order that khalwah will be avoided? It seems to be the \n    case that he may take his place, because the reason for the prohibition is \n    the fear that the Shaytan may cause temptation between them. \n\n    End quote from Subul as-Salam, 1/608 \n\n    Based on this, there is nothing wrong with the man allowing a \n    non-mahram to enter his house, on condition that he is not alone with his \n    wife and that he is trustworthy. However, the basic principle, and the best \n    precaution to safeguard religious commitment, is that he should not allow \n    this unless there is a mahram present. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, **khulwah**, or the act of being alone with a member of the opposite sex, is generally viewed with specific guidelines, especially when it involves someone who is not closely related (mahram). When considering the presence of another woman during khulwah, the views can be nuanced and depend on the interpretation of Islamic teachings by different scholars.\n\n### General Guidelines on Khulwah\n\n1. **Prohibition of Khulwah with Non-Mahram**: It is well-established in Islamic tradition that a man should not be alone with a non-mahram woman. This is primarily to prevent any situations that might lead to immoral actions or thoughts. The Prophet Muhammad said: \n\n   > “Whenever a man is alone with a woman, the devil is the third among them.” \n   > (Sunan Ibn Majah, 1845)\n\n2. **Presence of Another Woman**: The presence of another woman does provide some leeway. If the khulwah involves a man and a woman who is not closely related, having another woman with them may change the dynamics, thereby reducing the risk of inappropriate interactions. However, opinions on this may vary:\n   - Some scholars argue that the presence of another woman makes it permissible since it avoids the privacy that could lead to temptation.\n   - Others maintain that regardless of the presence of another woman, any situation where men and non-mahram women are together can lead to unwanted consequences, thus should be avoided.\n\n### Verses of the Quran Supporting Guidelines\n\nThe following verses from the Quran and their interpretations can provide insights into the appropriate conduct related to interactions between men and women:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:32-36)** states:\n   > \"O wives of the Prophet, you are not like other women. If you are mindful of God, do not be too obliging in your speech, lest someone sick of heart should covet your person; so say only customary things. Stay at home, and do not deck yourselves with ostentation as in the days of paganism; fulfil your devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey God and His Apostle. God desires to remove impurities from you, O inmates of this house...\"\n   - This emphasizes the importance of maintaining modesty and lowering the potential for temptation.\n\n2. **Surah An-Nur (24:30-31)** instructs:\n   > \"And tell the believing women to lower (some) of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which (ordinarily) appears thereof and to wrap (a portion of) their hijab over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of private parts of women.\"\n   - This verse further reinforces the need for women to dress modestly and interact appropriately with men, thereby suggesting that even the presence of another woman does not eliminate the principles of modesty and restraint.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:53)** advises:\n   > \"O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are invited for a meal, not waiting for the clasping of ties; but when you are invited, enter, and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, such behavior was troubling the Prophet, and he was shy of (dismissing) you. But Allah is not shy of the truth...\"\n   - This highlights the importance of propriety and the context of social interactions, indicating that even in settings with more than one person, norms of appropriate conduct must be observed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn sum, while the presence of another woman during khulwah may mitigate some concerns, the best practice is to avoid such situations altogether to maintain adherence to Islamic principles of modesty and restraint. It's essential for individuals to consider the teachings of the Quran and Hadith, as well as the interpretations of reputable scholars when navigating these situations. This ensures that interactions remain respectful and in accordance with Islamic values."

        "question": "Family Disputes",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly severing the ties of kinship is a major sin. The many texts of the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) that enjoin upholding ties of kinship highlight the great importance of this matter in our religion. One of the greatest aims of sharee‘ah (Islamic law) is to bring people together and maintain the ties of brotherhood and kinship among them. \nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Those who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e. they are good to their relatives and do not sever the bond of kinship), fear their Lord, and dread the terrible reckoning (i.e. abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which Allah has forbidden and perform all kinds of good deeds which Allah has ordained).”\n[ar-Ra‘d 13:21].\nAmong the reports of the Prophet’s (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Sunnah which give a stern warning against severing the ties of kinship is the following: \nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n“Allah created the universe, and when He had finished, kinship (al-rahim) stood up and said, ‘This is the standing up of one who seeks Your protection from being cut off.’ Allah said, ‘Yes, would it please you if I were to take care of those who take care of you and cut off those who cut you off?’ It said, ‘Of course.’ Allah said, ‘Then your prayer is granted.’” \nThen the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Recite, if you wish: ‘Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship? Such are they whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight. Do they not then think deeply in the Quran, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?’ [Muhammad 47:22-24].” \nNarrated by al-Bukhari, 5987; Muslim, 2554 \nIf people were to ponder what causes the severing of family ties amongst them, they would find the cause is disputes about some materialistic issues which will not avail for anything before Allah on the Day of Resurrection; or it may be because of what the Shaytan stirs up amongst them, leading to enmity and resentment amongst them because of insignificant reasons that are not worth paying any attention to in the first place. \nThis happens despite the fact that Islam enjoins upholding the ties of kinship even if there are considerable reasons for cutting ties, and it encourages the believers to overlook mistakes and to adopt a forgiving and tolerant attitude, not to seek out mistakes and nurture resentment, grudges and envy. \nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said: O Messenger of Allah, I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off. I treat them well, but they abuse me. I am patient and kind towards them, but they insult me. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you are as you say, then it is as if you are putting hot ashes in their mouths. Allah will continue to support you as long as you continue to do that.”\nNarrated by Muslim, 2558 \nAn-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim (16/115):\nIgnorance here refers to bad speech. What this hadith means is that it will be like feeding them hot ashes. This is a metaphor for the pain they will feel, like the pain of one who eats hot ashes. There will be no sin on this doer of good, rather they will be sinning greatly for cutting him off and causing him harm. \nAnd it was said that what is meant is that by treating them kindly you will make them feel ashamed of themselves because of how kindly you treat them and how badly they have treated you. And Allah knows best. End quote. \nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n“The upholder of kinship ties is not the one who is kind to them if they are kind to him, rather the upholder of kinship ties is the one who, if his relatives cut him off, he upholds the ties of kinship with them.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari, 5991. \nThis is the conduct and attitude enjoined by Islam. No one should hesitate to denounce the one who cuts off ties with his sister or his mother. It is not permissible for you to go along with your father in cutting off ties with his sister; rather you have to uphold ties with her and treat her kindly, and try to reconcile between her and your father, doing all that you can to achieve this. \nPlease see also the answers to questions no.  4631, 7571 and 75411\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Answer: Family Disputes in Islam\n\nFamily disputes are a common challenge faced by many, and Islam provides specific guidelines on managing conflicts, particularly in the context of marriage and familial relations. The Quran contains verses that advocate for fairness, compassion, and respect in dealings with family members, especially in situations involving divorce and inheritance.\n\n#### 1. Guidelines on Marriage and Divorce\nIslam places significant emphasis on the rights and responsibilities of both husbands and wives in relationships. \n\n- **Divorce Regulations**: The Quran mentions that divorce should be approached thoughtfully and respectfully. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:229-232) states: \n  > \"Divorce is (revocable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honourably, or part with them in a decent way...\" \n  This shows that divorce should not be a hasty decision, and if it must happen, it should be done fairly.\n\n- **Respect During Divorce**: Surah At-Talaq (65:1-3) stresses the importance of treating divorced spouses with respect during and after the divorce process:\n  > \"O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their appointed period, and calculate that period, and fear God, your Lord. Do not expel them from their houses, nor should they go away themselves, unless they are openly guilty of adultery...\"\n\n  It emphasizes the importance of a dignified separation without harassment.\n\n- **Financial Support**: In Surah At-Talaq (65:6), Allah instructs:\n  > \"House the (divorced) women where you live, according to your means; but do not harass them so as to reduce them to straitened circumstances.\"\n  This reinforces the duty of financial responsibility towards ex-spouses, especially during pregnancy and child-rearing.\n\n#### 2. Rights and Inheritance\nIslamic law places great emphasis on the equitable distribution of property and rights of family members after a person's death.\n\n- **Inheritance Rules**: Surah An-Nisa (4:8-12) outlines the shares of the inheritance, ensuring that everyone related to the deceased is provided for in a fair manner:\n  > \"...As for the children, God decrees that the share of the male is equivalent to that of two females...\"\n\n  These rules not only prevent disputes but also ensure that vulnerable family members, such as orphans, are looked after.\n\n- **Be Fair in Financial Matters**: Surah Al-Baqarah (2:283) highlights fair dealings:\n  > \"And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly or send it [in bribery] to the rulers in order that [they might aid] you [to] consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin...\"\n\n  This applies broadly to all financial transactions, reinforcing the notion of justice in family disputes concerning financial matters.\n\n#### 3. Resolving Conflicts\nIslam encourages open and respectful dialogue in resolving conflicts, rooted in mutual understanding and respect.\n\n- **Consultation**: Surah Ali 'Imran (3:61) illustrates the importance of discussion when disputes arise:\n  > \"Tell those who dispute this with you even after the knowledge that has reached you: 'Come, let us gather our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, and pray and solicit God to condemn those who lie.'\"\n\n  This verse emphasizes collective prayer and a communal approach to resolving disputes.\n\n#### 4. Consideration and Kindness\nThe Quran repeatedly emphasizes kindness, especially towards family. \n\n- **Empathy and Concern**: Surah At-Talaq (65:10) reminds believers to act with compassion:\n  > \"How many habitations rebelled against their Lord's command and His apostles; but We took them to severe task, and punished them with the harshest punishment.\"\n\n  This reflects the importance of adherence to divine commands, including those regarding family relations.\n\n### Conclusion\nFamily disputes can be complex and emotionally charged; however, the Quran provides comprehensive guidelines to navigate these challenges with grace, justice, and compassion. By adhering to these principles, one can foster a more harmonious family environment in accordance with Islamic teachings. The collective aim of these verses is to promote fairness, nurture empathy, and uphold the dignity of each family member in all circumstances."

        "question": "Prohibition of Shaking Hands With Non-Mahram Women",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    \n    Firstly: \n\n    In \n    Mukhtasar al-Akhdari and other Maliki books there is an indication that \n    it is haram to shake hands with a non-mahram woman according to the madhhab \n    of Malik (may Allah have mercy on him). \n\n    \n    ‘Aleesh said in Minah al-Jaleel Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel (1/22): It is \n    not permissible for a man to touch the face or hand of a non-mahram woman, \n    and it is not permissible for them to put their hands together without a \n    barrier. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace \n    and blessings of Allah be upon him) never accepted the oath of allegiance \n    (bay‘ah) of a woman by holding her hand; he would accept oaths of allegiance \n    from women verbally. According to another report: His hand never touched the \n    hand of a woman; rather he would accept their oath of allegiance verbally. \n    End quote. \n\n    \n    Secondly:\n\n    The \n    details that you mentioned have to do with nullifying wudu by touching; wudu \n    is nullified in the event of seeking pleasure, or finding pleasure (even if \n    he was not seeking it), or seeking it and finding it. Wudu is not nullified \n    when one does not seek pleasure or find it.\n\n    The \n    prohibition is connected to doing it deliberately, whether there is pleasure \n    or not.\n\n    For \n    more information please see the answer to question no. \n     \n    and \n    \n    \n    2459\n\n    And \n    Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, the prohibition of shaking hands with non-mahram (those who are not closely related) women is rooted in the principles of modesty, chastity, and the overarching guidelines of interaction between genders. \n\n### 1. **Concept of Mahram**\nA mahram is someone who a person is closely related to and with whom marriage is not permissible. This includes one's parents, siblings, and children. The Quran emphasizes the importance of recognizing these relationships.\n\n### 2. **Modesty and Interaction**\nThe guidelines for modest interaction between men and women are deeply embedded in several Quranic verses, which stress the importance of maintaining a respectful distance.\n\n#### Supporting Verses:\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:59)**: This verse instructs believing women to draw their cloaks over themselves, so as to be recognized and not harassed. The underlying principle is to maintain dignity and modesty:\n  > \"O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.\" (Al-Ahzab 33:59)\n\n- **Surah Al-Nur (24:30-31)**: These verses advise both men and women to lower their gaze and guard their modesty:\n  > \"Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do. And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts...\" (Al-Nur 24:30-31)\n\nThese verses highlight the broader Islamic teaching that discourages any form of intimate physical contact outside of marriage or close family ties.\n\n### 3. **Respect for Boundaries**\nRespecting boundaries is an important aspect of Islamic ethics, ensuring that relationships between genders remain professional and respectful.\n\n#### Supporting Verse:\n- **Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:10)** indicates that Islamic law acknowledges the boundaries in relationships with non-believers, emphasizing a distinction between different faiths that could affect interpersonal relations:\n  > \"O you who have believed, when the believing women come to you as refugees, examine them. Allah is most knowing of their faith.\" (Al-Mumtahanah 60:10)\n\n### 4. **The Example of the Prophet**\nBesides the Quran, the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (Hadith) further clarify the interaction between genders. Hadith literature contains various accounts where the Prophet advised against physical contact between men and non-mahram women.\n\n#### Supporting Hadith:\nA well-known narration from Sahih Muslim mentions that the Prophet said:\n> “It is better for one of you to be stabbed in the head with an iron needle than to touch the hand of a woman who is not lawful for him.” (Narrated by Muslim)\n\nThis hadith exemplifies the strictness regarding physical contact with non-mahram individuals.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the prohibition against shaking hands with non-mahram women in Islam is not merely a cultural norm but is based on Quranic injunctions and Prophetic teachings aimed at preserving modesty, preventing temptation, and maintaining the sanctity of relationships. Thus, following these guidelines fosters an environment of respect and dignity in societal interactions."

        "question": "Responding to Greeting of Parrot",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nAl-Fayyoomi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe babgha (parrot) is a well-known bird. The word babgha may be masculine or feminine, and the plural is Babghawat. \nAl-Misbah al-Muneer fi Ghareeb al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 1/35 \nSecondly: \nIt seems that it is not prescribed to return the greeting of a parrot which has learnt how to say salams (Islamic greeting), because saying salam is an act of worship and a supplication which requires intention on the part of the one who said it, and there is no such intention on the part of this trained creature. So one should not return its greeting. The ruling is the same as that on a tape on which the greeting is recorded and can be heard. It is a transmission of sound and does not come under the ruling on greeting when it is broadcast live, in which case returning the greeting is prescribed and is a communal obligation (fard kifayah).\nAl-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSometimes the greeting may be recorded and they put it on the tape and run it. If it is recorded then you are not obliged to return the greeting, because this is just a transmission of sound. \nLiqa’ al-Bab al-Maftooh, 28/229 \nSee the rest of the fatwa and details on this issue in the answer to question number  128737.\nBased on this, the parrot does not intend to give the greeting of salam, because it does not possess the power of reason, and when it speaks it is just repeating what it has been taught, without meaning what it says. \nSome of the scholars have stated that it is not prescribed to prostrate if one hears a verse from a parrot or from a recorded tape. \nOne of the conclusions of the book Bahjat al-Asma‘ fi Ahkam al-Sama‘ fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami by Prof. ‘Ali ibn Dhariyan ibn Faris al-Hasan al-‘Anzi (published by Dar al-Manar in Kuwait) is: \nThe listener need not do the prostration of recitation if he hears it from a source that is not human, such as a trained bird like a parrot or hearing it from an echo. End quote. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, responding to a greeting is an important principle that reflects respect and good manners, as it aligns with the teachings of the Quran regarding greetings and hospitality. This principle is exemplified in several verses and traditions.\n\n### Quranic Principles on Greetings\n\n1. **Surah An-Nur (24:61)**:\n   This verse emphasizes the importance of greeting others and invoking blessings upon them:\n   > \"There is no harm in your eating together or separately. But when you enter houses, salute the inmates with a greeting in the name of God, invoking blessings and good health.\"\n   - *Reference: Quran (24:61)*\n\n   This verse establishes that it is customary and encouraged to greet those you are visiting, which harmonizes with the notion of responding to greetings.\n\n2. **Surah An-Nahl (16:90)**:\n   In this verse, God commands us to uphold justice and fulfill obligations, which includes social interactions such as greetings:\n   > \"Indeed, God commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice.\"\n   - *Reference: Quran (16:90)*\n\n   Although this verse does not directly speak about greetings, it reflects the broader principles of social conduct and justice, suggesting goodwill in interactions.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:83)**:\n   While this verse deals with the commitments made by the children of Israel, it alludes to the overall expectation of kindness and respect in dealings, which can be extended to how Muslims greet each other:\n   > \"And [mention] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], 'Do not worship except Allah; and to parents, do good...\"\n   - *Reference: Quran (2:83)*\n\n### Practice of Responding to Greetings\n\nIn several hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him), the importance of responding to a greeting is emphasized. The Prophet said:\n- \"When one of you is greeted, he should respond to the greeting.\" (Sahih Muslim)\n- The Prophet (peace be upon him) also mentioned, \"The most beloved of the people to Allah is the one who initiates the greeting.\" \n\nThese teachings provide a comprehensive understanding that responding to greetings is not just a matter of politeness but also an act of kindness and sociability.\n\n### Example from Prophets\n\nIn Surah Adh-Dhariyat (51:25-29), the story of the angels visiting Prophet Abraham (Ibrahim) showcases the practice of greeting guests:\n> \"When they came to him, they said: 'Peace.' He answered: 'Peace.' They were a people he did not recognize.\"\n- *Reference: Quran (51:25)*\n\nThis recounts a scenario where the greeting is crucial, demonstrating mutual respect and peace.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, responding to greetings is an essential aspect of Islamic etiquette directly supported by Quranic verses and hadiths. The principles of respect, peace, and social responsibility manifest in the practice of greetings, fostering a sense of community and goodwill among individuals. The examples provided from the Quran emphasize the significance of these interactions and set a standard for how Muslims should conduct themselves socially."
