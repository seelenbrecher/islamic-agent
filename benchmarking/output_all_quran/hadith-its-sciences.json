        "question": "What are the reasons why the hadiths were written down?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe writing down of the hadiths refers, in general terms, to the narrator writing down his reports on paper. This was known from the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThe main reason for that was to document and protect the reports from being lost or forgotten.\nThis reason is so clear that there is no need for further discussion of proof.\nOne example of that is what was narrated by al-Bukhari (113) from Abu Hurayrah, who said: There is no one among the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who narrated more from him than me, except ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr, who wrote down his hadiths and I did not.\nAt the time of the Sahabah and senior Tabi‘in, there were a number of people who wrote down some of their reports, but they did not pay attention to documenting the hadiths in a specific manner, compiling them in books as the Quran was compiled in one mushaf. There are a number of reports which indicate that they were not in favour of compiling the hadiths in a book.\nThere were two reasons for that:\n-1-\nThey wanted to protect the Quran from being abandoned, or to avoid anything being written down at the time when the Sahabah were collecting the Quran in writing, lest the two things become mixed and confused.\n-2-\nAt that time, the hadiths contained only the words and actions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which explained the verses of the Quran. The isnads (chains of narration) were also brief and were hardly mentioned; they were not so lengthy that the Arabs would not be able to memorize them, for they were people who had excellent memories and were keen to maintain that skill by memorizing things. Moreover, the hadiths are not like the Quran, recitation of which is an act of worship; the hadiths are to be acted upon. As that is the case, there was no need for each of the Sahabah to know all the hadiths with their exact wording; rather it was sufficient for each of them to know some of the hadiths, then ask one another [about other hadiths] when necessary.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn Islamic terms, what matters with regard to the hadiths is their meanings. They are not like the Quran, in which what matters is both the exact wording and the meaning, because it is the word of Allah in both wording and meaning, and is miraculous in both wording and meaning, and it is recited as an act of worship with its wording exactly as it was revealed. So it is no wonder that Allah reduced their burden and made it sufficient, in most cases, for some of the Sahabah to be aware of the hadiths and convey them.\"(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi 12/43).\nSome of them at that time would narrate hadiths and would seek out hadiths when necessary for practical reasons, so that they could act upon them, without going beyond that.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n… It was narrated from ‘Umar that he forbade narrating a lot of hadiths, and he did that for two reasons:\n-1-\n‘Umar’s preference was that narrating hadiths should only be done when needed.\n-2-\nWhat he stated clearly, which was that he preferred people not to be distracted from the Quran by listening to hadiths when there was no need to do so.\nIt was narrated from him that he said: “Narrate few hadiths from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and only narrate that which is needed to be acted upon.”\nThe reference to acting in this quotation is general in meaning, and includes acts of worship, interactions with others and etiquette.\"(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi  12/61).\nDealing with the situation in that manner made it easy for them to memorize what they needed, therefore there was no urgent need to write the hadiths in a book. This is similar to the case of the Quran, which was revealed little by little, which made it easy for them to memorize it without needing to have the entire Quran in one book.\nAl-Khatib al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt has been proven that those who did not like to write down hadiths during the early period of Islam only disliked that so that no other book would be given the same importance as the Book of Allah, and the people would not be distracted from the Quran by anything else. Thus the Muslims were forbidden to acquire and read the previous Scriptures, because it is not possible to know what of their contents is true and what is false. Moreover, the Quran is sufficient and there is no need for the earlier Scriptures, because it supersedes them. And books of knowledge were prohibited during the earliest period, when Islam was very new, because there were so few people with proper knowledge at that time who could distinguish between revelation and other things. Most of the Bedouin had no understanding of religion and did not spend time with the scholars and knowledgeable people, so there was the possibility that they might confuse the books of hadith with the words of Allah in the Quran, and might believe that what was contained in the books of hadith was the words of Allah.\nThe people were instructed to memorize hadiths, because the isnads were short, as it was not long after the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). They were forbidden to rely on books, because that would lead to a decline in memorization to the point that it would be almost non-existent, but if there was no writing down of hadiths, then people’s memories would become strong, for a person’s memory is with him wherever he goes.\"(Taqyid al-‘Ilm  p. 57).\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThose scholars who disapproved of the writing down of hadiths disapproved for two reasons:\nThe first reason was so that there would be no book that was given the same importance as the Quran.\nThe second reason was so that the one who wrote down hadiths would not rely on what he had written and forego memorizing, in which case there would be fewer people who memorized hadiths.\"(Jami‘ Bayan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi  1/292).\nSecondly:\nLater on, especially in the second century AH, there emerged an urgent need to write down the hadiths in books, because the situation had changed. The hadiths had become widely circulated among people, because when the Tabi‘in realized that the number of Sahabah and senior Tabi‘in was declining due to their dying, they strove to seek out the hadiths that they had narrated, which they collected and kept in written form.\nAl-Bukhari (99) narrated from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz that he wrote to Abu Bakr ibn Hazm, saying: Seek out whatever hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are extant and write them down, for I am afraid that with the death of the scholars, knowledge will disappear.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs a matter-of-fact, some of the senior Sahabah thought that conveying of hadiths was only to be done at a time of need, and they thought that if they conveyed hadiths to others when there was no need for that, there was the possibility of error for which they could be called to account, unlike when there was a need, in which case conveying what they knew of hadith was a must, and either Allah would protect them from error or a He would not bring them to account for it. Hence hadiths were narrated from all of them, and it was never narrated from any of them that he knew a hadith, but when there was a need to act according to its guidelines he refused to narrate it.\nSome other Sahabah narrated hadiths even when there was no need for that, because they thought that conveying them before the need arose was something good, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Narrate from me, and there is nothing wrong with it.” And there is other evidence which speaks of conveying knowledge and conveying hadiths.\nEach of the two views has a point, and the scholars were all aiming to do good.\nBut when the number of Sahabah became few, the view of the second group carried more weight.\"(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi 12/61).\nThis is like the case of the Quran at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): there was no urgent need to put it all together in a written book, but as the reciters among the Sahabah who had memorized it began to die one after another, there emerged the need to compile it all in one master copy.\nIt was narrated from ‘Ubayd ibn as-Sabbaq that Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Abu Bakr sent for me when the people of Yamamah had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against Musaylimah). (I went to him) and found 'Umar bin al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said (to me):‘ ‘Umar has come to me and said: Casualties were heavy among the reciters of the Quran (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) at the Battle of Yamamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the reciters on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Quran may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you [Abu Bakr] should issue orders that the Quran be collected.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4986).\nAnd there are many similar reports, because the hadiths had begun to include the fatwas and verdicts of the Sahabah, then the views and fatwas of the Tabi‘in.\n‘Abd ar-Razzaq narrated in al-Musannaf (11/258) from Ma‘mar that Salih ibn Kaysan said: I met Ibn Shihab when we were both seeking knowledge, and we agreed to write down some hadiths and other reports. So we wrote down everything that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then we wrote down what was narrated from his companions. I said: No, it is not part of the Sunnah. But he said: Yes, it is part of the Sunnah. So he wrote it down and I did not; he did well and I missed out.\nThen the isnads (chains of narration) became lengthy and numerous, because the number of narrators increased.\nIn addition to that, many views of innovators began to spread among the people, and views based on personal opinion and fabrications of hadiths and reports also became widespread.\nAll of this prompted the leading scholars of hadith and Sunnah to compile what they had collected of hadiths in specialized books, so as to preserve the Sunnah and spread it among people.\nAl-Khatib al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nScholars only began to write down knowledge and rely on writing down hadiths in books, after having been reluctant to do that, because hadiths and reports had become widespread; isnads had become longer; the names, kunyahs and lineages of narrators had become numerous; and technical terms varied, and people were unable to memorize all of that…\"(Taqyid al-‘Ilm  p. 64).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should understand, may Allah increase me and you in knowledge, that the reports of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were not written down in books at the time of his Companions and the senior Tabi‘in, and they were not sorted into categories, for two reasons:\nThe first reason was because, in the beginning, they were forbidden to do that, as is proven in Sahih Muslim, because of the fear that some of that might become mixed with the Quran.\nThe second reason was because they had the ability to memorise things and their minds were clear, and because most of them did not know how to read and write.\nThen towards the end of the time of the Tabi‘in, the writing down of hadiths and reports began, and similar hadiths and reports were grouped together in different categories, when the scholars scattered throughout different regions, and a lot of innovations appeared on the part of the Kharijis, Rafidis and those who denied the divine decree (Qadaris).\nThe first ones to compile the reports in books were ar-Rabi‘ ibn Subayh and Sa‘id ibn Abi ‘Urubah…\"(Hadi as-Sari p. 6).\nThis has to do with general reasons, but there may have been specific reasons too. The author of each book may have had a specific motive, on the basis of which he chose to put hadiths in certain categories. For example, it is well known that al-Bukhari divided his book al-Jami‘ as-Sahih [Sahih al-Bukhari] into various categories for certain reasons.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAbu ‘Abdillah Muhammad ibn Isma‘il al-Bukhari said: We were with Ishaq ibn Rahawayh and he said: Why do you not write a brief book in which you record the sound hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?\nHe said: I liked that idea, so I began to compile the book of al-Jami‘ as-Sahih [Sahih al-Bukhari] …\"(Hadi as-Sari  7).\nAbu Musa al-Madini narrated in Khasa’is Musnad al-Imam Ahmad (p. 14):\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: I said to my father (may Allah have mercy on him): Why did you not like people to write books, then you did al-Musnad?\nHe said: I wrote this book to be a reference book, so that if people differed concerning the hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), they can refer to it.

        "predicted_answer": "The writing down of hadiths (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) was undertaken for several important reasons that align with the broader objectives of Islam as indicated in the Quran. Below are detailed reasons followed by supporting references.\n\n### 1. Preservation of Knowledge\nOne of the primary reasons for documenting hadiths was to preserve the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. Since the Quran acknowledged the necessity of following divine guidance, hadiths became essential for interpreting and implementing Quranic principles. \n\nSupporting Evidence:\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:67)**: \"O Prophet, announce what has reached you from your Lord; if you do not, you will not have delivered His message.\" This emphasizes the need to convey the message accurately, reinforcing the importance of preserving the Prophet's teachings.\n  \n### 2. Guidance for the Community\nHadiths provide practical guidance on various aspects of life that are not explicitly detailed in the Quran. The Prophet's explanations and examples help followers implement Islamic law and ethics in daily life.\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n- **Surah Al-Qasas (28:45-46)**: \"You were not present on the side of Mount Sinai when We gave the commandments to Moses, nor were you witness (to the event).\" This indicates that the teachings of past prophets were crucial for guidance. Just as Moses received guidance, so too did Muhammad, and both needed documentation to guide their respective communities.\n\n### 3. Clarification of the Quran\nHadiths serve to clarify ambiguities in the Quran and provide context for its verses. They elucidate how specific verses should be understood and applied in various situations. \n\nSupporting Evidence:\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:101)**: \"O you who believe, do not ask about things which, if made known to you, may vex you.\" This avoids confusion and despair that might arise without proper understanding, highlighting the necessity of teachings that provide clarity.\n\n### 4. Accountability and Responsibility\nThe documentation of hadiths imposes a collective responsibility on the Muslim community to know and follow the teachings of Islam. This fosters a sense of accountability among believers, as they are expected to adhere to the guidance provided by both the Quran and the Prophet.\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:105)**: \"O you who believe, on you rests (the responsibility) for your own selves.\" This reinforces the individual accountability and the importance of knowledge that is to be followed in faith and action, clearly communicating the significance of the hadiths.\n\n### 5. Preventing Misinterpretation and Fabrication\nBy documenting the sayings and actions of the Prophet, the Muslim community aimed to prevent misinterpretations and the spread of falsehoods about Islam. This step was crucial in maintaining the authenticity of the faith.\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:102)**: \"Such things were asked by a people before you, but they disbelieved them afterwards.\" This warning underscores the need to have authentic sources of knowledge to avoid falling into the traps of misunderstanding and disbelief.\n\n### 6. Accountability in Witness and Testimony\nJust as with the establishment of legal practices, the need for reliable witnesses was paramount. Documenting hadiths ensured that the community had valid references for testimony and legal decisions.\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:106)**: \"O you who believe, let two honest men among you be witness...\" This calls for verification of information within a community, pertinent to both the legal and ethical teachings found within hadiths.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe compilation of hadiths was not merely an act of recording historical events but a significant step towards ensuring the longevity and purity of the Islamic faith. Each hadith serves as a critical link between the Quranic revelations and the practical implementation of Islam in daily life, thus fostering a well-guided community. Through these documented accounts, future generations are provided with a comprehensive understanding of their faith, leading to a cohesive and practice-oriented Muslim identity."

        "question": "Is memorizing hadith in translation like memorizing it in Arabic?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to memorizing and learning the Prophet’s Sunnah, undoubtedly the basic principle is that all of that – for the one who is able – should be done in Arabic, the language in which the revelation came, and in which the hadiths were narrated in the books of Sunnah. This is better than memorizing the meanings translated into other languages, for two important reasons:\nThe first reason is:\nArabic is one of the symbols of Islam, and it is the language that was chosen by Allah, may He be exalted, to transmit the message of Islam. Whenever the Muslim is able to learn his religion in this language, he should not turn to any other language. This was the view of the righteous early generations.\nAsh-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nEvery Muslim must learn as much of the language of the Arabs as he is able to so that he can testify in Arabic that La ilaha illa Allah wa Muhammad ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger), and he can recite the Book of Allah in Arabic, and recite the words of dhikr that he is enjoined to recite, such as takbir, tasbih and the tashahhud, and so on.\nThe more knowledge he can learn in the language which Allah made the language of the last of His Prophets and in which He revealed the last of His Books, the better it will be for him. End quote from ar-Risalah (p. 48-49).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAsh-Shafa‘i said: … The language which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose was the language of the Arabs, in which He sent down His holy Book, and He made it the language of the last of His Prophets, Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nHence we say: everyone who is able to learn Arabic should learn it, because it is the foremost language that one should strive to learn, without forbidding anyone to speak a non-Arabic language.\nAsh-Shafa‘i regarded it as disliked for one who knows Arabic to give names in any other language, or to speak it mixed with foreign words. What the leading scholars said concerning this issue was narrated from the Sahabah and Tabi‘in. End quote from Iqtida’ as-Sirat al-Mustaqim (1/521-522).\nThe second reason is:\nTranslated hadiths are translations of the meanings, and there are a number of hadiths in which the words are to be pronounced as they are in Arabic, so the one who memorizes them should pay attention to their pronunciation in Arabic as much as he is able, such as the hadiths which mention adhkar. This is indicated by the hadith of al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib, who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“When you go to your bed, do wudu’ as for prayer, then lie down on your right side and say: \nAllahumma aslamtu wajhi ilayka wa fawwadtu amri ilayka wa alja’tu zahri ilayka raghbatan wa rahbatan ilayka, la malja’a wa laa manjaa minka illa ilayka. Allahumma amantu bi kitabika alladhi anzalta wa nabiyyika alladhi arsalta (O Allah I submit my face to You, and I entrust my affairs to You, and I rely totally on You in hope and in fear of You. Verily there is no refuge nor safe haven from You except with You. O Allah, I believe in Your Book which You have revealed and in Your Prophet whom You have sent).  \nThen if you die during the night, you will have died following the fitrah (sound nature of man). Make these the last words that you speak.” \nHe said: I repeated it back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and when I reached the words. “Allahumma aamantu bi kitaabika alladhi anzalta (O Allah, I believe in Your Book which You have revealed),” I said: “Wa rasulika (And Your Messenger).” He said: “No. Wa nabiyyika alladhi arsalta (and Your Prophet whom You sent).”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (247) and Muslim (2710).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe most appropriate thing that can be said regarding the reason why the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) corrected the one who said “rasul (messenger)” instead of “nabi (prophet)” is that the wording of adhkar is tawqifi [i.e., they can only be known through divine Revelation and sound texts of hadith, with no room for ijtihad or alteration]. They must be recited as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recited them, because that pronunciation has special effects and benefits, and they should not be altered. Therefore they must be recited with the same pronunciation that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is the view favoured by al-Maziri… End quote from Fath al-Bari (11/112).\nWith regard to other hadiths, in many cases there is a difference of scholarly opinion regarding their interpretation, so a translation will be based on the meaning favoured by the translator, or on what he understood, which may based on a weaker scholarly view, or it may be based on his own understanding which is incorrect, or it may be incorrectly expressed in the language into which it is translated.\nIn some hadiths, the Arabic wording may indicate a number of meanings, some of which are lost in translation, so the one who reads the translation understands only one meaning, and if the translator aimed to encompass all the meanings that are contained in the hadith, the translation would be so long that the one who wants to memorize it would tire of it.\nBut for the one who is not able to learn Arabic or memorize in Arabic, so he memorizes in his own language, he is still doing well. All that he is lacking is the pronunciation in Arabic, but if understands the meaning, this is beneficial knowledge that he has acquired, even if that has to do with adhkar, supplications (du‘a’s), ruqyah and the like. So there is nothing wrong with him offering supplication in translation, and remembering Allah in his language that he is able to speak.\nFor more information, see the answers to questions no. 262254 and 318586 .\nConclusion:\nThe one who is able to learn Arabic should study the Prophet’s Sunnah and memorize it in Arabic, with the pronunciation narrated in the books of Sunnah, because Arabic is a symbol of Islam and is the language in which the revelation came.\nMemorizing in Arabic means memorizing the pronunciation, and in some cases the pronunciation is essential and required, such as adhkar. That will also preserve the full meanings, some of which may be lost in translation.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Memorizing Hadith, whether in translation or in Arabic, invites an exploration of the intent and the importance of language in the preservation of Islamic teachings. Here are some insights into this topic:\n\n### Importance of Arabic in Memorization\n\n1. **Authenticity and Precision**: One of the key reasons that Arabic is emphasized in memorization is that Hadith texts, much like the Qur'an, carry specific meanings and nuances that can sometimes be lost in translation. The structure, style, and vocabulary of Arabic serve to convey not just the literal meaning but also the spiritual and cultural context. This view aligns with the importance placed on the Arabic language in Islam, as it is the language of the Qur'an. Surah Al-Humazah (Surah 104) emphasizes understanding through depth rather than superficial knowledge (Al-Humazah 5-9).\n\n   **Surah Al-Humazah 5-9**: \n   > \"How will you comprehend what Hutama is? It is the fire kindled by God which penetrates the hearts...\"\n\n2. **Preservation of Teachings**: Memorizing Hadith in the original Arabic helps ensure that the teachings are preserved as they were originally conveyed by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Arabic serves as a safeguard against dilution or misinterpretation, as altering the wording can change its implications. The Qur'an itself underscores the importance of remembering and reciting the messages delivered (Surah Taha 1-3).\n\n   **Surah Taha 1-3**: \n   > \"TA HA. We have not sent down the Qur'an to you that you should be burdened, but as admonition for him who fears...\"\n\n### Translation and Its Limitations\n\n1. **Understanding Context**: While translating Hadith into another language can facilitate understanding for non-Arabic speakers, it may not capture the full context and depth of meaning intended in the original Arabic text. The nuances of Arabic grammar and idiomatic expressions often do not have direct equivalents in other languages. \n\n2. **Goal of Memorization**: The ultimate goal of memorization—whether in Arabic or translation—should be to understand and embody the teachings of the Prophet. Surah Al-A'la suggests that God will aid in the remembrance and understanding of His message (Surah Al-A'la 6-10).\n\n   **Surah Al-A'la 6-10**: \n   > \"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, unless God may please...\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while memorizing Hadith in translation can aid comprehension and accessibility, it does not entirely replicate the experience of memorizing it in Arabic, where the authenticity, richness, and spiritual context are preserved. The verses from Surah Al-Humazah and Surah Taha speak to the significance of understanding, contemplation, and preservation, all of which are critically tied to the Arabic language in Islamic tradition. Thus, while both forms of memorization have their places, the Arabic versions are viewed as more authentic and complete."

        "question": "Is The Introduction of Sahih Muslim Part of it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nFirstly:\nWhat is known as the \"Introduction to Sahih Muslim\" refers to the pages that Imam Muslim wrote at the beginning of his book \"As-Sahih\" before he started narrating the Hadiths of the book, which (i.e., the introductory pages) amount to about 30 pages in the printed versions.\nHe did not give it a specific name, but began the content of the introduction without a title, where he said (may Allah have mercy on him):\n\"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, all praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds, And the [best] outcome is for the righteous, and may Allah send blessings upon Muhammad, the seal of the prophets, and upon all the prophets and messengers.\nTo proceed: You, may Allah bestow mercy on you by granting you success from your Creator, mentioned that you intended to examine the collection of reports transmitted from the Messenger of Allah(peace and blessings be upon him) concerning the Sunnahs of the religion and its rulings, and what there is of reward and punishment, encouragement and deterrence, and other types of matters with the chains of narration by which they were transmitted, and which the scholars have exchanged among themselves...\" End quote from \"Introduction to Sahih Muslim\" (p. 2).\nHowever, scholars have conventionally referred to these pages as \"The Introduction,\" and some call it \"Khutbat Al-Kitab.\"\nSecondly:\nThe subject of this introduction addresses the following points:\nFirst: Clarifying the reason for the book's composition.\nSecond: Explaining the subject of the book.\nThird: Describing his methodology in the book.\nFourth: Discussing some issues of Hadith sciences that the reader of the book should be aware of.\nThirdly:\nIs the introduction by Imam Muslim considered part of his book \"As-Sahih\"?\nIn terms of its narration and writing, it is not separate from \"As-Sahih\" because it has been narrated, copied, and printed as part of his book, and it has not been transmitted separately from it, so it is like any introduction or pologue of a book.\nBut in terms of its subject matter and content, it is not part of his book \"As-Sahih\"; rather, it is merely its introduction.\nThis is understood from the action of Imam Muslim, where he said after concluding the introduction:\n\"With the help of Allah, we begin, and we seek sufficiency in Him, and our success is only through Allah, Glorious is His Majesty.\" End quote from \"Sahih Muslim\" (1/28).\nThen he began to mention the Hadiths of his book.\nScholars have conventionally distinguished between \"The Introduction\" and \"As-Sahih.\" When they attribute a Hadith mentioned by Imam Muslim in \"The Introduction,\" they do not usually say it was narrated by Muslim in his \"Sahih,\" but rather they say it was narrated in \"The Introduction to As-Sahih,\" as is evident from the practice of Al-Mizzi in his book \"Tuhfat Al-Ashraf,\" and other scholars.\nThis distinction is clearly evident from what Al-Mizzi said in the introduction to his book \"Tuhfat Al-Ashraf bi M`arifat Al-Atraf\":\n\"... To proceed: I have resolved, Allah willing, to compile in this book the common portions of the six books which are the mainstay of the Muslims and upon which most rulings revolve, namely:\nSahih Muhammad ibn Ismail Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim ibn Al-Hajjaj An-Naysaburi, Sunan Abu Dawud As-Sijistani, Jami` Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi, Sunan Abu `Abd Ar-Rahman An-Nasa’i, and Sunan Abu `Abdullah Ibn Majah Al-Qazwini, and what is similar to them, such as: The Introduction to the book of Muslim...\" End quote from \"Tuhfat Al-Ashraf\" (1/3 - 4).\nLikewise, they differentiate between the narrators mentioned in the introduction and those whose Hadiths Imam Muslim narrated in the main body of his book \"As-Sahih.\"\nThe narrator whose Hadiths Imam Muslim only narrates in the introduction is described as being among the men of Muslim in \"The Introduction,\" as Al-Mizzi did in his book \"Tahdhib Al-Kamal,\" where he said in the introduction to his book, defining the symbols of his book:\n\"The symbol for what Muslim narrated in As-Sahih is: (M), and the symbol for what he narrated in the introduction to his book is: (MQ)\" End quote from \"Tahdhib Al-Kamal\" (1/149).\nThose who came after him did something similar in the biographies of the narrators.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\"... As for your saying: Muslim narrated from Sufyan ibn Husayn in his \"Sahih,\" it is not as you mentioned, but rather he narrated from him in the introduction to his book. Muslim did not stipulate in it what he stipulated in the book regarding authenticity, so it has its own status, and the rest of his book has another status, and the people of Hadith have no doubt about this.\" End quote from \"Al-Furusiyya Al-Muhammadiyya\" (1/183).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Introduction of Sahih Muslim is indeed part of the collection known as Sahih Muslim. Sahih Muslim is one of the most respected compilations of hadith in the Islamic tradition, along with Sahih al-Bukhari. It is attributed to the scholar Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, who dedicated his life to the collection and verification of hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad).\n\n### Structure of Sahih Muslim\n\n1. **Format and Organization**: Sahih Muslim is structured into books (or chapters) that cover various aspects of Islamic belief, practice, and law, such as prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage. The Introduction serves to outline the methodology used by Imam Muslim in his compilation. In this section, he discusses the importance of hadith, his criteria for accepting them, and the different chains of transmission that validate the narrations.\n\n2. **Criteria of Authenticity**: Imam Muslim emphasized the rigor of verifying hadith. He was known for his strict criteria regarding the reliability of the narrators involved in the transmission of hadith. This is discussed in the Introduction of his work.\n\n3. **Purpose of the Collection**: The overall aim of Sahih Muslim is to provide authentic sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, thereby offering guidance for Muslims in their everyday lives and spiritual pursuits. \n\n### Relevant Islamic Principles\n\nIn terms of the Islamic understanding of knowledge, one could reference some key principles from the Qur'an that highlight the importance of following the guidance brought by the messengers. While Sahih Muslim is not a Qur'anic text but rather a compilation of hadith, the following verses can be seen as indicative of the trust in divine guidance:\n\n- **Obedience to the Messenger**: \n   - *Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:67)*: \"O Prophet, announce what has reached you from your Lord, for if you do not, you will not have delivered His message\" (5:67).\n   - This verse emphasizes the importance of conveying God's message, akin to the purpose of the hadith collections.\n  \n- **Clarity and Guidance**: \n   - *Surah Al-Mu'minun (23:51-52)*: \"O you apostles, eat things that are clean, and do things that are good. We are surely cognizant of what you do\" (23:51-52).\n   - This verse reflects the emphasis on the purity of actions and intentions, which resonates with the purpose of hadith literature.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the Introduction of Sahih Muslim is not only a formal preface to the hadith collection but also lays down the foundational principles for understanding and utilizing the hadiths correctly in daily life. It is crucial for readers and scholars alike to be aware of the methodologies employed by Imam Muslim, as this underpins the authenticity and reliability of the teachings derived from his compilation. The referenced verses from the Qur'an underscore the significance of following divine guidance as articulated through the Prophet Muhammad and validate the ongoing relevance of hadith literature in Islam."

        "question": "Are ahaad hadiths probably sound or definitively sound, and what is the view of at-Tabari and Ibn Taymiyah concerning that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.1. Rejecting ahaad hadiths is rejecting most of what is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) [as-Sunnah an-nabawiyyah]\nIf a hadith is soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), we must accept it and act in accordance with it, without differentiating between ahaad hadiths and mutawaatir hadiths.\nThis is the view of the Sahaabah and Taabi‘een, and of those who followed them in truth. They accept the hadith if its isnaad is sound, and they act in accordance with it, and they do not hesitate to do that.\nThe one who rejects ahaad hadiths rejects most of the Sunnah, because most of the reports are ahaad hadiths. This is contrary to the command of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning): {And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from} [al-Hashr 59:7].\nThis is a Qur’anic injunction to accept and follow what is narrated from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and it cannot be understood as referring only to the mutawaatir reports, which are few in number and limited, and do not cover all beliefs, acts of worship, interactions, and morals and manners.\nThe call to reject ahaad reports is a call to reject most of the Sunnah and to ignore the command mentioned in this verse.\n2. What is meant by hadiths that are definitively proven\nWhat is meant by hadiths that are definitively proven is hadiths that can be definitively proven to have been soundly narrated from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). They are of four types:\n\nMutawaatir hadiths.\nThose which were narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim and were accepted by the ummah.\nThose which the ummah unanimously agreed on and accepted as sound, even though they are not narrated in as-Saheehayn, because of what is well established, that the ummah is protected from error when they reach consensus on something.\nWidely-known reports that are narrated through many different chains of narrators, none of which are subject to any criticism.\n\nFor an explanation of that, please see the answer to question no. 197164 .\nBased on that, the claim that all the ahaad hadiths are not definitively proven is not correct; rather the ahaad hadiths that the ummah has accepted and regarded as sound, or that are widely circulated and narrated through many chains of narrators but have not reached the level of being mutawaatir, are still to be regarded as definitively proven.\n3. Dividing hadiths into mutawaatir and ahaad does not mean that there is doubt about the ahaad hadiths\nIn the answer to question no. 126571, we explained that dividing hadiths into mutawaatir and ahaad does not mean that there is doubt about the ahaad hadiths, and regarding the mutawaatir hadiths as being definitively sound does not mean that we cannot rely on the ahaad hadiths and accept them. We gave an example of that and explained it, so please refer to that question.\n4. Ahl as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed on accepting ahaad hadiths with regard to beliefs\nAhl as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed on accepting ahaad hadiths with regard to beliefs even if the hadith is to be attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the basis of probability. No one disagreed with that except innovators such as the Mu‘tazilah and their ilk.\nImam Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our companions and others differed regarding a report narrated by one narrator of good character: does it mean that it is definitively sound and we should act in accordance with it, or does it mean only that we should act in accordance with it but it is not definitively sound?\nThe view of most of the scholars regarding a report narrated by a sole narrator is that we should act in accordance with it but we cannot say that it is definitively sound [rather it is probably sound]. This is the view of ash-Shaafa‘i and most of the scholars of fiqh and men of reason; according to their view, we cannot be absolutely certain unless there is definitive proof, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that.\nMany scholars of hadith, and some men of reason – including al-Husayn al-Karaabeesi and others – said that we should both be certain of it and act in accordance with it. Ibn Khuwayz Mindaad stated that this view is in accordance with the view of Maalik.\nAbu ‘Umar said: What we say is that we should act in accordance with it but we cannot be completely certain of it, like when you have witnesses, whether two or four. This is the view of most of the scholars of fiqh and hadith; all of them are of the view that ahaad hadiths are to be accepted regarding issues of belief. This is the view of a number of Ahl as-Sunnah.. And Allah is our source of strength.\" (At-Tamheed  1/7).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars of fiqh and hadith in all regions, as far as I know, are unanimously agreed that the report of a single narrator of good character is to be accepted, and it is obligatory to act in accordance with it if it is proven and not abrogated by another report or by scholarly consensus.\nThis is the view of all the fuqaha’ throughout the ages, from the time of the Sahaabah until our own time, except the Khaarijis and some small groups of innovators who do not have any impact on scholarly consensus.\" (At-Tamheed  1/2).\nSo whether it is said that ahaad reports are proven on the basis of probability or are proven definitively, they must be accepted and acted upon with regard to both rulings and beliefs.\n5. The view of Imam at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) regarding ahaad hadiths\nThe view of Imam at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) does not differ from that of Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr, for he thinks that ahaad hadiths are not definitively proven, but we should accept them and act in accordance with them, even with regard to beliefs. He (may Allah have mercy on him) followed this view in his books.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the report is a kind that is as definitive as one who himself witnessed and heard, then the one who heard it should testify that what he is reporting is what happened, like testifying to a fact that he has seen and heard.\nBut if the report is a kind that is not definitive and does not dispel all doubts, but the one who is transmitting it is a person who is honest and of good character, then the one who hears his report must believe him and testify that he is narrating it as he heard it from him. That is similar to what we say about reports narrated by individuals of good character. We have explained this elsewhere, and there is no need to repeat it here.\" (At-Tabseer fi Ma‘aalim ad-Deen  p. 139).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is because the one whom the report reaches via one who heard it from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) can only be one of two things:\n\nEither the one who narrated the report to him is one individual or a group who are like one individual, meaning that they conveyed it in such a way that they did not leave him with no excuse not to follow it.\nOr he received the report from a group in such a way that he was left with no excuse not to follow it.\n\nSo if the one who conveyed that to him was one individual, or a group who are like one individual, in the sense that they would not leave no excuse for the one to whom they conveyed it not to accept it, then in that case:\nIf there is no one among them who is of good character and truthful, he does not have to act in accordance with the report and he does not have to accept their report.\nIf there is one among them who is of good character and truthful, then if that narrator conveyed the report to him, he must act in accordance with it but he does not have to believe that it is definitive.\" (Tahdheeb al-Aathaar  2/768).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There are some reports narrated by one narrator of good character or a group whose reporting does not lead to believing that their report is definitively sound, and does not leave the one who hears it with no excuse for not accepting it, but the one who hears it must still accept it.\nThere are some reports which are narrated in such a way that makes it obligatory for the one who hears them to believe that they are definitively proven, and leave no excuse for the one who hears them not to accept them. This is the transmission of a report by a group of people who are not prone to forgetfulness and error, and the way in which the report is transmitted shows that it is not possible that they could all have agreed upon a lie.\"(Tahdheeb al-Athaar, Musnad Talhah wa’-Zubayr, p. 439.\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no report that I have narrated or not narrated, with a sound chain of narrators who are trustworthy and of good character, going back to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and of Allah be upon him), but for us it is a true and sound report, and the Muslims are bound to accept it and act in accordance with it.\" (Tahdheeb al-Athaar  2/713).\nThus he (may Allah have mercy on him) regards it as obligatory to act in accordance with and accept as sound ahaad reports, and the ummah should accept them and act in accordance with them without differentiating between whether the report explains rulings or otherwise.\nSee: Usool ad-Deen ‘inda al-Imam at-Tabari by Dr. Ta-Ha Muhammad Naja, p. 61; Manhaj al-Imam Ibn Jareer at-Tabari fi Naqd al-Ahaadeeth, by Dr. Nabeelah Zayd ibn Sa‘d (2/707).\n6. The view of Ibn Taymiyah on acting in accordance with ahaad hadiths\nWith regard to Ibn Taymiyah, he thought that if there is evidence to prove that the ahaad hadith is sound, then we should believe that it is definitively proven, and he quoted ahaad reports as evidence for both rulings and beliefs.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Hence the correct view is that the ahaad report (khabar waahid) could reach the point of being definitively proven, if there is other evidence to raise it to the level of being definitive. Based on that, many of the texts in as-Saheehayn are regarded as being mutawaatir by scholars of hadith, even if others do not realize that they are mutawaatir. Hence most of the texts of as-Saheehayn are the type of reports which the scholars of hadith know definitively that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said those words, sometimes because they are mutawaatir in their view, and sometimes because the ummah accepted them and believed in their soundness.\nThe ahaad report (khabar waahid) that is widely accepted means that the hadith is definitively proven according to the majority of scholars among the companions of Abu Haneefah, Maalik, ash-Shaafa‘i and Ahmad. This is the view of most of the companions of al-Ash‘ari, such as al-Isfaraayeeni and Ibn Foorak. Although if we examine the report in and of itself, we would think that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it on the basis of probability, when there is scholarly consensus on accepting the hadith and believing it to be sound, it becomes like when the scholars of fiqh agree unanimously on a certain ruling, basing that ruling on what is apparent, or analogy, or an ahaad report (khabar waahid). Thus that ruling becomes definitive according to the majority, even though without taking this consensus into account it is not definitive, because the consensus of the ummah is protected from error.\nThe scholars who explain shar‘i rulings never agree unanimously to make permissible something that is prohibited or to make prohibited something that is permissible. The same applies to the scholars of hadith: they never agree unanimously to accept a fabricated hadith or to reject a sound hadith.\nSometimes one of them is aware of other, corroborating evidence to support a particular hadith, which makes him believe that it is definitively sound, and whoever comes to know what he knows about that hadith will reach the same conclusion as he reached.\" (Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa 18/40-41).\nConclusion:\nAll of the Muslim scholars accept ahaad hadiths concerning rulings on what is halaal and haraam. Most of them – and this is the view of Ahl as-Sunnah – also accept ahaad hadiths regarding beliefs. The issue of whether the reports are proven on the basis of probability or are definitive does not affect the obligation to accept them and act in accordance with them.\nRegarding the ruling on one who rejects the Sunnah, please see the answer to question no. 115125 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, the categorization of hadiths is crucial for understanding their authenticity and the degree to which they can be relied upon in matters of belief and practice. The terms *ahad* and *mutawatir* are often used to delineate the transmission authenticity, with *ahad* hadiths being those transmitted by a limited number of narrators, while *mutawatir* hadiths are transmitted by many from the beginning to the end of the chain.\n\n### Are Ahad Hadiths Probably Sound or Definitively Sound?\n\n**1. Ahad Hadiths:**\nAhad hadiths are generally considered to be of a weaker status than mutawatir hadiths. However, many scholars argue that *ahad* hadiths can still be sound (*sahih*) if they meet specific criteria regarding their chain of narrators and the integrity of their content. Scholars such as Al-Bukhari and Muslim have compiled collections that encompass both *mutawatir* and *ahad* hadiths and have specified the conditions under which they deemed certain *ahad* hadiths to be sound.\n\n**2. Scholarly Views:**\nRegarding the views of Islamic scholars, at-Tabari and Ibn Taymiyah expressed differing perspectives:\n\n- **At-Tabari:** He emphasized the importance of both *ahad* and *mutawatir* hadiths, recognizing that while *mutawatir* hadiths are preferable due to their consensus among narrators, *ahad* hadiths can also contribute valuable knowledge, especially if deemed authentic by reliable scholars.\n\n- **Ibn Taymiyah:** He argued that authentic *ahad* hadiths could indeed be sound and valid sources of religious law. He maintained that *ahad* hadiths, when verified, contribute significantly to Islamic legal and theological thought. He believed that many *ahad* hadiths possess strong reliability and that they can shape religious understanding despite their limited transmission scope.\n\n### Supporting Verses\n\nWhile specific verses from the Qur'an do not directly address hadith classification, the importance of following prophetic guidance can be gauged from multiple verses. An example would be:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:67):** \"O Prophet, announce what has reached you from your Lord, for if you do not, you will not have delivered His message. God will preserve you from (the mischief of) men; for God does not guide those who do not believe.\" \n  - This verse emphasizes the obligation to convey what has been revealed, which underscores the value of hadith in conveying the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:159):** \"Indeed, those who conceal what We revealed of clear proofs and guidance after We made it clear for the people in the Scripture - those are cursed by Allah and cursed by those who curse.\"\n  - This verse indicates the significance of authentic teachings and their transmission, which applies to hadiths as well.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while *ahad* hadiths are generally not viewed as definitively sound in the same manner as *mutawatir* hadiths, if authenticated, they form an important part of Islamic jurisprudence and theology. Scholars like at-Tabari and Ibn Taymiyah provide nuanced perspectives that allow for the acceptance of authentic *ahad* hadiths as valid contributions to religious understanding. Their deliberations advance the discussion on how *ahad* narrations hold value within the vast framework of Islamic tradition, despite their inherent limitations in transmission."

        "question": "Is there reward for reading the hadiths of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Yes, there is reward for reading books of all types of knowledge, and studying knowledge. Seeking knowledge through the Qur’an and Sunnah brings an immense reward, for knowledge is to be obtained from the Qur’an and from the Sunnah. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are those who learn Quran and teach it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5027). There are many hadiths which speak of reading Qur’an, including the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Read the Qur’an, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection interceding for its companions.” Narrated by Muslim (804).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Would one of you like to go to Bat-haan – a valley in Madinah – and bring two large she-camels without that involving any sin or severing of family ties?” They said: We would all like that, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “For one of you to go to the mosque and learn two verses from the Book of Allah is better for him than two large she-camels, and three (verses) are better for him than three (she-camels), and four (verses) are better for him than four (she-camels), and so on.” Narrated by Muslim (803), or as he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said. This is indicative of the virtue of learning the Qur’an and reciting the Qur’an.\nAccording to the hadith of Ibn Mas‘ood: “Whoever recites a letter of Qur’an will have one hasanah, and each hasanah brings a ten-fold reward.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2910). The same applies to the Sunnah, if the believer learns it; for reading and studying the hadiths will bring a great reward, because this comes under the heading of seeking knowledge. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever follows a path seeking knowledge thereby, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2646). This indicates that studying issues of knowledge, memorising hadiths and discussing them are among the means of gaining admittance to Paradise and being saved from Hell. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for a person, He grants him understanding of religion.” Agreed upon. Understanding of religon comes through studying the Qur’an and Sunnah. Acquiring knowledge of the Sunnah is one of the signs that Allah wills good for a person, just as acquiring knowledge of the Qur’an is also a sign of that. The evidence concerning that is abundant, praise be to Allah. End quote.\nFataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (1/11).",
        "predicted_answer": "Reading the Hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him) is associated with immense rewards and benefits in Islam. The Hadiths serve as a vital source of guidance for Muslims, complementing the teachings of the Qur'an. The spiritual rewards for reading and following these teachings could be inferred from a variety of Quranic verses that promote the virtues of obeying and remembering God and His messenger.\n\nOne significant verse is from **Surah Al-Anfal (8:2-4)**, which asserts that true believers are those whose hearts are filled with awe when God is mentioned, and whose faith is strengthened when His messages are read to them. The citation reads: \n\n> \"They are true believers whose hearts fill up with awe when the name of God is mentioned; and their faith is further strengthened when His messages are read out to them; and those who place their trust in their Lord.\" \n\nThus, reading the Hadith can strengthen a believer's faith and relationship with Allah (swt).\n\nIn addition, **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:31)** mentions that obedient individuals, including the wives of the Prophet, will be rewarded doubly for their adherence to God and His messenger:\n\n> \"But whoever of you is obedient to God and His Apostle, and does the right, will be given a two-fold reward by Us.\"\n\nThis verse hints that those who actively engage with Hadith literature, by learning and implementing its teachings, can expect rewards from Allah (swt).\n\nFurthermore, **Surah Al-Hadid (57:18)** states:\n\n> \"Surely the men and women who spend in charity, and give a goodly loan to God, will have it doubled for them and will receive a generous reward.\"\n\nThe concept of reward is closely linked to the idea of conveying knowledge, including acting upon that knowledge and sharing it with others. By reading Hadiths and applying their lessons, one also engages in acts of charity and goodness, which are consistently rewarded.\n\nLastly, **Surah Al-Hadid (57:11)** says:\n\n> \"Who will give a goodly loan to God which He will double for him, and be for him a splendid reward?\"\n\nThis metaphor can resonate with the act of reading Hadith as a form of 'loaning' good deeds to Allah through learning and implementing what is taught.\n\nIn summary, engaging with the Hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him) brings about spiritual growth, strengthens faith, and leads to rewards from Allah (swt). The aforementioned verses illustrate the significance of obeying and remembering God and His messenger, ultimately affirming the value of Hadiths in a believer's life."

        "question": "The du‘aa’ (supplication) that the Sahaabah used to recite in Qunoot al-Witr in the second half of Ramadan during the caliphate of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere are a number of hadiths which speak of Qunoot in Witr, the most famous of which is that which was narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (1718), Abu Dawood in his Sunan (1425), at-Tirmidhi in his Sunan (464), an-Nasaa’i in his Sunan (1745) and Ibn Maajah in his Sunan (1178) from al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught me words to say in Qunoot al-Witr:\n“Allaahumma ihdini feeman hadayta wa ‘aafini feeman ‘aafayta wa tawallani feeman tawallayta wa baarik li feema a‘tayta, wa qini sharra ma qadayta, fa innaka taqdi wa la yuqda ‘alayk, innahu laa yadhillu man waalayta, tabaarakta Rabbana wa ta‘aalayta\n(O Allah, guide me among those whom You have guided, pardon me among those whom You have pardoned, turn to me in friendship among those to whom You have turned in friendship, and bless me in what You have bestowed, and save me from the evil of what You have decreed. For verily You decree and none can turn back Your decree; and he is not humiliated whom You have befriended. Blessed are You, O Lord, and Exalted).”\nThis hadith is saheeh; it was classed as saheeh by an-Nawawi in Khulaasat al-Ahkaam (1/455); Ibn Hajar in Muwaafaqat al-Khabari al-Khabara (1/333); Ibn al-Mulaqqin in al-Badr al-Muneer (3/630); and Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood (1281).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the du‘aa’ that the Sahaabah regularly recited in Qunoot al-Witr during the caliphate of Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, it was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh (1100) via ‘Urwah ibn az-Zubayr that ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn ‘Abd al-Qaari – who during the caliphate of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab was in charge of the bayt al-maal (treasury) along with ‘Abdullah ibn al-Arqam – narrated that ‘Umar went out one night in Ramadan, and ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn ‘Abd al-Qaari went out with him. He walked around the mosque, and the people in the mosque were scattered, one man praying by himself, and one man praying with a group following him in prayer. ‘Umar said: by Allah, I think that if we bring them together behind one reciter (imam), that will be better.\nThen ‘Umar decided to go ahead and do that, and he instructed Ubayy ibn Ka‘b to lead them in praying qiyaam in Ramadan.\nThen ‘Umar came out and saw the people praying behind their reciter (imam), and ‘Umar said: What a good innovation this is, but what they sleep and miss is better than what they are doing – referring to prayer at the end of the night, whereas the people were praying qiyaam at the beginning of the night.\nThe people used to pray qiyaam at the beginning of the night, and they used to curse the disbelievers in the middle of the night:\n“Allahumma qaatil al-kafarata alladheena yasuddoona ‘an sabeelika wa yukadhdhiboona rusulaka wa laa yu’minoona bi wa‘dika wa khaalif bayna kalimatihim wa alqi fi quloobihim ar-ru‘ba wa alqi ‘alayhim rijzaka wa ‘adhaabaka, ilaah al-haqq \n(O Allah, destroy the disbelievers who bar people from Your path, disbelieve Your messengers and do not believe in Your promise; create disunity among them, cast fear into their hearts and send Your punishment upon them, O God of truth).”\nThen he would send blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and offer supplication for the Muslims, asking for whatever he could of good, then he would pray for forgiveness for the believers.\nHe (the narrator) said: And when he had finished cursing the disbelievers, sending blessings upon the Prophet, praying for forgiveness for the believing men and women, and asking for their needs, he would say:\n“Allahumma iyyaaka na‘budu wa laka nusalli wa nasjud, wa ilayka nas‘a wa nahfid wa narju rahmataka rabbana, wa nakhaafu ‘adhaabak al-jadd, inna ‘adhaabaka liman ‘aadayta mulhaq\n(O Allah, You alone we worship, and to You alone we pray and prostrate, and for Your sake we strive. We hope for Your mercy, our Lord, and we fear Your stern punishment, for Your punishment is inevitable for those whom You take as enemies).”\nThen he would say takbeer and prostrate.\nIts isnad is saheeh. It was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Qiyaam Ramadaan (p. 31).\nA similar report was also narrated from Mu‘aadh ibn al-Haarith Abu Haleemah al-Ansaari, who is known as Mu‘aadh al-Qaari’. He was one of the Sahaabah who were well versed in the Qur’an, as he was the reciter and imam of the Ansaar. He was killed in the battle of al-Harrah in 63 AH. Ibn Hajar said in al-Isaabah (6/110): He is the one whom ‘Umar appointed to lead Taraaweeh prayer in Ramadan. End quote.\nIt is proven that he used to offer a similar supplication to this when praying qiyaam in Ramadaan. It was narrated from him by Abu Dawood in Masaa’il al-Imam Ahmad (p. 96) via Muhammad ibn Sireen who said: Among the supplications that Mu‘aadh al-Qaari’ used to offer in qiyaam – that is, night prayers in Ramadan – was:\n“Allahumma ‘adhdhib al-kafarat alladheena yasuddoona ‘an sabeelika wa yukadhdhiboona rusulak.

        "predicted_answer": "The supplication (du‘aa’) recited by the Sahaabah during Qunoot al-Witr in the second half of Ramadan, particularly during the caliphate of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, is not explicitly detailed in the Qur'an. However, it draws upon the general themes found within the Quranic verses that reflect the spiritual ethos of Islam—highlighting the importance of seeking guidance, forgiveness, and acknowledging God’s mercy.\n\n### Historical Context\nDuring the time of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, it was a common practice for the Muslims to make personal supplications in Qunoot al-Witr, particularly during the last part of Ramadan, when they would seek Allah's mercy and protection. This practice is supported by various Hadiths, including those reported by Ibn Abbas, where it is mentioned that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) would raise his hands during Qunoot and supplicate for his community.\n\n### Inspiration from the Qur'an\nThe types of supplications that align with the spirit of the Quran can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Supplicating for Guidance**:\n   In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:186), Allah promises to respond to the supplication of the believer: \n   - \"When My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me...\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:186).\n\n2. **Seeking Forgiveness**:\n   The notion of seeking forgiveness and mercy is emphasized in multiple places. In Surah Al-Isra (17:80), the Prophet (peace be upon him) is encouraged to seek honor and assistance from Allah:\n   - \"And pray: 'O my Lord, let my entry be with honour, and let my exit be with honour, and grant me power from You which would help (sustain) me.'\" (Surah Al-Isra, 17:80).\n\n3. **Acknowledging the Importance of Prayer**:\n   Regular prayers and supplications are a means to strengthen one's connection with Allah. The emphasis on prayer is found in Surah Al-Muzzammil (73:20):\n   - \"... recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily...\" (Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:20).\n\n4. **Pleading for Help and Mercy**:\n   There is a broader invocation of God’s mercy, as exemplified in multiple verses, such as in Surah Al-Duhaa (93:3-5) which reminds believers of Allah’s continued guidance and support:\n   - \"And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied.\" (Surah Al-Duhaa, 93:5).\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the exact wording of the du‘aa’ recited in Qunoot during ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab's time may not be documented, the spirit of such supplications reflects a reliance on Allah's mercy, guidance, and support as echoed throughout the Qur'an. Believers are encouraged to engage in personal supplications that encompass these themes in their prayers, especially during the blessed nights of Ramadan.\n\n### Summary of Relevant Verses\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah** (2:186): Invocation and response from Allah.\n2. **Surah Al-Isra** (17:80): Seeking honor and assistance from Allah.\n3. **Surah Al-Muzzammil** (73:20): Importance of reciting the Qur'an and prayer.\n4. **Surah Al-Duhaa** (93:5): Assurance of Allah’s provision and satisfaction for believers. \n\nThese verses provide a foundation upon which the communal supplications during Ramadan could be constructed, reflecting the essence of Muslim spirituality in the context of worship and supplication."

        "question": "How could a woman have acquired knowledge of hadith?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Seeking knowledge in Islam is not only a human activity; rather it is an act of worship by means of which the Muslims seek to draw closer to their Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and by means of which they seek reward with Him, may He be glorified, in the highest levels of Paradise, with the Prophets, the strong and true in faith (siddeeqeen), the martyrs and the righteous.\nBecause knowledge is an act of worship, the Muslims were keen to adhere to the laws of Allah when acquiring it and teaching it, knowing that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is watching every thought that crosses their minds and every inclination of their hearts, so that they would not drift away from the path of seeking knowledge only for the sake of Allah. One aspect of that is that the way in which knowledge was sought by Muslim women and young women must have been within the framework of Islamic rulings. At the same time, these rulings and guidelines did not prevent them from acquiring a high level of religious knowledge, as ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The best women are the women of the Ansaar. Shyness did not prevent them from seeking to acquire deep knowledge of religion. Narrated by Muslim (no. 322).\nWe may see – from the books of biographies of women, narrators of hadith and scholars – how the commitment to Islamic guidelines on the part of the female seekers of knowledge has many aspects, as follows:\nFirstly:\nThe prohibition on travelling without a mahram is something on which there is consensus among the scholars, and some of the fuqaha’ and scholars of hadith did not make any exception except travelling for the obligatory Hajj and ‘umrah. So it is not known that any woman travelled long distances and exposed herself to the grave dangers that existed during those times except with a mahram, so that she would not be disobeying Allah in a matter in which she wanted to obey Him, and so that her efforts to seek knowledge would not backfire on her on the Day of Resurrection. See the answer to question no. 82392 .\nSecondly:\nWith regard to mixing with men and men and women looking at each other, our righteous forebears, the fuqaha’ and scholars of hadith, were the furthest removed from that. In her pursuit of knowledge, the female scholar or seeker of knowledge must observe complete hijab, which includes the face and hands, or she must listen and speak from behind a curtain or partition, following the example of the Mothers of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with them). The Taabi‘een learned from the Mothers of the Believers everything that they narrated, hundreds of hadiths, from behind a partition, in response to the command of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts” [al-Ahzaab 33:53].\nThis ruling was not only applicable to the Mothers of the Believers. al-‘Allaamah al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that Allah, may He be exalted, explained the reason for this ruling – which is the obligation of hijab – by saying that it was purer for the hearts of both men and women and offered protection against suspicion is a clear proof that this ruling is intended to be general in application. That is because none of the Muslims would say that anyone other than the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not have any need for their hearts to be more pure, or that the hearts of men are more free of suspicion than the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). End quote from Adwa’ al-Bayaan (6/242).\nWe have stated this previously in many answers on our website, including no. 46921 .\nThirdly:\nSimilarly, you will find in the books of biography many cases in which it is stated that listening was done from behind a curtain or partition, in obedience to the command of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. The scholars of hadith said, in response to those who rejected the report that Muhammad ibn Ishaaq heard from Faatimah the wife of Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah: It may be that he heard from her with a partition between them in the absence of her husband. Adh-Dhahabi said: That is what one would expect of them, which is the way in which many of the Taabi‘een learned from the female Sahaabah. And it may be that he went to listen to her and he saw her and learned from her when he was still a minor. It is also possible that he learned from her when she had grown very old; that is possible because she was more than ten years older than Hishaam.\nEnd quote from Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’ (7/42):\nIn Musnad al-Imam Ahmad (33/401) it says: Some scholars of hadith came and asked for permission to visit Abu’l-Ashhab. He gave them permission to come in, and they said: Narrate to us. He said: Ask me something. They said: We do not have anything [in particular] to ask you about. His daughter said from behind the curtain: Ask him about the hadith of ‘Arfajah ibn As‘ad whose nose was cut off on the day of [the battle of] al-Kilaab. End quote.\nSimilarly, it was narrated from Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) that when the Muwatta’ was read to him, if the student made a mistake in the pronunciation, or added or omitted something, his daughter would knock on the door, and her father would say to the student: Go back and check, for you have made a mistake. And the student would go back and find the mistake. Al-Madkhal by Ibn al-Haaj (1/215).\nIt says in ad-Daw’ al-Laami‘ li Ahl al-Qarn at-Taasi‘ (12/22), in the biography of Haleemah, the daughter of Abu ‘Ali al-Mazmalaani, that she listened from behind the partition to [the book] Thamaaniyaat an-Najeeb when al-Jammaal al-Hanbali was teaching it.\nThus we can be certain that the way in which women sought Islamic knowledge was in accordance with Islamic etiquette. It is also an example of making sacrifices for the sake of acquiring knowledge, and achieving a high level of knowledge, as the books of history record the names of hundreds of women whose memory will live forever in this world and who played a role in Islamic history.

        "predicted_answer": "In the context of Islam, acquiring knowledge, including knowledge of hadith (the sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad), is a vital aspect addressed in the Quran. A woman may acquire knowledge of hadith in several ways, as illustrated by Islamic texts and practices.\n\n### 1. **Direct Participation in Learning and Teaching**\nWomen during the time of the Prophet Muhammad were actively involved in the learning and teaching of hadith. Prominent female figures such as Aisha bint Abu Bakr (the Prophet's wife) played a crucial role in transmitting hadith. She is known to have narrated more than 2,000 hadiths, covering areas such as family matters, social dealings, and jurisprudence. Women like Aisha were not only recipients of knowledge but also contributors to the scholarly tradition.\n\n### 2. **Prophet Muhammad's Teachings on Seeking Knowledge**\nThe significance of pursuing knowledge is emphasized in various hadith. The Prophet Muhammad said: \"Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim\" (Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 224). The emphasis here extends to both genders, thus implying that women have the same obligation to seek knowledge, including hadith.\n\n### 3. **Encouragement in the Quran for Community Learning**\nThe Quran encourages believers to seek knowledge and discern the truth. While the verses mentioned do not directly refer to women acquiring hadith, they outline the importance of coming to God’s revelations and following the Prophet, which includes learning from him. For instance, in Surah Al-Mumtahanah, it is stated:\n> \"O Prophet, when believing women come to you and swear on oath that they will not associate anything with God...\" (Surah 60:12).\n\nThis demonstrates a framework for women to be part of the community that actively engages with the Prophet's teachings. It highlights the importance of a social structure where women were integral to collective worship and learning.\n\n### 4. **Women in the Early Islamic Community**\nHistorically, many women provided key testimony and shared wisdom based on their understanding and experiences, which were documented as hadith. This is reiterated in the Quran, which refers to women as equal partners in faith and encourages their engagement with the religion. For example:\n> \"The believing men and women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong...\" (Surah At-Tawbah, 9:71).\n\nThis verse supports the idea that women were active participants in the community, responsible for spreading knowledge, including hadith.\n\n### 5. **Narration and Preservation of Hadith**\nWomen not only learned hadith but also participated in its preservation through both oral and written means. The societal structure allowed women to relay important teachings, sometimes to large gatherings of followers. Many early scholars acknowledged the contributions of female narrators, which enriched the Islamic tradition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThrough their direct engagement in learning, their status as scholars, societal support for women’s education, and historical examples, women acquired knowledge of hadith. The verses from the Quran support this movement towards inclusivity in learning, performance of duties in faith, and participation in the community. Women were not only consumers of knowledge but also vital contributors to the discourse surrounding Islamic teachings.\n\n### References\n- Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:12\n- Surah At-Tawbah, 9:71\n- Hadith: Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 224"

        "question": "The saheeh Sunnah is wahy (Revelation) from Allah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:  \nIt is essential that it be established in the mind and heart of every Muslim that the Sunnah – which is the words, deeds and approval that are attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – is one of the two parts of divine Revelation that were revealed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The other part of the Revelation (Wahy) is the Holy Quran.  \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.\n4. It is only a Revelation revealed”\n[al-Najm 53:3-4]\nIt was narrated from al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’di Yakrib (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  \n“Verily I have been given the Quran and something similar to it along with it. But soon there will be a time when a man will be reclining on his couch with a full stomach, and he will say, ‘You should adhere to this Quran: what you find that it says is permissible, take it as permissible, and what you find it says is forbidden, take it as forbidden.’ But indeed, whatever the Messenger of Allah forbids is like what Allah forbids.” \nNarrated by al-Tirmidhi (2664). He said: It is hasan ghareeb with this isnaad. It was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (2870). \nThis is what was understood by the righteous salaf (may Allah be pleased with them): \nHassaan ibn ‘Atiyah said in al-Kifaayah by al-Khateeb (12): \nJibreel used to bring the sunnah down to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as he used to bring the Quran down to him. End quote. \nNarrated by al-Daarimi in his Sunan (588) and by al-Khateeb in al-Kifaayah (12). It was attributed by al-Haafiz in al-Fath (13/291) to al-Bayhaqi, and he said: With a saheeh isnaad. \nThe importance of the Sunnah is first of all that it explains the Book of Allah and is a commentary on it, then it adds some rulings to those in the Book of Allah. \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad ) the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Quran)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought”\n[al-Nahl 16:44]. \nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr said in Jaami’ Bayaan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi (2/190): \nThe commentary of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the Quran is of two types: \n1 – Explaining things that are mentioned in general terms in the Holy Quran, such as the five daily prayers, their times, prostration, bowing and all other rulings. \n2 – Adding rulings to the rulings of the Quran, such as the prohibition on being married to a woman and to her paternal or maternal aunt at the same time. End quote. \nSecondly: \nAs the Sunnah is the second of the two parts of Revelation, it is inevitable that Allah will protect it, so as to preserve the religion from distortion and additions or subtractions. \nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Ihkaam (1/95): \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”\n[al-Hijr 15:9] \n“Say (O Muhammad ): “I warn you only by the Revelation (from Allah and not by the opinion of the religious scholars and others). But the deaf (who follow the religious scholars and others blindly) will not hear the call, (even) when they are warned [i.e. one should follow only the Quran and the Sunnah (legal ways, orders, acts of worship, and the statements of Prophet Muhammad , as the Companions of the Prophet did)]”\n[al-Anbiya’ 21:45]\nAllah tells us that the words of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are all Wahy (revelation), and Wahy is undoubtedly Dhikr, and Dhikr is preserved according to the text of the Quran. Thus it is correct to say that his words (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are all preserved by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and He has promised that none of them will be lost to us, because that which Allah preserves can certainly not be lost at all; it has all been transmitted to us and Allah has established proof and left us with no excuse. End quote.  \nThirdly: \nOnce it is established that the Sunnah is part of the divine revelation, it is essential to note that there is only one difference between it and the Quran, which is that the Qur'aan is the word of Allah, may He be exalted, which was revealed verbatim to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whereas the Sunnah may not be the words of Allah, rather it is only His Revelation, so it need not necessarily come to us verbatim, but the meaning of it comes to us. \nOnce we understand this difference, we see that the point in transmission of the Sunnah is to convey the meanings, not the exact same words that were uttered by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Islam tells us that Allah only preserves the words of the Quran in full, and He preserves the general meanings of the Sunnah, and that which explains the Book of Allah, not the exact words and phrases. \nHowever, the scholars of this ummah throughout the early centuries strove to preserve the sharee’ah and the Sunnah. They have transmitted to us the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as he said them, and they distinguished between the reports that were right and wrong, true and false. \nWhat the questioner sees of multiple reports of a single hadeeth does not mean that there is any shortcoming in the preservation and transmission of the Sunnah. Rather the reports vary for numerous reasons, and once they are understood the answer will become clear. \nFourthly: \nReasons for multiple reports: \n1-Multiple incidents\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Ihkaam (1/134): \nThe existence of different versions does not represent a fault in the hadeeth if the meaning is the same, because it is proven that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) uttered a hadeeth he would repeat it three times, so each person would narrate it according to what he heard. This difference in the reports does not mean that the hadeeth is weak, if the meaning is the same. End quote. \n2-Reporting the meaning\nThis is the most common reason for there being multiple versions of a single hadeeth. What matters in transmission of a hadeeth is that the meaning be conveyed. As for the wording, it is not the matter of worship as is the case with the Quran. \nFor example, the hadeeth “Actions are but by intentions” is also narrated as “Action is by intention” and “Actions are but by intention” and “actions are by intention.” The reason for these multiple versions is that the meaning was narrated. The source of the hadeeth is one, namely Yahya ibn Sa’eed from Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem from ‘Alqamah from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). It may be noted that the meaning that is understood from these sentences is the same, so what does it matter if there are multiple reports? \nIn order to be more certain that the narrator had transmitted the correct meaning of the hadeeth, the scholars would not accept a report of similar meaning unless it came from a scholar of the Arabic language, then they would compare his report with that of another trustworthy narrator; then they would be able to spot the mistake in narration if there was any mistake. There are many such examples but this is not the place to discuss them in detail. \n3 – Narrator’s shortening of the hadeeth \ni.e., the narrator memorized the hadeeth in its entirety, but he quoted only part of it in one place, and narrated it in full elsewhere. \nFor example: Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated the story of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forgetting two rak’ahs of Zuhr prayer. The entire story was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, and it is one story. This indicates that the difference in reports is due to some narrators shortening it. See Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 714, 715, 1229. \n4 – Mistakes \nOne of the narrators may have made a mistake, so he narrated the hadeeth in a way that it was not narrated by others. It is possible to spot the mistake by comparing the reports with one another. This is what was done by the scholars in the books of Sunnah and takhreej. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Jawaab al-Saheeh (3/39): \nBut Allah has preserved for this ummah that which He revealed. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”\n[al-Hijr 15:9]\nSo there is no error in the interpretation of the Quran or in the transmission of hadeeth or interpretation thereof. Allah guaranteed that there would always be in this ummah those who would explain it and highlight evidence against the errors of those who err and the lies of those who lie. This ummah will not agree on misguidance, and there will remain among them a group who will adhere to the truth until the Hour begins. For they are the last of the nations and there is no Prophet after their Prophet and no Book after their Book. When the nations before them changed, Allah sent a Prophet to show them the way with commands and prohibitions, but there will be no Prophet after Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Allah has guaranteed to preserve the revelation that He has sent down. End quote. \nThe Sunnah, as we explained at the beginning, is revelation (wahy) from Allah, which explains to the people that which was revealed to them in the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and it teaches them the rulings that they need to practise their religion. Even if the details or the basic principles are mentioned in the Book of Allah, we say: in this sense the Sunnah is one of the attributes of Prophethood and one of the missions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The people still regard the Sunnah in this manner, whether it is mentioned in books or in oral reports which may differ in some wording or in different contexts. None of that gives cause to doubt its status or worry that it has not been preserved properly or to dispute its validity as evidence or to say that the people have no need of it, despite the many difference among people about theoretical and practical issues.  \nThe great scholar Shaykh ‘Abd al-Ghani ‘Abd al-Khaaliq (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWe do not find in the books of al-Ghazaali or al-Aamidi or al-Bazdawi, or any of the scholars of usool who follow their method of writing, any suggestion or hint of any dispute with regard to this matter. They are the ones who examined all the books and madhhabs of the earlier scholars and studied the disputes, even the odd views, and they took great care to refute them. \nThen he quoted from the author and commentator of al-Musallam: The Quran, Sunnah, scholarly consensus and analogy are he valid foundations of Islam, as is discussed in the field of ‘ilm al-kalaam. But the scholars of usool focused on the validity of scholarly consensus and analogy, because there were too many foolish people who tried to undermine their validity, such as the khawaarij and Raafidis (may Allah humiliate t hem). As for the validity of the Quran and Sunnah, the ummah is unanimously agreed on that, which is why there was no need to discuss their validity. End quote. \nSee: Hujjiyyat al-Sunnah (248-249). \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The assertion that the Sunnah (the teachings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad) is a form of revelation (wahy) from Allah can be supported by various verses from the Qur'an that emphasize the divine origin of the guidance provided through messengers and how they transmit God's message to humanity. While the Qur'an is the primary scripture in Islam, the Sunnah complements it, providing context and practical application of the Qur'anic teachings.\n\n### Divine Authority of the Sunnah\n\n1. **Surah Al-Ahqaf (46:9-13)**:\n   - This verse highlights the Prophet's role in conveying God's message. The Prophet Muhammad states, \"Say: 'I am not a new Messenger... I only follow what is revealed to me. My duty is only to warn you clearly.'\" Thus, this indicates that the teachings he delivers, including the Sunnah, stem from divine revelation.\n   - *Reference*: Al-Ahqaf, 46:9\n\n2. **Surah Ash-Shuraa (42:51-53)**:\n   - In these verses, it is stated, \"It is not given to man that God should speak to him...or send a messenger to convey by His command whatsoever He pleases.\" This further emphasizes that the message delivered by the Prophet—including both the Qur'an and the Sunnah—is from God.\n   - *Reference*: Ash-Shuraa, 42:51-52\n\n3. **Surah Al-Haqqah (69:39-43)**:\n   - This passage distinguishes the words of the Messenger from those of poets and soothsayers, affirming the noble origin of the message. It states that the revelation is \"sent down by the Lord of all the worlds,\" reinforcing that the teachings of the Messenger are divinely inspired.\n   - *Reference*: Al-Haqqah, 69:39-43\n\n### Complementarity of the Qur'an and Sunnah\n\n4. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:151)**: \n   - The verse notes, \"Just as We have sent among you a Messenger from yourselves, reciting to you Our verses and purifying you and teaching you the Book and wisdom...\" Here, the wisdom mentioned relates to the Sunnah, demonstrating how the Messenger’s teachings elaborate on the Qur'anic revelations.\n   - *Reference*: Al-Baqarah, 2:151\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Sunnah is indeed seen as an extension of divine guidance alongside the Qur'an. The Prophet Muhammad, as a messenger, received revelations that included not only the written text of the Qur'an but also the practical applications of those teachings, which were embodied in his actions and sayings. Thus, referring to the Sunnah as wahy aligns with the Islamic understanding of revelation and guidance from Allah. \n\nFor a comprehensive understanding of the theological basis for the Sunnah as revelation, the verses mentioned above provide clear support, illustrating the divine authority behind both the Qur'an and the Sunnah as essential facets of Islamic faith."

And whoever honors the symbols of Allah - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts”\n[al-Hajj 22:32].\nPart of that is venerating and respecting the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Sunnah.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhoever believes in the oneness of Allah’s divinity and the message of His slave and Messenger, then does not follow this belief with what it requires of respect and honour, which is something that resides in the heart and is reflected in one’s behaviour and attitude – rather after he claims to believe, he shows disrespect, disregard and scorn in word and deed – then his having this belief is the same as his not having it. That will lead to the corruption and invalidation of that belief, and it will lead to the loss of what it could contain of benefits and a positive impact on his character and behaviour, because belief purifies and rectifies the heart, so when it does not purify and rectify the heart, that is only because it has not taken root in the heart.\nEnd quote from as-Saarim al-Maslool (3/700).\nWhat appears to be the case is that explaining hadiths to the children, then printing them and asking the children to memorize them and colour them in, is not contrary to respecting the Prophet’s Sunnah. The aim is to have the children memorize this hadith and to make that easy for them with some permissible, fun activity that they like, namely colouring and drawing, and similar educational methods that help to achieve the noble aim that is prescribed.\nBased on that, there does not seem to us to be anything wrong with the method mentioned in the question.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Teaching children about Islam, including through the methods of using texts such as hadiths, is an essential aspect of Islamic upbringing. Using coloring activities to engage children can foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of their faith. However, it is important to consider the content, the approach, and the way in which such activities are executed, especially considering the sanctity of religious texts.\n\n### Ruling on Teaching Children through Coloring in Texts of Hadiths\n\n1. **Respect for Religious Texts**: Hadiths (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) are highly revered in Islam, akin to the Quran. When teaching children, it is paramount that the texts are treated with the utmost respect. The Quran emphasizes the importance of judging and adhering to what has been revealed by God:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:48)**: \"And to you We have revealed the Book containing the truth, confirming the earlier revelations, and preserving them (from change and corruption). So judge between them by what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, side-stepping the truth that has reached you...\"\n\n   This indicates the necessity for careful and respectful engagement with divine texts.\n\n2. **Educational Value**: Engaging children through activities such as coloring can facilitate learning in a fun and interactive format. Such methods can be effective in conveying complex ideas, thereby fostering a connection with Islamic teachings. The Quran encourages the seeking of knowledge:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:35)** states: \"O you who have believed, fear Allah and seek the means of nearness to Him and strive in His cause that you may succeed.\"\n\n   This verse showcases the importance of striving to learn and to draw closer to Allah, which can be done increasingly through creative education.\n\n3. **Appropriateness of the Content**: When choosing hadiths for such activities, it’s critical to ensure they are appropriate for the child’s age and understanding. Hadiths that convey moral lessons, stories of the Prophet, or those that reinforce good behavior are suitable choices. The objective should be to instill values such as honesty, kindness, and respect, which are celebrated in many hadiths.\n\n4. **Environment and Intent**: The environment in which children engage with these activities should be conducive to respecting the content. If coloring in hadiths is perceived as a playful activity, care must be taken to communicate the seriousness of what the hadith represents. \n\n5. **Encouragement to Explore Faith**: Utilizing interactive methods, such as coloring, can motivate children to learn more about their faith in a way that feels personal and enjoyable. This aligns with the Quran’s guidance to spread knowledge and understanding.\n\n6. **Cautions Against Misuse**: Care must be taken to avoid trivializing the text. As underscored in **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:44)**, those who do not judge by what God has revealed are considered unjust. Thus, the intent and presentation of such material need to be handled with care.\n\nIn conclusion, teaching children through coloring in texts of hadiths can be permissible if it is approached thoughtfully and respectfully, with an emphasis on moral education and engagement. Muslim educators and parents can leverage such methods to instill a love for learning about Islam while ensuring that the dignity of the texts is upheld."

        "question": "The science of hadith is based on reason and shar‘i guidelines",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The science of hadith is basically and in principle founded on rational guidelines, with a methodology based on an accumulation of experience attained by the hadith scholars on the basis of many years’ experience of narrating reports and checking their authenticity and soundness. They attained the basis of this knowledge through lengthy involvement in checking reports, seeking them out, conveying them, examining them and determining whether there were any faults in them, thus gradually developing the general guidelines and framework of the science of hadith. Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi said: Distinguishing the soundness of hadith is a kind of knowledge that Allah, may He be exalted, creates in people’s hearts after they have spent a great deal of time in this field and have attained lengthy involvement therein.\nAl-Jaami‘ (2/255).\nBut at the same time, these general guidelines – in their general philosophy, but not in their minor details – are derived from some shar‘i principles that are mentioned in the texts of the Quran and Sunnah. There are general shar‘i texts that outline to the scholars of hadith the basic principles of the science of history and reports. As for the details, they were left to be developed through the accumulation of practice and experience, as referred to above.\nSome of these general shar‘i principles are as follows:\n1. The stern prohibition on lying about hadiths (narration from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Lying about me is not like lying about anyone else. Whoever tells a lie about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1295) and Muslim (4 – in the Introduction to his Saheeh).\n2. Not accepting the report of an evildoer. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! If a Fasiq (liar — evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done” [al-Hujuraat 49:6].\n3. Stipulation that the narrator should be of good character, by analogy with the requirement for a witness to be of good character. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And take as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims). And establish the testimony for Allah” [at-Talaaq 65:2].\n4. Constant verification and checking. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those one will be questioned (by Allah)” [al-Isra’ 17:36].\n5. Warning against odd and weird reports. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “At the end of time there will be liars and charlatans who will bring ahaadeeth that neither you nor your forefathers ever heard. Beware of them and stay away from them, and do not let them mislead you or confuse you.” Narrated by Muslim in the Introduction to his Saheeh (7).\n6. Refraining from knowingly narrating a report that is a lie, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever narrates a hadith from me knowing that it is false is one of the liars.” Narrated by Muslim in the Introduction to his Saheeh.\n7. Precise memorisation is the basis of trustworthiness. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allah bless a man who hears a hadith from us and memorizes it so that he can convey it to others, for perhaps he is conveying it to one who will understand it better than him, and perhaps the one who conveys knowledge does not understand it himself.” Narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (3660).\n8. Warning against putting oneself under suspicion by narrating a lot of weird reports and not being selective in what one narrates. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient lying for a man to speak of everything that he hears.” Narrated by Muslim in the Introduction to his Saheeh.\n9. Seeking evidence and proof. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), ‘Produce your proof if you are truthful’” [al-Baqarah 2:111].\n10.Seeking certain knowledge, far removed from speculation and illusion. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But they have no knowledge thereof. They follow but conjecture, and verily, conjecture is no substitute for the truth” [an-Najm 53:28].\nSome of these texts were quoted as evidence by Imam Muslim (may Allah have mercy on him) in the Introduction to his Saheeh (p. 7), where he said:\nYou should know, may Allah guide you, that it is obligatory for everyone who can distinguish between sound and unsound reports, and between trustworthy and dubious narrators, not to narrate any report unless he is sure of the soundness and honesty of their narrators, and to avoid those which are narrated by dubious narrators and those who stubbornly follow bid ah (innovation).\nThe evidence for what we are saying and that it should not be any other way is the words of Allah, may He be blessed and exalted:\n“O you who believe! If a Faasiq (liar — evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done”\n[al-Hujuraat 49:6]\n“such as you agree for witnesses”\n[al-Baqarah 2:282]\n“And take as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims)”\n[al-Talaaq 65:2].\nThe verses that we have quoted prove that the report of a faasiq (liar or evil person) is to be rejected and not accepted, and that the testimony of one who is not just is to be rejected.\nEven though a report is not the same as testimony in some ways, they are fundamentally the same because the report of a faasiq is not acceptable according to the scholars, just as his testimony is rejected by all of them. The Sunnah indicates that munkar reports are to be rejected just as the Quran indicates that the report of a faasiq is to be rejected. End quote.\nDr. Humaam Sa‘eed says:\nThus it becomes clear to us that the methodology of the hadith scholars is a Quranic methodology that is derived from the Quran and Sunnah, and that it is a critical methodology that deals with historical reports; in other words, it does not accept a reported text without examining it critically, and it is not sufficient for this text to be narrated from a scholar or a person of respectable standing in order for it to be accepted. Rather it is essential that the attribution of the report to the one who said it should be proven, and it should be examined thoroughly and carefully to make sure that it is in harmony with the proven principles and general guidelines.\nThis critical methodology that deals with historical reports was absent in the case of the Torah and Gospel, and it was absent in the case of all historical narratives before Islam. Then Islam came to give the world this sound methodology that is based on research, thorough examination and sound thinking. Charles Guinevere contrasted this methodology of critically examining historical events with the Christian methodology that is based on faith, which accepted reports from earlier generations without any discussion or critical examination.\nMany researchers overlooked this methodological connection between the Holy Quran and the sciences of hadith, to the extent that many people thought that the methodology of the hadith scholars was the result of a kind of unsurpassed brilliance, and that it developed because of need alone. But the truth that cannot be doubted is that the methodology of the hadith scholars is a Quranic methodology, and it is one of the manifestations of the miraculous nature of this religion. Just as Allah protected His holy Book from any changes or alterations, He also preserved the Sunnah as a whole and protected it from vanishing and being forgotten. End quote from al-Fikr al-Manhaji ‘inda al-Muhadditheen (p. 24).\nAll of the above – as will be clear to the reader – represents general methodological principles that were established by the Holy Quran and instilled by our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in the souls of his Companions, so as to set out for them a general framework for the theory of the knowledge that they were seeking to acquire, on which they would found knowledge that was based on reason and on religious texts. So these principles led to a very precise and thorough examination (of the reports) and a critical sense that was well balanced and guided. The reason for that was fear of going against these principles and divine commands. Were it not for that, the Muslims would have indulged in illusions and speculation, and we would have seen myths, fables and contradictions that would have been the common language in the knowledge produced by the Muslims. But the religious deterrent contained in the ten guidelines mentioned above played a major role in the methodology of checking and examining that the hadith scholars developed.\nAs for precise details about hadith science, which is “learning the rules and regulations on the basis of which scholars study the isnaad (chain of narrators) and matn (text of a hadith), and determine whether it is to be accepted or rejected” – such as their discussion about whether a narrator had a precise memory or not, whether the report is written in a precise manner, the methodology of dealing with reports narrated by those who engaged in tadlees [tadlees is when a narrator narrates a hadith that he did not hear directly from his shaykh, without mentioning the name of the third party from whom he heard it], giving precedence to a report that is narrated by one who is more authentic over one who is trustworthy, knowing how to classify the narrators from a particular shaykh, comparing between different reports and collecting hadith with similar texts but different isnaads, exercising deliberation when examining narrators, seeking corroborative reports, regarding a report as strong if there are many versions of it and many isnaads, and other guidelines and regulations that help scholars to determine whether a report is to be accepted or rejected – all of that, as you can see, is the product of detailed rational thinking that translates these general principles into practical methodological rules and regulations by means of which the hadith scholars came to a conclusion in judging whether a hadith was saheeh (sound) or da‘eef (weak).\nAl-‘Allaamah al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nBut have they paid attention to reason when accepting a hadith and regarding it as sound?\nI say: Yes, they did pay attention to that at four points: when they heard the hadith, when they narrated it, when they passed judgement on the narrators, and when they passed judgement on the hadiths.\nWhen the well-versed scholars in this field heard a report that could not be sound, or was very unlikely to be sound, they did not write it down or memorise it, and if they did memorise it, they did not narrate it to others.\nIf there is any interest that could be served by mentioning it, they would mention it and follow that by criticism of the report and of the narrator who was at fault. Imam ash-Shaafa‘i said in ar-Risaalah (p. 399): What could be indicative of whether a narrator is telling the truth or lying is when a narrator narrates a report that cannot be true, or that is contrary to another report that is more authentic, or has more evidence to prove it sound.\nAl-Khateeb said in al-Kifaayah fi ‘Ilm ar-Riwaayah (p. 429): Chapter on the obligation to eliminate odd reports and those that cannot possibly be sound.\nThere are among narrators a group who are very lenient with regard to what they hear and narrate, but the imams (leading scholars) are lying in wait for the narrators, so you hardly find any hadith that is clearly false, but you will find in its isnaad one or two narrators, or a group of narrators, whom the imams criticised. The imams very often criticise a narrator and regard him as flawed for narrating one munkar (odd) hadith, let alone two or more.\nThey describe the report that cannot possibly be sound, or is unlikely to be sound, as munkar (odd) or baatil (false). We find this a great deal in the biographies of weak narrators, or in books that speak of flawed and fabricated reports.\nThe scholars who examined the hadiths would not regard a narrator as credible until they examine his hadiths and check them one by one.\nWith regard to examining the soundness of hadiths, the scholars are very careful and cautious. Yes indeed, not everyone from whom it was narrated that he regarded a hadith as sound and credible was necessarily a man of deep knowledge, but the one who has knowledge and experience can distinguish between one thing and another.\nThe leading scholars who examined the hadiths realised that among them are some hadiths that may be difficult for some scholars of kalaam and their ilk to accept, but they found them to be in accordance with reason that is credible according to the religious texts, and that they fulfilled all the other conditions of soundness. Moreover, they found in the Quran many verses that are in harmony with it or that speak of the same idea. This is also difficult for the scholars of kalaam to accept, but the hadith scholars know that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) believed in and followed the Quran, so it is very possible that he would say things that carry similar meanings to what is in the Quran.\nEnd quote from al-Anwaar al-Kaashifah (p. 6-7).\nDr. Khaldoon al-Ahdab said:\nThe development of usool al-hadith was on a rational basis. Were that not the case, it could never have had this huge impact in shaping the Muslim mind.\nThis rational development of usool al-hadith began from the methodological and rational principle that is stated in the Holy Quran and Sunnah with regard to examining the narrator and what he narrated, on which the science of usool al-hadith is based.\nThe development of this branch of knowledge may be represented in the fact that the hadith scholars paid attention to reason when examining a hadith to see how sound it is, in four stages, as the great scholar and critic ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Mu‘allimi al-Yamaani said.\nEnd quote from Athar ‘Ilm Usool al-Hadith fi Tashkeel al-‘Aql al-Muslim, (p. 19).\nDr. ‘Abdullah Dayfullah ar-Ruhayli said:\n The academic guidelines on verifying reports, according to us Muslims – as in the case of the methodology of the hadith scholars – is not based on belief in the unseen, such that this mystical approach could be one of the guidelines for ascertaining whether a report is sound or not; rather they are rational guidelines that take into account reason, proven historical facts, comparison of reports, or other guidelines that the hadith scholars developed regarding the evidence or proof of the soundness of a report.\nThese guidelines, as we have described them, are rational and based on common sense, such that all people – or almost all people – will be able to understand and accept them, regardless of their religion or affiliation. A report with an interrupted chain of narrators, for example, is something that all people of sound mind would doubt and would not accept it because of that. That is because there is no continuous chain of narrators going all the way back to the source of the report, and if that is not available, then how can it be imagined that the report is sound?\nHuman minds can differentiate between a report being certain on the one hand, and it being likely or a mere possibility on the other hand. Therefore there is no room for the question which says, on what academic methodology is the approach of the hadith scholars in verifying a report based? Is it a scientifically-based methodology, or is it a mystical, faith-based methodology? That is because belief in the unseen plays no role in examining and verifying the report, then accepting it or rejecting it. However, this aspect of the hadith scholars’ methodology has to do with verifying reports and is not based on personal opinion or belief in the unseen.\nEnd quote from Hiwaar hawla Manhaj al-Muhadditheen fi Naqd ar-Riwaayaat Sanadan wa Matnan (p. 12-13).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The science of hadith is indeed based on reason and shar‘i (Islamic law) guidelines. This science involves the collection, verification, and analysis of the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The integrity of hadith is crucial in understanding Islam, as it provides context and explanation to the Quran. \n\n### 1. Finality of Divine Guidance\nThe Quran asserts that God's final guidance is encapsulated in the Quran and the prophetic traditions. This basis of belief informs the necessity of rigorous standards in hadith compilation and evaluation to preserve the integrity of Islamic teachings. The Quran states:\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:44)**: \"We sent down the Torah which contains guidance and light... And there (in the Torah) We had ordained for them a life for a life, and an eye for an eye...\"\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:48)**: \"And to you We have revealed the Book containing the truth, confirming the earlier revelations, and preserving them (from change and corruption). So judge between them by what has been revealed by God.\"\n\nThis indicates the importance of authentic sources (the Quran and hadith) for judgment in matters of faith.\n\n### 2. The Role of Reason\nReason and rationality play a fundamental role in understanding and interpreting both the Quran and hadith. The Quran encourages believers to reflect on their beliefs and the world around them:\n- **Surah Ash-Shuraa (42:10)**: \"In whatever matter you disagree the ultimate judgment rests with God.\" This emphasizes that ultimate authority rests with divine guidance, which should be interpreted judiciously. \n\nMoreover, the verse encourages the believers to seek knowledge and clarity, indicating that rational inquiry is not only permitted but encouraged within Islam.\n\n### 3. Authority of Hadith\nThe authority of hadith stems from the commandments of God, as highlighted in several verses:\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:103)**: \"God has not sanctioned Baheerah or Sa'ibah, Waseelah or Ham. The unbelievers fabricate lies of God, for many of them are devoid of sense.\" \n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:104)**: \"When you say to them: 'Come to what God has revealed...' they say: 'Sufficient to us is the faith that our fathers had followed...'\"\n\nThese verses illustrate the significance of adhering to God's revelations and the importance of authenticating sources of religious guidance over cultural or inherited beliefs.\n\n### 4. Preservation of Knowledge\nThe preservation of knowledge through hadith is also emphasized in:\n- **Surah Ash-Shuraa (42:51-52)**: \"It is not given to man that God should speak to him except by suggestion or indirectly, or send a messenger... We made it a light by which We show the way to those of Our creatures as We please.\" \n\nThis indicates that the integrity of knowledge—whether it is received directly through divine communication or through prophetic teachings—requires careful authentication and trust in the source of that knowledge.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe science of hadith is deeply rooted in both divine instruction and human reason. The Quran emphasizes the necessity of following authentic guidance, using reason to understand it, and adhering to the principles it lays down. The rigorous process in hadith science ensures that the teachings derived from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) are accurate and aligned with the core values of Islam. Believers are encouraged to engage with these sources thoughtfully and responsibly, reminding us of the importance of both faith and reason in the Islamic tradition."

        "question": "Ruling on one who rejects a saheeh hadith",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThe Prophet’s Sunnah is the second source of Islamic sharee‘ah. The revelation came down to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with the Sunnah as it came down to him with the Qur’an. The proof of that is the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.\nIt is but a revelation revealed”\n[an-Najm 53:3-4]. \nAllah, may He be exalted, has enjoined upon the believers complete submission to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his hadith and rulings, to the extent that He, may He be glorified, swore by His divine self that whoever hears the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then rejects them and does not accept them, has nothing to do with faith at all. He, may He be glorified and exalted, said (interpretation of the meaning):\n“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:65]. \nHence there was consensus among the scholars that whoever denies that the Sunnah constitutes shar‘i evidence in general terms, or rejects a hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him – knowing that it is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – is a disbeliever, who has not attained even the lowest level of Islam and submission to Allah and His Messenger. \nImam Is-haaq ibn Raahawayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhoever hears a report from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he accepts as being sound, then rejects it, not by way of dissimulation (when he has no choice because of a threat), is a disbeliever. End quote \nAs-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nYou should understand, may Allah have mercy on you, that whoever denies that the hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) constitutes shar‘i evidence – whether he denies a report that speaks of something that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said or did, if that hadith fulfils the conditions stipulated in usool al-hadith – has committed an act of disbelief that puts him beyond the bounds of Islam, and he will be gathered (on the Day of Resurrection) with the Jews and Christians, or with whomever Allah wills of the disbelieving groups. End quote. \nMiftaah al-Jannah fi’l-Ihtijaaj bi’s-Sunnah (p 14) \nAl-‘Allaamah Ibn al-Wazeer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRejecting the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when one is aware that it is his hadith constitutes blatant disbelief. End quote. \nAl-‘Awaasim wa’l-Qawaasim (2/274) \nIt says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah: \nThe one who denies that we should follow the Sunnah is a disbeliever, because he is expressing disbelief in Allah and His Messenger, and rejecting the consensus of the Muslims. End quote. \nFataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (vol. 2, 3/194) \nSee also the answers to questions no. 604, 13206 and 77243 \nSecondly: \nAs for the one who rejects a hadith and does not accept it, denying that it is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he is not like those who come under the first category. We understand that many followers of the new “enlightenment” trend – who have taken it upon themselves to judge the Prophet’s Sunnah on the basis of their views and affiliation – in fact, have not come up with anything new. Rather they are a continuation of the innovators who came before them, whose specious arguments the scholars quoted and took it upon themselves to refute them. \nTo these people and others like them we say: \nAcademic methodology dictates that we should examine several important matters before rejecting a hadith or denying that it is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). These conditions are as follows: \nThe first condition: \nWe should see whether there is a complete contradiction between what is mentioned in the hadith and what is mentioned in a Qur’anic text that is clear and unambiguous in meaning and not abrogated. We should emphasise here the condition of complete contradiction – and not just an apparent contradiction that may come to the mind of one who hastens to jump to conclusions when examining hadith. Perhaps those who are involved in denying the hadiths will agree with us on this condition, because most of the apparent contradictions that occur to many people are not contradictions in reality; rather they are mere speculation in the mind of the objector and it is possible, with deliberation and by examining the shades of meaning of different words, to answer the one who thinks that there is a contradiction, and demonstrate how the hadith is in harmony with the fundamentals and sublime aims of sharee‘ah. Whoever studies the book of al-‘Allaamah Ibn Qutaybah ad-Deenoori entitled Mukhtalif al-Hadith will realise how reckless many of them were in their denial of hadiths on the basis of the claim that they are not in accordance with the Qur’an, or that they contradict sound reasoning, but when Ibn Qutaybah mentions the correct explanation of these hadiths given by the scholars, it becomes clear that there is a sound interpretation for them that is in harmony with Islamic teachings, and that the notion that these hadiths contradict the Quran is based on corrupt understanding. \nWe ask these people and their ilk, who have the audacity to reject the Sunnah and cast aspersions on the hadiths of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) without any academic methodology or acceptable critical guidelines, and without properly understanding the fundamentals of hadith science that they are talking about, the following: \nDo you think that it is possible for a hadith to completely contradict the Holy Qur’an to the extent that the examiner may think that this hadith is not the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), at the time when we see all the scholars of Islam, from the time of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) up until the present day, in agreement on accepting this hadith and commenting on it, interpreting it, quoting it as evidence and acting upon it? \nDoesn’t rational thinking – on which they claim to base their argument – dictate that they should respect the consensus of specialists on the matter that is at the heart of their specialty? \nCan anyone have the audacity to say that physicists, chemists, mathematicians, educationalists or economists, for example, have made a mistake if they agree on a matter – especially when the one who is objecting to them is not one of the specialists in that field; rather all that can be said is that he has read some articles about it or a few books along the lines of Science For Dummies or The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Science [i.e., books that offer a basic introduction to a field]? \nThe second condition: \nThere should be a weakness in one of the links of the isnaad that could have led to the mistake mentioned in the text. \nSimilarly, we think that this condition is in harmony with sound methodology and is a valid condition. No one should disagree on this point who understands anything about the principles of academic criticism. Denying that a text is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) should mean that there is a weak link in the chain of narration that led us to mistakenly believe that this hadith is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), when in fact it is not. \nImam ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) – who is prominent in terms of knowledge and faith, and was the first one to write on the topic of usool al-fiqh – said: \nIf a hadith is narrated by trustworthy narrators from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then that is sufficient to regard it as a sound hadith. \nIkhtilaaf al-Hadith, in al-Umm (10/107). \nAnd he said: \nThere is no other way to determine whether a hadith is sound or otherwise except by knowing how honest and trustworthy the narrators are, with the exception of very few hadiths. \nAr-Risaalah (para. 1099) \nAnd he also said: \nMuslims of good character are those who are good and sound in and of themselves… As for what they say and do, it is to be regarded as sound and acceptable, unless we find something in their actions that indicate otherwise. So we should be cautious with them in cases where their actions differ from what is expected of them. \nAr-Risaalah (para. 1029-1030); see also al-Umm (8/518-51 9) \nAfter narrating some of the academic principles concerning this matter, which is something that he discussed a great deal in his various books, Imam ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) says that what he stated – some of which we have quoted here – is not the view of only a few scholars, or his own personal view; rather these are the principles on which there was consensus among the scholars who came before him. He says: \nAt the beginning of this book of mine, I quoted, in support of what I discuss of principles and guidelines, from a number of earlier scholars who had knowledge of the Qur’an and Sunnah, different scholarly opinions, analogy and rational thinking, and none of them differed with another. They said: This is the view of the scholars among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, the Taabi‘een, and the generation who followed them, and it is our view. Whoever diverges from this path is, in our view, diverging from the path of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the path of the scholars who came after them, until the present day, and he is one of the people of ignorance. And all of them said: we cannot see anything but the consensus of the scholars in all regions, unanimously agreeing to regard as ignorant the one who departs from this path. And they – or most of them – went even further and expressed more stringent views with regard to the one who departs from this path, but there is no need to quote them here. \nIkhtilaaf al-Hadith, al-Umm (10/21). See also: ar-Risaalah (para. 1236-1249). \nThe first thing that the one who rejected a hadith that is attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) must do is research and find out the identity of the narrator who was mistaken in his transmission of this hadith. If the one who denies the hadith cannot find an acceptable reason in the isnaad for rejecting the hadith, then this indicates that he is mistaken in his methodology. It also indicates that it is essential to have another look and try to understand the hadith and the Qur’an and the aims and goals of sharee‘ah. \nSo how about if the hadith was narrated with the soundest isnaads on the face of the earth? How about if the hadith was narrated via many chains of transmission – as is the case with most of the hadiths that are rejected by the proponents of “enlightenment” – and from a number of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them)?  \nThe third condition: \nOne should express his reservations about a hadith as a personal view based on his own reasoning, which may be right or wrong, and he should avoid stating his view as certainty, as if it is the correct view. He should also avoid making accusations against others who differ with him or casting aspersions on the intelligence of Muslim scholars. This applies in cases where there is a valid reason to hold such a view, and provided that one is qualified to speak about such matters and is proficient in the skills needed to understand and research them. A hadith may appear to be da‘eef (weak) to one scholar for a particular reason, but he should not speak in accusatory tones of those who accepted the hadith. \nWhoever does not comply with these three conditions and persists in denying and rejecting the hadiths is exposing himself to grave danger, because it is not permissible for a Muslim to reach a conclusion that is not based on proper methodology and without following any guidelines, and criticise other scholars (who disagree with him), otherwise he may fall into sin and error. \nImam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever rejects the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is on the brink of doom. End quote. \nAl-Hasan ibn ‘Ali al-Barbahaari said: \nIf you hear a man casting aspersions upon a hadith or denying a hadith, or giving precedence to something else over a hadith, then suspect his commitment to Islam, for he is undoubtedly following whims and desires and innovation. \nIf you hear a man, when you quote a hadith, showing no interest in it on the basis that he only wants to hear quotations from the Qur’an, you should not doubt that he is a man who is following the path of the heretics, so get up and leave him, and bid him farewell. End quote.\nSharh as-Sunnah (113-119)\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhatever the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) narrates from his Lord, it is obligatory to believe in it, whether we understand its meaning or not, because he is the most truthful one [namely the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)]. Whatever it says in the Qur’an and Sunnah, every believer must believe in it, even if he does not understand its meaning.

        "predicted_answer": "The question of rejecting a \"saheeh\" (authentic) hadith can be approached through various texts from the Qur'an and the teachings within Islamic tradition, particularly in relation to the authority of divine revelation and prophetic guidance. The rejection of a valid hadith could be viewed as a significant issue for a believer.\n\n### 1. Authority of the Prophet\nThe Qur'an emphasizes the importance of following the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) along with the revelations given to him. In Surah Al-Ma'idah, Allah commands believers to adhere to what is revealed in both the Qur'an and the teachings of the Prophet:\n\n**Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:41)**:\n> \"Be not grieved, O Apostle, by those who hasten to outrace others in denial, and say with their tongues: ‘We believe,’ but do not believe in their hearts.\"  \n(Citation: Qur'an 5:41)\n\nThis verse conveys the importance of genuine belief, suggesting that superficial acceptance without actual belief is inadequate. Thus, denying the Prophet's teachings (including hadiths) might fall into this category of hypocrisy.\n\n### 2. Judgment by Allah’s Revelations\nMoreover, the verses in Surah Al-Ma'idah stress the necessity of judging by what Allah has revealed. Ignoring or rejecting any portion of divine guidance, including authentic hadith, could imply a refusal to accept God's authority:\n\n**Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:44)**:\n> \"Indeed, those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are indeed the disbelievers.\"  \n(Citation: Qur'an 5:44)\n\nThis highlights that rejecting the teachings of the Prophet, which are authentic hadith, could classify an individual among those who do not judge by Allah's guidance.\n\n### 3. Fabrication of Lies Against God\nIn Surah Al-Ma'idah, Allah also warns about those who lie about Him and fabricate untruths regarding His commands:\n\n**Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:103)**:\n> \"God has not sanctioned Baheerah or Sa'ibah, Waseelah or Ham. The unbelievers fabricate lies against God, for many of them are devoid of sense.\"  \n(Citation: Qur'an 5:103)\n\nRecognizing that the rejection of authentic hadith could parallel such fabrications, it's significant to consider this warning seriously.\n\n### 4. The Connection of Actions and Beliefs\nAdditionally, the Qur'an stresses that one's beliefs must align with their actions. In Surah Al-Ma'idah, it is stated that God does not wish to purify the hearts of those who forsake His commands:\n\n**Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:41-42)**:\n> \"...These are the people whose hearts God does not wish to purify...\".  \n(Citation: Qur'an 5:41-42)\n\nThus, rejecting a saheeh hadith could indicate a deeper disconnection from divine guidance and the truth.\n\n### Conclusion\nRejecting a saheeh hadith could be viewed as a serious matter in Islam. It carries the implications of rejecting prophetic authority and guidance which, according to the Qur'an, can lead to the misguidance of the heart and ultimately punishment in the Hereafter. Understanding the Qur'anic verses surrounding following divine revelation and prophetic instruction emphasizes the importance of accepting hadith as integral to the Islamic faith.\n\n### Suggested Actions\n1. **Study the Hadith**: Engage with the authentic hadith literature to understand its context and implications in daily life.\n2. **Consult Scholars**: Seek guidance and clarification from knowledgeable scholars regarding specific hadith to resolve doubts.\n3. **Self-reflection**: Reflect on the motivations behind rejecting prophetic traditions and their alignment with one's personal beliefs."

        "question": "The hadeeth “O slaves of Allah, help me” is not saheeh",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This hadith was narrated by at-Tabaraani \n    in al-Mu‘jam al-Kabeer (17/117) via ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Shurayk who \n    said: My father told me, from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Eesa, from Zayd ibn ‘Ali, from \n    ‘Utbah ibn Ghazwaan, from the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah \n    be upon him) who said: “If one of you loses something, or one of you wants \n    help, and he is in a land in which there are no people, then let him say, ‘O \n    slaves of Allah, help me; O slaves of Allah, help me,’ for Allah has slaves \n    whom we do not see.” \n\n    There are three problems with this hadeeth \n    which mean that it must be da‘eef. They are: \n\n    1.‘Abd ar-Rahmaan \n    ibn Shurayk ibn ‘Abdullah an-Nakha‘i al-Kufi\n\n    Abu Haatim said: He is weak in narration \n    of hadeeth.\n\n    End quote from al-Jarh wa at-Ta‘deel \n    (5/244) \n\n    Ibn Hibbaan mentioned him in \n    ath-Thiqaat (8/375) and said: He sometimes makes mistakes. \n\n    Al-Haafiz said in at-Taqreeb (p. \n    342): He is sadooq (honest) but makes mistakes. \n\n    See also: Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb \n    (6/176). \n\n    2.Shurayk ibn \n    ‘Abdullah an-Nakha‘i\n\n    The scholars highlighted his poor memory \n    and lack of precision. Al-Haafiz said concerning him: He is sadooq (honest) \n    but makes many mistakes; his memory changed after he was appointed as a \n    judge in Kufah.\n\n    End quote from Taqreeb at-Tahdheeb \n    (p. 266) \n\n    3.Zayd ibn ‘Ali ibn \n    al-Husayn did not meet ‘Utbah ibn Ghazwaan or hear from him. Between the \n    death of ‘Utbah and the birth of Zayd there were approximately sixty years.\n\n    See: Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (2/249, \n    4/64) \n\n    Hence al-Haythami said concerning the \n    hadeeth: It was narrated by at-Tabaraani and its men were regarded as \n    trustworthy even though some of them were somewhat da‘eef (weak). But Zayd \n    ibn ‘Ali did not meet ‘Utbah.\n\n    End quote from Majma‘ az-Zawaa’id \n    (10/93) \n\n    There is corroborating evidence for this \n    hadeeth in the marfoo‘ hadeeth of Ibn Mas‘ood: “If the mount of one of you \n    disappears in the wilderness, let him call out: ‘O slaves of Allah, bring it \n    back to me,’ for Allah has (angels) present on earth who will bring it back \n    to you.” \n\n    This was narrated by at-Tabaraani in \n    al-Mu‘jam al-Kabeer (10/217); Abu Ya‘la in his Musnad (9/177). It \n    is also da‘eef; it was classed as such by al-Haythami in Majma‘ \n    az-Zawaa’id (10/132), al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Sharh al-Adhkaar \n    (5/150); al-Haafiz as-Sakhkhaawi in al-Ibtihaaj bi Adhkaar al-Musaafir \n    wa’l-Haaj (p. 39). \n\n    Shaykh al-Albaani discussed this hadeeth \n    in detail in as-Silsilah ad-Da‘eefah, where he (may Allah have mercy \n    on him) said: \n\n    In addition to the fact that this hadeeth \n    is da‘eef (weak), there is nothing in the text to suggest that it is \n    permissible to seek the help of the dead, such as the awliya’ (“saints”; \n    close friends of Allah) and the righteous, because it clearly indicates that \n    what is meant by the slaves of Allah here is some creation other than human \n    beings. \n\n    This is based on the fact that in the \n    first hadeeth he says: “for Allah has (angels) present on earth who will \n    bring it back to you,” and in this hadeeth he says: “Allah has slaves whom \n    we do not see.” \n\n    This description can only apply to the \n    angels or the jinn, because they are the ones who we do not usually see. … \n    So it is not permissible to include with them Muslims among the jinn or \n    humans whom they call “men of the unseen,” such as the awliya’ and the \n    righteous, whether they are alive or dead. Seeking help from them and \n    seeking their aid is blatant shirk, because they cannot hear the \n    supplication, and even if they could hear it, they would not be able to \n    respond and fulfil the request. \n\n    This is clearly stated in many verses, \n    including the passage in which Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “And those, whom you invoke or call \n    upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the thin membrane over the date \n    stone).\n\n    If you invoke (or call upon) them, they \n    hear not your call, and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant \n    it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown \n    your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad SAW) like Him Who \n    is the All-Knower (of each and everything)”\n\n    [Faatir 35:13-14]. \n\n    End quote from Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth \n    ad-Da‘eefah wa’l-Mawdoo‘ah (656). \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadeeth you mentioned, “O slaves of Allah, help me,” is part of the discussion surrounding the invocation of help from Allah alone. Islamic teachings emphasize the oneness of God (Tawhid) and the belief that ultimate help and support come solely from Him, rather than from creation or any other beings. \n\nTo support this understanding, let’s refer to the provided verses from the Quran that reinforce the idea of relying solely on Allah for help and guidance.\n\n1. **Surah Al-A'raf (7:192-196)**:\n   - **Ayah 192-196** states that the beings invoked besides Allah are created and cannot help themselves. They lack the faculties (like hearing and seeing) that would enable them to respond to a person’s call. This emphasizes that one should not rely on other entities for help.\n   - **Verse**: “Who can neither help them, nor help themselves? If you call them to guidance they will not follow you...”\n   - **Source**: [Surah Al-A'raf (7:192-196)].\n\n2. **Surah At-Tawbah (9:40-44)**:\n   - Allah assisted the Prophet Muhammad during difficult times, which serves as a reminder that faith and reliance on God will bring about divine support. \n   - **Verse**: “If you do not help (the Prophet), remember God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave...”\n   - **Source**: [Surah At-Tawbah (9:40-44)].\n\n3. **Surah Al-Hajj (22:39-43)**:\n   - This passage explains that permission has been granted to those who are oppressed to fight back. It illustrates God's support for the oppressed and those who are devoted to Him.\n   - **Verse**: “God will surely help those who help Him, -- verily God is all-powerful and all-mighty...”\n   - **Source**: [Surah Al-Hajj (22:39-43)].\n\n4. **Surah An-Nahl (16:37-41)**:\n   - This passage talks about God's control over guidance and acknowledges that He guides whom He wills, thus emphasizing God's ultimate power in granting help.\n   - **Verse**: “Even if you are eager to guide them, God does not surely guide those who have gone astray...”\n   - **Source**: [Surah An-Nahl (16:37-41)].\n\n5. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:17-21)**:\n   - This verse emphasizes that no one can save you from Allah’s decree except Allah Himself. Also, it draws attention to the loyalty and support that should truly exist among believers.\n   - **Verse**: “Say: 'Who will save you from God if He decides to afflict you or show you His mercy?' They will never find a friend or helper apart from God.”\n   - **Source**: [Surah Al-Ahzab (33:17-21)].\n\n6. **Surah An-Nasr (110:1-3)**:\n   - This surah signifies victory coming from Allah. Those who witness it should glorify Him and seek His forgiveness, underlining the concept that help and success come from Him alone.\n   - **Verse**: “When the help of God arrives and victory... then glorify your Lord and seek His forgiveness.”\n   - **Source**: [Surah An-Nasr (110:1-3)].\n\nIn summary, the invocation for help is fundamentally directed towards Allah in Islamic belief. The cited verses consistently remind believers that ultimate assistance and guidance come from Allah alone and stressing reliance on Him aligns with core Islamic teachings. The hadeeth questioning this principle is deemed non-authentic as it contradicts the importance of divine reliance."

        "question": "Quoting as evidence for seeking the help of someone other than Allah being permissible the hadeeth, “If one of you gets lost in the wilderness, let him call out, “Help me, O slaves of Allah.’”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nAl-Bazzaar (4922) narrated via Usaamah ibn Zayd al-Laythi, from Abaan ibn Saalih, from Mujaahid, from Ibn ‘Abbaas, in a marfoo‘ report: “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has angels on earth other than the recording angels who write down how many leaves fall from the trees. If one of you gets lost in the wilderness, let him call out, ‘Help me, O slaves of Allah.’” \nAl-Bazzaar said:\nWe do not know of these words being narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in this wording except this version with this isnaad.\nEnd quote from Musnad al-Bazzaar (11/181) \nThere are two problems with this hadeeth: \n1.It is based on the narration of Usaamah ibn Zayd al-Laythi\nHe is one of the narrators concerning whom the scholars of al-jarh wa at-ta‘deel (evaluation of hadeeth narrators) differed. Some of them regarded him as thiqah (trustworthy), and others regarded him as da‘eef (weak). Whatever the case, there is some doubt about his memory and precision. \nImam Ahmad said: If you examine the hadeeth he narrated, you will find some oddness in it.\nEnd quote from al-Kaamil fi Du‘afa’ ar-Rijaal (2/76) \nAl-Haafiz adh-Dhahabi said concerning him:\nHe is sadooq (honest) but sometimes gets confused. The view of Yahya al-Qattaan differed concerning him. Ahmad said: He is nothing. An-Nasaa’i said: He is not qawiy (strong). Ibn ‘Adiyy said: There is nothing wrong with him. \nEnd quote from al-Mughni fi ad-Du‘afa’ (1/66) \nSimilarly, al-Haafiz said concerning him in at-Taqreeb: He is (honest) but sometimes gets confused.\nEnd quote from Taqreeb at-Tahdheeb (p. 98) \n2.Those who narrated it from Usaamah ibn Zayd differed about how  he narrated this hadeeth. Some of them narrated it from him in a marfoo ‘ report, as the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and some narrated it in a mawqoof report as the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him).\nThe only one who narrated it as a marfoo‘ report was Haatim ibn Ismaa‘eel. His report was narrated by al-Bazzaar in his Musnad (4922). \nFour narrators differed from him. They are: \n1.‘Abdullah ibn Farookh. His report was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan (1/325)\n2.Rawh ibn ‘Ubaadah. His report was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan (10/140)\n3.Ja‘far ibn ‘Awn. His report was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan (10/140)\n4.Abu Khaalid al-Ahmar. His report was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (6/91)\nAll of them narrated from Usaamah ibn Zayd al-Laythi, and regarded it as the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas. \nUndoubtedly the mawqoof report (with an isnaad going back to the Sahaabi – Ibn Abbaas – and not the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – is more likely to be sound, because the number of its narrators is greater and they are more precise, so they are less likely to have made mistakes and get confused. \nImam ash-Shaafa‘i said: If there are several narrators (whose reports concur), it is more likely to be transmitted correctly than if there is only one narrator.\nEnd quote from Ikhtilaaf al-Hadeeth , p. 177 \nAl-Haafiz Shams ad-Deen adh-Dhahabi said: If a hadeeth is narrated by a trustworthy narrator with an isnaad, and he narrated it as a mawqoof or mursal report, but a number of his trustworthy peers differed from him, then what counts is that on which those trustworthy narrators are agreed, because a single narrator may make mistakes. In this case there is a clear mistake with no way to explain it, and what matters is what the majority agree on.\nal-Mooqazah p. 52 \nWhat is more likely to be the case with this hadeeth – if we determine that it is acceptable – is that it is the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas, and not the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). \nAl-Bayhaqi said: This is mawqoof (and its isnaad ends with) Ibn ‘Abbaas, and it has been applied by some righteous people, and they found it to be true from experience.\nEnd quote from al-Adaab, p. 269 \nAmong those who acted upon this hadeeth was Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. \n‘Abdullah the son of Imam Ahmad said: I heard my father say: I heard my father say: I did Hajj five times, twice riding and three times walking, or twice walking and three times riding. I lost my way during one Hajj and I was walking, so I began to call out: O slaves of Allah, show me the way. I kept doing that until I found the road.\nEnd quote from Masaa’il al-Imam Ahmad Riwaayat Ibnihi ‘Abdullah (p. 245). See also: Tareekh Dimashq by Ibn ‘Asaakir (5/298). \nSecondly: \nOne of the important matters to which attention must be paid is that the guideline on the kind of seeking help that constitutes shirk is “asking of anyone other than Allah for that which no one can do except Allah.” \nAs for seeking help from other created beings in matters that they are able to do, that has nothing to do with shirk at all. \nThe report mentioned states that there is a type of angels, who are alive, in the sense of a life that is natural and appropriate for them. Allah has put them on earth to help those who are lost and guide them to the correct route, so whoever asks them for help is asking for help from a created being regarding something that he is able to do, and Allah has created him for this role. \nThere is a great difference between this and asking a created being who is dead or absent to heal his sick loved one, or to bless him with a child, or to make childbirth easy for his wife, or to have mercy on him and forgive him, and other things that no one can do except Allah. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:\nIstighaathah means seeking ghawth (help) which is removal of hardship. A created being may be asked for help with regard to matters that he is able to help with, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“but if they seek your help in religion, it is your duty to help them”\n[al-Anfaal 8:72]\n“The man of his (own) party asked him for help against his foe”\n[al-Qasas 28:15]\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety)”\n[al-Maa’idah 5:2]. \nBut with regard to that which no one can do except Allah, it should only be sought from Allah. End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (1/103). \nAnd he said:\nAs for that which no one can do except Allah, may He be exalted, it is not permissible to seek it from anyone except Allah, may He be glorified; it should not be sought from the angels or the Prophets or anyone else, and it is not permissible to say to anyone other than Allah “Forgive me” or “Give us rain” or “Grant us victory over the disbelieving people” or “Guide our hearts” and so on. … As for that which humans are able to do, that does not come under this heading.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (1/329) \nAnd he said:\nThe Sunnah is that the living person may be asked to offer du‘aa’ (supplication), just as he may be asked for anything else that he is able to do. As for created beings who are absent or dead, they are not to be asked for anything.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (1/344) \nAnd he said:\nThings that no one is able to do except Allah are not to be sought from anyone else, such as sending down rain, causing crops to grow, relief of distress, guidance away from the wrong paths, and forgiveness of sins. No one in creation is able to do these things; no one is able to do them except Allah.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (1/370) \nWe have quoted a great deal from Shaykh al-Islam about this point because there is a great deal of confusion about it among those who follow whims and desires and innovations (bid‘ah), who seek to confuse others also. \nShaykh Saalih Aal ash-Shaykh said: The hadeeth does not support the claim of the followers of falsehood, that one may ask of the dead and others. Rather it clearly states that those who are addressed by the one who has lost his way are the angels, who can hear what he says to them and are able to respond by their Lord’s leave, because they are alive and have been given the ability to help the one who is lost find his way. They are the ones who are addressed as slaves of Allah; they are alive and can hear, and can respond by doing what their Lord enables them to do, which is to help the one who is lost in the wilderness find his way. Whoever quotes these reports as meaning that one may call upon a specific person by name is telling lies against the Messenger of Allah, and he has not paid attention to and contemplated the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and that is characteristic of those who follow whims and desires. \nOnce this is clear, we may say that this report contains words that may be said and one may be lenient concerning it, despite the fact that it is da‘eef, because it is in accordance with the basic teachings of Islam and is not contrary to the texts of the Qur’an and Prophetic hadeeths. Moreover, it is specific to a situation as mentioned in the report, because this is one of the matters concerning which it is not permissible to make analogy, as beliefs are based on tawqeef [i.e., they can only be known through divine Revelation and sound texts of hadeeth, with no room for ijtihad].  This is what we understand. (p. 56) \nTo sum up: \nWith regard to that which no one can do except Allah, and that which is unique to His Lordship, such as giving life, causing death, and granting provision… All of that is not to be sought from anyone except Him, may He be glorified. Whoever seeks help from anyone other than Allah with regard to such matters has committed shirk (association of others with Allah). \nWith regard to that which created beings are able to do, there is nothing wrong with asking for it from those who are able to do it, or seeking their help with regard to it, subject to two conditions: that the one whose help is sought is alive and present, and that he is able to do that thing. \nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 132642\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the question regarding the permissibility of seeking help from others besides Allah in Islam, we can refer both to the cited hadith and relevant Quranic verses. The hadith states, “If one of you gets lost in the wilderness, let him call out, ‘Help me, O slaves of Allah.’” This implies that one may call upon the believers or righteous individuals for assistance in times of need, especially in situations where one may be helpless.\n\n### Quranic Perspectives\n\n1. **Surah Al-A'raf (7:192-196)**:\n   - **Verses**: *“Who can neither help them, nor help themselves? If you call them to guidance they will not follow you. It is all the same if you call them or hold your tongue. Those whom you invoke besides God are created beings like you. So call on them and let them answer your call, if what you say is true.”*\n   - **Interpretation**: These verses illustrate that the beings worshipped or called upon other than Allah cannot provide genuine help or guidance. They are creations who lack power over their own circumstances.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Hajj (22:39-40)**:\n   - **Verses**: *“Permission is granted those (to take up arms) who fight because they were oppressed. God is certainly able to give help to those who were driven away from their homes for no other reason than they said: ‘Our Lord is God.’”*\n   - **Interpretation**: This verse shows that divine support is a promise from Allah to those who are justly oppressed. It indicates that while humans may assist one another, ultimate support comes from Allah.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Kahf (18:51-55)**:\n   - **Verses**: *“I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation. I would not take as helpers those who lead (men) astray.”*\n   - **Interpretation**: This passage underscores the futility of relying on beings who cannot aid themselves, affirming that only Allah is the true Helper. \n\n### Context of the Hadith\n\nThe hadith where a person calls upon \"O slaves of Allah\" suggests that there is a permissible degree of asking for help from fellow Muslims, particularly from those who are righteous and capable of aiding. In dire straits, as in the wilderness or during crises, it is allowed to seek assistance from others. This is consistent with the notion of community support in Islam, where believers are enjoined to support one another.\n\n### Key Distinctions\n\nWhile seeking aid from other humans is permissible, it is essential to differentiate between asking for help in practical matters and invoking beings (angels, prophets, saints, etc.) in ways that imply reliance on them as partners with Allah (shirk). The Quran extensively cautions against associating partners with Allah (e.g., Surah Al-A'raf 7:194-201 and Surah Al-An'am 6:68-72).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIslam teaches the importance of reliance on Allah as the ultimate source of help while also recognizing the value of community support among believers. The emphasis should always remain on Allah's power and mercy, and any appeal to others must be framed within the understanding that they are merely agents or means through which Allah may choose to assist. Thus, seeking help from others while maintaining the belief that true help comes from Allah is coherent with Islamic teachings. \n\nIn summary, while the hadith affirms a communal approach to seeking assistance, the Quran strongly emphasizes that Allah is the ultimate source of support and guidance."

        "question": "He is asking about original copies of Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Saheeh Muslim!",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    One of the most important things that the \n    educated Muslim, or the Muslim who is acquainted with the classical legacy, \n    should understand is that stirring up doubts is easy and is something that \n    anyone could do, to stir up doubts about anything, even about basic givens \n    and common-sense issues on which people base their rational thinking. The \n    matter may even go so far that some of those who got carried away with \n    doubts and specious arguments ended up denying their own existence, and \n    doubted everything around them, which led to them being admitted to mental \n    health clinics, because they drifted so far from common sense and sound \n    human nature. \n\n    This is how we deal with many so-called \n    specious arguments which are, in reality, nothing but illusions uttered by \n    some people who are causing us trouble at this time. This always compels us \n    to start from the very beginning in establishing principles of sound \n    rational thinking in various fields of knowledge and education. \n\n    What is mentioned in the question is one \n    such example. If what the questioner meant by “original copies” is \n    manuscripts that the author wrote in his own hand, then according what \n    rational thinking or logic can it be said that it is essential that the \n    original manuscripts be extant in order to accept that a particular book is \n    correctly attributed to its author?! How many books are there in the world, \n    since people learned how to write, that could meet this irrational \n    condition?! \n\n    In order to understand how irrational \n    those who stipulate that condition are, all you have to do is imagine that \n    one of them entered a venerable library or well-known publishing house or \n    international bookstore and said to the person in charge, I will not accept \n    the attribution of any books you have in this huge store unless you give me \n    the original manuscript, written by the author himself, so that I will be \n    certain that these books are soundly attributed to their authors! Doing this \n    would be ignoring all the customs and academic and legal requirements which \n    guarantee to us nowadays that the book is sound and that it will not be \n    claimed by anyone other than the author, such as requirements to register \n    books in the National Library, to get permission to publish, making books \n    well-known to critics and providing well-established evidence to that \n    effect, and other similar academic ways of proving such matters. \n\n    We know for certain that some of those who \n    specialise in producing specious arguments know deep down in their hearts \n    how foolish and silly are the things they suggest and say, but at the same \n    time they persist in saying it because they know that merely stating his \n    specious with regard to anything that exists will inevitably have some \n    influence on people’s hearts and minds. Hence whatever results he gets will \n    suffice him, even if he only manages to confuse a few people. What matters \n    to him is that he shuffles the cards and causes confusion with regard to \n    sound ways of thinking. \n\n    However, Saheeh al-Bukhaari was \n    heard by ninety thousand men from Imam al-Bukhaari himself (may Allah have \n    mercy on him), as was stated by one of his most famous students, namely \n    Muhammad ibn Yoosuf al-Farbari (d. 320 AH). See: Tareekh Baghdaad \n    (2/9); Tareekh al-Islam (7/375). Al-Farbari’s narration of Saheeh \n    al-Bukhaari was famous because he lived for a long time and was precise \n    in copying it out. He heard it from al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on \n    him) over three years, then a number of trustworthy narrators learned it \n    from him, and from them this book became well-known. \n\n    Al-Mustamli (d. 376 AH) – one of those who \n    narrated it from Muhammad ibn Yoosuf al-Farbari – said: I copied the book of \n    al-Bukhaari from its original text that was with Ibn Yoosuf, and I saw that \n    he had not completed it yet; there were many blank pages there, including \n    some isnaads after which he had not written any hadeeths, and some hadeeths \n    for which he had not written any isnaads. So we tried to complete that.\n\n    End quote. Narrated by al-Baaji in at-Ta‘deel \n    wa’t-Tajreeh (1/310) \n\n    The Saheeh was narrated from al-Farbari \n    by a number of trustworthy narrators, among the most famous of whom were the \n    following: \n\n    Al-Mustamli (d. 376 AH), whose name was \n    Ibraaheem ibn Ahmad\n\n    Al-Hamawi Khateeb Sarkhas (d. 381 AH), \n    whose name was ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad\n\n    Abu’l-Haytham al-Kashmeehani (d. 389 AH), \n    whose name was Muhammad ibn Makki\n\n    Abu ‘Ali ash-Shabwi, whose name was \n    Muhammad ibn ‘Umar\n\n    Ibn as-Sakan al-Bazzaaz (d. 353 AH), whose \n    name was Sa‘eed ibn ‘Uthmaan\n\n    Abu Zayd al-Mirwazi (d. 371 AH), whose \n    name was Muhammad ibn Ahmad\n\n    Abu Ahmad al-Jarjaani (d. 373 AH), whose \n    name was Muhammad ibn Muhammad \n\n    Among the trustworthy students of al-Bukhaari \n    who heard his Saheeh directly from him and transmitted it to the \n    people with its isnaads in written form was the imam, hafiz, faqeeh and \n    qaadi, Abu Ishaaq Ibraaheem ibn Ma‘qil ibn al-Hajjaaj an-Nasafi (d. 295). \n    The copy of an- Nasafi was transmitted by Imam al-Khattaabi (may Allah have \n    mercy on him), as he said in his commentary A‘laam al-Hadeeth \n    (1/105): We heard most of this book from the narration of Ibraaheem ibn \n    Ma‘qil an- Nasafi. Khalaf ibn Muhammad al-Khayyaam told us: Ibraaheem ibn \n    Ma‘qil told us, from him. \n\n    This is the most famous way that the \n    scholars of hadith had: they would read their books to their students, or \n    their students would read their books to them. Then those books would become \n    well-known through the students and narrators, not through the original \n    manuscript of the author, which was one copy that he kept for himself. There \n    were no printing presses or publishing houses at that time; instead of \n    printing presses there was the narration of students with strong isnaads. \n\n    What would any researcher find more \n    authentic than the transmission of trustworthy narrators narrating from the \n    manuscripts that were read to (and checked with) the author himself and \n    approved by him, as they said concerning the copy of as-Saghaanni: He copied \n    it from the manuscript that was read to the author (may Allah have mercy on \n    him)”?\n\n    See: Fayd al-Baari by al-Kashmiri. \n\n    If you want to ask about how old the \n    manuscripts that are extant today are, the Orientalist Manjana said in \n    Cambridge in 1936 CE that the oldest manuscript he had come across up to \n    that point was written in 370 AH, according to the narration of al-Mirwazi \n    from al-Farbari. See Tareekh at-Turaath by Fu’aad Sizkeen (1/228). \n\n    One of the most famous manuscripts of the \n    book that has come down to us in modern times is the copy of al-Haafiz Abu \n    ‘Ali as-Sadafi (d. 514 AH), which he copied from the manuscript written by \n    Muhammad ibn ‘Ali ibn Mahmoud, which was read to Abu Dharr (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) and has his writing on it too. It was kept by al-‘Allaamah at-Taahir \n    ibn ‘Ashoor, who borrowed it from the library of Tobruk in Libya. \n\n    There is also the copy of the imam and \n    hafiz Sharaf ad-Deen ‘Ali ibn Ahmad al-Yoonayni, who is known as al-Ba‘li \n    al-Hanbali (d. 701 AH). He checked it against the original copy that was \n    read to al-Haafiz Abu Dharr al-Harawi, and the original copy that was read \n    to al-Aseeli, and the original copy al-Haafiz Ibn ‘Asaakir, and the original \n    copy that was read to Abu’l-Waqt in the presence of the grammarian and \n    linguist Ibn Maalik, the author of al-Alfiyyah (d. 672 AH). \n\n    And so on… if we were to keep listing the \n    copies of as-Saheeh that are extant in the manuscript libraries of \n    the world, and how close they were to the time when as-Saheeh was \n    written, and the large numbers of those who copied and checked them, and how \n    trustworthy they were, and how they checked their copies against the \n    authoritative main copies, that would take a great deal of time. It is \n    sufficient for you to go to one of the libraries where manuscripts are kept \n    and ask about Saheeh al-Bukhaari; you will find hundreds of copies \n    with sound chains of transmission going back to Imam al-Bukhaari himself. \n    Al-Fihris ash-Shaamil lists 2327 locations in various libraries in which \n    there are manuscripts of this book.\n\n    See: al-Fihris ash-Shaamil li’t-Turaath \n    al-‘Arabi al-Islami al-Makhtoot, al-Hadeeth an-Nabawi wa ‘Uloomuhu \n    (1/493-565). \n\n    With regard to Saheeh Muslim, it is \n    no less well-known and widespread than the Saheeh of Imam al-Bukhaari, \n    as Brockelmann said: Saheeh Muslim almost matches Saheeh al-Bukhaari \n    in the number of manuscripts and their presence in most libraries, as he \n    stated in The History of Arabic Literature (3/180) \n\n    It has many chains of transmission which \n    confirm that the book is soundly attributed to its author. The number of \n    such chains of transmission is almost unlimited, to such an extent that a \n    number of scholars wrote books just to discuss the chains of transmission of\n    Saheeh Muslim; there are eight such books, one of the last of which \n    was the book by al-Kattaani (d. 1327 AH) entitled Juz’ Asaaneed \n    Saheeh Muslim. \n\n    Shaykh Mashhoor Hasan Salmaan said: \n\n    A group of people learned this book from \n    Muslim, one of the most famous of whom was Ibraaheem ibn Muhammad ibn \n    Sufyaan. He heard it from its author no less than three times, and he \n    checked it against the copy of his shaykh, Muslim. Muslim’s copy was very \n    precious and dear to him; he carried it with him to ar-Rayy and placed it \n    before Abu Zur‘ah ar-Raazi and Ibn Waarah looked at it. A number of scholars \n    learned it from Sufyaan; among them was al-Jaloodi. His copy was in \n    circulation among the students and some of them made a copy of it… Many of \n    these copies were very precise and were read to some prominent scholars and \n    checked against other manuscripts. Therefore the scholars used it as a \n    reference for research and discussion; they used to refer to it when dealing \n    with issues and problems. There are many manuscript copies of as-Saheeh \n    in libraries throughout the world, and hardly any library is without it. \n    These copies vary in the dates at which they were copied and they vary in \n    condition. \n\n    In the library of al-Qarawiyyeen in Fez up \n    till now there is a very precious copy of it; this is the copy of Ibn Khayr \n    al-Ishbeeli, which he checked many times (against other manuscripts); he \n    heard it read to him and he read it to other shaykhs, to such an extent that \n    it is regarded as the greatest extant manuscript of Saheeh Muslim \n    in North Africa. Written on it in the handwriting of Ibn Khayr is a note \n    stating that he checked it against three other original manuscripts of the \n    copy of al-Haafiz Abu ‘Ali al-Jiyaani. \n\n    End quote from al-Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj \n    wa Manhajuhu fi’s-Saheeh (1/375-376) \n\n    As for the claim that “some of the \n    commentators on al-Bukhaari discussed the meaning of some hadeeths that are \n    not in al-Bukhaari”, we have not found a single example of that. Differences \n    in the reports in Saheeh al-Bukhaari only occur in a few, very minor \n    cases having to do with the isnaads or some phrases in the texts, or the \n    chapter headings. But to suggest that there are some independent hadeeths \n    under some headings that were mentioned in some manuscripts but not others, \n    we could not find any example of that. \n\n    Even if we assume that they exist, it is \n    not something to object to or find strange. If the narrators who narrated \n    from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) differed \n    sometimes, whereby some of the Sahaabah narrated the hadeeth with a \n    particular wording, and others narrated it with a different wording, or some \n    of the Sahaabah narrated a hadeeth and others did not remember it, in dozens \n    of examples, that does not undermine the principle of the Prophetic Sunnah, \n    and it does not shed doubt on the trustworthiness of the Sahaabah who \n    narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). So it \n    is more appropriate that the fact that there are slight differences between \n    the narrators of al-Jaami‘ as-Saheeh should not undermine the basic \n    authenticity of the book or its trustworthiness or its hadeeths and \n    reports. \n\n    We do not doubt that a lack of experience \n    in dealing with the classical Islamic legacy – and indeed a lack of \n    knowledge about the nature of history and manuscripts altogether – is the \n    reason for such misleading ideas or extreme ignorance and lack of \n    understanding on the part of the one who says that. \n\n    Otherwise, anyone who has any knowledge of \n    these branches of knowledge will be certain that minor differences in \n    reports or manuscripts in classical books is something natural in the light \n    of the fact that people in the past relied on copying by hand, and because \n    means of communication were very simple, and copyists were sometimes \n    imprecise in adhering to the original text; indeed they were sometimes \n    unaware of alterations that the author himself had introduced to his book \n    that would lead to some differences in the copies, as happened in the case \n    of Sunan at-Tirmidhi, Sunan Abi Dawood, al-Muwatta’ by \n    Imam Maalik, and the Musnad of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Indeed that \n    also happened in the case of the poetry of the Jaahiliyyah before that, and \n    in the books of Plato, Aristotle, and the entire legacy of Greek philosophy, \n    and in the case of both the Torah and the Gospel. \n\n    We hope that by giving these brief \n    highlights, readers will be alerted to the nature of these specious \n    arguments that are made and will realise that a little rational thinking, \n    with a little experience, will be sufficient to ward off all these specious \n    arguments. \n\n    See: Riwaayaat wa Nusakh al-Jaami‘ as-Saheeh \n    li’l-Imam Abu ‘Abdullah Muhammad ibn Ismaa‘eel al-Bukhaari: Diraasah wa \n    Tahleel, by Dr. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Kareem ibn ‘Ubayd, which was of \n    great use to us in preparing the answer given above. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "When discussing the original copies of **Saheeh al-Bukhaari** and **Saheeh Muslim**, it is essential to understand their significance in Islamic tradition and how they relate to the preservation of Hadith—the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). \n\n### Overview of Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Saheeh Muslim\n\n1. **Saheeh al-Bukhaari**: Compiled by Imam Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari (d. 870 CE), this collection is regarded as the most authentic collection of Hadith in Sunni Islam. Al-Bukhari spent years traveling and studying to collect over 600,000 Hadiths, of which he meticulously selected 7,275 that met his stringent criteria for authenticity.\n\n2. **Saheeh Muslim**: Compiled by Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj (d. 875 CE), this collection is similarly esteemed and is often considered second only to Saheeh al-Bukhaari. Imam Muslim also traveled extensively and collected Hadiths, focusing on those that had a solid chain of narration. His collection contains around 9,200 Hadiths (with repetitions), with essential authenticity.\n\n### Preservation and Original Copies\n\nWhile original manuscripts of these texts may not fully survive today, the credibility of their content is maintained due to the rigorous criteria employed by the scholars. They ensured that every Hadith was verified based on:\n\n- **Chain of Narration (Isnad)**: Each Hadith must have a chain of reliable narrators.\n- **Content Verification (Matn)**: The content of the Hadith must be consistent with accepted Islamic teachings and free from contradictions.\n\nThe preservation of these texts can be linked to Quranic teachings about the importance of protecting divine revelation and truth.\n\n### Relevant Quranic Verses\n\nThe Quran speaks about the preservation of its own teachings which can be extrapolated to the preservation of Hadith due to their intertwined nature:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:146-150)** describes knowledge of the Book, emphasizing that God has power over all things and speaks to the truth:\n   - \"Those to whom We have sent down the Book know this even as they know their sons. Yet a section among them conceals the truth knowingly...\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:146-150)**\n\n2. **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:101)** advises the believers to avoid asking questions that might vex them, recognizing that once the truth is known, it must be accepted:\n   - \"O believers, do not ask about things which, if made known to you, may vex you...\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:101)**\n\n3. Similarly, **Surah Al-Hijr (15:90-94)** warns against those who fragment the Scriptures pondering on the traditions of prior prophets, thereby showing the necessity for maintaining a unified and true account of prophetic teachings:\n   - \"Like (those) We had sent to those schismatics who slandered their Books and severed their Scripture into fragments.\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Hijr, 15:90-94)**\n\n4. In **Surah Al-Anbya (21:23)**, it is noted that God will question all about their deeds and emphasizes the importance of bringing proof in faith matters:\n   - \"He cannot be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Anbya, 21:23)**\n\nThese references underline the responsibility of believers to uphold and preserve the authentic teachings of Islam, which include both the Quran and Hadith literature. \n\nIn conclusion, while original copies of Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Saheeh Muslim may not exist in their initial forms, the rigorous methods of validation and the significance placed on preserving authentic Hadith ensure that their teachings remain vital and accessible to Muslims today. The principles laid down in the Quran about knowledge and truth guide this preservation endeavor."

        "question": "Is Prayer on Last Friday of Ramadan Expiation for Missing Prayers?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The obligation to make up missed prayers\nWhoever omits an obligatory prayer until the time for it has ended, one of the following must be the case: either he omitted it for a legitimate reason such as falling asleep or forgetting, or he omitted it without any excuse.\nIf a person omits a prayer for a legitimate reason, there is no sin on him, but he must offer it when he wakes up or remembers. If a person omits it deliberately, then he has committed a grave sin and he must make it up according to many scholars; others favoured the view that he cannot make it up, but he is required to repent, pray for forgiveness, regret it, and do a lot of righteous deeds. \nIs there any special prayer on the last Friday of Ramadan?\nThe report that speaks of a prayer that may be offered by one who omitted a prayer deliberately until the time for it ended, so that it may be an expiation for his deeds, is a lie and is falsely attributed to Islamic teaching. There follow some comments of the scholars concerning that: \n1. Ash-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“The hadith “Whoever prays the five obligatory prayers of the night and day on the last Friday of Ramadan, that will make up for what he missed of prayers during that year” is undoubtedly mawdu‘ (fabricated). I could not find it in any of the books in which the authors compiled fabricated hadiths, but it is well-known among a group of people who claim to have knowledge in the city of San‘a nowadays, and many of them do that! I do not know who fabricated it and told it to them; may Allah curse the liars.” (Al-Ahadith al-Mawdu‘ah, p. 54) \n2. The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said: \n“Prayer is an act of worship and the basic principle concerning it is tawqif i.e., stopping at what has been narrated in Shari‘ah (and not introducing anything new); the issue of making up the prayers and details of how to do that is something to be learned from texts and it is not valid to refer to anything in this regard except the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the consensus based on both of them or one of them. \nThere is no proof from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or from his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), or from the leaders of guidance (may Allah have mercy on them) that they offered this prayer or instructed or encouraged others to do so. \nIf it was something established, then his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would have known about it and would have transmitted it to us, and the leaders of guidance after them would have guided us to it. But there is no proof to that effect from any of them in word or in deed. \nThat indicates that what is mentioned in the question about the “prayer to make up for the prayers of a lifetime (salat al-qada al-‘umri)” is a bid‘ah that has been introduced into Islam for which Allah has not prescribed. It is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.” (Agreed upon). Rather what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to do is to make up the prayers that one misses because of falling asleep or forgetting until the time for them ends, and he explained to us that we should offer those prayers as they are usually offered when we wake up or remember, not on the last Friday of Ramadan.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Daimah, 8/167, 168) Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud \n3. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \nThere is a group of people who have a custom in Ramadan, which is to offer the five obligatory prayers after a prayer on the last Friday (of Ramadan), and they say that this is to make up for any obligatory prayers that a person did not offer or that he forgot in Ramadan. What is the ruling on this prayer? \nHe replied: \n“The ruling concerning this prayer is that it is an innovation (bid‘ah) and it has no basis in Islamic teachings; it will only take a person further away from his Lord, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance will be in the Fire.” No matter how much the followers of an innovation like it and regard it as good in their own minds, it is something bad before Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance will be in the Fire.” These five daily prayers that a person makes up on the last Friday of Ramadan have no basis in Islamic teaching. Moreover, we say: has this person missed only five prayers? Perhaps he missed a number of days, not a number of prayers? \nWhat matters is that so long as a person is aware that he has missed prayers, he must make them up when he realises that, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it, let him offer it when he remembers it” (Agreed upon). But if a person does these five prayers to be on the safe side – as they claim – that is something reprehensible and is not permitted.” (Majmu‘ Fatawa ash-Shaykh al-‘Uthaymin, 12/227, 228) \n4. Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) was asked: \nI read a hadith from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in which he said: “Whoever misses a prayer during his life and cannot remember what it was, let him get up on the last Friday of Ramadan and pray four rak‘ahs with one tashahhud, reciting in each rak‘ah the Opening of the Book (i.e., al-Fatihah) and Surat al-Qadr fifteen times, and Surat al-Kawthar the same number of times, and let him say in his intention: I intend to pray four rak‘ahs as expiation for what I have missed of prayers.” How sound is this hadith? \nHe replied: \n“There is no basis for this in the Sunnah of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). What is proven from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is that he said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, let him offer it when he remembers it. There is no expiation for that except this” (agreed upon). With regard to the prayers that you missed previously, if you missed them because of sleep – for example – or because you were unconscious, or for some excuse that you thought made it permissible for you to delay them, then what you must do is make them up and offer them in order. If you missed them deliberately, then the more correct of the two scholarly views is that you must repent to Allah, because the one who misses prayer deliberately is in a grave position, even if he does not deny that they are obligatory. The correct view is that he has become a disbeliever by doing that. So you must repent to Allah if you missed them deliberately, and you must persist in offering prayers regularly in the future, and may Allah accept your repentance. \nBut if you missed them because of sleep or unconsciousness, or something else that prevented you from offering them on time, then you have no choice but to make them up. As for offering this prayer that you mentioned at the end of Ramadan in this manner, there is no basis for that in the Islamic religion, and it will not make up for the prayers that you missed.”\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the issue of missing prayers and their expiation is a significant concern for believers. Specifically, your question about whether prayer on the last Friday of Ramadan can serve as expiation for missed prayers is nuanced and largely dependent on the interpretation of religious texts and scholarly consensus.\n\n### Overview of Prayer in Islam\n\nPrayer (Salah) is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and is compulsory for all adult Muslims. It is a means of maintaining a connection with Allah and seeking His guidance and forgiveness. The Quran emphasizes the importance of establishing prayer:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:43)**: \"And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship].\" \n\nThis establishes prayer not just as an act of worship but as an obligatory duty.\n\n### Understanding Expiation\n\nExpiation (Kaffara) in Islam generally pertains to acts or conditions wherein a believer seeks forgiveness for their wrongdoings or missed obligations. For fasting, for example, those unable to fast due to health issues may feed the poor (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:184).\n\n### Missing Prayers\n\nIn the case of missed prayers (Salah), the Quran acknowledges that believers may face various circumstances, such as illness or travel, that may hinder their ability to pray on time:\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:101)**: \"And when you travel in the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer, if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt [or attack] you...\"\n\nHowever, the expiation specifically for missed obligatory prayers (fard) is not clearly delineated in the Quran.\n\n### Prayer on the Last Friday of Ramadan\n\nThere is no specific Quranic text that indicates that prayer on the last Friday of Ramadan serves specifically as an expiation for missed prayers. However, it is a tradition, particularly in certain cultures, to engage in significant prayers during this time, known as Jumu'ah (Friday prayer). \n\nGeneral practices around this Friday may be seen as beneficial due to the significance of Ramadan and the rewards associated with prayer during these holy times. The congregation on Fridays is highlighted in the Quran:\n\n- **Surah Al-Jumu'ah (62:9)**: \"O you who have believed, when the call to prayer is pronounced on the Day of Congregation, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave trade...\"\n\nThis verse promotes the idea of gathering for prayer, indicating that Fridays hold a special place in the Islamic faith.\n\n### Scholarly Opinions\n\nMost scholars agree that while prayers during Ramadan (including the last Friday) are highly revered, they do not serve as a formal expiation for missed obligatory prayers. Instead, it is recommended to make up missed prayers (Qadha) faithfully as soon as possible. If someone has missed prayers, the best course is to sincerely repent and perform the prayers that were missed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo summarize, while the last Friday of Ramadan is a significant time for prayer and reflection, there is no direct evidence or consensus that participating in this prayer serves as an expiation for missed obligatory prayers. Instead, believers are urged to fulfill their missed prayers as a priority while continually seeking Allah's mercy and forgiveness. The way to seek expiation for missed obligatory prayers remains through sincere repentance and making up those prayers.\n\n### Relevant Verses\n\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:43)**: Importance of prayer.\n2. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:184)**: Expiation related to fasting.\n3. **Surah An-Nisa (4:101)**: Shortening prayers during travel.\n4. **Surah Al-Jumu'ah (62:9)**: Importance of congregational prayer.\n\nThese verses emphasize the necessity of prayer, the forgiveness of Allah, and the conditions under which obligations may be adjusted or missed."

        "question": "Will a person be brought to account for whatever crosses his mind of good or evil?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhaari (6491) and Muslim (131) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, relating from his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted: “Allah decreed good deeds and bad deeds, then He explained that. Whoever thinks of doing a good deed then does not do it, Allah will write it down as one complete good deed. If he thinks of doing a good deed and then does it, Allah [may He be glorified and exalted] will write it down between ten and seven hundred fold, or many more. If he thinks of doing a bad deed then he does not do it, Allah will write it down as one complete good deed, and if he thinks of it then does it, Allah will write it down as one bad deed.” \nAl-Bukhaari (5269) and Muslim (127) also narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will forgive my ummah for whatever crosses their minds so long as they do not act upon it or speak of it.” \nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThese texts refer to four matters: the recording of good deeds and bad deeds, and thinking of good deeds and bad deeds. This is four matters.  \nThen he said: \n… The third matter: thinking of good deeds. It is recorded as one complete good deed even if he does not do it, as it says in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas and elsewhere. … In the hadeeth of Khuraym ibn Faatik it says: “… If a person thinks of doing a good deed but then does not do it and Allah knows that he thought of it and was keen to do it, He records for him one good deed…” [Narrated by Ahmad, 18556. al-Arna’oot said: Its isnaad is hasan. It was mentioned by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah]. This indicates that what is meant by “thinking of” here is the determination and resolve that are usually present when one is keen to do an action, not merely a passing thought that is not accompanied by any resolve or determination. \nAbu’d-Darda’ said: If a person goes to his bed, intending to pray during the night (qiyaam), then sleep overtakes him until morning comes, what he intended to do will be recorded for him. \nIt was narrated that Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyab said: If a person thinks of praying, fasting, going for Hajj or ‘Umrah, or going for jihad, then he is prevented from doing that, Allah will grant him the reward of what he wanted to do. \nAbu ‘Imraan al-Jawni said: It is said to the angel: Record such and such for So and so. He says: O Lord, he did not do it. He says: He intended it. \nZayd ibn Aslam said: A man used to go around among the scholars, saying: Who will tell me of a deed that I may keep doing for Allah, for I do not like any hour of the day or night to come to me except I am striving for the sake of Allah, may He be exalted. It was said to him: You have found what you are looking for. Do good as much as you are able to, then when you become tired or you stop doing it, think about doing it, for the one who thinks about doing a good deed is like the one who does it. \nIf the intention is accompanied by words or effort, the reward is ensured and the one who intended it is like the one who does it, as Abu Kabshah narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“[People] in this world are of four types: a person to whom Allah grants wealth and knowledge, so he fears his Lord with regard to it, upholds his ties of kinship with it, and acknowledges the rights of Allah concerning it – he is of the highest status. (The second is) a person to whom Allah grants knowledge but He does not grant him wealth, so he is sincere in his intention and says: If I had wealth, I would do the same as So and so does. He will be rewarded according to his intention and their reward will be the same. (The third type) is a person to whom Allah grants wealth, but He does not grant him knowledge, so he squanders his wealth without knowledge; he does not fear his Lord concerning it, he does not uphold his ties of kinship with it and he does not acknowledge the rights of Allah concerning it – he is of the worst status. (And the fourth type is) a person to whom Allah does not grant either wealth or knowledge, so he says: If I had wealth, I would do the same as So and so does. He will be requited according to his intention and their burden of sin will be the same.”\nNarrated by Imam Ahmad, at-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani because of corroborating evidence. \nThe phrase “Their reward will be the same” is understood as meaning that they are equal with regard to the basic reward for actions, but not with regard to the multiplication of that reward. Multiplication of reward is only for the one who actually does a deed, not the one who intends it but does not do it. If they were equal in all regards, a tenfold reward would be recorded for the one who thought of a good deed but did not do it, and this is contrary to all the texts. That is indicated by the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward” [an-Nisa’ 4:95]. Ibn ‘Abbaas and others said: Those who sit (at home), above whom those who strive hard and fight are preferred in grades are those who have excuses, and those who sit (at home), above whom those who strive hard and fight are preferred by a huge reward, are those who do not have excuses. \nThen he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe fourth matter is thinking of evil deeds without doing them. In the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas it says that this will be recorded as one complete good deed. Similarly in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, Anas and others it says that it will be recorded as a hasanah (good deed). In the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah it says “for he gave it up for My sake” (Muslim, 129). This indicates that what is meant is that if a person was able to do what he thought of of sin, but gave it up for the sake of Allah, may He be exalted, one good deed will undoubtedly be recorded for him for that, because his refraining from committing that sin for that reason is a righteous deed. \nBut if he thinks of committing a sin, then does not do it for fear of other people, or in order to show off to them, then it was said that he will be punished for refraining from it with that intention, because giving precedence to fear of people over fear of Allah is haraam, just as aiming to show off to people is also haraam. If refraining from the sin is accompanied by such intentions, then he will be punished for refraining. \nAl-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad said: They used to say: Refraining from doing something for the sake of people is showing off and doing it for their sake is shirk. \nBut if he tries to do it by all available means then is prevented from doing it because it is not decreed that he should do it, in that case a number of scholars stated that he will be punished for it, because of the hadeeth, “… so long as he does not speak of it or act upon it.” So if a person strives to commit a sin, then is unable to do it, he has acted upon it. Similarly, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When two Muslims confront one another with their swords, the slayer and the slain will both be in Hell.” I said – or it was said – O Messenger of Allah, (we understand about) the slayer, but what about the slain? He said: “He wanted to kill his companion.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 31: Muslim, 2888). The words “so long as he does not speak of it or act upon it” indicate that if the one who thinks of a sin speaks of what he was thinking of, then he will be punished for thinking of it in that case, because he has committed a sin with his physical faculties, which is speaking with his tongue. That is also indicated by the hadeeth of Abu Kabshah quoted above, who said: (The fourth type of person) says: “If I had wealth, I would do with it what So and so does”, referring to the one who disobeyed Allah with his wealth. He said: “Their burden of sin will be the same.” \nThen he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nBut if he changes his intention and gives up his resolve for no reason, will he be punished for what he thought of of sin, or not? \nThere are two scenarios: \nThe first is if his thinking of sin was a passing thought that he did not dwell on and it did not take root in his heart; rather he disliked it and was put off by it. This will be forgiven; it is like the awful thoughts or whispers that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked about, and he said: “That is clear faith.” [Narrated by Muslim, 132] \nWhen the verse (interpretation of the meaning) “…whether you disclose what is in your ownselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills…” [al-Baqarah 2:284] was revealed, that was distressing for the Muslims and they thought that it included these passing thoughts. Then the following verse was revealed, in which it says (interpretation of the meaning): “Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear” [al-Baqarah 2:286]. (Narrated by Muslim, 126). This proved that with regard to that which they had no strength to bear, they would not be punished or brought to account for it, and it became clear that what was meant in the first verse was things that they resolved and intended to do. \nThe second scenario is things that one has resolved and intends to do, that occurred to one’s mind and become established, and one dwells on them. These are of two types: \n(i)Acts of the heart (that have to do with belief), such as doubting or disbelieving in the Oneness of Allah, or Prophethood, or the Prophet’s mission, and other kinds of disbelief and hypocrisy. These are all things for which a person will be punished and by means of which he becomes a disbeliever and a hypocrite.\nWe may add to these all sins that have to do with the heart, such as loving that which Allah hates, hating that which Allah loves, arrogance, self admiration, etc. \n(ii)The second type has to do with that which is not actions of the heart; rather they are physical actions, such as zina, stealing, drinking alcohol, murder, slander and so on. If a person persists in wanting to do such things and resolving to do them, but he shows no outward indication of that, then there are two well-known scholarly views as to whether he will be held accountable for that.\nThe first view is that he will be held accountable for it. Ibn al-Mubaarak said: I asked Sufyaan ath-Thawri: Will a person be held accountable for thinking (of committing a sin)? He said: If he has resolved to do it, he will be held accountable. This view was regarded as more correct by many of the fuqaha’, scholars of hadeeth and scholars of kalaam among our companions and others. They quoted as evidence for that verses such as the following (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And know that Allah knows what is in your minds, so fear Him”\n[al-Baqarah 2:235]\n“but He will call you to account for that which your hearts have earned”\n[al-Baqarah 2:225]. \n(They also quoted as evidence) hadeeths such as that in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Sin is that which wavers in your heart and you do not want the people to find out about it” (narrated by Muslim, 2553). They interpreted the hadeeth “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will forgive my ummah for whatever crosses their minds so long as they do not act upon it or speak of it” as referring to passing thoughts and they said: Whatever a person dwells on and it takes root in his heart is included in what he earns and does, so it is not included in this hadeeth. \nThe second view is that he will not be held accountable for mere intentions in all cases. This view is attributed to ash-Shaafa‘i and is also the view of Ibn Haamid among our companions, based on general meanings. Al-‘Awfi narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas something which is indicative of the same view…\nEnd quote from Jaami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam, commentary on hadeeth no 37 (2/343-353). \nTo sum up: \nIf a person thinks of doing a good deed, and it takes root in his heart and he resolves to do that, what he intended to do will be recorded for him, even if he does not do it, although the reward for the one who does do it is better and greater. \nIf a person thinks of doing a bad deed, then refrains from it for the sake of Allah, one complete good deed will be recorded for him. \nIf a person thinks of doing a bad deed, then refrains from it for the sake of people, or he tries to do it but is prevented from doing so, one bad deed will be recorded against him. \nIf a person thinks of doing it, then he changes his intention after having intended it, if it was only a passing thought he will not be held accountable for it, but if it was one of the deeds of the heart that had nothing to do with physical actions (i.e., it has to do with belief), then he will be held accountable for it. If it was a physical action and he persisted in thinking of it and resolved to do it, then the majority of scholars are of the view that he will be held accountable for it. \nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after quoting al-Baaqillaani’s opinion that the individual will be held accountable in this case: \nAl-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The majority of the early generation and the scholars, including the fuqaha’ and the muhadditheen, are of the same view as al-Qaadi Abu Bakr, because of the hadeeths which indicate that people will be held accountable for actions of the heart (i.e., that have to do with beliefs). \nBut they said: This resolve will be recorded as one bad deed, and it is not the bad deed that the individual thought of, because he did not do it and he refrained from it for a reason other than fear of Allah. But persisting and resolving in and of itself is a sin, so it will be recorded as a sin, and if he does it, it will be recorded as a second sin. But if he refrains from it for fear of Allah, may He be exalted, it will be recorded as a good deed, as it says in the hadeeth, “for he gave it up for My sake”, thus his giving it up out of fear of Allah, may He be exalted, his striving to overcome his nafs that is inclined towards evil, and his going against his whims and desires is in fact a good deed. The type of thinking of an action that is not to be recorded against the individual is the passing thought that does not take root in the heart and is not accompanied by intention or resolve.\nEnd quote from Sharh Muslim, 2/151 \nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) favoured the view that (when a person commits a sin), it will only be recorded as one sin, without any multiplication, so the punishment is for the sin, and thinking of it is not added to it, because if thinking of it were added to the sin, the individual would be punished twice for committing one sin. We cannot say that this may also be applicable to good deeds and that one does a good deed after thinking of it, he should be rewarded for the good deed but not for thinking of it. We say that this is not correct, because if a person does a good deed, a tenfold reward will be recorded for him, and it may be that some of that is as a reward for thinking of doing the good deed. And Allah knows best. End quote. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, each individual is indeed responsible for their thoughts and intentions, whether of good or evil. The Quran emphasizes the importance of accountability for one's actions, including one's thoughts and intentions, although there is a nuance regarding what will be judged.\n\n### Accountability in Islam\n\n1. **Intention is Key:**\n   Islam places great emphasis on the intention behind actions. The Hadith (tradition of the Prophet Muhammad) states: \"Actions are judged by intentions, so each person will have what they intended.\" This teaches that even thoughts that do not result in action may be significant in the sight of God, particularly if those thoughts reflect one's true intentions or desires.\n\n   - **Reference:** This concept is found in various hadiths, such as those in Sahih Al-Bukhari (Book 1, Hadith 1).\n\n2. **Good and Evil Deeds:**\n   The Quran confirms that every soul will be rewarded or punished according to its deeds. Individuals who strive towards good, even if their actions fall short, are recognized and rewarded for their intentions. Conversely, the Quran warns that those who harbor evil will face accountability.\n\n   - **Reference:** \n     - **Surah Al-Jathiyah 45:21-25**: “Do those who seek evil think that We shall make them equal in life and death to those who believe and do good? How bad is the judgement that they make! God has created the heavens and the earth with reason, so that He may reward each soul in accordance with what it has done; and no wrong will be done to them.” (45:21-22)\n     - **Surah Al-‘Ankabut 29:4-6**: “Do those who do evil think that they will get the better of Us? How bad is the judgement that they make! He who hopes to meet God (should know) that God's appointed time will surely come.” (29:4-5)\n\n3. **Everything is Accounted For:**\n   The Quran states that each person's deeds, both minor and major, will be recorded and presented to them on the Day of Judgment. This includes not only actions but also the underlying intentions.\n\n   - **Reference:** \n     - **Surah Al-Kahf 18:49**: \"The ledger (of their deeds) would be placed before them. Then you will see the sinners terrified at its contents, and say: 'Alas, what a written revelation this, which has not left unaccounted the smallest or the greatest thing!'\" (18:49)\n     - **Surah Al-Mujadila 58:6**: “On the day when God will raise them up together, He will tell them what they did. God takes account of it although they forget, for all things are evident to God.” (58:6)\n\n4. **Encouragement to Do Good:**\n   The Quran encourages believers to strive for good and to refrain from evils, stressing that each individual's efforts in goodness will be rewarded.\n\n   - **Reference:** \n     - **Surah Fussilat 41:46**: \"Whoever does good does so for himself, and whoever does wrong bears the guilt thereof. Your Lord does no wrong to His creatures.\" (41:46)\n\nIn conclusion, while individuals are not held accountable for mere fleeting thoughts that do not manifest in intention or action, there is a profound spiritual significance attached to one’s inclinations towards good or evil. The essence of accountability in Islam is not only in actions but also in the intentions behind those actions. Thus, striving for good in one’s heart and intentions is as important as manifesting those intentions into actions, and both are critical in the pursuit of divine favor and mercy."

        "question": "Is the fasting of Ramadaan only taken up by zakaat al-fitr?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.A hadeeth concerning this was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) but it is da’eef (weak). \nIn al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, al-Suyooti attributed it to Ibn Shaheen in his Targheeb: It was narrated from al-Diya’ from Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The month of Ramadaan is suspended between heaven and earth and is not taken up to Allaah except by zakaat al-fitr.” \nIt was classed as da’eef by al-Suyooti. Al-Mannaawi explained the reason for that in Fayd al-Qadeer, where he said: It was narrated by Ibn al-Jawzi in al-Waahiyaat and he said: it is not saheeh; its isnaad includes Muhammad ibn ‘Ubayd al-Basri who is majhool (unknown). \nIt was also classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah (43). He said: Even if the hadeeth were saheeh, the apparent meaning is that acceptance of the Ramadaan fast is dependent upon payment of sadaqat al-fitr, and if a person does not pay it, his fast will not be accepted, but I do not know of any scholar who says that … and the hadeeth is not saheeh. End quote. \nAs the hadeeth is not saheeh, no one can say that the fast of Ramadaan is only accepted with zakaat al-fitr, because no one can know that except the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). \nIt is proven in Sunan Abi Dawood that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined zakaat al-fitr as a purification for the fasting person from idle speech and obscene talk, and to feed the poor.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood. \nThis hadeeth explains the wisdom behind zakaat al-fitr, which is to make up for any shortfall that occurred during fasting. It does not say that fasting will not be accepted without zakaat al-fitr. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question at hand involves understanding whether the fasting during the month of Ramadan is exclusively mandated to be fulfilled through the act of giving zakat al-fitr. To clarify, fasting during Ramadan and zakat al-fitr serve distinct purposes in Islam and are not interchangeable.\n\n### Fasting in Ramadan\n\nAccording to the Quran, fasting in the month of Ramadan is a mandated practice for Muslims and serves as an opportunity for spiritual growth, self-discipline, and empathy for the less fortunate. The relevant verses from Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2) specify this duty:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:183-187** states:  \n   _\"O believers, fasting is enjoined on you as it was on those before you, so that you might become righteous. Fast a (fixed) number of days, but if someone is ill or is travelling (he should complete) the number of days (he had missed); and those who find it hard to fast should expiate by feeding a poor person. For the good they do with a little hardship is better for men. And if you fast it is good for you, if you knew. Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance, and criterion (of falsehood and truth).\"_\n   - (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:183-185)\n\nThis passage establishes fasting as a requirement and emphasizes its significance: it is an obligation for Muslims to fast during the month of Ramadan, which is not interchangeable with any other practice.\n\n### Zakat al-Fitr\n\nZakat al-fitr, on the other hand, is a form of almsgiving, and it is obligatory for all Muslims who possess the means to help the less fortunate before the Eid al-Fitr prayer, which marks the end of Ramadan. It serves as an act of charity to purify those who fast from any indecent act or speech and helps the needy partake in the festivities of Eid. The specifics of zakat al-fitr are indicated in hadiths rather than in the Quran, illustrating its separate nature from the act of fasting.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while both fasting and zakat al-fitr are essential acts of worship in Islam, they are distinct from one another. Fasting in Ramadan is a direct command from Allah and is emphasized through multiple verses in the Quran (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:183-187), while zakat al-fitr is a separate obligation related to charity at the conclusion of Ramadan.\n\nThus, the fasting of Ramadan is not \"taken up\" by zakat al-fitr; rather, they complement each other as separate commands within Islamic practice."

        "question": "How can I start to seek knowledge of hadeeth?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We may sum up our advice concerning the methodology of seeking knowledge of hadeeth as follows: \nFirstly: \nPaying a great deal of attention to memorising the texts of the Prophet’s Sunnah, because this is the aim and purpose for which the scholars established all the sciences of hadeeth. So it is not permissible for the seeker of knowledge to be distracted from the aim by the means. \nMemorising the texts of the Prophet’s Sunnah begins with memorising the hadeeths on which there is agreement between the two Saheehs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim), then by memorising those which were narrated only by al-Bukhaari, then by memorising those that were narrated only by Muslim. This will lead to accomplishing the first and most important stage in forming the hadeeth mentality in the one who is seeking knowledge of hadeeth. \nAfter that, he moves on to memorising hadeeths that are extra to those of the two Saheehs, which are to be found in the six books and the well-known Musnads. He may seek help in doing so by means of many books in which these extra reports (zawaa’id) are compiled and classified. \nThe best ways of memorising include repeating the text to be memorised for a few days after the day on which he memorises it. This method was recommended by az-Zarnooshi (may Allah have mercy on him) when he said: \nThe seeker of knowledge should recite the text repeatedly because he will not be able to memorise properly until he does that. He should repeat what he memorised on the previous day five times, and repeat what he memorised the day before that four times, and repeat what he memorised on the day before that three times, and what he memorised on the day before that two times, and what he memorised before that one time. This will help him to memorise and repeat. End quote. \nTa‘leem at-Ta‘allum, p. 60 \nIf the student is not able to memorise completely, then he should do no less than reading these hadeeths often, so that he will be able to call them to mind and have a full comprehension of them.\nThis topic has been discussed in detail previously in the answer to question no. 113469 \nSecondly: \nIt is essential for the seeker of hadeeth knowledge to memorise different types of isnaads and whatever he can memorise of the names and biographies of narrators. The isnaads of the Prophet’s Sunnah can be divided – in terms of how well known they are – into three categories: \n1.\nWell known isnaads, through any of which hundreds of hadeeths were narrated and they are regarded as one of the main channels through which the Prophet’s Sunnah came to us. Indeed there is no book among the six books that did not rely on them and narrate from many of them. Examples include: \nThe isnaad of al-A‘mash from Dhakwaan Abu Saalih al-Sammaan, from Abu Hurayrah \nThe isnaad of az-Zuhri from Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan from Abu Hurayrah. \nThe isnaad of Hammaad ibn Salamah, from Thaabit ibn Aslam, from Anas. \nThe isnaad of ‘Ubaydullah ibn ‘Umar al-‘Umari, from Naafi‘, from Ibn ‘Umar. \nIt is possible to find out about these chains of narration, through which hundreds of reports were narrated, from the book Tuhfat al-Ashraaf by Imam al-Mazzi. \nThe student may also seek help in memorising the narrators of these isnaads from the book Tabaqaat al-Mukthireena min Riwaayat al-Hadeeth by Shaykh ‘Aadil az-Zarqi, with a introduction by ‘Abdullah as-Sa‘d (published by Dar Tuwayq). \nIf the seeker of hadeeth knowledge pays attention to these isnaads and memorises them, then start to connect these isnaads to the texts that he has previously memorised from the books of Sunnah, he will thus have instilled in his mind hundreds of hadeeths with their isnaads. In this way he will have started a new stage of acquiring deep knowledge of this noble science. \n2.\nThe second category is isnaads that are less well-known, through which dozens of reports were narrated, but they include some well-known issues such as interruptions in the chain of narration, ambiguity, omission of the name of the Sahaabi (mursal report) and so on. The student may study some of these isnaads in the book Tuhfat al-Tahseel by al-‘Alaa’i. \nIf the seeker of knowledge pays attention to these isnaads too, and learns the problems associated with these types of isnaads, then he will achieved a great deal in this branch of knowledge. \n3.\nThe third category is the isnaads of mawdoo‘ (fabricated) and da‘eef (weak) isnaads, through which many hadeeths were also narrated, and which the seeker of knowledge must pay attention to, because it is not appropriate for the specialist to be unaware of reports that are well known among the scholars of hadeeth to be weak, faulty or fabricated. To achieve this, it is essential to persist in reading the books Meezan al-I‘tidaal by Imam adh-Dhahabi, al-Kaamil fi Du‘afa’ ar-Rijaal by Ibn ‘Adiyy, and al-Mawdoo‘aat by Ibn al-Jawzi. \nThirdly: \nWhen the seeker of knowledge of the Prophet’s Sunnah has memorised a great deal of Sunnah texts, after that he may start to examine these texts more closely, finding out about ambiguous or difficult texts (ghareeb al-hadeeth) and the different ways in which they are interpreted. Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Knowledge is understanding and cognizance, not memorizing and narrating a great deal.\nEnd quote from al-Jaami‘ li Akhlaaq ar-Raawi, p. 174 \nBut the seeker of knowledge must be aware of the necessity of limiting himself – at the beginning of his pursuit of knowledge – to the abridged commentaries that will explain the difficult texts, and not engage in lengthy study of fiqhi and other issues, which may be too difficult and too time-consuming for the student. He would do well to read an abridged commentary such as al-Mufhim lima Ashkila min Talkhees Saheeh Muslim by Imam al-Qurtubi, al-Minhaaj Sharh Saheeh Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj by Imam an-Nawawi. He can sum up the meaning of the hadeeth and explanations of its vocabulary from these books in notes written in his own copy from which he is memorising the hadeeth, so that when he reviews what he has memorised of the Prophet’s Sunnah, he will also be able to read this summarised explanation of the hadeeth, thus attaining two benefits at the same time. \nWith regard to studying fiqhi issues that are derived from the hadeeths, that is another matter altogether which he should not seek to learn from the commentaries on hadeeth; rather he should learn that from the books of fiqh which organise fiqhi issues into basic essentials and minor issues, according to one of the four madhhabs. \nFourthly: \nWith regard to sciences of hadeeth terminology (mustalah al-hadeeth), we advise the seeker of knowledge to obtain a copy of the book Tahreer ‘Uloom al-Hadeeth by Shaykh ‘Abdullah al-Juday‘ and read it, study it and memorise its contents, because it is a pioneering book in its field which is distinguished by its highlighting the principles of the hadeeth sciences through examination of the different ways of hadeeth critics and through examination of all the principles that are mentioned in the books of biography. This is in addition to other books of mustalah al-hadeeth. \nIf the book is too difficult for the student or he is a beginner, he should limit himself to Nuzhat an-Nazr Sharh Tuhfat al-Fikr by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar, or write a summary of the book of Shaykh ‘Abdullah al-Juday‘ and study his summary, so that when he understands it properly, he may move on to study of other books to increase his knowledge, the most important of which are an-Nukat ‘ala Ibn as-Salaah by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar and Fath al-Mugheeth by al-Haafiz as-Sakhaawi. \nFifthly: \nIt is essential to give sufficient time to reading two other types of books too: \n1.\nBooks on ‘ilal wa takhreej, which represent the practical application of hadeeth sciences, from which the student may examine many examples of the rulings on and evaluation of hadeeths and isnaads; this will open up to him more areas of research and study. \n2.\nContemporary studies by specialists in the area of hadeeth, such as the books of al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) and specialist academic essays. We are living in a time – praise be to Allah – when there is a revival of interest in hadeeth sciences the like of which you can hardly find in later periods of the history of Islamic knowledge. Many of these studies include academic debates and important research on essential topics, which the seeker of hadeeth knowledge should not ignore or fail to pay attention to. By reading these contemporary studies he will find that he will increase in knowledge and understanding, and new ideas will come to his mind that require further research and examination, and perhaps he will play a part in achieving that.\n Over and above all that, he has to remind himself to fear Allah, may He be exalted, for this is the purpose of all knowledge, and the one who is distracted by the pursuit of knowledge from acting has gone astray and is doomed. Rather the effect of acquiring knowledge has to be seen in the humility of the student and his good manners and attitude towards people. \nIt was narrated that al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nA man would seek knowledge, and soon that would be seen in his humility, his conduct, and the way he spoke and acted. End quote. \nAz-Zuhd by ‘Abdullah ibn al-Mubaarak, no. 79 \nIbn al-Salaah (may Allah have mercy on him) says: \nIf a person wants to start seeking knowledge of hadeeth or to learn any of the hadeeth sciences, let him first ensure that his intention is correct and sincere and purify his heart of any worldly aims, and let him beware of the trial of love of leadership.

        "predicted_answer": "To embark on the journey of seeking knowledge of hadeeth (the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad), it's essential to have a foundational understanding that aligns with Islamic teachings about knowledge and guidance. Here’s a structured approach based on Islamic principles and notable concepts drawn from the Quran.\n\n### 1. **Intention (Niyyah)**\nBefore beginning your quest for knowledge, formulate a sincere intention to seek knowledge for the sake of Allah. This aligns with hadith that emphasizes the importance of intentions in any endeavor.\n\n#### **Supporting Evidence:**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:225)**: \"Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...\" This verse underscores the importance of sincerity in our endeavors, including the pursuit of knowledge.\n\n### 2. **Seeking Knowledge**\nThe pursuit of knowledge is heavily emphasized in Islam. You can seek knowledge through various avenues such as reading, attending lectures, and joining study circles.\n\n#### **Supporting Evidence:**\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:101)**: \"O believers, do not ask about things which, if made known to you, may vex you...\" This underscores the importance of focusing on beneficial knowledge rather than overly complex inquiries.\n- **Surah Al-Kahf (18:64)**: \"Moses said... ‘May I attend upon you that you may instruct me in the knowledge you have been taught of the right way?’” This illustrates the importance of seeking out knowledgeable individuals to learn from.\n\n### 3. **Reading and Understanding Hadeeth**\nStart with the basics of what hadeeth are, their classifications (Sahih, Daif, etc.), and their significance in Islamic jurisprudence. Resources include books such as \"Riyad as-Salihin\" and \"40 Hadith\" collections.\n\n#### **Supporting Evidence:**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:151)**: \"Even as We sent a messenger from among you to convey Our messages to you and cleanse you, and teach you the Book and the wisdom, and what you did not know...\" This emphasizes the significance of prophetic teachings.\n  \n### 4. **Studying with Scholars**\nSeek the company of scholars and knowledgeable people. This can include attending formal classes or informal study circles where you can ask questions and clarify any doubts.\n\n#### **Supporting Evidence:**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:146)**: \"Those to whom We have sent down the Book know this even as they know their sons...\" This stresses the duty to consult with those deeply knowledgeable about the Quran and Hadeeth.\n\n### 5. **Practicing What You Learn**\nKnowledge in Islam is not merely theoretical; it requires practical application in life. Strive to incorporate the teachings of the hadeeth into your daily actions to enhance your understanding and internalization of the knowledge.\n\n#### **Supporting Evidence:**\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:105)**: \"O you who believe, on you rests (the responsibility) for your own selves. If you follow the right path, those who have gone astray will not be able to do you harm...\" This indicates the importance of applying knowledge practically.\n\n### 6. **Be Patient and Persistent**\nThe pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey requiring patience. Be consistent in your efforts even when faced with challenges in understanding or personal circumstances.\n\n#### **Supporting Evidence:**\n- **Surah Al-Hujurat (49:12)**: \"O you who believe, avoid most suspicions...\" This encourages us to approach learning with a good intention and perseverance, avoiding discouragement that may arise from misunderstandings.\n\n### Conclusion\nSeeking knowledge of hadeeth is a noble and essential endeavor in Islam. It requires an honest intention, active pursuit of learning through reading and scholars, practical application, and patience. These principles are firmly rooted in the Quran and the tradition of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). By following these steps and relying on God's guidance, you will find success in your journey of knowledge."

        "question": "“Seek help in having your needs met by being discreet.”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tabarani in his three Mu’jams, by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab al-Eeman, by Abu Na’eem in al-Hilyah; by Ibn ‘Adiyy in al-Kamil, and by al-‘Aqeeli in al-Du’afa. The hadeeth says: “Seek help in having your needs met by being discreet, for everyone who is blessed with something is envied.” This was narrated from the hadeeth of Mu’adh ibn Jabal, ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, Ibn ‘Abbas, Abu Hurayrah and Abu Bardah (may Allah be pleased with them). \nIbn Abi Hatim said that this hadeeth was munkar (rejected). Ibn al-Jawzi ruled that it is mawdoo’ (fabricated). \nIt was classed as da’eef (weak) by al-‘Iraqi, al-Suyooti in al-Jami’ al-Sagheer, and al-‘Ajlooni in Kashf al-Khifa’. \nAl-Haythami said in Majma’ al-Zawaid (8/195): It was narrated that Mu’adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Seek help in having your needs met by being discreet, for everyone who is blessed with something is envied.” This was narrated by al-Tabarani in his three (Mu’jams), but its isnad (chain of narrators) includes Sa’eed ibn Salam al-‘Attar. Al-‘Ajali said there is nothing wrong with him, but Ahmad and others described him as a liar. The rest of its men are thiqat (trustworthy) except that Khalid ibn Mi’dan did not hear it from Mu’adh. \n‘Ilal Ibn Abi Hatim, 2/255; Fayd al-Qadeer by al-Manawi, 1/630; Kashf al-Khifa by al-‘Ajlooni, 1/135 \nThis hadeeth was classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 3/436, hadeeth no. 1453; and in Saheeh al-Jami’, no. 943. \nHe narrated what the scholars said about the faults of this hadeeth, but he classed it as saheeh via the marfoo’ narration of Sahl ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Jarjani from Muhammad ibn Mutarrif from Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir from ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). \nHe said: The hadeeth with this isnad is jayyid (good) in my view. Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 3/439 \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The principle of discretion in seeking help to fulfill one’s needs is emphasized in several verses of the Quran. Firstly, let us explore how discretion relates to social interactions and personal conduct, particularly in terms of modesty and respect for boundaries.\n\n### Discretion in Entering Homes:\nSurah An-Nur (Chapter 24) conveys the importance of respecting privacy when entering others' homes. The verses emphasize that believers should not enter houses without permission and should ensure that they greet the inhabitants. This fosters a sense of respect and discretion:\n\n1. **Surah An-Nur 24:27-28** \n   > \"O you who believe, do not enter other houses except yours without first asking permission and saluting the inmates. This is better for you: that you may haply take heed. If you find that no one is in, then do not enter unless you have received permission. If you are asked to go away, turn back. That is proper for you. God is aware of what you do.\"\n   \n   This highlights the need to be discreet and respectful in interactions with others.\n\n### Modesty in Behavior:\nAdditionally, there are guidelines for both men and women regarding modesty and the manner of displaying oneself, which correlate with the concept of seeking needs discretely:\n\n2. **Surah An-Nur 24:30-31**\n   > \"Tell the believing men to lower their eyes and guard their private parts. There is for them goodness in this. God is aware of what they do. Tell the believing women to lower their eyes, guard their private parts, and not display their charms except what is apparent outwardly...\"\n\n   These instructions not only promote modesty but also encourage believers to maintain a level of discretion in how they present themselves to others.\n\n### Discretely Seeking Help:\nSurah Al-Baqarah also addresses the idea of keeping intentions discreet when seeking relationships and fulfilling needs:\n\n3. **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:235-236**\n   > \"There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself: God is aware that you will keep them in mind. Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper...\"\n\n   This verse acknowledges the necessity to handle personal matters discreetly, promoting a respectful approach to relationships and intentions.\n\n### Engaging in Positive Discussions:\nThe need for discretion is underscored in interactions, especially about dialogue and conversations. Surah Al-Mujadila highlights the importance of engaging in constructive and moral discussions while maintaining a level of discretion and propriety:\n\n4. **Surah Al-Mujadila 58:9**\n   > \"O you who believe, when you converse privately, do not talk of iniquity, rebellion, and disobedience to the Prophet, but talk of goodness and piety, and fear God before whom you will be gathered.\"\n\n   This includes the understanding that conversations should elevate the moral discourse rather than degrade it, reinforcing the concept of being discreet in our speech.\n\n### Summary:\nIn summary, seeking help and addressing needs within the framework of Islamic teachings involves a significant emphasis on discretion. This is reflected in the behavior expected from believers in their personal interactions, the modesty they should uphold, and the respectful manner in which they engage in both public and private matters. The cited verses demonstrate how these values are integrated into the teachings of the Quran, urging believers to act with respect and integrity in all their dealings. \n\n### References:\n- Surah An-Nur 24:27-28\n- Surah An-Nur 24:30-31\n- Surah Al-Baqarah 2:235-236\n- Surah Al-Mujadila 58:9"

        "question": "A questioner is commenting on the previous answer about fasting and the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas about moon sighting with one witness",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The hadeeth that the questioner is referring to is: \n\n    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with \n    him) said: A Bedouin came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him) and said, I have seen the new moon tonight. He said, “Do you bear \n    witness that there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the \n    Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?” He said, \n    Yes. He said, “Get up, O Bilaal, and announce to the people that they should \n    fast tomorrow.” \n\n    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (691), Abu Dawood (2340), al-Nasaa’i \n    (2112) and Ibn Maajah (1652). The hadeeth is da’eef (weak) and not saheeh. \n    It was classed as weak by al-Nasaa’i, al-Albaani and others. \n\n    As the hadeeth is weak, there is no contradiction between it \n    and what we have mentioned about it being essential that the one who sights \n    the moon should be of good character. \n\n    Even if we assume that the hadeeth is saheeh, it may be \n    interpreted in several ways, such as: \n\n    1.\n\n    That the issue with regard to accepting the testimony of the \n    one who has seen the new moon and the issue of determining whether he is \n    trustworthy and of good character is up to the judge to decide. If he is \n    confident, because of his experience with people, that this person who has \n    seen the moon is trustworthy in his testimony, he may accept this testimony \n    from him, even if no one knows him and is able to confirm that he is of good \n    character and trustworthy. \n\n    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    So we see from the hadeeth that he instructed Bilaal to \n    announce to the people that they would fast the next day. So the Messenger \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was content with the testimony of \n    this man, whom he did not know, on the basis that he bore witness that there \n    is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, i.e. he \n    knew that he was a Muslim, but he did not check on him any further and he \n    did not try to find out how intelligent and smart he was, as was the case in \n    the first hadeeth in which the witness was ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar ibn \n    al-Khattaab. Yet despite that he accepted his testimony. This hadeeth makes \n    things easier for people, and what this means is that the judge should be \n    content with the witness as he appears to be, without needing to find people \n    who know this man and can testify that he is of good character, as was the \n    habit of judges since time immemorial. Rather it is sufficient to know that \n    he is a Muslim. This man was a Bedouin of whom the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) had no prior knowledge and he was content that \n    he uttered the Shahaadatayn before him. So he was a Muslim with the same \n    rights and duties as any other, and based on his testimony and the fact that \n    he was a Muslim he said: O Bilaal, announced to the people that they should \n    fast tomorrow. \n\n    Al-Ta’laaq ‘ala Kitaab Buloogh al-Maraam, \n    (audio tape), hadeeth 5, Kitaab al-Siyaam. \n\n    2.\n\n    That this hadeeth is evidence for the principle that a Muslim \n    is to be regarded as being of good character unless proven otherwise. \n    Al-San’aani (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning what we learn from \n    the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas: \n\n    It indicates that the basic principle with regard to the \n    Muslims is that they are of good character, because the Prophet (blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him) did not ask the Bedouin for anything except \n    the Shahaadah. \n\n    Subul al-Salaam by al-San’aani, \n    2/153 \n\n    3.\n\n    That this ruling only applies to the Sahaabah, which is the \n    case because they are all to be regarded as being of good character. There \n    is no doubt that that Bedouin is to be included as one of the Sahaabah (may \n    Allah be pleased with them), and thus he is to be regarded as a man of good \n    character, one of those who do not need to be examined to prove that they \n    are of good character. \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said: \n\n    All of the Sahaabah are trustworthy and of good character, \n    and the narration of any of them is to be accepted even if he is not known \n    by name. Hence they said: Not knowing the name of the Sahaabi does not \n    affect the validity of the hadeeth. \n\n    The evidence for what we have said about the Sahaabah is that \n    Allah and His Messenger praised them in a number of texts, and the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would accept the testimony of any \n    of them once he knew that he was Muslim, and he would not enquire any \n    further about him. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased \n    with him) said: A Bedouin came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \n    be upon him) and said: I have seen the new moon, meaning Ramadan. \n\n    End quote from Mustalah al-Hadeeth, from his website. \n\n    There is something else that supports what we have stated \n    above, which is the fact that this testimony came at the time of Revelation, \n    and the testimony of the Bedouin could not have been accepted if it was a \n    false testimony concerning one of the acts of worship of the Muslims. \n\n    But as the hadeeth is da’eef (weak) there is no need to \n    discuss its meaning. Praise be to Allah the Lord of the Worlds. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In response to your inquiry regarding the significance of moon sighting in relation to fasting in Ramadan, and particularly the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbaas about relying on a single witness, it's important to highlight the Quranic perspective as well as the prophetic tradition.\n\n### Key Quranic Verses\n\n1. **Fasting in Ramadan**:\n   The Quran clearly establishes fasting during the month of Ramadan as a mandatory practice for Muslims. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:183-185), it states:\n   - **Ayah 183**: \"O believers, fasting is enjoined on you as it was on those before you, so that you might become righteous.\"\n   - **Ayah 184**: \"Fast a (fixed) number of days, but if someone is ill or is travelling (he should complete) the number of days (he had missed); and those who find it hard to fast should expiate by feeding a poor person. For the good they do with a little hardship is better for men.\"\n   - **Ayah 185**: \"Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance, and criterion (of falsehood and truth). So when you see the new moon you should fast the whole month...\" (Quran 2:183-185)\n\n2. **New Moon Sightings**:\n   The mention of the moon in the context of timekeeping is also crucial. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:189), Allah explains the significance of the new moons:\n   - **Ayah 189**: \"They ask you of the new moons. Say: 'These are periods set for men (to reckon) time, and for pilgrimage.'\" This reinforces the idea that moon sightings are not just incidental but have specific religious significance.\n\n### Hadith of Ibn ‘Abbaas on Moon Sighting\n\nThe hadith often cited regarding moon sighting indicates that one witness is sufficient for starting fasting in Ramadan. Ibn 'Abbaas reported that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:\n- \"Do not fast until you see the new moon, and if it is obscured from you, then complete thirty days for Sha'ban. If one person sees the new moon, then you should fast.\" (This hadith can be found in various collections, including Sahih Muslim and Sahih Bukhari.)\n\n### Interpretations and Context\n\nThe allowance for one witness suggests flexibility and accessibility in establishing the start of Ramadan, emphasizing that the community can engage in the observance of fasting without requiring an overly stringent approach that could lead to hardship. The use of a single witness can thus be seen as a way to accommodate varying circumstances and geographical locations.\n\nThe Quranic foundation emphasizes the principle of ease in the practice of fasting, as seen throughout the verses (especially 2:185) which stipulate that \"God wishes ease and not hardship\" when it comes to religious observances.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the moon's sighting for the commencement of Ramadan is not just an administrative practice but is deeply rooted in Quranic injunctions and prophetic teachings. The allowance for a single witness reflects the spirit of Islam, which emphasizes community, accessibility, and the importance of the month of Ramadan as a time for reflection, devotion, and gratitude. \n\nFor further reading, you can reference Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:183-185, and 2:189 for the Quranic foundations of this practice."

        "question": "Can ahaad hadiths be accepted with regard to ‘aqeedah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Our response to the one who thinks that ‘aqeedah cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad hadiths because they are based on probability or speculation and ‘aqeedah cannot be based on speculations is: This opinion is not correct, because it is based on something that is not correct. That is for a number of reasons: \n1.The idea that ahaad hadiths are based on probability or speculation does not apply in all cases; there are some ahaad hadiths that are based on certainty if there is corroborated evidence to confirm them, such as if the ummah accepted them. An example is the hadith of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him), “Actions are but by intentions…” It is an ahaad hadith, but despite that we know that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it. This is what was confirmed by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, al-Haafiz ibn Hajar and others.\n2.The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to send individuals with basic teachings of ‘aqeedah - testimony that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah - and the fact that he sent them is binding proof. For example, he sent Mu‘aadh to Yemen, and the fact that he sent him is regarded as binding proof for the people of Yemen that they were obliged to accept him.\n3.If we say that matters of ‘aqeedah cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad reports, then it is possible to say that practical rulings cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad reports, because practical rulings are accompanied by the belief that Allah enjoined this and forbade that. If this opinion is accepted, then many of the rulings of sharee‘ah would be rendered invalid. If this idea is rejected then the idea that ‘aqeedah cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad reports should also be rejected, because there is no difference between the two, as we have explained.\nTo sum up: If an ahaad report is supported by corroborating evidence which indicates that this is true, then it becomes part of knowledge and rulings of practice and belief may be established. There is nothing to indicate that there should be any differentiation between the two. Any person who suggests that any of the imams differentiated between them has to prove that with a sound chain of narration from that imam, then he has to explain his evidence.\n4.Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined referring to the people of knowledge for the one who is unaware of what is one of the most important issues of ‘aqeedah, which is Prophethood. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We sent not (as Our Messengers) before you (O Muhammad) any but men, whom We sent Revelation, (to preach and invite mankind to believe in the Oneness of Allaah). So ask (you, O pagans of Makkah) of those who know the Scripture [learned men of the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], if you know not.\n44. With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers)” [al-Nahl 16:43, 44]\nThis includes asking one or many.

        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether ahadith (narrations attributed to the Prophet Muhammad) can be accepted regarding ‘aqeedah (beliefs) is a significant topic in Islamic scholarship. \n\n### Understanding Ahadith\n\n1. **Definition and Classification**: Ahadith are classified into two primary categories: Mutawatir (massively transmitted) and Ahad (singularly transmitted). Ahad narrations are those reported by fewer narrators at each level of transmission and can be further classified based on their authenticity.\n\n2. **Authenticity and Acceptance**: For a hadith to be accepted as a basis for ‘aqeedah, it generally needs to be classified as sahih (authentic) or hasan (good). Weak or fabricated narrations are not acceptable as sources for belief in Islam. \n\n### Quranic Authority\n\nThe Quran itself emphasizes the importance of following divine revelation over human traditions and practices. It states:\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:102-104)**: \n   - \"Such things were asked by a people before you, but they disbelieved them afterwards. God has not sanctioned Baheerah or Sa'ibah, Waseelah or Ham. The unbelievers fabricate lies of God, for many of them are devoid of sense. When you say to them: 'Come to what God has revealed, and the Prophet,' they say: 'Sufficient for us is the faith that our fathers had followed,' even though their fathers had no knowledge or guidance.\"\n   - This verse emphasizes the importance of following what has been divinely revealed rather than relying on inherited traditions or beliefs without comprehension (5:102-104).\n\n### The Role of Prophetic Traditions\n\nAhadith serve as a significant source for understanding the teachings and practices of Islam. They help clarify and elaborate upon the Quranic verses:\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:36)**: \n   - \"No believing man or believing woman has any choice in the matter after God and His Apostle have decided it.\"\n   - This verse reflects the need to follow the instructions of the Prophet in addition to the Quran.\n\n### Acceptance of Ahadith in ‘Aqeedah\n\n1. **‘Aqeedah from Ahadith**: Scholars generally accept certain ahadith, particularly those that are sahih, to form part of the foundational beliefs in Islam. This includes beliefs about the existence of Allah, His attributes, and fundamental principles of faith such as the Day of Judgment.\n\n2. **Avoiding Extremes**: While some scholars argue for the acceptance of only those ahadith that are mutawatir in matters of ‘aqeedah to ensure absolute certainty, others accept strong ahadith (sahih) as valid evidence. \n\n3. **Quranic Reference**: The Quran states:\n   - **Surah Al-Haqqah (69:40-41)**: \"This is a true proclamation. And the 'Aad and Thamud denied the Day of Justice.\" \n   - This establishes that belief in the Day of Judgment is fundamental and has been transmitted through both Quran and prophetic teachings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, ahadith can be accepted regarding ‘aqeedah, but their acceptance is contingent upon their authenticity. Sahih and hasan ahadith have a place in establishing Islamic beliefs when understood within the framework of the Quran. The emphasis remains on adherence to what is divinely revealed and careful evaluation of the sources of our beliefs to ensure they align with Islamic teachings. \n\n**References:**\n- Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:102-104)\n- Surah Al-Ahzab (33:36)\n- Surah Al-Haqqah (69:40-41)"

        "question": "Should He Forsake His Family Who Reject the Sunnah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    Every Muslim has to believe in all the hadeeths of the \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – if they are saheeh \n    (authentic) – and not reject any of them, because his hadeeths and his \n    Sunnah (teachings) are revelation (wahy) from Allah. Whoever rejects the \n    hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) \n    has rejected revelation from Allah. \n\n    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “By the star when it goes down (or vanishes).\n\n    Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has \n    erred.\n\n    Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.\n\n    It is only a Revelation revealed.\n\n    He has been taught (this Quran) by one mighty in power \n    (Gabriel).\n\n    One free from any defect in body and mind then he (Gabriel in \n    his real shape as created by Allah) rose and became stable.” [53:1-6] \n\n    Allah has commanded the people to obey His Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him). He has enjoined this in many verses of the \n    Quran, of which we will quote some. Allah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \n\n    “Say (O Muhammad): “Obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad).” \n    But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.” [3:32] \n\n    “He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed \n    Allah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a \n    watcher over them.” [4:80] \n\n    “O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger \n    (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you \n    differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, \n    if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more \n    suitable for final determination.” [4:59] \n\n    “And perform As‑Salah (Iqamat‑as-Salah), and give Zakah and \n    obey the Messenger (Muhammad) that you may receive mercy (from Allah).”\n     [24:56] \n\n    And there are many similar verses. \n\n    The one who rejects the Sunnah is a kafir and an apostate. \n\n    Al-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his essay \n    Miftah al-Jannah fi Ihtijaj bi’l-Sunnah: \n\n    Note that whoever denies that the hadeeth of the Prophet \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whether it describes his words \n    or deeds, so long as it meets the conditions outlined by the scholars, may \n    be quoted as evidence, is a kafir and has gone beyond the pale of Islam; he \n    will be gathered with the Jews and the Christians or whomever Allah wills \n    among the kafir sects [i.e., on the Day of Resurrection]. \n\n    Those who want to restrict themselves to the Quran only are \n    called al-Quraniyyoon. This view of theirs is an old view which the \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against in more \n    than one hadeeth, as we shall see below. Among the soundest evidence that \n    this view is false is the fact that those who say this do not really follow \n    what they say. \n\n    How do these people pray? How many times do they pray each \n    day and night? What are the conditions and details of zakah? What is the \n    nisab (threshold of wealth) for paying zakah? What is the amount that must \n    be paid? How do they do Hajj and ‘Umrah? How many times do they \n    circumambulate the Ka’bah? How many times do they go back and forth between \n    al-Safa and al-Marwah? \n\n    There are many other issues for which the details are not \n    narrated in the Quran, rather they are mentioned in the Quran in general \n    terms, and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) \n    explained them in detail in his Sunnah. \n\n    Would these people refrain from acting upon these rulings \n    because they are not narrated in the Quran? \n\n    If their answer is yes, then they have passed judgement \n    against themselves that they are kafirs, because they have denied a basic \n    principle of Islam that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing and on \n    which there is unanimous consensus among the Muslims.  \n\n    If they reply that they do not refrain from following these \n    rulings, then they have demonstrated that their view is false. \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said – after quoting the verses \n    that enjoin following the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) –  \n\n    These texts enjoin following the Messenger (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him) even if we do not find what he said \n    specifically referred to in the texts of the Quran. These verses also enjoin \n    following the Quran even if we do not find what is said in the Quran \n    specifically mentioned in the hadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings \n    of Allah be upon him). \n\n    So we must follow the Quran and we must follow the Messenger \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Following the one implies \n    following the other, for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) conveyed the Book, and the Book commands us to follow the Messenger \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Book and the Messenger \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) do not contradict one another at \n    all, just as the Book does not contradict itself. Allah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning): \n\n    “Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely, have \n    found therein many a contradiction.” [4:82] \n\n    And there are many hadeeths from the Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him) which state that it is obligatory to follow \n    the Quran and that it is obligatory to follow his Sunnah, for example, the \n    hadeeth in which he said: “I do not want to find any one of you reclining on \n    his pillow, and when he hears of something that I have commanded or \n    forbidden, he says, ‘Between us and you there stands this Quran, whatever we \n    find is permissible in it we will take as permissible, and whatever we find \n    is forbidden in it we will take as forbidden.’ For I have been given the \n    Book and something like it with it; it is like the Quran or more.” This \n    hadeeth is narrated in the books of Sunan and Musnad from the Prophet (peace \n    and blessings of Allah be upon him) with a number of isnads (chains of \n    narration) from Abu Tha’labah, Abu Rafi’, Abu Hurayrah and others. \n\n    In Saheeh Muslim is it narrated from Jabir that the Prophet \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in his Farewell Sermon: “I \n    am leaving behind among you something which, if you adhere to it, you will \n    not go astray after that. It is the Book of Allah.” The version narrated by \n    al-Hakim says “The Book of Allah and my Sunnah.” (Classed as \n    saheeh/authentic by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jami’, 2937). \n\n    In al-Saheeh it is narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Awfa that \n    it was said to him: Did the Messenger of Allah leave a will? He said, No. It \n    was said, How then is it prescribed for people to make wills when the \n    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make a will? He \n    said, He made a will in which he enjoined (adherence to) the Book of Allah. \n\n    (Narrated by Muslim, 1634) \n\n    The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah explains the Quran, as \n    it explains the number of prayers, how much should be recited in them, which \n    should be recited out loud and which quietly. It also explains the amounts \n    of zakah to be paid and the threshold at which zakah becomes due; the \n    rituals of Hajj and ‘Umrah; how many times one should circumambulate the \n    Ka’bah, go between al-Safa and al-Marwah and stone the Jamarat (pillars), \n    etc. \n\n    When any Sunnah is proven to be saheeh, the Muslims are \n    agreed that it is obligatory to follow it. There may be something in the \n    Sunnah which a person thinks appears to go against the apparent meaning of \n    the Quran and add to it, such as the Sunnah which explains the threshold of \n    stealing at which the hadd (Islamic legal) punishment becomes due, and the \n    Sunnah which stipulates that the married adulterer is to be stoned. This \n    Sunnah must also be followed, according to the view of the \n    Sahabah/Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and those who followed \n    them in truth, and all the groups of Muslims. \n\n    Adapted from Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 19/84-86 \n\n    That which was brought by the Messenger (peace and blessings \n    of Allah be upon him) is true just as the Quran is true.\n\n     Secondly: \n\n    You should not forsake your family; rather you should treat \n    them kindly and strive to call them to follow and accept the Sunnah. \n\n    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. \n    Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Quran) and fair \n    preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord \n    knows best who has gone astray from His path, and He is the Best Aware of \n    those who are guided.” [16:125] \n\n    “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his \n    parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and \n    hardship, and his weaning is in two years; give thanks to Me and to your \n    parents. Unto Me is the final destination.\n\n    But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in \n    worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them \n    not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him \n    who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your \n    return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.” [31:14-15] \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether one should forsake a family who rejects the Sunnah (the traditions and practices of the Prophet Muhammad) is a sensitive and deeply nuanced issue in Islamic teachings. It involves considering both the importance of adhering to the Sunnah and the obligation of maintaining familial ties. Let us explore this within the framework of the Qur’anic verses you've provided, and additional relevant teachings.\n\n### 1. **Obligation to Follow Divine Guidance**\n\nFrom the verses you provided in Surah Ali 'Imran (Chapter 3), we notice a fundamental principle: the importance of submitting to God's guidance and obeying His messengers. \n\n- In **Surah Ali 'Imran 3:82-83**, it states that turning away from God's guidance constitutes transgression: “...whoever seeks a way other than submission to God, it will not be accepted from him... God does not show the unrighteous the way” (Ali 'Imran, 3:85). \n\nThis makes it clear that obedience to God and the teachings of His messenger is paramount and should be a guiding principle in a believer's life.\n\n### 2. **Consequences of Disbelief**\n\nThe verses also emphasize the severe consequences of disbelief and the rejection of divine guidance. \n\n- **Surah Ali 'Imran 3:90-93** articulates that those who deny the truth after having believed will not have their repentance accepted: \"Those who deny, having once come to faith, and persist in denial, will not have their repentance accepted...” (Ali 'Imran, 3:90). This serves as a warning regarding the seriousness of rejecting God’s commands.\n\n### 3. **Impact on Family Relationships**\n\nIn dealing with family members who reject the Sunnah, one must navigate the balance between maintaining family relationships and adhering to one’s faith. The Qur'an recognizes familial ties but also emphasizes faith as a central criterion.\n\n- **Surah Ali 'Imran 3:115** states, “The good they do will not go unaccepted; for God is aware of those who keep away from evil,” indicating that righteousness and faithfulness is a journey, and believers should encourage one another towards collective goodness, including within family relationships.\n\n### 4. **Communicating and Guiding Loved Ones**\n\nThe approach to family members who reject certain aspects of faith, like the Sunnah, should ideally be one of guidance and compassion rather than forsakement. \n\n- **Surah Ali 'Imran 3:20** suggests being instructive with a soft tone and encourages presenting the message of Islam truthfully, even to those who may oppose it: “If they turn away, your duty is to deliver the message. And God keeps an eye on His votaries” (Ali 'Imran, 3:20).\n\n### 5. **Continuing to uphold ties while being firm in faith**\n\nIslam teaches the importance of upholding family ties while simultaneously adhering to one’s faith. A believer is advised to maintain respectful and loving relations with family, while also standing firm in their beliefs.\n\nThis principle is further supported by the Hadith literature, where the Prophet Muhammad emphasized kindness and compassion towards family, regardless of their beliefs. He reportedly said, “The best of the believers is the one who is best in conduct, and the best of you is the one who is best to his family” (Sunan Ibn Majah).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, it is not necessarily prescribed to forsake one's family due to their rejection of the Sunnah; rather, a believer is encouraged to engage with them lovingly and respectfully, hoping to guide them towards the right path. However, maintaining one’s own faith and commitment to God should remain steadfast, as highlighted in the verses you provided. Balancing these aspects—adherence to faith and maintenance of family relations—requires wisdom and patience, as well as a deep understanding of Allah's guidance."

        "question": "Hadith About the Virtue of the Basmalah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This report was mentioned by al-Qurtubi in al-Jami’ li Ahkam al-Quran (1/92) and Ibn Katheer in his Tafseer (exegesis) (1/18), narrated from Wakee’ from al-A’mash from Abu Wail from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him); it is the words of Ibn Mas’ood, not of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nThis isnad (chain of narration) is saheeh (authentic) from Wakee’ to Ibn Mas’ood. \nAlthough al-A’mash is mudallis, what he narrated from those with whom he spent a great deal of time and narrated a great deal from them, such as Ibraheem al-Nakha’i and Abu Wail, may be accepted. \nAl-Dhahabi said in his biography of al-A’mash in Mizan al-I’tidal (2/224): \nHe is mudallis (i.e., gives false impressions concerning the narration of the hadith, using ambiguous words to give the impression that he heard it directly from his Shaykh when that is not the case), and sometimes he narrates in this manner from a weak narrator without realising it. When he says haddathana [he told us], there is no problem with that, but when he says ‘an [narrating from], there is the possibility of tadlees except in the case of narration from the shuyookh from whom he narrated a great deal, such as Ibraheem, Abu Wail [in the printed version it says “Ibn Abi Wail” but this is an error; the word “Ibn” is a mistake] and Abu Salih al-Samman. His narration from these shaykhs is to be understood as meaning that he heard directly from them and there is no interruption in the chain. End quote.\nBut there remains the issue of the narrators who come after Wakee’. Al-Qurtubi and Ibn Katheer do not mention the isnad in its entirety, and perhaps it is because of this that al-‘Allamah Ahmad Shakir omitted it from his abridgement of Ibn Katheer’s Tafseer which is entitled ‘Umdat al-Tafseer, in the introduction to which (1/11) he stated that he omitted every weak or problematic hadith. \nBut al-Suyooti attributed it in al-Durr al-Manthoor (1/26) to Wakee’, and Imam Wakee’ ibn al-Jarrah wrote a well-known Tafseer.  \nSee: al-Majma’ al-Muassis by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (p. 113) \nIf this is proven, then the isnad is saheeh, and the report from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) is saheeh. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Hadith About the Virtue of the Basmalah\n\nThe phrase \"Bismillah\" (بِسْمِ اللَّهِ) translates to \"In the name of Allah,\" and it holds great significance in Islamic traditions and practices. It is often mentioned at the beginning of various actions, from eating and drinking to starting any form of work, prayer, or recitation of the Qur'an. The importance of saying \"Bismillah\" and its virtues can be derived from the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and corroborated by verses from the Qur'an.\n\n#### 1. Importance of Beginning with Bismillah\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the significance of starting actions with the invocation of Allah's name. In a Hadith recorded in Sahih Muslim, he said:\n\n*\"Every important matter that does not begin with Bismillah is cut off (from blessings).\"* \n\nThis suggests that invoking Allah's name is essential for seeking His blessings and success in one's endeavors.\n\n#### 2. The Qur'anic Basis for the Basmalah\n\nThe virtue of the Basmalah is reinforced by various verses in the Qur'an. One such verse is found in Surah Al-Naml (27:30), where Allah states:\n\n*\"Indeed, it is from Solomon, and indeed, it reads: 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.'\"*  \n(Surah Al-Naml, Ayah 30)\n\nHere, the importance of beginning with \"In the name of Allah\" is underscored as it was used by Prophet Solomon (Sulaiman) in his letter to the Queen of Sheba, illustrating that invoking Allah's name was a practice of the Prophets themselves.\n\n#### 3. The Recommendation of the Prophets\n\nIn addition to Solomon's example, several other Prophets initiated their significant tasks or communications by invoking Allah's name. This practice, seen through various narratives in Islamic tradition, reaffirms the importance of Bismillah in setting a tone of consciousness of Allah in every act.\n\n#### 4. Reflection in Daily Life\n\nSaying \"Bismillah\" before meals and before other actions is not merely a tradition; it is a reminder of the blessings and provisions that Allah provides. Regular practice of saying it aligns with being grateful for all that one receives and acknowledges the Creator's presence in daily life.\n\n#### 5. Reminders and Warnings\n\nThe Qur'an passages also contain reminders that actions have consequences, and invoking the name of Allah humbles the believer and draws attention to the importance of intentions behind every deed. For instance, in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2):\n\n*\"...And do not assist one another in sin and aggression...\"*  \n(Surah Al-Ma'idah, Ayah 2)\n\nThis reinforces the notion that any action taken should be initiated with the right intention, starting with Allah's name, to avoid actions that are sinful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe repeated emphasis on the Basmalah is a powerful reminder of the Islamic principle of beginning every action with the consciousness of Allah. The virtues of saying \"Bismillah\" can be found in hadith, while its significance is enshrined in the Qur'an. In essence, invoking the name of Allah is not only an expression of faith but also a means of seeking divine guidance and blessings in all aspects of life."

        "question": "Commentary on the hadith: “A house in which there are no dates, its people will go hungry”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadith is saheeh. It was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. It is to be interpreted, according to the scholars, as referring to people whose food includes dates, such as the people of Madeenah at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others whose staple food is dates.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength.\n(Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn Baz 25/280)",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith \"A house in which there are no dates, its people will go hungry\" emphasizes the significance of sustenance in Islamic life and, specifically, the importance of dates as a staple food. Dates are not merely a source of nutrition but also hold cultural and religious significance in Islam, symbolizing provision and blessings from Allah.\n\n### Commentary on the Hadith\n\n1. **Physical and Spiritual Nourishment**: The hadith suggests that a household deprived of essential sustenance is likened to a household where the people suffer from hunger. Given that dates are a primary source of nutrition in many Arab cultures, the absence of such food can lead to physical hunger. This correlates with spiritual hunger — being devoid of sustenance may lead to a disconnection from gratitude and faith. In Islamic teaching, recognizing God's provisions is vital for spiritual well-being. This is supported by verses that remind us of God's provisions: \n\n   - Surah 51 (Adh-Dhariyat), Ayah 57: \n     > \"I want no sustenance from them nor do I want them to feed Me. God is certainly the great provider, Lord of strength and power.\" (51:57)\n\n   This shows that God does not require sustenance from His creation but rather provides for them.\n\n2. **Connotation of Dates**: Dates have been mentioned in the Qur'an and are often associated with blessings. They were a staple food during the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and signify abundance. The act of breaking a fast with dates is a Sunnah, highlighting their importance in daily life as well as in rituals such as Ramadan. \n\n   - Surah 2 (Al-Baqarah), Ayah 264:\n     > \"O believers, do not nullify your charity by giving to oblige and flaunting your favours...\" (2:264). \n\n   This emphasizes the importance of generosity and sharing the bounties God has provided, which can include dates.\n\n3. **Social Responsibility**: The hadith subtly brings forth the idea of social responsibility. In Islam, there is an emphasis on taking care of one's household and ensuring they have adequate sustenance. This ties into the broader theme of charity and helping those in need, as indicated in the following verse:\n\n   - Surah 51 (Adh-Dhariyat), Ayah 19:\n     > \"And in their wealth was a right for the needy.\" (51:19). \n\n   Therefore, the idea is not only about personal provision but also upon one’s responsibility towards others in the community.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe hadith underscores the importance of food, specifically dates, as essential to both physical sustenance and spiritual well-being. The themes of gratitude, social responsibility, and community care resonate throughout Islamic teachings. The Qur'an supports these ideas by emphasizing God's provision and the responsibility believers have towards one another in ensuring that no household suffers from hunger.\n\nIn essence, this hadith serves as a reminder to nurture both the body and soul through Allah's provisions and to extend that provision to others, ensuring a holistic community well-being."

        "question": "How sound is the hadeeth “Seek seventy excuses for your brother”?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.I do not know of any basis for it. What is prescribed for the believer is to respect his brother if he apologizes to him and accept his excuse if possible, and to think positively of him whenever possible, in hopes that hearts will be free from resentment and that people will be brought together and will cooperate in doing good. It was narrated from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: “Do not think badly of a word uttered by your brother, when you can find a good interpretation for it.” end quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadeeth \"Seek seventy excuses for your brother\" is attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and is often cited to emphasize the importance of giving others the benefit of the doubt and nurturing understanding and compassion within the community of believers. This principle is fundamental in Islamic teachings, as it encourages individuals to avoid jumping to conclusions and to foster relationships based on empathy and forgiveness.\n\n### Authenticity of the Hadeeth\n\nThe authenticity of this particular hadeeth has been discussed among scholars. While it is commonly referenced, it does not appear in the most trusted collections of hadith, such as Sahih al-Bukhari or Sahih Muslim. The reference is often found in books of ethics and good manners, such as *Ihya Ulum al-Din* by Al-Ghazali, and may have various narrations attributed to different reporters. \n\nDue to the absence of a strong and recognized chain of narration (isnad), some scholars classify it as weak (da'if) and therefore not suitable to be used as a basis for establishing concrete beliefs or actions. However, the underlying principle of seeking excuses for one another is well reflected in the Quran and in various authentic narrations.\n\n### Quranic Reflection\n\nSeveral Quranic verses touch upon the themes of community relations, treating others with respect, and avoiding suspicion:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Hujurat (49:10)**:\n    > \"The faithful are surely brothers; so restore friendship among your brothers, and fear God that you may be favoured.\" \n   This ayah emphasizes the brotherhood among believers and the importance of maintaining amicable relationships, reinforcing the need to seek understanding and excuse among one another.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Hujurat (49:12)**:\n    > \"O you who believe, avoid most suspicions: Some suspicions are indeed sins. So do not pry into others' secrets and do not backbite.\"\n   This verse advocates for cautiousness in assumptions about others and encourages refraining from negative thoughts, aligning closely with the essence of seeking excuses.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:267)**:\n    > \"O you who have believed, do not spend your money unwisely in your charity, but only from that which you have earned and what We have produced for you from the earth.\"\n   This reinforces the principle of sincerity and quality in interactions and transactions, which could extend metaphorically to our interpersonal communications and attitudes.\n\n4. **Surah Al-Mursalat (77:36-40)**:\n    > \"Nor given leave to make excuses. Alas the woe that day for those who deny!...\"\n   This highlights the importance of accountability and suggests the dire consequences of transgressions, which could be a reminder in the context of seeking excuses for one another.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the exact wording of \"Seek seventy excuses for your brother\" may not be strongly supported by authentic narrations, the moral it conveys is deeply entrenched in Islamic ethics. The spirit of compassion, understanding, and avoiding suspicion is a recurring theme throughout the Quran and hadith. The emphasis on community, brotherhood, and the avoidance of negative judgments forms a foundation that is indeed aligned with seeking excuses for one another.\n\nIn summary, while the hadeeth itself may be considered weak, the principles it highlights align well with broader Islamic teachings found in authentic sources. This encourages a culture of kindness and understanding, a crucial aspect for any vibrant community of believers."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to \n    the hadeeth “I am the most eloquent of those who speak the language of daad \n    (i.e., Arabic), but I am from Quraysh” – al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said concerning the tafseer of the latter part of Soorat \n    al-Faatihah: It has no basis. Al-‘Ajlooni said in Kashf al-Khafa’ \n    (1/200): It says in al-Laali’: Its meaning is correct, but it has no basis, as Ibn Katheer and other hafizes said. No isnaad is known for it. End quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith stating, \"I am the most eloquent of those who speak the language of daad (i.e., Arabic),\" emphasizes the significance of eloquence in the Arabic language, which is the language of the Qur'an. This imposes a profound connection between linguistic expression and the divine message conveyed through the Qur'an.\n\n### Key Points and Supporting Verses\n\n1. **Eloquence of the Qur'an**  \n   The Qur'an is heralded for its eloquence and clarity, serving as guidance and a warning. In **Surah Ash-Shu'ara (The Poets)**, Allah mentions:  \n   > \"Which the trusted spirit descended with, To (communicate) to your heart that you may be a warner, In eloquent Arabic.\"  \n   (Surah Ash-Shu'ara, Ayah 193-195)  \n   This verse indicates that the message was conveyed in eloquent Arabic, emphasizing its clarity and beauty, which can resonate deeply with the listener.\n\n2. **The Role of Linguistic Ability**  \n   Eloquence is critical in conveying messages effectively. The Qur'an points towards the importance of speaking clearly. In **Surah Taha**, Moses says:  \n   > \"Remove the defect of my tongue that they may understand my speech...\"  \n   (Surah Taha, Ayah 27-31)  \n   Here, Moses is asking Allah to ease his speech so that his message can be understood, showcasing the intrinsic value in clear and eloquent communication.\n\n3. **Proof of Divine Revelation**  \n   The eloquence of the Qur'an also serves as a testimony to its divine lineage and purpose. In **Surah Al-Ma'idah**, the truth of the Qur'an is highlighted:  \n   > \"And when God will ask: 'O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to mankind: 'Worship me and my mother as two deities apart from God?' (He) will say: 'Hallelujah.'\"  \n   This reflects the clarity and directness with which divine messages are communicated, underscoring the importance of eloquent expression in the conveyance of faith.  \n   (Surah Al-Ma'idah, Ayah 116-120)\n\n4. **The Challenge to Aspiring Eloquence**  \n   The Qur'an challenges those who doubt its divine origin by inviting them to produce something similar in its eloquence:  \n   > \"Say: If mankind and the jinn came together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants.\"  \n   (Surah Al-Isra, Ayah 88)  \n   This verse invites reflection on the unmatched eloquence and depth of the Qur'an, which is rooted in its divine origin.\n\n5. **Criticism of Poets and Their Eloquence**  \n   While the Qur'an acknowledges the eloquence of poets, it also criticizes those whose eloquence leads them astray. For instance:  \n   > \"And your movements among those who bow in homage to God. He is all-hearing and all-knowing. Should I tell you on whom the devils descend? They come down to every mendacious sinner, Who listens to you (for spreading rumours); but most of them are liars.\"  \n   (Surah Ash-Shu'ara, Ayah 219-223)  \n   This shows a distinction between constructive eloquence that conveys truth and misguided eloquence that leads to falsehood.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe hadith about eloquence in Arabic highlights the importance of language as a vehicle for divine revelation. The Qur'an itself, articulated in eloquent Arabic, serves as the ultimate example of effective communication of God's message, marrying beauty of language with profound meaning. The verses referenced underscore that eloquence is not merely for aesthetic appreciation but is fundamentally tied to the clarity and efficacy of conveying truth."

        "question": "Hadeeth: “Two rak’ahs with siwaak are better than seventy rak’ahs without siwaak”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Siwaak is Sunnah, and is an act of worship when done at the \n    time of prayer or when doing wudoo’, because the Messenger  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Siwaak is purifying for the mouth \n    and pleasing to the Lord.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i with a saheeh isnaad from \n    ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her).

        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you mentioned, \"Two rak’ahs with siwaak are better than seventy rak’ahs without siwaak,\" emphasizes the significance of performing acts of worship with attention to detail, cleanliness, and piety. While the hadith itself isn't directly cited in the Quran, it underscores principles found in the scripture regarding righteousness and the importance of intention in actions. Below are the supporting verses from the Quran that relate to the themes encapsulated in the hadith:\n\n### Importance of Righteous Deeds\n\n1. **Surah Al-Ma'idah (Surah 5), Ayah 100 - 104:**  \n   This passage reminds believers that good deeds are evaluated by their quality, with God emphasizing righteousness over mere quantity:\n\n   > \"Tell them: The unclean and the pure are not equal, even though the abundance of the unclean may be pleasing to you. So fear God, O men of wisdom; you may haply find success.\"  \n   > (Quran 5:100)\n\n2. **Surah Al-Ahzab (Surah 33), Ayah 29:**  \n   This verse highlights the importance of obedience and devotion to God and His Messenger, which can amplify the rewards of one's actions:\n\n   > \"But if you desire God, His Apostle, and the joys of life to come, then God has verily set apart for those of you who are good, a great reward.\"  \n   > (Quran 33:29)\n\n### Emphasis on Kiyning Cleanliness and Purity in Worship\n\n3. **Surah Al-Furqan (Surah 25), Ayah 68 - 70:**  \n   These verses indicate that believers who engage in actions with sincerity and righteousness will be rewarded, while hypocrites and evildoers will face severe consequences:\n\n   > \"And those who do not invoke with God another deity or kill the soul which God has forbidden, except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.\"  \n   > (Quran 25:68)\n\n### The Value of Small Acts with Great Intent\n\n4. **Surah Al-Ahzab (Surah 33), Ayah 31 - 35:**  \n   This verse reminds that those who are obedient and do righteous deeds, even if small, are granted greater rewards:\n\n   > \"But whoever of you is obedient to God and His Apostle, and does the right, will be given a two-fold reward by Us; and We have a rich provision in readiness for her.\"  \n   > (Quran 33:31)\n   \n### Conclusion\n\nThe hadith regarding the two rak’ahs with siwaak being more valuable than seventy rak’ahs without it stresses that the intention, cleanliness, and sincerity behind a deed can greatly enhance its value in the sight of Allah. These themes resonate throughout various Quranic verses that acknowledge the significance of righteous intentions, purity, and the sincere execution of worship. This indicates a clear understanding in Islam that quantity alone does not determine the worth of an action, but rather the quality and care put into it."

        "question": "Wearing an Iron Ring for Men",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Buraydah from his father (may Allah be pleased with them both) that a man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he was wearing a ring of gold. He said: “Why do I detect the stench of idols on you?” So he threw it away. Then he came and he was wearing a ring of iron, and he said: “Why do I see you wearing the jewellery of the people of Hell?” So he threw it away. He said: O Messenger of Allah, of what should I wear (a ring)? He said: “Wear (a ring) of silver, but no more than a mithqal (a measure of weight).” Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasai. Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a ghareeb (strange) hadeeh. It was narrated from Iyas ibn al-Harith ibn al-Mu’ayqeeb that his grandfather said: The ring of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was made of iron overlaid with silver. He said: I kept it sometimes, and Mu’ayqeeb was in charge of the ring of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Narrated by Abu Dawood and al-Nasai.\nIn al-Saheehayn it is narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the one who proposed marriage to the woman who had offered herself in marriage to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Look for something (to give as a dowry), even if it is a ring of iron.” This indicates that it is permissible to wear a ring of iron, as is indicated by the hadeeth of Mu’ayqeeb. As for the hadeeth of Buraydah quoted above, there is some weakness in its isnad (chain of narration). Thus it is clear that the more correct view is that it is not makrooh (disliked) to wear a ring of iron. But wearing a ring of silver is better, because the ring of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was made of silver, as is proven in al-Saheehayn. \nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. End quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the question of whether men can wear iron rings primarily stems from cultural practices and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), as there are specific rulings regarding the wearing of adornments and jewelry. While the Qur'an does not address the issue of wearing iron rings directly, the general principles governing adornment in Islam can provide guidance.\n\n### Key Points on Wearing Iron Rings for Men\n\n1. **General Prohibition on Gold for Men**:\n   The majority of Islamic scholars agree that men are prohibited from wearing gold jewelry based on a Hadith where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \n   > \"Wearing silk and gold has been made unlawful for the males of my nation and lawful for their females.\" (Sunan Abi Dawood, Book 34, Hadith 4219).\n\n   This means that while gold is strictly prohibited for males, the rules regarding other metals are generally more flexible.\n\n2. **Wearing Iron or Other Metals**:\n   There is generally no Islamic prohibition against men wearing rings made of iron, silver, or other metals. Elaboration can be found in interpretations of various Hadiths, which discuss the use of different materials for jewelry. For instance, it was reported that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) wore a silver ring, although iron rings specifically are not mentioned. \n\n3. **Cultural and Societal Contexts**:\n   The acceptance of wearing certain types of rings can also heavily depend on cultural context. In many societies, iron rings may be worn for practical reasons (e.g., craftsmanship, durability) or have cultural significance that does not contradict Islamic principles.\n\n### Supporting Verses from the Qur'an and Hadith\nWhile the Qur'an does not provide explicit verses on wearing iron rings for men, it offers general guidance on adornments and complexity of life:\n\n- **Surah Al-Hadid (Chapter 57)**:\n  - In verse 25, Allah mentions the creation of iron and its usefulness:\n    > \"We sent down iron which causes much distress but also has advantages for men...\" (Qur'an 57:25).\n  \n   This verse highlights that iron can be beneficial for human life, though it does not specify jewelry for men. The implication suggests that iron can be used for various purposes since it's beneficial.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, while the Qur'an does not specify the prohibition or allowance for wearing iron rings by men, Islamic law generally allows the wearing of rings made from various metals other than gold. The key is whether the adornment aligns with Islamic principles regarding modesty and purpose. Cultural acceptability must also be taken into account. Men are encouraged to beautify themselves within the guidelines of Islamic teachings, as long as such practices do not contradict major Islamic principles."

        "question": "The status of a faqeeh is superior to that of a hadeeth narrator, but both are good",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The faqeeh is the mujtahid who derives shar’i rulings, \n    explains the principles of sharee’ah and teaches people the rulings of their \n    religion. The focus of his specialty is the aims and goals of sharee’ah, the \n    clear verses of the Qur’aan and achieving sound understanding of what Allaah \n    wants from His slaves. \n\n    This is something that can be done by only a few individuals, \n    because it requires extensive study of the texts, lengthy study and \n    examination of the words of the scholars, and intelligence in studying real \n    life situations and applying the rulings of sharee’ah to them. \n\n    As for the narrator of hadeeth, he transmits what he hears of \n    the Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \n    and he delivers what he receives with honesty and sincerity. His main \n    concern is to convey the hadeeth as he heard it by any possible means, but \n    he does not concern himself with explaining the meaning of the hadeeth or \n    deriving shar’i rulings from it, or knowledge of what abrogates and what is \n    abrogated, or what is general and what is specific. Rather his role is \n    limited to simply transmitting and narrating. \n\n    This task requires precision and care in transmission, but it \n    does not require knowledge of fiqh or the basic principles (usool) of fiqh. \n\n    Imam al-A’mash (may Allaah have mercy on him) described the \n    work of both the faqeeh and the narrator of hadeeth in detail. He said: \n\n    “O fuqaha’, you are the doctors and we are the pharmacists.” \n    End quote. \n\n    Naseehah Ahl al-hadeeth li’l-Khateeb al-Baghdadi \n    (1/45). \n\n    It is no secret that the roles of the doctor and pharmacist \n    are complementary; they cannot do without one another. Both of them are good \n    and their influence is important. Islam also confirms that both the faqeeh \n    and the hadeeth narrator are good and will be rewarded by Allaah, but the \n    faqeeh (the doctor) is of a higher standing, as he pays attention to \n    understanding and deriving rulings. \n\n    Some scholars derived this meaning from the words of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “May Allaah bless \n    a man who hears a hadeeth from us and memorizes it so that he can convey it \n    to others, for perhaps he is conveying it to one who will understand it \n    better than him, and perhaps the one who conveys knowledge does not \n    understand it himself.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (3660). \n\n    Al-Ramahramzi (d. 360 AH) said: The Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) differentiated between the one who narrates \n    the Sunnah and the one who understands it, and he indicated that the one who \n    understands it is superior, by saying “for perhaps he is conveying it to one \n    who will understand it better than him, and perhaps the one who conveys \n    knowledge does not understand it himself.” By affirming the virtue of one, \n    the virtue of the other is automatically affirmed. For example: Maalik ibn \n    Anas and ‘Ubayd-Allaah al-‘Umari, or between al-Shaafa’i and ‘Abd al-Rahmaan \n    ibn Mahdi, or between Abu Thawr and Ibn Abi Shaybah. Fair-mindedness leads \n    you to determine that both are people of knowledge and virtue; this is the \n    attitude of fair-minded people that is reached by those who have knowledge \n    of the truth. End quote. \n\n    Al-Muhaddith al-Faadil \n    (1/169-170). \n\n    As for the one who combines both qualities, who understands \n    the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    and memorizes what he brought of knowledge, and understands the meanings, \n    and benefits himself and others thereby, these are the best of all types of \n    people. \n\n    It was narrated from Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: “The likeness of the guidance and knowledge with which \n    Allaah has sent me is that of rain falling upon the earth. Some of it is \n    good ground which receives the water and brings forth a great deal of \n    herbage and grass. Some of it is hard but it retains the water, and Allaah \n    benefits people by it, and they drink it and give it to their animals to \n    drink and use it for irrigation and grazing. And another part of it is \n    barren, it does not retain the water or produce herbage. That is the \n    likeness of one who gains an understanding of the religion of Allaah, and \n    Allaah benefits him by that with which Allaah has sent me, and he learns and \n    teaches others; and the likeness of a man who pays no attention to that, and \n    does not accept the guidance of Allaah with which I have been sent.” \n\n    Imam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    As for the meaning of the hadeeth, it is likening the \n    guidance that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    brought to rain. It says that land is of three types, and the same is true \n    of people. \n\n    The first type of land benefits from the rain and comes back \n    to life after having been dead, and it brings forth herbage from which \n    people, animals and plants benefit. This is like the first type of people \n    whom guidance and knowledge reach: such a person memorizes it and his heart \n    is brought back to life; he acts upon it and teaches others, so he benefits \n    from it and benefits others. \n\n    The second type of land does not benefit from the rain \n    itself, but it does something good with it, namely holding the water for \n    others, so people and animals benefit from it. This is like the second type \n    of people; they have good memories but they do not have deep understanding \n    or deep insight by means of which they could derive meanings and rulings, \n    and they do not strive hard in worship. They memorize it and preserve it \n    until there comes along one who needs it and thirsts for the knowledge that \n    they have, a scholar who is able to benefit from it. So he takes it and \n    benefits others by means of that which they conveyed to him. \n\n    The third type of land is the barren land that does not \n    produce any herbage and the like, and does not benefit itself from the \n    water, and does not retain it so that others may benefit from it. This is \n    like the third type of people; they do not have good memories or \n    understanding or insight. If they hear knowledge they do not benefit from it \n    or preserve it so that others may benefit. End quote. \n\n    Sharh Muslim (15/47-48). \n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  \n\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    likened the knowledge and guidance that he brought to rain, because of what \n    each of them bring of life, benefit, nourishment, medicine and all things \n    that are in people’s interests. This is true of both knowledge and rain. \n\n    And he likened people’s hearts to the different types of land \n    on which rain may fall, because the land is the place that retains the rain, \n    and all kinds of beneficial plants grow, just as the heart understands \n    knowledge and bears fruit and manifests blessings and benefits. \n\n    Then he divided people into three categories, according to \n    their readiness to memorize and understand its meanings and derive rulings \n    from it. \n\n    1-People with good memories and \n    good understanding, who understand and comprehend the meanings, and derive \n    different rulings, wisdom and benefits from it. They are like the land that \n    absorbs the water, which is the likeness of the memory, and brings forth a \n    great deal of herbage and grain, which is the likeness of understanding, \n    knowledge and derivation of rulings. This is the likeness of the one who is \n    both a haafiz and a faqeeh, the people who both narrate and understand the \n    hadeeth.\n\n    2-People who are able to memorize \n    and classify reports, but they are not able to understand the meanings or \n    derive different types of rulings and benefits from them. They are like \n    those who read and memorize the Qur’aan, paying attention to the letters and \n    pronunciation, but they are not able to develop a proper understanding of \n    Allaah, as ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said: “Except an understanding that Allaah \n    grants to His slave concerning His Book.” People vary greatly in their \n    understanding of the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Perhaps one person may \n    understand one or two rulings from the text, whereas another may understand \n    one hundred or two hundred. They are like the land that retains the water \n    for people so that they may benefit from it, drinking it or giving it to \n    others to drink or irrigating crops with it.\n\n    These two types are blessed, although the former are of \n    higher status. This is the bounty of Allaah which He gives as He wills, and \n    Allaah is the Owner of great bounty. \n\n    3-Those who have no share of it, \n    who neither memorize it nor understand it, who neither memorize nor \n    comprehend it. Rather they are like the land that is barren and dry, which \n    neither produces herbage nor retains the water.\n\n    They are the ones who are doomed. The first two categories \n    share the qualities of learning and teaching, each according to what it has \n    accepted as sound and what has reached it. One may know and memorize the \n    phrases of the Qur’aan, whilst another knows its meanings, rulings and \n    sciences, but the third category does not know or teach. They are the ones \n    who neither benefited from the guidance of Allaah or accepted it. They are \n    worse off than cattle, and they are the fuel of Hell. \n\n    This hadeeth also points to the honourable status and lofty \n    position of knowledge and teaching, and the wretchedness of those who have \n    no share of it; it mentions different categories of the sons of Adam with \n    regard to it – who is doomed and who is blessed; and it further divides the \n    blessed into those who are the foremost (in faith) and those who are among \n    “those on the Right Hand” (cf. al-Waaqi’ah 56:8). \n\n    This indicates that the people’s need for knowledge is like \n    their need for rain, or even greater. If they lose knowledge then they are \n    akin to the land that is lacking rain.  \n\n    Imam Ahmad said: People need knowledge more than they need \n    food and drink, because they need food and drink once or twice a day, but \n    they need knowledge with every breath they take. End quote. \n\n    Miftaah Daar al-Sa’aadah \n    (1/65-66). \n\n    So how do you stand with regard to all this? What type of \n    land are you? Are you the type that will benefit itself and others, so that \n    you memorize and understand, act upon it and teach it to others? Or are you \n    one who will preserve it for others so that they may benefit, and the one \n    who points others towards a good deed will be like the one who does it (in \n    terms of reward)? \n\n    We pray that Allaah will protect you. We think that you are \n    far above being like the barren land which never holds any water or produces \n    any vegetation, never memorizing or understanding, but appointing yourself \n    as judge to decide between the two groups! \n\n    Look at your aims and goals; strive hard and set high goals \n    for yourself. Make yourself memorize and understand, and if you are not able \n    to do some of it, then at least be one who points others towards good deeds, \n    and does that which is enjoined upon him. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In discussing the status of a faqeeh (Islamic scholar) compared to that of a hadeeth narrator, it's essential to understand the roles and significance of both within Islamic tradition.\n\n1. **Position of Faqeeh**: A faqeeh specializes in understanding Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and is adept at deriving legal rulings from the Quran and Sunnah. Their role extends beyond narrating hadith; they interpret these narrations in the context of legal and ethical frameworks. This interpretation is critical for applying Islamic principles in daily life, forming the foundation of legal systems within the Muslim community.\n\n   The Quran emphasizes the importance of knowledge and understanding in faith. For instance, Allah commands believers to seek knowledge and wisdom in various aspects of life. In Surah Taha, Allah instructs: \n\n   - **Surah Taha (20:112-114)**: \"But he who has done good things and believes, will have no fear of either being wronged or deprived... O Lord, give me greater knowledge.\" \n   \n   This illustrates the value placed on knowledge, particularly in guiding actions and faith.\n\n2. **Status of Hadeeth Narrator**: Hadeeth narrators play a crucial role in the transmission of the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Their task ensures that the teachings are accurately conveyed, serving as vital sources of knowledge alongside the Quran. However, the role is primarily about transmission rather than interpretation.\n\n3. **Comparison of Roles**: While both roles are vital for maintaining Islamic teachings and practices, the faqeeh's responsibility encompasses a broader scope of understanding the law and its application based on both the Quran and Hadith. This places the faqeeh in a position of authority when it comes to interpreting Islamic law, thus giving them a superior status compared to a pure narrator of hadith.\n\n   In this context, several Quranic verses indicate the respected position of knowledgeable individuals. For example:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Furqan (25:33-34)**: \"And they say: 'These are fables of antiquity he has invented...'\" We see that people who are devoid of sound knowledge often accuse those who possess it. This suggests a respect for those who have legitimate knowledge and understanding.\n   \n   - **Surah Fussilat (41:33-34)**: \"Whose word is better than his who calls to God and does the right, and says: 'I am of the obedient?'” This indicates the superiority of those who act upon their knowledge.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: While both a faqeeh and a hadeeth narrator play essential roles within the Islamic tradition, the status of a faqeeh can be considered superior due to their extensive knowledge and ability to interpret and apply Islamic principles. This is particularly inferred from the verses that emphasize the need for wisdom and knowledge in guiding one’s actions and faith.\n\nIn summary, the distinction in roles emphasized in the Quran supports the view that the faqeeh holds a more significant position due to their interpretative duties in jurisprudence versus the more straightforward narrational role of a hadeeth narrator."

        "question": "How to understand the hadeeth when the prophet instructed the one who prayed badly to repeat his prayer and not ordering Mu’awiyah to repeat it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah \n    ibn al-Hakam was narrated by Muslim (537) from Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam who \n    said: Whilst I was praying with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), a man among the people sneezed and I said:\n    Yarhamuk Allaah (may Allah have mercy on you). The people \n    glared at me and I said: May my mother be bereft of me! Why are you staring \n    at me? They started striking their hands on their thighs, and when I \n    realized that they were telling me to be quiet, (I felt angry) but I kept \n    quiet. When the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) had prayed – may my father and mother be sacrificed for him; by \n    Allaah I have never seen a better teacher or better teachings before or \n    since; he did not rebuke me, hit me or revile me – he said: “This prayer is \n    not the right place for any of the people’s speech, rather it is tasbeeh, \n    takbeer and recitation of Qur’aan.” \nThe hadeeth about the man \n    who prayed badly was narrated by al-Bukhaari (757) and Muslim (397) from Abu \n    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered the mosque and a man \n    came in and prayed, then he came and greeted the Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) returned the greeting and said: \n    “Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.” The man went back and prayed as \n    he had prayed before, then he came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) and greeted him, and the Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Wa ‘alayk al-salaam.” \n    Then he said: “Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.” When he had done \n    that three times, the man said: By the One Who sent you with the truth, I \n    cannot do more than that. Teach me. He said: “When you go to pray, say \n    takbeer, then recite whatever you can of the Qur’aan. Then bow until you are \n    at ease in bowing, then rise until you are standing up straight. Then \n    prostrate until you are at ease in prostration, then sit up until you are at \n    ease in sitting. Then do that throughout the entire prayer.” \nBoth ahaadeeth indicate \n    that the one who is ignorant is excused, but in the hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah he \n    is not commanded to repeat the prayer, whereas in the hadeeth of the one who \n    prayed badly, he is not commanded to repeat the prayers he had offered \n    before, rather he was commanded to repeat the current prayer only. \nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said, commenting on the hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah: As for the \n    words of the ignorant one, it was because he was new in Islam, so they are \n    like the words of one who forgets, so they did not invalidate his prayer if \n    they were few, because of this hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam, which we \n    are discussing here, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) did not command him to repeat the prayer. But he taught him \n    that it is haraam to talk during prayers for future reference. End quote. \nWith regard to commanding \n    the one who prayed badly to repeat his prayer when he did not command \n    Mu’aawiyah to do so, that is because there is a difference between doing \n    that which is forbidden and not doing that which is enjoined. Omitting what \n    is enjoined is not excused because of ignorance or forgetfulness when it is \n    possible to make it up, which is unlike doing what is forbidden. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said, in a discussion of things that are forbidden \n    whilst in ihraam: The correct view is that all of them may be excused. If a \n    person is excused due to ignorance, forgetting or being forced to do \n    something , there are no consequences to his actions whatsoever, whether it \n    has to do with having intercourse, hunting, clipping the nails, wearing \n    tailored garments or anything else. We have mentioned above evidence from \n    the Qur’aan, Sunnah and rational thought.  \nThe same applies to all \n    other actions that are forbidden during acts of worship; the ruling does not \n    apply, if they happen in cases of ignorance forgetfulness or compulsion, \n    because of the general meaning of the texts and because the penalty, fidyah \n    or kafaarah (expiation) is only prescribed in order to compensate for going \n    against the rules or to expiate sins, but the ignorant, forgetful person or \n    one who is forced did not deliberately go against the rules, and if he had \n    remembered, been aware or had the choice he would not have done it. \nIf a person drinks by \n    mistake in Ramadaan (because he forgets he is fasting), he does not have to \n    make it up. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah \n    be pleased with him): “Whoever forgets when he is fasting and eats or \n    drinks, let him complete his fast, for it is Allaah Who has fed him and \n    given him to drink.” The one who does not deliberately go against the rule \n    is not sinning and does not have to offer any fidyah. \nSimilarly, when ‘Adiyy ibn \n    Haatim wanted to fast, he took a black thread and a white thread, because of \n    the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and eat \n    and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct \n    from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) \n    till the nightfall” [al-Baqarah 2:187]. They used to take the rulings \n    directly from the Qur'aan. But the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said to him: “Your pillow must be very wide, if the \n    black and white threads are beneath your pillow.” But he did not command him \n    to repeat the fast because he was ignorant of the ruling. \nSimilarly, Asma’ bint Abi \n    Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with her) said that they broke the fast on a \n    cloudy day at the time of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him), and he did not command them to make it up – because \n    they were unaware of the fact that the sun had not yet set. \nThe same applies to prayer. \n    The evidence is that Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) started to pray with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) and a man sneezed, so he said, “Yarhamuk-Allaah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on you)” whilst he was praying. The people glared at him – i.e., \n    they looked at him disapprovingly – and he (may Allaah be pleased with him) \n    said, “May my mother be bereft of me!”, i.e., he added more words to what he \n    had said. So they started to slap their thighs with their hands to make him \n    be quiet, and he fell silent. When he had said the salaam, the Messenger \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called him. Mu’aawiyah \n    said: May my father and mother be sacrificed for him; by Allaah I have never \n    seen a better teacher or better teachings before or since; he did not rebuke \n    me, hit me or revile me – he said: “This prayer is not the right place for \n    any of the people’s speech, rather it is tasbeeh, takbeer and recitation of \n    Qur’aan.” And he did not tell him to repeat it because he was unaware of the \n    ruling. \nThe texts point to this \n    principle, which is not blaming people for forgetting, not knowing, or being \n    forced to do something. This is what is implied by the words of Allaah \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n“your Lord has written \n    (prescribed) Mercy for Himself, so that if any of you does evil in \n    ignorance, and thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds (by obeying \n    Allaah), then surely, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”\n[al-An’aam 6:54], \nAnd the words of Allaah in \n    the hadeeth qudsi: “My mercy prevails over My wrath.” \nOmitting to do that which \n    is enjoined, however, is not excused on the basis of forgetting, ignorance \n    or being forced, when it is possible to make it up, because the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses \n    a prayer or forgets it, let him pray it when he remembers it.” So it is not \n    waved in the case of forgetting. And because the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not waive the current prayer on the \n    grounds of ignorance, as we see in the hadeeth of the one who prayed badly; \n    he commanded him to repeat it even though he was ignorant, because he was \n    omitting to do something enjoined.  \nMoreover, it is possible to \n    make up things that are enjoined, but forbidden things are over and done \n    with. But if a person is doing something that is forbidden, he should stop \n    doing it as soon as he realizes. If someone says that Allaah’s words \n    (interpretation of the meaning): “Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or \n    fall into error” [al-Baqarah 2:286] are general in meaning and include \n    both omitting things that are enjoined and doing things that are forbidden, \n    the response is that that is indeed the case; the one who does not do \n    something that is enjoined out of ignorance or because he forgets will not \n    be punished for not doing it, but not doing it means that he is obliged to \n    discharge his duty once the excuse is no longer applicable.

        "predicted_answer": "The question regarding the Hadeeth where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) instructed a man who prayed badly to repeat his prayer, while not ordering Mu’awiyah to do the same, can be understood through an analysis of the context and purpose of prayer in Islam, as well as the teachings surrounding it.\n\n1. **Nature of the Prayer**: The act of prayer (Salat) in Islam is not just a ritual but is intended to connect the believer with God. The quality and intention behind the prayer are crucial. In the Hadeeth mentioned, the Prophet noticed that the man was performing his prayer incorrectly and thus advised him to repeat it, indicating a need for improvement in his concentration and performance. This is supported by the general teachings on the importance of proper prayer, such as in Surah Al-Mu'minun where Allah emphasizes the qualities of successful believers, stating: \n\n   *“Indeed, believers are successful, they who are humble in their prayers.”* (Surah Al-Mu'minun, 23:1-2)\n\n2. **Degree of Awareness and Capacity**: The different instructions given reflect the Prophet’s awareness of the individuals' different circumstances. Mu’awiyah was known for his background and involvement in leadership roles, which might have placed him in a different level of accountability and expectation. Therefore, Mu’awiyah’s broader experience may have influenced the Prophet’s approach towards him – implying that he might have been better equipped to understand the nature of prayer without needing a direct correction. \n\n3. **Growth and Development in Faith**: The Prophet's guidance in this instance illustrates the importance of teaching through example and correcting others in a way that fosters growth, encouraging the one who prayed badly to improve without public embarrassment. This method of teaching aligns with the notion of compassion in Islam and the role of the teacher as a nurturer of potential. This can be reflected upon in the way the Quran discusses the purpose of guidance:\n\n   *“And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds.”* (Surah Al-Anbiya, 21:107)\n\n4. **Individual Respect**: The fact that Mu’awiyah was not asked to repeat his prayer might also reflect the understanding of the context. In different instances, the Prophet recognized the companionship of those around him and maintained respect for their dignity even while emphasizing the need for correction. In Surah An-Nur, it states:\n\n   *“And whenever you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it or [at least] return it in a like manner.”* (Surah An-Nur, 24:61)\n\n5. **Relational Context**: In a community of believers, interactions are nuanced by social roles, relationships, and individual histories. The Prophet often adapted his teachings to fit the dynamics of his companions. For example, the aforementioned verses from Surah Al-Munafiqun caution the believers regarding behaviors, suggesting that the Prophet's response to differing individuals would have been in consideration of their nature.\n\n   *“O you who believe, let not your wealth and children make you negligent of the remembrance of Allah.”* (Surah Al-Munafiqun, 63:9)\n\nIn summary, the distinction in the Prophet's approach toward the man who prayed badly and Mu’awiyah can be understood through the contexts of their circumstances, the need for methodical correction, and the overarching principles of compassion and individual recognition found in both the Hadeeth and the Quran. The emphasis on sincerity, humility, and gradual improvement in one's faith is central to Islamic teaching."

        "question": "Meaning of the lack in reason and religious commitment in women",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have not seen any lacking in reason and religious commitment but (at the same time) more able to rob the wisdom of the wise, except one of you [women].” They said: How are we lacking in religious commitment and reason, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Is not the testimony of a woman like half the testimony of a man?” They said: Yes. He said: “That is how she is lacking in reason. And when she menstruates, does she not refrain from praying and fasting?” They said: Yes. He said: “That is how she is lacking in religious commitment.” So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that her lacking in reason refers to her weak memory, and that her testimony must be supported by the testimony of another woman, in order to confirm the testimony, because she may forget, and add something to or take something away from her testimony, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her” [al-Baqarah 2:282]. \nWith regard to her lacking in religious commitment, that is because when she is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth, she does not pray or fast, and she does not make up the missed prayers, so this is lacking in religious commitment. But this lacking is not something for which she is called to account or blamed, rather it is something that happens by the will of Allah; for He is the One Who has prescribed that out of kindness towards her and so as to make things easier for her, because if she were to fast during menses and nifaas, that would harm her. By His mercy Allah has prescribed that she should not fast at the time of menses and nifaas, and she should make it up after that. \nWith regard to prayer, at the time of menses she is unable to purify herself, so by His mercy Allah has prescribed that she should not pray, and the same applies to nifaas, and He has not prescribed that she should make it up, because making it up would be very difficult, as prayers are offered five times a day, and menses may last for several days, seven or eight or more, and nifaas may last as long as forty days. So by His mercy and kindness towards her, Allah has waived the duty of offering and making up prayers.  \nThis does not mean that her reason is lacking entirely, or that her religious commitment is lacking entirely, rather the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that the lack in her reasoning has to do with what may happen of her testimony not being accurate, and the lack in her religious commitment has to do with what may happen of her missing prayers and fasts at the time of menses and nifaas.  But that does not imply that she is less than a man in everything, or that a man is better than her in everything. \nYes, the male gender is superior to the female gender in general, for many reasons, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means” [al-Nisa’ 4:34]. \nBut a woman may sometimes surpass a man in many things. How often has a woman surpassed men in her reason, religious commitment and memory. What is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with regard to the female gender being inferior to the male gender in reason and religious commitment is from this point of view, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained.  \nA woman may do a great deal of righteous deeds and thus surpass many men in her righteous deeds, fear of Allah and status in the Hereafter. She may have a great deal of interest in some matters and thus able to give proper testimony, better than that of  some men in some issues in which she has an interest. She may strive in memorization and understanding these issues, thus becoming a reference point with regard to Islamic history and many other things. This is clear to anyone who studies the state of women at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and after that. \nThus it is clear that this lack does not mean that women cannot be relied on in narration (of hadith etc) or in giving testimony, if it is supported by another woman. It also does not mean that she does not fear Allah or that she cannot be among the best of Allah’s slave and the best of the female slaves of Allah, if she adheres strictly to Islam. Although fasting is waived for her at the time of menses and nifaas, she has to make it up, and even prayer is waived in her case, but she does not have to make it up. This does not imply that she is lacking in all things when it comes to fearing Allah, obeying His commands and becoming well-versed in matters that are of interest to her. It is a lack that is specific to reason and religious commitment, in the way that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained. So the believer should not accuse her of being lacking in all things, or of being weak in religious commitment in all aspects, rather it is a specific type of lacking that has to do with her religious commitment and reason, which has to do with accuracy of testimony and so on. So she should be treated fairly and the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) should be interpreted in the best possible manner. And Allah knows best. \nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him)",
        "predicted_answer": "### Meaning of the Lack in Reason and Religious Commitment in Women\n\nIn Islamic discourse, the perceived lack of reason and religious commitment in women has been a topic of varying interpretations, and it is essential to approach this subject with a nuanced understanding in line with Islamic teachings. \n\n#### Key Verse: Surah An-Nisa (4:34)\nOne of the key passages that is often referred to in discussions about women's role and status in Islam is Surah An-Nisa, verse 4:34. It states:\n\n> \"Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their wealth (to support them). Therefore, the righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in (the husband’s) absence what Allah would have them guard. And as for those from whom you fear disobedience, admonish them and forsake them in bed and strike them. But if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.\" \n\nIn this verse, the phrase “Allah has made one of them to excel the other” is often interpreted to refer to roles rather than superiority in intellect or faith. Scholars commonly note that the verse establishes a framework for mutual rights and responsibilities between men and women, rather than denoting an intrinsic lack of reasoning or commitment in women.\n\n### Interpretation of Women’s Role\n#### 1. Contextual Understanding:\nThe historical and societal context during the time of the revelation plays a crucial role. Many scholars argue that the social milieu, including the treatment of women in pre-Islamic Arabia, necessitated that women were granted specific protections and rights that they previously lacked. \n\n#### 2. Rational Capacity:\nThe implication of a “lack of reason” is often based on the notorious saying attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) regarding women’s testimonies and their role during specific jurisprudential matters. For example, in another hadith, it is stated that a woman’s testimony can be worth half that of a man’s. However, this is generally understood to relate to contexts of legal testimony, not a broad statement about women’s intellectual capacity or spiritual commitment.\n\n#### Relevant Verses about Women’s Spirituality and Equality:\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:221)**: \n   > \"And do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her. And do not marry your daughters to idolaters until they accept the faith.\"\n   This verse affirms that belief is paramount, emphasizing shared values in marriages.\n\n2. **Surah An-Nisa (4:32)**: \n   > \"And do not covet that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of His bounty. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things.\"\n   This verse highlights gender equality regarding earnings and spiritual merit.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:35)**: \n   > \"Indeed, the Muslim men and women, the believing men and women, the devout men and women, the truthful men and women, the patient men and women, the humble men and women, the charitable men and women, the fasting men and women, the men and women who remember Allah often, Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward.\"\n   These verses emphasize that both men and women are equally capable of attaining virtue and reward.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe assertion of any inherent lack of reason or religious commitment among women is not supported by the Qur'anic text when interpreted in its full context. Verses such as those in Surah An-Nisa and Surah Al-Baqarah illustrate that men and women are equal in their spiritual and moral capabilities. The specific roles delineated in Islamic law, therefore, should not be misconstrued as an implication of inferiority. Instead, they underscore different responsibilities within the context of family and society.\n\nIn modern discourse, it is crucial to continue to celebrate and uphold the dignity, intellect, and spiritual capacity of women, recognizing their significant contributions to faith and society in accordance with Islamic teachings.\n"

        "question": "Authenticity of the Hadeeth “The sleep of the fasting person is worship”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth is not saheeh, and it is not proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nAl-Bayhaqi narrated in Shu’ab al-Eeman (3/1437) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Awfa (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The sleep of the fasting person is worship, his silence is tasbeeh (glorification), his du’a (supplication) is answered and his good deeds will be multiplied.” Its isnad (chain of narration) was classed as weak by al-Bayhaqi who said: Ma’roof ibn Hassan (one of the men in the isnad) is da’eef (weak) and Sulayman ibn ‘Amr al-Nakha’i is weaker than him. Al-‘Iraqi said in Takhreej Ihya’ ‘Uloom al-Deen (1/310): Sulayman al-Nakha’i is one of the liars. It was classed as da’eef by al-Manawi in Fayd al-Qadeer (9293) and it was mentioned by al-Albani in Silsilat al-Ahadeeth al-Da’eefah (4696) who said: It is da’eef. \nWhat the Muslims should do in general – and this applies even more so to khateebs and da’iyahs (callers to Islam) – is to verify reports before attributing a hadeeth to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is not permissible to attribute to him anything that he did not say. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Telling a lie about me is not like telling a lie about anyone else. Whoever tells a lie about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1391) and by Muslim in the introduction to his Saheeh (4). \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith \"The sleep of the fasting person is worship\" is one that emphasizes the spiritual dimension of fasting in Islam, suggesting that even while a person is asleep during the fasting hours, they are engaged in an act of worship. This saying has been reported in various collections of hadith, including those by Al-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and Ahmad.\n\n### Authenticity of the Hadith\n\n1. **Sources of the Hadith:**\n   - The hadith is considered weak (da'if) by some scholars, although it has been upheld by others due to its supportive context found in the broader teachings of Islam about fasting, intention, and worship.\n\n2. **Supporting Context from the Quran:**\n   - The practice of fasting itself is established firmly in the Quran. For example, in Surah Al-Baqarah, it is stated:\n     - \"O believers, fasting is enjoined on you as it was on those before you, so that you might become righteous.\" (Quran 2:183)\n     - \"Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance...\" (Quran 2:185)\n     - These verses highlight the importance of fasting and set the tone for considering all aspects of this worship, including rest and sleep, to be part of the spiritual discipline.\n\n3. **Connection to Worship:**\n   - The function of sleep in the overall routine of a fasting person can be aligned with the concept that every action performed with the intention of pleasing Allah becomes worship. This is supported by many hadith, such as when the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) says that every action is judged by the intention behind it (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 1, Hadith 1).\n\n4. **Encouragement of Spiritual State:**\n   - The suggestion that sleep is also a form of worship during fasting aligns with the broader Islamic understanding that a believer’s life should be consistently oriented towards worship, whether in active prayer or in rest.\n\n### Summary of the Hadith's Relevance\n\nWhile the hadith \"The sleep of the fasting person is worship\" may have variations in authenticity reports among scholars, it encourages a holistic view of worship, where even natural actions, performed with the right intention, become acts of devotion. The Quranic verses promoting the value of fasting and the importance of intention support the idea that everything a fasting believer engages in—whether prayer, work, family time, or even sleep—can be included as acts of worship.\n\n### Citations from the Quran\n- **Fasting Decreed:** Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:183\n- **Month of Ramadan:** Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:185\n\nThese foundations and interpretations help foster a comprehensive understanding of worship during Ramadan that can encompass more than just overt practices of devotion, including one's rest and recovery during the fast."

        "question": "A Weak Narration About the Virtues of Ramadaan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth of Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh. He said: Chapter on the virtues of the month of Ramadhan if the report is saheeh. Then he said: ‘Ali ibn Hijr al-Sa’di told us, Yoosuf ibn Ziyad told us, Humam ibn Yahya told us, from ‘Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad’an, from Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyab, from Salman (may Allah be pleased with them) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed us on the last day of Sha’ban and said: “O people, there has come to you a great month, a blessed month, a month in which there is a night that is better than a thousand months. Allah has made fasting it obligatory and spending its nights in prayer a voluntary act. Whoever draws close (to Allah) during it by doing a good deed will be like one who did an obligatory deed in any other month, and the one who does an obligatory deed in it will be like one who did seventy obligatory deeds in any other month. It is the month of patience, and the reward of patience is Paradise. It is the month of helping others. It is a month in which the believer’s provision is increased. Whoever gives a fasting person food with which to break his fast will have his sins forgiven and he will be ransomed from the Fire, and he will have a reward like his without it detracting from his reward in the slightest.” They said: Not all of us can find something to give to the fasting person with which to break his fast. He said: “Allah will give this reward to the one who gives a fasting person a date or a drink of water or a sip of milk. It is a month the beginning of which is mercy, the middle of which is forgiveness and the end of which is ransom from the Fire. The one who reduces the burden for his slave will be forgiven by Allah, and He will ransom him from the Fire. So do a lot of four good deeds during it, two with which you will please your Lord and two which you cannot do without. As for the two good deeds with which you will please your Lord, they are bearing witness that there is no god except Allah, and seeking His forgiveness. As for those which you cannot do without, they are asking Allah for Paradise and seeking refuge with Him from Hell. Whoever feeds a fasting person until he is full, Allah will give him to drink from my Cistern, a drink after which he will not thirst again until he enters Paradise.” \nIts isnad (chain of narration) includes ‘Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad’an, who is da’eef (weak) because of his bad memory.

The Quran emphasizes its importance through various verses, recognizing it as a period of spiritual growth and devotion. \n\n#### Key Verses and Their Implications\n\n1. **Fasting Mandate**: \n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), Ayah 183 states: \n     > \"O believers, fasting is enjoined on you as it was on those before you, so that you might become righteous.\" \n     This verse highlights the requirement of fasting, drawing parallels between the followers of different faiths in their attempts to attain piety.\n\n2. **Guidance Through the Quran**: \n   - In the same chapter, Ayah 185 proclaims:\n     > \"Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance, and criterion (of falsehood and truth).\"\n     This underscores that Ramadan is not only a time for fasting but also the period when the Quran—the guiding scripture for Muslims—was revealed.\n\n3. **Ease and Exemptions**: \n   - Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 184 mentions:\n     > \"Fast a (fixed) number of days, but if someone is ill or is travelling (he should complete) the number of days (he had missed); and those who find it hard to fast should expiate by feeding a poor person.\"\n     This verse acknowledges the difficulties faced by individuals and allows for alternatives, ensuring that the practice of fasting is not a source of undue hardship.\n\n4. **Spiritual Nearness**: \n   - Ayah 186 from Surah Al-Baqarah states:\n     > \"When My devotees enquire of you about Me, I am near, and answer the call of every supplicant when he calls.\"\n     This verse conveys the concept that Ramadan is not only about fasting but also an opportunity for believers to draw nearer to God through supplication and intense spiritual activity.\n\nHistorically, the virtue of Ramadan has been attested to through both Quranic verses and Hadith, emphasizing themes of community, charity, and spiritual devotion. However, some narrations regarding specific rewards or virtues related to fasting during Ramadan may not be as strongly supported by authentic sources, potentially leading to weak narratives. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Quran itself serves as a comprehensive guide about Ramadan, emphasizing its role as a month of guidance, self-discipline, and community. While weak narrations may exist within certain traditions concerning the month’s virtues, core Quranic injunctions offer strong reinforcement of its significance in the Islamic faith.\n\n**References**:\n- Al-Baqarah (2:183-185, 186) in the Holy Quran."

        "question": "Authenticity of “Religion is How You Deal With Others”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is not a hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and there is no basis for it in the books of the Sunnah prophetic teachings). \nIt was mentioned by al-Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in the introduction to the fifth volume of Silsilat al-Ahadeeth al-Da’eefah, p.11. He said concerning it: There is no basis for this, not even among the fabricated ahadeeth! End quote. \nAl-Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about it and he said: \nThis is not a hadeeth, rather it is a saying of the people. End quote. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase \"Religion is how you deal with others\" reflects a profound principle in Islam concerning interpersonal relationships, ethics, and community cohesion. This concept is intimately tied to the teachings of the Quran, which emphasizes ethics, justice, compassion, and brotherhood among humans. Below, I will outline key Quranic verses that support this notion, along with their references.\n\n### 1. Interpersonal Relations and Brotherhood\nIslam places a great emphasis on the treatment of others and maintaining good relationships within the community. \n\n- **Surah Al-Hujurat (49:10-13):**  \n  \"The faithful are surely brothers; so restore friendship among your brothers, and fear God that you may be favoured. O you who believe, men should not laugh at other men, for it may be they are better than them; and women should not laugh at other women, for they may perhaps be better than them. Do not slander one another, nor give one another nicknames. After believing, it is bad to give (another) a bad name.\" (49:10-12)  \n  This verse highlights the need for compassion and respect among believers, underlying that one's value is determined by their character and integrity rather than social status or outward appearances.\n\n### 2. Encouragement to Forgive and Overlook\nA key aspect of decency in interactions is the ability to forgive and show patience in the face of wrongdoing.\n\n- **Surah Ali 'Imran (3:159):**  \n  \"It was through God's mercy that you dealt with them gently; for had you been stern and hard of heart they would surely have broken away from you. So pardon them and pray that forgiveness be theirs, and seek their counsel in all affairs.\" (3:159)  \n  This verse emphasizes the importance of gentleness and understanding when dealing with others, suggesting that kindness can lead to stronger bonds and unity within the community.\n\n### 3. Justice in Dealing with Others\nJustice is a fundamental principle that governs how individuals should interact with one another.\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:8):**  \n  \"O you who believe! Be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses in the name of Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives.\" (5:8)  \n  This verse indicates that justice should be upheld at all costs, reflecting that ethical dealings with others are paramount in Islamic teachings.\n\n### 4. Avoiding Suspicion and Backbiting\nThe Quran explicitly prohibits actions that harm interpersonal relations, such as suspicion, backbiting, and spreading rumors.\n\n- **Surah Al-Hujurat (49:11-12):**  \n  \"O you who believe, avoid most suspicions: Some suspicions are indeed sins. So do not pry into others' secrets and do not backbite.\" (49:12)  \n  This guidance aims to create a sense of trust and respect among individuals, discouraging behaviors that can lead to discord.\n\n### 5. The Importance of Unity\nUnity is a crucial element in Islamic teachings, which also correlates with how individuals relate to one another.\n\n- **Surah Ali 'Imran (3:103):**  \n  \"Hold on firmly together to the rope of God, and be not divided among yourselves, and remember the favors God bestowed on you when you were one another's foes and He reconciled your hearts.\" (3:103)  \n  The verse signifies the importance of unity and brotherhood, with the \"rope of God\" metaphorically representing the guidance of Islam that should bind the community.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe essence of the saying \"Religion is how you deal with others\" aligns with these teachings from the Quran, emphasizing that the foundation of faith is manifested in our ethics and interactions with others. Islam encourages compassion, forgiveness, justice, and unity, creating a framework for believers to cultivate positive relationships in their communities and with all of humanity. The cited verses provide a clear directive that how one treats others is a reflection of their faith and character, making this idea authentically representative of Islamic principles."

        "predicted_answer": "When it comes to understanding the chains of narration (isnad) in Islamic tradition, a good starting point is to explore the significance of narrations in Islamic scholarship, particularly in the context of Hadith collections. The process of preserving the teachings of Islam through reliable signs and authentication methods is essential for ensuring correctness in religious practice and belief.\n\n### Importance of Chains of Narration\n\nIn Islam, the credibility of any narrated saying or action of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) hinges on its chain of narrators (isnad). Each narrator in the chain must possess integrity (adalah) and a good memory (dabt) to be considered a reliable source. As mentioned in various Islamic scholarship, the proficiency in transmitting knowledge is crucial. The Quran itself emphasizes the necessity of knowledge and guidance through messengers, as seen in the following verses:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Qasas (28:43)**:\n   - *\"After We had destroyed the earlier generations, We gave Moses the Book as evidence for mankind, and a guidance and grace, so that they may remember.\"*\n   - This verse highlights that divine guidance was provided through credible means, signaling the importance of trustworthiness in narrating such guidance.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Qasas (28:46)**:\n   - *\"You were not present on the side of Mount Sinai when We called.\"*\n   - This verse points to the reality that no one witnessed certain events directly, a reminder that reliance upon trustworthy narrators is essential for conveying truth.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Qasas (28:51-52)**:\n   - *\"Those to whom We gave the Book before this do believe in it; and when it is read out to them, they say: 'We believe in it. It's the truth from our Lord.'\"*\n   - The transition of knowledge from previous prophets indicates the foundational role of authentic narratives.\n\n### Classic Resources for Learning Chains of Narration\n\n1. **Books of Hadith**: \n   - The six major Hadith collections (Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawood, Jami` at-Tirmidhi, Sunan an-Nasa'i, and Sunan Ibn Majah) are excellent places for learning about chains of narration. Each collection discusses the authenticity of narrators and their qualifications.\n   \n2. **Science of Hadith (Ilm al-Hadith)**: \n   - Texts dedicated to the science of Hadith, such as \"Nuzhat al-Nazir\" or \"Tadrib al-Rawi,\" outline the methods of authentication and evaluation of narrators' credibility.\n\n3. **Scholarly Works on Hadith and Isnad**: \n   - Works by scholars like Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (\"Fath al-Bari\"), Al-Nawawi (author of \"Al-Majmu karya Hadith\"), or Al-Dhahabi (\"Siyar A'lam al-Nubala\") provide insights into the intricacies of Hadith sciences including isnad methodologies.\n\n4. **Modern Resources**: \n   - Online platforms like \"Sunnah.com\" provide searchable databases of Hadith alongside their chains of narration, making it easier for students to trace and study these important aspects of Islamic teachings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the study of chains of narration is pivotal in Islamic scholarship as it ensures that the teachings of Islam are accurately transmitted and understood. Both the Quranic injunctions and the commitment of early scholars to preserving the integrity of these narrations form the foundation for the study and practice of Islam today. It encourages the pursuit of knowledge and discernment—a testament to the value Islam places on authenticity in both religious and secular endeavors."

        "question": "Soundness of the hadeeth Hadeeth “Sincerity is one of My secret blessings”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth is da’eef jiddan (very weak) or mawdoo’ (fabricated). \nIt was narrated by al-Qazweeni in his Musalsalat, as al-Iraqi said in Takhreej Ihya ‘Uloom al-Deen, 4/365, from the hadeeth of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him). But its isnad (chain of narrators) includes Ahmad ibn ‘Ata al-Hujaymi and ‘Abd al-Wahid ibn Zayd, both of whom are matrook (i.e., their hadeeth is not accepted). \nIt was also narrated by al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws, 3/187, from ‘Ali and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them). \nAl-Hafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari, 4/109, (it is) a wahin jiddan hadeeth (i.e., very flimsy)",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadeeth \"Sincerity is one of My secret blessings\" is reported in various forms in Islamic literature, and it emphasizes the significance of sincerity (ikhlas) in a person's belief and actions. Assessing the soundness of this particular hadith involves looking at the chain of transmission (isnad) and whether it is cited in reliable sources.\n\n1. **Background on Sincerity in Islam**: Sincerity is a major concept in Islam, emphasized throughout the Quran and Sunnah. It is the intention behind one's actions, which should be solely for Allah's pleasure. This theme is present in multiple Quranic verses.\n\n2. **Hadeeth References**: The exact wording of \"Sincerity is one of My secret blessings\" is not found in widely regarded hadith books like Sahih Bukhari or Sahih Muslim but is often attributed to other collections, such as those by al-Bayhaqi or al-Hakim, which increases the necessity of scrutinizing the integrity of these reports.\n\n### Quranic Verses Supporting Sincerity\n\n#### Surah Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112: The Sincerity)\n1. **Verse 1-4**: \n   - \"Say: 'He is Allah, the One. Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent.'\" (Al-Ikhlas 112:1-4)\n   - This surah emphasizes the pure and singular nature of Allah, which is inherently linked to sincerity in worship.\n\n#### Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2: The Cow)\n2. **Verse 264**: \n   - \"O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury as does one who spends his wealth only to be seen by the people and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. So his parable is like that of a smooth stone upon which is dust and is struck by a downpour, so it leaves it bare.\" (Al-Baqarah 2:264)\n   - This verse highlights that sincere actions should be free from seeking recognition.\n\n#### Surah Al-Hujurat (Chapter 49: The Rooms)\n3. **Verse 15**: \n   - \"Indeed, the believers are only those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and then doubted not but strove with their properties and their lives in the cause of Allah. It is those who are the truthful.\" (Al-Hujurat 49:15)\n   - True belief is accompanied by sincerity and effort in the cause of Allah.\n\n### Conclusion on Sincerity\nThe principle of sincerity is immensely valued in Islam, and it is supported by multiple verses in the Quran that underline the importance of having pure intentions when performing acts of worship. \n\n### Validity of the Hadeeth\nWith regard to the hadith itself, while the concept aligns with Quranic teachings and reflects a fundamental aspect of Islamic faith, it is essential to verify the specific chain of narrators from the collections that cite it. Scholars focus on hadith authenticity, and unless found in a reputable and verified collection, one should approach less-authentic reports with caution.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nWhile the precise wording of \"Sincerity is one of My secret blessings\" may not be found in the most authentic collections, the essence of the statement is deeply rooted in Islamic teachings. The importance of sincerity is recognized in both the Quran and the broader corpus of hadith literature, indicating that sincere actions are of paramount importance in a believer's life. \n\nIf you wish to explore the soundness of the specific hadeeth further, consulting a scholar specializing in hadith studies or the specific collections where the hadith is found would provide a deeper understanding and clarification."

        "question": "Fabricated Hadeeth",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This story has no \n    basis, and we could not find it after a lengthy search. \n\n    And Allah knows \n    best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### Fabricated Hadeeth in Islam\n\nIn Islam, Hadith refers to the recorded sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Understanding the authenticity of Hadith is crucial because fabricated Hadith can mislead believers and distort the teachings of Islam. The concept of fabricated Hadith is discussed throughout Islamic texts and teachings, and there are clear guidelines in the Qur'an regarding such deceptions.\n\n#### The Authenticity and Authority of the Message\n\nThe Qur'an itself offers a defense against accusations of fabrication. In Surah 46, Al-Ahqaf (The Wind-Curved Sandhills), it is stated:\n\n> \"Do they say: 'He has fabricated it?' Tell them: 'If I have fabricated it, you have no power to save me from God. He knows what you are busy with concerning this. He is sufficient as witness between you and me; yet He is forgiving, ever-merciful.'\"  \n> (Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46:8)\n\nThis verse illustrates that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) explicitly addresses the accusations against him, asserting that if he had fabricated the message, it would lead to God's judgment upon him. This reinforces the inviolability of the revelations he received.\n\n#### Warning Against Fabrication\n\nMoreover, the Qur'an warns against fabricating lies about God and His messages. In Surah 5, Al-Ma'idah (The Table Spread), we find:\n\n> \"The unbelievers fabricate lies of God, for many of them are devoid of sense.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:103)\n\nThis verse highlights that those who fabricate lies do so out of ignorance or denial of divine truth, underscoring the seriousness of misrepresenting God’s message.\n\n#### The Role of Witnesses and Truthfulness\n\nIn discussing justice and the importance of truth, the Qur'an emphasizes the necessity of integrity in matters of testimony. In the same Surah (Al-Ma'idah), it further states:\n\n> \"O you who believe, let two honest men among you be witness when you dictate your last will...\"  \n> (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:106)\n\nThis verse indicates that sincerity and honesty are paramount, establishing a framework for truthful transmission of both personal and prophetic messages, which is necessary to prevent the spread of fabricated narrations.\n\n#### The Historical Context of Accusations\n\nIn Surah 11, Hud, the Prophet Noah is confronted with similar accusations:\n\n> \"Do they say you have fabricated it? Tell them: 'If I have fabricated it, then mine is the guilt; but I am clear of what you are guilty.'\"  \n> (Surah Hud, 11:35)\n\nThis not only shows that earlier prophets faced similar challenges but also exemplifies how such defamations are often a reflection of the rejecters' own failings rather than the authenticity of the message.\n\n#### Consequences of Denial and Fabrication\n\nThe Qur'an warns against those who deny the truth:\n\n> \"When Our revelations are recited before him, he says: 'These are fables of long ago.'\"  \n> (Surah Al-Mutaffifin, 83:13)\n\nThe link between denial and the heart becoming rusted symbolizes the psychological consequences of rejecting revealed truth, warning that those who fabricate or deny divine messages ultimately harm their own spiritual state.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe issue of fabricated Hadith serves as a reminder of the need for authentication and vigilance among Muslims regarding the teachings of their faith. The Qur'an provides both a defense against accusations of fabrication and a warning against the dangers of dishonesty in faith matters. As such, Muslims are encouraged not only to seek authentic Hadith but also to maintain integrity in their understanding and propagation of Islamic teachings. \n\nFor further reading and a deep understanding of this topic, one should refer to established sources such as Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, which are renowned collections of Hadith adhering to rigorous standards for authenticity."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is meant by “the two Shaykhs” is al-Imam al-Bukhari and al-Imam Muslim (may Allah have mercy on them). \nAl-Bukhari is Muhammad ibn Isma’eel al-Bukhari (d. 256 AH). He wrote a book, Saheeh al-Bukhari, in which he compiled a number of saheeh ahadeeth (authentic prophetic traditions) from our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nMuslim is Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj al-Nisaboori (d. 261 AH). He is the author of Saheeh Muslim. These two books – Saheeh al-Bukaari and Saheeh Muslim – are the soundest books of ahadeeth from our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nIf it is said of a hadeeth (prophetic narration) that it was “narrated by the two Shaykhs”, what is meant is that it was narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim in their Saheehs. The same applies if it says “agreed upon,” i.e., al-Bukhari and Muslim both agreed on its narration. \nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in the introduction to Sharh Muslim (1/14): The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) are agreed that the soundest of books after the Holy Quran are al-Saheehayn, i.e., the two Saheehs of al-Bukhari and Muslim, and the ummah (global Muslim community) accepted that from them. The book of al-Bukhari is the sounder and more useful of the two. End quote. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase \"Narrated by the Two Shaykhs\" typically refers to a narration or hadith that is found in the collections of two of the most authoritative hadith scholars in Islam: Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim. These two scholars compiled their collections of hadith in rigorous ways, and their works are considered to be among the most authentic sources of information regarding the teachings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n### Meaning and Significance:\n\n1. **Authority and Authenticity**: \n   - When a hadith is prefaced with \"narrated by the two Shaykhs,\" it implies that the hadith is widely accepted in the Islamic tradition due to its presence in the collections of both Bukhari and Muslim. This signifies that the narration has undergone strict verification processes for authenticity.\n\n2. **Establishment of the Hadith**: \n   - This phrase assures that the hadith complies with the standards of authenticity established by these scholars, which include criteria like the reliability of the narrators, the continuation of the chain of narration, and the text’s consistency with established Islamic teachings.\n\n3. **Academic Standing**: \n   - It enhances the scholarly significance of the hadith, making it a foundational piece of evidence for Islamic rulings and teachings across various Islamic disciplines such as jurisprudence, ethics, and theology.\n\n### Examples:\n\nTo cite an example, a common hadith found in the sources of Bukhari and Muslim is the one regarding the importance of intention. It states, “Actions are judged by intentions, and everyone will get what was intended” (Bukhari, 1; Muslim, 1907). This hadith underlines the importance of the intention behind actions in Islam.\n\n### Related Verses of the Quran:\n\nWhile the specific phrase \"Narrated by the Two Shaykhs\" does not appear in the Quran, its intent can be linked to the value of authenticity and following the truth, as reflected in Islamic teachings:\n\n1. **Honesty and Truthfulness**:\n   - Surah Ash-Shu'ara (Chapter 26), Ayah 221-224 speaks about truth and the nature of those who mislead others:\n     > “Should I tell you on whom the devils descend? They come down to every mendacious sinner. Who listens to you (for spreading rumors); but most of them are liars. As for the poets, only those who go astray follow them.” (Quran 26:221-224)\n\n2. **Calling to Truth**:\n   - Surah Ash-Shuraa (Chapter 42), Ayah 15 emphasizes the call to the truth, which can be seen as a parallel to the transmission of authentic hadith:\n     > “Yet to that (law) you should call them, and be constant as commanded. Do not follow their passing whims, but say: 'I believe in whatever Scripture God has revealed'...” (Quran 42:15)\n\nThese verses collectively stress the importance of following authentic teachings, which closely ties into the concept of hadith being narrated by recognized authorities.\n\nIn summary, \"Narrated by the Two Shaykhs\" signifies the authenticity and reliability of narrations that are essential for understanding Islamic teachings. The emphasis on truth and following genuine guidance is mirrored in the Quran, which reinforces the significance of adhering to authentic sources in Islam."

        "predicted_answer": "The statement \"The happiness of the son of Adam (peace be upon him) depends on his being content with what Allah decrees\" emphasizes the essence of contentment in Islamic teachings, particularly as it relates to the concept of trust in Allah's wisdom and decrees. The foundation for understanding this principle can be drawn from various teachings in the Qur'an and Hadith.\n\n### Contentment in the Qur'an\n\n1. **Surah Hud (11:9-11)**:\n   - \"If We allow man to enjoy Our favours, and then take them away from him, he becomes despondent and ungrateful. If We let him taste Our favours after adversity, he says: 'Misfortune has left me,' and begins to brag and exult, except those who endure with patience and do the right, who will have pardon and a great reward.\"\n   - This verse illustrates how one's happiness is tied to patience and contentment with Allah's decree. Here, those who endure adversities and remain patient are promised a great reward.\n\n2. **Surah An-Nahl (16:53-54)**:\n   - \"Whatsoever the blessings you enjoy are surely from God, and when in trouble you turn to Him in supplication. Yet when He has delivered you from affliction, some of you ascribe companions to your Lord.\"\n   - This verse emphasizes recognizing that blessings are from Allah, reinforcing the need for gratitude and contentment with His decrees.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:116-119)**:\n   - This verse emphasizes accountability and the importance of honest adherence to faith and divine will. It outlines how being true to one’s faith leads to ultimate happiness.\n   - \"This will surely be happiness supreme.\" (5:119) speaks directly to the concept of happiness stemming from faith and adherence to divine guidance.\n\n4. **Surah Al-An'am (6:82-83)**:\n   - \"They alone have peace who believe and do not intermix belief with denial, and are guided on the right path.\"\n   - Here, peace and happiness are associated with the sincerity of faith and belief in Allah's wisdom.\n\n### Contentment in Hadith\n\nIn addition to the Qur'an, Hadith literature supports the idea that happiness is significantly linked with contentment. An often-cited Hadith related to contentment is:\n\n- **\"The strong man is not the one who overcomes others in wrestling; rather, the strong man is the one who controls himself when he is angry.\"** (Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6114)\n  - This Hadith signifies inner strength as the ability to remain content and patient in challenging situations.\n\nMoreover, another Hadith states:\n- **“Whoever is pleased with Allah as his Lord, Islam as his religion, and Muhammad as his Prophet has tasted the sweetness of faith.”** (Sahih Muslim)\n  - This Hadith connects happiness with satisfaction in faith and acceptance of Allah’s decree.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe essence of the statement on happiness being contingent upon contentment with Allah's decrees is deeply rooted in the teachings of Islam as revealed in the Qur'an and Hadith. Both sources highlight that true happiness and peace stem from patience, gratitude, and acceptance of whatever Allah wills. Individuals are encouraged to maintain faith in Allah's wisdom and be thankful for His blessings, regardless of their circumstances, as this leads to ultimate contentment and satisfaction in this life and the Hereafter."

But there is nothing in this hadeeth to suggest that \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that this \n    monk was the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), rather ‘Eesa \n    (peace be upon him) is in heaven; Allaah took him up and he will remain \n    there until the appointed time, then Allaah will send him back down and he \n    will support Islam at the end of time. \n\n    The story of how Salmaan came to Islam is a great story, full \n    of lessons and exhortations. We will let the questioner read the hadeeth in \n    full, so that he might benefit from it: \n\n    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas said: Salmaan \n    al-Faarisi told me his story from his own lips. He said: \n\n    I was a Persian man, one of the people of Isbahaan, from a \n    village thereof called Jayy. My father was the chieftain of his village, and \n    I was the dearest of Allaah’s creation to him. He loved me so much that he \n    kept me in his house near the fire, as girls are kept in. I strove hard in \n    the Magian religion until I became the keeper of the fire, which I tended \n    and did not let go out for a moment. My father had a huge garden, and he was \n    busy one day with some construction work, so he said: “O my son, I am too \n    busy with this building today, go and check my garden,” and he told me some \n    of the things he wanted done. I went out, heading towards his garden, and I \n    passed by one of the Christian churches, where I could hear their voices as \n    they were praying. I did not know anything about the people because my \n    father had kept me in his house. When I passed by and heard their voices, I \n    entered upon them to see what they were doing. When I saw them, I was \n    impressed with their prayer and I was attracted to their way. I said: By \n    Allaah, this is better than the religion that we follow. By Allaah, I did \n    not leave them until the sun set, and I forgot about my father’s garden and \n    did not go there. I said to them: Where did this religion originate? They \n    said: In Syria. Then I went back to my father, who had sent people out to \n    look for me, and I had distracted him from all his work. When I came to him, \n    he said: O my son, where were you? Did I not ask you to do what I asked? I \n    said: O my father, I passed by some people who were praying in a church of \n    theirs, and I was impressed with what I saw of their religion. By Allaah, I \n    stayed with them until the sun set. He said: O my son, there is nothing good \n    in that religion. Your religion and the religion of your forefathers is \n    better than that. I said: No, by Allaah, it is better than our religion. He \n    was afraid for me, and he put fetters on my legs and kept me in his house. I \n    sent word to the Christians saying: If any Christian merchants come to you \n    from Syria, tell me about them. He said: Some Christian merchants came to \n    them from Syria, and they told me about them. I said to them: When they have \n    completed their business and want to go back to their own country, tell me \n    about that. So when they wanted to go back to their own country, they told \n    me about that, and I threw off the irons from my legs and went out with \n    them, until I came to Syria. When I reached Syria, I said: Who is the best \n    person in this religion? They said: The bishop in the church.  So I went to \n    him and said: I like this religion, and I would like to stay with you and \n    serve you in your church and learn from you and pray with you. He said: Come \n    in. So I went in with him, but he was a bad man. He would command them and \n    exhort them to give charity, but he kept a great deal of it for himself and \n    did not give it to the poor; he had amassed seven chests of gold and silver. \n    I hated him deeply when I saw what he was doing, then he died and the \n    Christians gathered to bury him. I said to them: This was a bad man; he \n    commanded you and exhorted you to give charity, but when you brought it to \n    him he kept it for himself and did not give any of it to the poor. They \n    said: How do you know that? Show us where his treasure is. So I showed them \n    where it was and they brought out seven chests filled with gold and silver. \n    When they saw that they said: By Allaah, we will never bury him; then they \n    crucified him and pelted him with stones.  Then they brought another man and \n    appointed him in his place. Salmaan said: I have never seen a man who does \n    not offer the five daily prayers who was better than him; he shunned this \n    world and sought the Hereafter and no one strive harder than him night and \n    day. I loved him as I had never loved anyone before, and I stayed with him \n    for a while. Then when he was about to die, I said: O So and so, I was with \n    you and I loved you as I had never loved anyone before, and now the decree \n    of Allaah has come to you as you see; to whom do you advise me to go? What \n    do you command me to do? He said: O my son, by Allaah, I do not know of \n    anyone today who follows what I followed. The people are doomed; they have \n    changed and abandoned most of what they used to follow, except for a man in \n    Mosul. He is So and so, and he follows what I used to follow, so go and join \n    him. When he died and was buried, I went to the man in Mosul. I said to him: \n    O So and so, So and so advised me when he died to come to you, and he told \n    me that you follow the same as he followed. He said to me: Stay with me. So \n    I stayed with him, and I found him to be a good man who followed the same as \n    his companion had followed. But soon he died. When he was dying I said to \n    him: O So and so, So and so advised me to come to you and told me to join \n    you, but now there has come to you from Allaah what you see. To whom do you \n    advise me to go? What do you command me to do? He said: O my son, by Allaah \n    I do not know of anyone who follows what we used to follow except a man in \n    Nasayyibeen. He is So and so; go to him. When he died and was buried, I went \n    to the man in Nasayyibeen. I came to him and told him my story and what my \n    companion had told me to do. He said: Stay with me. So I stayed with him and \n    I found him to be a follower of the same way as his two companions, and I \n    stayed with a good man. By Allaah, soon death came upon him, and when he was \n    dying I said to him: O So and so, So and so advised me to go to So and so; \n    then So and so advised me to come to you. To whom do you advise me to go and \n    what do you command me to do? He said: O my son, by Allaah we do not know of \n    anyone left who follows our way and to whom I can tell you to go, except a \n    man in ‘Ammooriyyah. He follows something like what we follow. If you wish, \n    go to him, for he follows our way. When he died and was buried, I went to \n    the man in ‘Ammooriyyah and told him my story. He said: Stay with me. So I \n    stayed with a man who was following the same way as his companions. I earned \n    wealth until I had cows and sheep, then the decree of Allaah came to him. \n    When he was dying I said to him: O So and so, I was with So and so, and So \n    and so told me to go to So and so; then So and so told me to go to So and \n    so; then So and so told me to come to you. To whom do you advise me to go \n    and what do you command me to do? He said: O my son, by Allaah, I do not \n    know of anyone who follows our way to whom I can advise you to go. But there \n    has come the time of a Prophet, who will be sent with the religion of \n    Ibraaheem. He will appear in the land of the Arabs and will migrate to a \n    land between two harrahs (lave fields; land with black rocks), between which \n    there are palm trees. He will have characteristics that will not be hidden. \n    He will eat of what is given as a gift but he will not eat of what is given \n    as charity. Between his shoulder blades is the Seal of Prophethood. If you \n    can go to that land then do so. Then he died and was buried, and I stayed in \n    ‘Ammooriyyah as long as Allaah willed I should stay, then some merchants of \n    Kalb passed by me and I said to them: Will you take me to the land of the \n    Arabs and I will give you these cows and sheep of mine? They said: Yes. So I \n    gave them the cows and sheep, and they took me there, but when they brought \n    me to Waadi al-Qura they wronged me and sold me as a slave to a Jewish man. \n    When I was with him I saw the palm trees, and I hoped that this was the land \n    that my companion had described to me, but I was not sure. Whilst I was with \n    him, a cousin of his from Banu Qurayzah came to him from Madeenah, and he \n    sold me to him, and he took me to Madeenah. By Allaah, as soon as I saw it, \n    I recognized it from the description given to me by my companion.  I stayed \n    there, and Allaah sent His Messenger, who stayed in Makkah as long as he \n    stayed, and I did not hear anything about him because I was so busy with the \n    work of a slave. Then he migrated to Madeenah, and by Allaah, I was at the \n    top of a palm tree belonging to my master, doing some work on it, and my \n    master was sitting there. Then a cousin of his came and stood beside him, \n    and said: May Allaah kill Banu Qaylah! By Allaah, right now they are \n    gathering in Quba’ to welcome a man who has come from Makkah today, and they \n    say that he is a Prophet. When I heard that, I began to shiver so much that \n    I thought I would fall on top of my master. I came down from the tree and \n    started saying to that cousin of his: What are you saying, what are you \n    saying? My master got angry and he struck me with his fist and said: What \n    has it got to do with you? Go back to your work! I said: Nothing; I just \n    wanted to make sure of what he was saying. I had something that I had \n    collected, and when evening came, I went to the Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was in Quba’, and I \n    entered upon him and said to him: I have heard that you are a righteous man \n    and that you have companions who are strangers and are in need. This is \n    something that I have to give in charity, and I see that you are more in \n    need of it than anyone else. I brought it near to him and the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to his \n    companions: “Eat,” but he refrained from eating.  I said to myself: This is \n    one. Then I went away and collected some more. The Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) moved to Madeenah, then I came \n    to him and said: I see that you do not eat (food given in) charity; this is \n    a gift with which I wish to honour you. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate some of it and told his companions \n    to eat too. I said to myself: This is two. Then I came to the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was in \n    Baqee’ al-Gharqad, where he had attended the funeral of one of his \n    companions and he was wearing two shawls and was sitting among his \n    companions. I greeted him with salaam then I moved behind him, trying to \n    look at his back to see the Seal that my companion had described to me. When \n    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw \n    me going behind him, he realized that I was trying to find confirmation of \n    something that had been described to me, so he let his rida’ drop from his \n    back, and I saw the Seal and recognized it. Then I embraced him, kissing \n    (the Seal) and weeping, and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “Turn around.” So I turned \n    around and I told him my story as I have told it to you, O Ibn ‘Abbaas. The \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted \n    his companions to hear that. Then Salmaan was kept busy with the work of a \n    slave, until he had missed attending Badr and Uhud with the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said: Then the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to \n    me: “Draw up a contract of manumission, O Salmaan.” So I draw up a contract \n    of manumission with my master in return for three hundred palm trees which I \n    would plant for him, and forty uqiyahs. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to his companions: “Help your \n    brother.” So they helped me with the palm trees, one man gave thirty small \n    trees and another gave twenty, and another gave fifteen, and another gave \n    ten, i.e., each man gave according to what he had, until they had collected \n    three hundred small trees for me. Then the Messenger of Allaah  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “Go, O Salmaan, and dig the \n    holes where they are to be planted. When you have finished, come to me and I \n    will plant them with my own hand.” So I dug the holes for them, and my \n    companions helped me, then when I had finished, I came to him and told him. \n    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    came out with me and we started to bring the trees close and the Messenger \n    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) planted them with \n    his own hand. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Salmaan, not one \n    single tree among them died. So I had paid off the trees but there still \n    remained the money. A piece of gold the size of an egg was brought to the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from \n    one of his campaigns. He said: “What happened to the Persian who had a \n    contract of manumission?” I was summoned to him and he said: “Take this and \n    pay off what you owe, O Salmaan.” I said: How could this pay off everything \n    I owe, O Messenger of Allaah? He said: “Take it, and Allaah will help you to \n    pay off what you owe.” So I took it and weighed it for them, and by the One \n    in Whose hand is the soul of Salmaan, it was forty uqiyahs, so I paid them \n    their dues and I was set free. I was present with the Messenger of Allaah \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at al-Khandaq, and after \n    that I did not miss any major event with him. \n\n    Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (5/441). The scholars \n    of hadeeth said: Its isnaad is hasan. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The story of Salmaan al-Faarisi (may Allaah be pleased with him) and his journey to Islam is a remarkable example of seeking truth and divine guidance. Salmaan was originally from Persia and was raised in a Zoroastrian family. His early life was characterized by a longing for spiritual truth, which ultimately led him on a quest across several regions in search of the true religion.\n\n### Journey to Islam\n\n1. **Initial Quest for Truth**: Salmaan's quest for truth began when he became curious about Christianity after meeting a Christian priest. He was impressed by the priest's devotion and teachings, which led him to convert to Christianity. However, he was not fully satisfied and felt compelled to learn more.\n\n2. **Meeting Different Religious Figures**: As Salmaan continued his journey, he studied under various Christian scholars and traveled to different regions. He was advised to go to a particular city where he would find a prophet that would be sent in the future. His continuous pursuit of truth exemplified his sincere desire to understand and practice the right faith.\n\n3. **The Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him)**: Eventually, Salmaan learned about the coming of the last prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him), who would be sent to guide humanity. His heart was drawn towards him, and he set out to meet the Prophet in the city of Medina.\n\n4. **Embracing Islam**: Upon arriving in Medina, Salmaan met the Prophet Muhammad and was deeply moved by his teachings. He embraced Islam, thus completing his long and arduous journey for truth. His conversion is an outstanding reminder of how sincere searching for knowledge can lead one to Islam.\n\n### Relevant Quranic Verses\n\nSalmaan al-Faarisi's story resonates with the themes presented in the Quran regarding guidance and believing in the truth. For instance:\n\n- **Surah Al-Qasas 28:52-56** reflects the behavior of those who come to faith after seeking the truth, indicating their perseverance and the dual rewards they receive for their belief:\n\n  > \"Those to whom We gave the Book before this do believe in it; And when it is read out to them, they say: 'We believe in it. It is the truth from our Lord.' These will be given their recompense twice, for they persevered and repelled evil with good.\"  \n  (Al-Qasas 28:52-54)\n\n- Additionally, **Surah Ali 'Imran 3:82-86** showcases the importance of submitting fully to God's guidance and heeding the call to faith:\n\n  > \"Then any one who turns away will be a transgressor. Do they seek another way than God's?\"  \n  (Ali 'Imran 3:82)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSalmaan al-Faarisi's story is ultimately one of seeking and finding truth in the face of various challenges and misguidances. His journey from Zoroastrianism through Christianity and finally to Islam illustrates a profound commitment to discovering the correct path. His story reminds believers that genuine searching for faith is recognized and rewarded by Allah, echoing the Quranic principles of guidance, patience, and perseverance in the divine quest for truth."

Al-Najm said: This is not known. It was also narrated with the wording, “The most beloved of names to Allaah are those which describe one as a slave of Allaah or which are derived from the name Muhammad”, al-Suyooti said: I could not find any source for this hadeeth. End quote. \nIt says in al-Maqaasid al-Hasanah (p. 87): As for what is frequently said, “The best names are those which are derived from the name Muhammad or which describe one as a slave of Allaah”, I do not know it. End quote. \nAl-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The best names are those which describe one as a slave of Allaah or which are derived from the name Muhammad” – there is no basis for this, as has clearly been stated by al-Suyooti and others.

        "predicted_answer": "The question regarding the authenticity of the hadith stating that \"The best names are those which describe one as a slave of Allah or which are derived from the name Muhammad\" necessitates a careful consideration of the sources in Islamic tradition, particularly the Hadith and Quran.\n\n### Analysis of the Hadith\nWhile the hadith in question is often cited in discussions about naming conventions in Islam, the authenticity of specific sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) can vary. Many scholars in Islamic theology review the chains of narration (isnad) and the content (matn) to ascertain their reliability.\n\nThe particular hadith emphasizing the value of names describing servitude to Allah (such as \"Abdul Rahman,\" meaning \"servant of the Most Merciful\") and those derived from the name Muhammad (like \"Muhammad\" or \"Ahmad\") is often discussed among scholars, yet variations in its classification (e.g., hadith sahih, hasan, etc.) exist.\n\n### Quranic References\nTo support the principle of using meaningful names, Islamic teachings generally underscore the significance of names and avoid any that could lead to idolatry or be devoid of noble meanings.\n\n1. **Surah Al-A'raf (7:71-75)** underscores the importance of not attributing names without divine sanction, as illustrated in the story of Prophet Saleh and his people:  \n   > \"He replied: 'You have already been beset with punishment and the wrath of God. Why dispute with me about names invented by you and your ancestors for which no sanction was sent down?'\"  \n   *(Surah Al-A'raf, Ayah 71)*  \n\n2. **Surah Al-An’am (6:83-87)** reflects on the assignment of titles and the respect commanded by righteous individuals, pointing out the divine involvement in guiding reputable figures whose legacies continued through their names:  \n   > \"And We gave him Isaac and Jacob and guided them, as We had guided Noah before them, and of his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron.\"  \n   *(Surah Al-An'am, Ayah 84)*  \n\n3. Additionally, **Surah An-Najm (53:23-27)** warns against inventing names without divine authority, reinforcing the idea of using proper and respectful names:  \n   > \"These are only names which you and your fathers have invented. No authority was sent down by God for them.\"  \n   *(Surah An-Najm, Ayah 23)*  \n\n4. **Surah Muhammad (47:19)** emphasizes faithfulness and the importance of guidance:  \n   > \"Know then, therefore, there is no god but He, and ask forgiveness for your sins and those of believing men and women.\"  \n   *(Surah Muhammad, Ayah 19)*  \n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the hadith about the best names referring to servitude to Allah and names related to Muhammad offers a strong cultural and ethical guideline within Islam, its classification may be debated regarding authenticity. Nonetheless, the Quran encourages naming with proper intention and acknowledges the significance of using noble names, which aligns with the spirit of the mentioned hadith.\n\nIn summary, although the exact authenticity of the hadith can be questioned, the principles of naming in Islamic tradition find solid grounding in the values reflected in the Quran, advocating for meaningful, respectful, and divinely sanctioned names."

        "question": "The hadeeth: “Conceal the engagement and proclaim the marriage”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws, where it says: “Announce the marriage and conceal the engagement.” This is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth which was classed as such by al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (2494), and in Da’eef al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, 922. \nBut the first part of it is saheeh with the word “proclaim.”  \nAhmad narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Proclaim marriages.” This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1993. \nProclaiming marriages, in the sense of announcing them and publicizing them, is obligatory according to the majority of scholars, indeed it is one of the conditions of a marriage being valid, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage except with a wali (guardian) and two witnesses of good character.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi from ‘Imraan and ‘Aa’ishah; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7557. \nSome scholars regarded it as mustahabb to conceal the engagement for fear of hasad (destructive envy) which could lead to trouble between the man and the family of his fiancée, as stated in Haashiyat al-‘Adawi ‘ala Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel, 3/167. \nThis is supported by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Seek help in meeting your needs by keeping quiet, for everyone who is blessed is envied.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 943. \nThis does not apply only to engagement, rather a person should not show openly the blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon him to one who will envy him for that. \nWith regard to holding engagement parties, this is something that many people do, and there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allaah. But it should be noted that we must adhere to the limits set by sharee’ah in these parties, so there should be no free mixing of men and women, or use of musical instruments apart from the daff, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) allowed use of the daff in wedding parties. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadeeth \"Conceal the engagement and proclaim the marriage\" emphasizes the importance of keeping the engagement private while making the marriage announcement public. In Islamic tradition, this practice is rooted in both the Qur'an and the teachings of Prophetic tradition.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Secrecy of Engagement**: The concept of keeping an engagement private can be linked to the need for privacy in relationships before the marriage is officially acknowledged. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:235) states, \"There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself\" (Quran 2:235). This emphasizes that although proposals can be made discreetly, the actual marriage should be announced to ensure it holds social recognition and legitimacy.\n\n2. **Announcement of Marriage**: The idea of publicly proclaiming marriage comes from the broader teachings in Islam about transparency and the establishment of family relations within the community. Publicly announcing a marriage serves to protect the rights of both parties and helps to cultivate trust. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:231), it notes, \"When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term, do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably,\" which implies that marriage should happen with a sense of community acknowledgment.\n\n3. **Importance of Honor**: Surah Al-Ahzab (33:49) further discusses the obligations of marriage, saying, \"O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' of them.\" This highlights the importance of honor and respect in the process of marriage, fostering an environment where the rights and future of both individuals are protected and celebrated.\n\n4. **Communal Harmony**: Announcing marriage helps to prevent misunderstandings and protects both parties from accusations of dishonor or secrecy. Surah Al-Ahzab (33:54) emphasizes, \"God is watchful of everything,\" indicating that public acknowledgment of marriage helps to maintain honesty and integrity in relationships, reflecting the broader values of accountability in Islam.\n\nIn conclusion, the hadeeth \"Conceal the engagement and proclaim the marriage\" aligns with Islamic teachings that encourage the safeguarding of personal intentions and the promotion of communal ties through the public declaration of marriage. These practices support the development of family and kinship within a socially responsible framework, fostering a sense of community solidarity and mutual respect."

End quote. \n\n    So the hadeeth is not proven. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Hadith you referred to, \"The believer is between five hardships,\" is not a specific quote found in the Qur'an, but it speaks to several themes found in Islamic theology regarding trials, tribulations, and the nature of belief. The idea is that believers will face various difficulties and challenges as a part of their faith journey. \n\nIn addressing the notion of hardships and how they relate to faith, the following Qur'anic verses provide support:\n\n1. **Trials and perseverance in faith**:\n   - Allah mentions that believers can expect to face trials as a test of their faith. Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), Ayah 214: \n     > \"Do you think you will enter Paradise without such trials as came to those who passed away before you? They encountered suffering and adversity and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed with him cried out: 'When will the help of Allah come?' Indeed, the help of Allah is near.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:214)\n\n2. **Ease accompanies hardship**:\n   - In Surah Ash-Sharh (Chapter 94), Allah reassures believers that after hardship, there will be ease. \n     > \"So verily, with the hardship, there is relief. Verily, with the hardship, there is relief.\" (Surah Ash-Sharh 94:6-7). This verse emphasizes that true hardship is temporary and is often followed by relief.\n\n3. **Endurance and the righteous**:\n   - Surah Al-Mujadila (Chapter 58), Ayah 4 to 8 indicates that those who face challenges with trust in God will be rewarded, and that God is aware of all actions. \n     > \"On the day when Allah will resurrect them all together, He will inform them of what they did. Allah has kept count of it, while they have forgotten it.\" (Surah Al-Mujadila 58:6)\n\n4. **Striving in the path of God**:\n   - The importance of striving through difficulties is underscored in Surah Al-Ma'idah (Chapter 5), Ayah 35: \n     > \"O you who have believed, fear Allah and seek the means of nearness to Him and strive in His cause that you may succeed.\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:35)\n\n5. **The consequences of apostasy**:\n   - The risk of abandoning faith in times of hardship is emphasized in Surah Al-Ma'idah (Chapter 5), Ayah 54, where believers are warned that turning away from faith has serious consequences:\n     > \"O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion - Allah will bring forth for His people whom He will love and who will love Him.\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:54)\n\nIn conclusion, the challenges faced by believers emphasize the need for resilience, patience, and faith in God's plan. These themes resonate across various verses in the Qur'an, which provide both warnings and encouragement to those who find themselves tested in their faith."

        "question": "Is the hadeeth “The Fire was stoked for a thousand years until it turned red…” saheeh?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tirmidhi: ‘Abbaas al-Doori \n    al-Baghdaadi told us, Yahya ibn Abi Bukayr told us, Shareek told us, \n    narrating from ‘Aasim who is Ibn Bahdalah, from Abu Saalih from Abu Hurayrah \n    from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: \n    “The Fire was stoked for a thousand years until it turned red, then it was \n    stoked for a thousand years until it turned white, then it was stoked for a \n    thousand years until it turned black, and it is intensely black.” \n\n    And he said: Suwayd told us, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak told \n    us, from Shareek, from ‘Aasim, from Abu Saalih or another man, from Abu \n    Hurayrah, a similar report, but he did not attribute it to the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Abu ‘Eesa al-Tirmidhi said: the \n    hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah concerning this is more likely to be mawqoof (i.e., \n    to have an interruption in the chain of narration); I do not know of anyone \n    who attributed it to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) apart from Yahya ibn Abi Bukayr (who narrated it) from Shareek. \n\n    Al-Albaani said: This Yahya is thiqah (trustworthy) and is \n    accepted in al-Saheehayn, so it is not possible to criticize him, \n    especially since Shareek, who is the son of ‘Abd-Allaah al-Nakha’i al-Qaadi, \n    who has a bad memory, appears in the isnaad and this is the weak point of \n    hadeeth. This is supported by his confusion; sometimes he attributes it to \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and sometimes \n    he does not, and sometimes he is definite in his isnaad and says, “from Abu \n    Saalih”, and sometimes he is uncertain and says, “from Abu Saalih or another \n    man.” These are signs that he is imprecise and does not have a good memory. \n    So no wonder the scholars who had knowledge of men’s biographies classed him \n    as da’eef (weak). So the hadeeth is da’eef, whether it is attributed to the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or not. \n\n    See al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 3/470.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you referred to, which states, \"The Fire was stoked for a thousand years until it turned red...\" is classified as weak (da'if) according to many scholars of hadith. This classification implies insufficient authenticity based on the chains of transmission (isnad) or the integrity of the narrators involved. \n\n**Assessment of the Hadith:**\n1. **Source Authenticity**: The authenticity of any hadith is determined through strict standards that assess the reliability of its chain of narrators and the text itself. The mentioned hadith about the length of time the Fire (Hell) was stoked is often referenced in discussions but is not found in the major authentic collections (Sahih al-Bukhari or Sahih Muslim), which raises concerns about its validity.\n2. **Scholarly Opinions**: Many contemporary scholars of hadith have deemed this specific narration as weak due to its chain of narrators and potential discrepancies. Scholars such as Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani in his works have highlighted problems with specific narrators or the chain's continuity.\n\n**Supporting Context from the Quran**:\nWhile the hadith itself may not be reliably authentic, the Quran does provide vivid descriptions of Hellfire and its nature. Several verses convey information about punishment and the characteristics of Hell. Here are some relevant verses:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:71-75)**: \n   - “Consider the fire that you strike (and get by friction). Have you raised its tree, or We have raised it? We have made it as a reminder and convenience for the needy. So glorify your Lord, the most supreme.”\n   - This verse emphasizes the existence and nature of fire, which serves as a reminder of God's power and the reality of punishment.\n\n2. **Surah Ad-Dukhan (44:45-49)**: \n   - “(It will be said), 'Seize him and drag him into the depths of Hell.'”\n   - The imagery provided here enhances the gravity of Hell and indicates severe punishment in the afterlife.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Humazah (104:6-9)**: \n   - “It is the fire kindled by God which penetrates the hearts.”\n   - This verse underscores the intensity of Hellfire and the psychological and physical torment it inflicts.\n\n4. **Surah Al-Furqan (25:11-15)**: \n   - “When (Hell) appears to them from a distance they will hear it raging and roaring.”\n   - This reflects the overwhelming and fearsome nature of the Fire, reinforcing the consequences of disbelief and immorality.\n\nThese Quranic references outline the concept of Hell in Islam and illustrate the severe consequences of one's actions in life. They serve as a reminder for believers regarding accountability and the reality of the afterlife.\n\nIn conclusion, while the hadith about the Fire being stoked for a thousand years is considered weak, the Quran itself provides ample descriptions of Hell and its punishments, emphasizing the gravity of one's actions and the reality of divine retribution."

        "question": "“His knowledge of my situation is sufficient asking”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.These words were narrated \n    from Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) when his people threw him into the fire \n    with the catapult. He was met by Jibreel who asked him: “O Ibraaheem, do you \n    have any need?” Ibraaheem said, “Of you, no.” Jibreel said: “Then ask your \n    Lord.” Ibraaheem said: “His knowledge of my situation is sufficient \n    asking.” \n\n    Al-Baghawi mentioned this in his tafseer (commentary) on \n    Soorat al-Anbiya’, and indicated that it is da’eef (weak).  (5/327).  \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa \n    (1/183): \n\n    The report which says that when Ibraaheem was thrown into the \n    fire Jibreel said to him, “Ask (of your Lord)” and he said, “His knowledge \n    of my situation is sufficient asking” has no sound isnaad, and it is false. \n    Rather what is proven in al-Saheeh from Ibn 'Abbaas is that he said, \n    “Hasbi Allaah wa ni’m al-wakeel (Allaah is sufficient for me and He \n    is the best dispoer of affairs).”  \nWith regard to Ibraaheem \n    asking of his Lord, this is mentioned in the Qur’aan in more than one place, \n    so how could he have said, “His knowledge of my situation is sufficient \n    asking” ?? \n\n    Ibn Taymiyah also said (8/358):   \n\n    With regard to his saying “His knowledge of my situation is \n    sufficient asking”, this is false and goes against what Allaah tells us \n    about Ibraaheem and other Prophets and how they prayed to Allaah and asked \n    of Him. It also goes against what Allaah has commanded His slaves to ask Him \n    for, which is the good things of this world and the Hereafter, such as when \n    they said (interpretation of the meaning): \n\"Our \n    Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that \n    which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!\"\n[al-Baqarah 2:201]\nAnd making du’aa’ to \n    Allaah and asking of Him and putting one's trust in Him are all acts of \n    worship that are prescribed in Islam. \n\n    This hadeeth was also mentioned by al-Albaani in \n    al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (21). He said: It is one of the Israa’eeliyyaat \n    (reports from Jewish sources) and has no basis in any report that can be \n    attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). \n    Some of the Sufis adopted this meaning when they said, “Your asking of Him \n    is an accusation of Him.” \n\n    Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  \n\n    This is serious misguidance. Would the Prophets accuse their \n    Lord by asking Him for various things? Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) said:  \n“O our Lord! I have made some of my \n    offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the \n    Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As‑Salaat \n    (Iqaamat‑as‑Salat). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, \n    and (O Allaah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.\n\n    O our Lord! Certainly, You know what we conceal and what \n    we reveal. Nothing on the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allaah…”\n\n    [Ibraaheem 14:37-38 – interpretation of the meaning]\n\n    Many du’aa’ of the Prophets are mentioned in the Qur’aan and \n    Sunnah.  \n\n    The one who says such a thing seems to be unaware of the fact \n    that du’aa’, which means beseeching and turning to Allaah, is a great act of \n    worship, regardless of what need one is asking to be met. Hence the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Du’aa’ is worship.” \n    Then he recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My \n    Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your \n    (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and \n    do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter \n    Hell in humiliation!”\n [Ghaafir 40:60]\n    \n    That is because in du’aa’ the slave demonstrates his complete \n    submission to his Lord and his need for Him and his dependence upon Him. \n    Whoever turns away from du’aa’ turns away from worship of Allaah. No wonder \n    there are so many ahaadeeth which enjoin and encourage du’aa’, and the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does \n    not make du’aa’ to Allaah, He will be angry with him.” \n\n    This was narrated by al-Haakim, who classed it as saheeh, and \n    al-Dhahabi agreed with him. It is a hasan hadeeth.  \n\n    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: “Ask Allaah for everything, even a lace for your shoes, because \n    if Allaah does not make it easy for you to obtain it, you will not be bale \n    to obtain it.” Narrated by Ibn al-Sunni (no. 349) with a hasan isnaad, and \n    it has corroborating reports in the hadeeth of Anas which was narrated by \n    al-Tirmidhi (4/292 and others). \nIn conclusion, this \n    report which is attributed to Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) could not have \n    been uttered by any Muslim who understands the importance of du’aa’ in \n    Islam, so how can it have been said by the one who called us Muslims? \n\n    Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah, 1/29.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase \"His knowledge of my situation is sufficient asking\" reflects the concept of placing trust and reliance on God's knowledge and wisdom, especially in times of hardship or uncertainty. In Islam, there is a strong emphasis on acknowledging God's omniscience and His ability to understand and manage our circumstances far better than we can.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Trust in God's Knowledge**: \n   The Quran emphasizes that God is fully aware of the affairs of His creation. Believers are encouraged to place their faith in His understanding, as His knowledge encompasses all things, including the unseen.\n\n2. **Seeking Help and Relief**:\n   In moments of distress or need, instead of seeking assistance from others, turning to God and asking for His help is considered the best course of action.\n\n### Relevant Verses\n\n1. **Surah Yusuf (Joseph) 12:86**:\n   In this verse, Prophet Jacob (Yaqub) expresses deep trust in God's knowledge regarding the fate of his son Joseph. He says:\n   - \"I cry my plaint and grief to God, and know from God what you do not know.\" \n   This illustrates that he relies on God’s understanding of his situation despite the lack of physical evidence about Joseph’s whereabouts (Surah Yusuf, Ayah 86).\n\n2. **Surah Ash-Shuraa (The Consultation) 42:27-31**:\n   Allah explains His wisdom in controlling the abundance or scarcity of provisions, stating:\n   - \"If God were to give in abundance to His creatures they would fill the earth with oppression. So He gives according to measure as He will.\"\n   This verse signifies that God's knowledge informs how He allocates resources, ensuring justice and fairness, which is part of His greater plan and wisdom (Surah Ash-Shuraa, Ayah 27).\n\n3. **Surah Yusuf (Joseph) 12:50**:\n   In this context, Joseph acknowledges God's omniscience:\n   - \"My Lord is cognisant of their guile.\" \n   This shows Joseph’s firm belief that God understands the true nature of situations and people, reinforcing the idea that God’s knowledge is sufficient for trust (Surah Yusuf, Ayah 50).\n\n4. **Surah Yusuf (Joseph) 12:54**:\n   After revealing his identity to his brothers, Joseph displays a deep trust in God's plan and wisdom by saying:\n   - \"God does not surely let the wiles of those who betray ever succeed.\"\n   This further emphasizes the reliability of God's knowledge over his own assessments (Surah Yusuf, Ayah 54).\n\n5. **Surah Al-Qasas (The Stories) 28:24**:\n   Prophet Moses, while in distress, invokes God's help:\n   - \"My Lord, I have need of whatever good you send me.\" \n   This plea exemplifies the act of turning to God in times of need, trusting His awareness of one’s situation (Surah Al-Qasas, Ayah 24).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the phrase \"His knowledge of my situation is sufficient asking\" resonates deeply within the teachings of Islam. It encourages believers to trust in God's perfect knowledge and wisdom over their circumstances, especially in times of trial. By reflecting on the stories and lessons from the Quran, such as those from Surah Yusuf and Al-Qasas, one can find comfort in the idea that God's insight into our lives and needs is beyond our human comprehension."

        "question": "The hadeeth: “Allaah loves those who are persistent in making du’aa’”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There are ahaadeeth which \n    are in circulation among people and are often-repeated, and some people may \n    be keen to spread them because they are unaware that they are not saheeh and \n    cannot be attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him). The Muslim should be cautious and should not attribute anything \n    to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) except that \n    which he knows is proven to be soundly narrated from him. \nThis hadeeth – “Allaah loves those who are stubborn in \n    making du’aa’” – is not saheeh and cannot be attributed to the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\nIt was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Du’aa’ \n    (2/795), by al-‘Aqeeli in al-Du’afa’ al-Kabeer (4/452), by Ibn ‘Adiyy \n    in al-Kaamil, 7/2621).\nAl-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhees: It was \n    narrated only by Yoosuf ibn al-Safar from al-Awzaa’i, and he is matrook \n    (rejected). Al-Albaani said in al-Irwa’ (3/143); It is mawdoo’ \n    (fabricated).\nAnd he stated in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah \n    (2/96-637) that it is baatil (false).\nThis is with regard to whether this wording can be \n    attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\nWith regard to the meaning:\nWhat is meant by being persistent in du’aa’ is repeating \n    it. It is proven that this was what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) did. Muslim (1794) narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah \n    be pleased with him) said: When the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) made du’aa’ he would repeat it three times, and when he \n    asked he would ask three times.\nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\nThis shows that it is mustahabb to repeat du’aa’s three \n    times. The phrase “and when he asked” refers to du’aa’ as well, but the idea \n    is repeated in different words by way of emphasis.\nAl-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Chapter \n    on repeating du’aa’s.” Then he mentioned the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may \n    Allaah be pleased with her), that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) made du’aa’ to Allaah and repeated the du’aa’, when the \n    Jew Labeed ibn al-A’sam put a spell on him. ‘Aa’ishah said: Until one day, \n    or one night, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) made du’aa’, then he made du’aa’, then he made du’aa’… Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari, 6391; Muslim, 2189.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in \n    al-Daa’ wa’l-Dawa’ (p. 25): One of the most beneficial of remedies is \n    persisting in du’aa’.\nIn Kitaab al-Zuhd by Imam Ahmad (305) it is \n    narrated from Qataadah: Mawraq said: I can find no other likeness for the \n    believer except that of a man who is at sea, clinging onto a piece of wood, \n    and saying, “O Lord, O Lord,” that Allaah might save him.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The concept of persistence in making du’aa (supplication) in Islam is an important theme found within the teachings of the Quran and the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The hadith that states, “Allah loves those who are persistent in making du’aa’” underscores the importance of prayer and sincerity in supplication. Here, I will elaborate on this concept while providing supporting verses from the Quran.\n\n### The Importance of Du’aa (Supplication)\n\n1. **Connection to Allah**:\n   Being persistent in du’aa is a means of establishing a connection with Allah. Allah invites believers to call upon Him, promising that He will respond to their supplications. This is highlighted in the Quran:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:186)**: “And when My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me.” This verse emphasizes that Allah is attentive and responsive to those who earnestly seek Him.\n\n2. **Patience and Perseverance**:\n   Persistence in du’aa reflects a believer's patience and their unwavering faith in Allah's mercy and power. The Quran encourages believers to seek help through patience and prayer:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:153)**: \"O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient.\" This verse indicates that prayer is a source of strength during trials and that Allah is present with those who show perseverance.\n\n3. **Rewarding the Persistent**:\n   This attribute of being persistent is praised by Allah, and such individuals are promised rewards both in this life and the Hereafter:\n   - **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:22)**: \"You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their clan.\" This verse emphasizes loyalty to faith and the rewards of those who remain steadfast in their devotion to Allah.\n\n4. **Spending and Supplicating**:\n   The act of making du’aa is often connected with charitable actions, showcasing an individual's commitment to serving Allah. The Quran prompts believers to spend in the way of Allah:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:261)**: \"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like that of a seed of grain that sprouts into seven ears; in every ear there are a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies (His reward) for whom He wills.\" This metaphor illustrates how Allah rewards those who engage in righteous acts including sincere supplication.\n\n5. **The Promise of Allah**:\n   Furthermore, Allah assures the believers of His mercy and the acceptance of their prayers:\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:54)**: “O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion - Allah will bring forth for the people He will love and who will love Him, [who are] gentle with the believers, mighty against the disbelievers.\" This reinforces the notion that Allah favors those who consistently strive in their faith, including through persistent supplication.\n\nIn conclusion, the act of making du’aa is crucial in Islam, symbolizing a believer's dependence on Allah and showcasing their devotion. Persistence in supplication reflects patience, dedication, and a deep-seated faith in Allah’s mercy and response. The above verses from the Quran illustrate this principle, affirming that Allah is attentive to the calls of those who earnestly seek Him."

He is the Most Merciful and Most Merciful.\"\n     - **59:23**: \"He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Most Holy, the Source of Peace, the Bestower of Security...”\n     - **59:24**: \"He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor, the Fashioner. To Him belong the best names...\"\n\n3. **The Themes of the Ayahs**:\n   - **Self-reflection**: The verses encourage believers to consider their actions and their balance between worldly affairs and spiritual duties.\n   - **Remembrance of Allah**: There’s a strong emphasis on remembering Allah, highlighting that neglecting His remembrance leads to self-neglect and misguidance.\n   - **Consequences of Actions**: The verses point toward the eternal consequences and the stark difference between the inhabitants of Paradise and Hellfire.\n\n### Summary\nThe last verses of Surah Al-Hashr (Ayahs 18-24) encourage self-reflection and mindfulness of Allah. Reciting these verses, according to the Hadith, offers protection from Allah, emphasizing their spiritual significance. Engaging with these verses can enhance one's faith and commitment to righteousness, encouraging believers to live aware of their purpose and accountability in this life. \n\nIn essence, these teachings highlight the importance of balancing material pursuits with spiritual responsibilities, leading to a holistic approach to worship and accountability."

        "question": "Soundness of the Hadeeth “Whoever persists in saying the first takbeer at the beginning of Fajr prayer for forty days…”?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    In Shu’ab \n    al-Eeman by al-Bayhaqi there is a marfoo’ hadeeth (report) narrated from \n    Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) according to which the \n    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Fajr \n    and ‘Isha in congregation and does not miss one rak’ah, he will be recorded \n    as being free from two things: free from the Fire and free from \n    hypocrisy.” (Shu’ab al-Eeman, 3/62). \n\n    It says in \n    al-‘Ilal al-Mutanahiyah: This hadeeth is not saheeh (authentic) and its \n    narrators are not known apart from Bakr ibn Ahmad narrating from Ya’qoob ibn \n    Tahiyyah, both of whose condition is unknown. (1/432).  \n\n    But a \n    different version was narrated in Sunan al-Tirmithi, where it says: “Whoever \n    prays to Allah for forty days in congregation, catching up with the first \n    takbeer, he will be recorded as being free from two things: free from the \n    Fire and free from hypocrisy.” (al-Tirmithi no. 241; classed as da’eef by \n    al-Tirmithi but as hasan/sound by al-Albani). \n\n    This \n    hadeeth was also classed as da’eef by a number of earlier scholars, who \n    stated that it is mursal (chain does not reach the Companions), but it was \n    classed as hasan by some of the later scholars. See Talkhees al-Habeer, \n    2/27. \n\n    The \n    hadeeth is not limited to Fajr prayer only, rather the reward mentioned in \n    the hadeeth is connected to being present for the opening takbeer of all the \n    five daily prayers. \n\n    \n    Undoubtedly being keen to catch up with the opening takbeer for this period \n    of time is an indication of the strength of a person’s religious \n    commitment. \n\n    So long as \n    the hadeeth can be interpreted in a sound manner, there is the hope that the \n    one who is keen to do what is mentioned therein will attain this great \n    virtue. The least that he will attain by means of this keenness is training \n    himself to regularly observe this important rite of Islam. \n\n    We ask \n    Allah to write for us and for you freedom from hypocrisy and from the Fire, \n    for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Responsive.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you are referring to states, “Whoever persists in saying the first takbeer at the beginning of Fajr prayer for forty days, he will receive the ultimate reward.” This hadith is often discussed in the context of Islamic practice, especially concerning the significance of praying in congregation and the rewards associated with consistent acts of worship.\n\n### Soundness of the Hadith\n\nThe evaluation of this hadith's soundness must consider its chains of transmission (sanad) and the reliability of the narrators. Generally, scholars categorize hadith into several classifications: Sahih (authentic), Hasan (good), Da’if (weak), and others. The specific classification of this hadith can vary based on the sources consulted. \n\n1. **Scholarly Consensus**: Various scholars dispute the hadith's authenticity, with many citing it as weak due to questionable narrators in its chain. For instance, some scholars point out that this hadith is not found in the major hadith collections like Sahih al-Bukhari or Sahih Muslim, which typically include only the strongest narrations.\n\n2. **Evidence of Practice**: Regardless of its authenticity, the principle emphasized in the hadith aligns with the broader teachings of Islam regarding the importance of prayer, particularly in congregational settings. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) stressed the significance of performing prayers with the community. \n\n### The Importance of Prayer\n\nThe Quran indeed emphasizes prayer as a key aspect of worship. Here are relevant verses:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:43)**: \"And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship].\" This verse emphasizes the communal aspect of prayer and worship, aligning well with the message of the hadith about consistently attending the Fajr prayer.\n\n2. **Surah Fussilat (41:49-53)**: Here, it addresses human behavior in times of distress and ease. The verses remind believers to remain steadfast and grateful in their worship, which is mirrored by the concept of persisting in prayer.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Fajr (89:1-3)**: “By the dawn, and by the ten nights.” This underscores the significance of the Fajr prayer, primarily situated in the time of dawn, highlighting its special virtues.\n\n4. **Surah Al-Ghafir (40:55)**: “So persevere; the promise of God is true; and seek forgiveness for your sins, and chant the praises of your Lord evening and morning.” This indicates the importance of worshipping God consistently and seeking His forgiveness.\n\nThe broader teachings of Islam reinforce the idea that consistent prayer, especially collectively, holds great merit, reflecting the spiritual integrity and righteousness expected from a Muslim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while the hadith about the first takbeer at Fajr may have issues with its chain of narrators or overall soundness, the principles it embodies coincide with the fundamental teachings of Islam regarding community and consistency in prayer. The prioritized practice of prayer, as evidenced through the Quranic verses mentioned, remains central to Islamic belief and practice. Therefore, while one may question the hadith's authenticity, the underlying lesson about community worship and the importance of prayer is crucial and well-supported within Islamic teachings."

        "question": "Weak Narration Concerning the prohibition of Helping to Kill a Muslim",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:  \n\n    This hadeeth was \n    narrated by Ibn Majah (2620) and al-‘Aqeeli in al-Du’afa (457) and \n    al-Bayhaqi in al-Sunan (8/22). It is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth which is not \n    soundly narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him). Imam Ahmad said: This hadeeth is not saheeh. \n\n    Indeed, Abu Hatim \n    ruled it to be mawdoo’ (fabricated), and al-Thahabi agreed with him. Ibn \n    al-Jawzi narrated it in al-Mawdoo’at (2/104). Ibn Hibban said: This is a \n    mawdoo’ (fabricated) hadeeth which has no basis. \n\n    Ibn Hajar and \n    al-Munthiri said: (This is) a very weak hadeeth. Al-Zayla’i said: it is a \n    weak (da’eef) hadeeth. \n\n    Al-Albani \n    mentioned it in Da’eef Sunan Ibn Majah and said: (it is) very weak. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    Even though this \n    hadeeth is weak, there is no doubt that helping to kill a Muslim unlawfully \n    is a major sin. \n\n    Al-‘Izz ibn ‘Abd \n    al-Salam (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Qawa’id: \n\n    If you want to \n    know the difference between a minor sin and a major sin, then compare the \n    consequences of the sin with the consequences of a major sin as stated in \n    the texts. If it is less than the least consequences of a major sin, then it \n    is a minor sin. If it is equal to or greater than the least consequences of \n    a major sin, then it is also a major sin. Whoever insults the Lord, may He \n    be glorified, or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), \n    or mocks the Messengers, or disbelieves in one of them, or throws filth at \n    the Ka’bah, or throws the Mus-haf (copy of the Quran)  into the garbage – \n    these are major sins, even though the sharee’ah does not state clearly that \n    they are major sins. Similarly, if a person holds down a chaste woman for \n    another to commit zina (adultery) with her, or holds down a Muslim for him \n    to kill him, the evil consequences of these acts are undoubtedly greater \n    than the consequences of consuming the wealth of an orphan, even though that \n    is also a major sin. Similarly if a person guides the kuffar (non-Muslims) \n    to the weak points of the Muslims, even though he knows that they will \n    destroy the Muslims as a result of his help and will take their women and \n    children captive, and plunder their wealth, then this is more serious than \n    his running away from the battle field with no excuse, even though that is a \n    major sin. Similarly if he tells a lie about a person for which he knows \n    that person will be killed, then it is a major sin, but telling a lie which \n    will result in a date being taken away from him, is not a major sin.”  \n\n    Helping a kafir to \n    kill a Muslim may constitute kufr (disbelief) in some cases. The scholars \n    mentioned things that nullify a person’s Islam, one of which is supporting \n    the mushrikeen (polytheists) and helping them against the Muslims. See \n    question no. \n    \n    33691. \n\n    Thirdly: \n\n    It is not \n    permissible for anyone to take the matter of attributing hadeeth to the \n    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) lightly. He (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever tells lies about me, it is \n    not like telling lies about anyone else. Whoever tells lies about me \n    deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1291; \n    Muslim, 4. \n\n    And he (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever narrates a hadeeth from me \n    which is known to be false, he is one of the liars.” Narrated by Muslim in \n    the introduction to his Saheeh. \n\n    And al-Nawawi \n    said: \n\n    [This hadeeth has \n    been narrated in two versions, one of which says al-kathibayn (the two liars \n    – dual form) and the more well-known version which says al-kathibeen (the \n    liars – plural).] Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: The version which we have says \n    al-kathibeen (plural) and Abu Na’eem al-Asbahani narrated it in his book \n    al-Mustakhraj ‘ala Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Samurah, where it says \n    al-kathibayn, in the dual form. Some of the imams said that the word yura \n    [translated above as “known to be” as yara [meaning “knowing (himself).” Or \n    it could mean “thinking [that it is false].” In this case the hadeeth means \n    that the person becomes a sinner only when he himself knows or thinks that \n    what he is narrating from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) is a lie. But if he did not know or think that it was a lie, then there \n    is no sin on him if he narrated it, even if others think that it is false, \n    or know that to be the case.  But what we may conclude from this hadeeth is \n    that lying is strongly condemned, and that whoever thinks that what he is \n    narrating is most likely false, but still narrates it, is a liar. How can he \n    not be a liar when he is narrating something that did not happen? \n\n    If a person does \n    not have sufficient knowledge to be able to distinguish between a saheeh \n    (authentic) hadeeth and a da’eef (weak) one, then he should ask the scholars \n    who are specialized in this field, and refer to the comments of the imams \n    and scholars that are compiled in books, in accordance with the words of \n    Allah (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “So ask of those who know the Scripture, if you know not.” [16:43].",
        "predicted_answer": "The topic of the prohibition of assisting in the killing of a Muslim is taken seriously in Islam, emphasizing the sanctity of life, especially the life of a fellow believer. The relevant verses highlight this principle and provide clarity on the consequences of such actions.\n\n1. **Prohibition of Killing a Believer**: The Quran explicitly states that it is not permissible for a believer to take the life of another believer intentionally. Surah An-Nisa (4:92-93) makes this clear:\n   - \"It is not for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake; and he who kills a believer by mistake should free a believing slave and pay blood-money to his family unless they forego it as an act of charity. If he belonged to a community hostile to you but was himself a believer, then a believing slave should be freed. In case he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, then give blood-money to his family and free a believing slave. But he who has no means should fast for two months continuously; this is a means of atonement prescribed by God. And God is Knowing and Wise.\"\n   - **(Surah An-Nisa, 4:92-93)**\n\n2. **Consequences for Killing a Believer Intentionally**: The severity of intentionally killing a believer is further emphasized in the same chapter:\n   - \"And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and the wrath and curse of God are upon him, and a great punishment is prepared for him.\"\n   - **(Surah An-Nisa, 4:93)**\n\n3. **Mutual Assistance in Righteous Acts**: Moreover, the Quran emphasizes the importance of helping one another in good deeds and righteousness while discouraging actions that lead to aggression or crime. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2) states:\n   - \"O you who have believed, do not violate the sanctity of the rites of Allah or of the sacred month or the sacrificial animals or the garlanded ones, and do not let the hatred of a people deter you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Severe in punishment.\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:2)**\n\n4. **The Islamic Perspective on Violence Among Muslims**: The overarching theme in these verses is the prohibition of violence and killing among Muslims, emphasizing that all lives are sacred. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:32) reflects this principle:\n   - \"Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely...\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:32)**\n\n5. **Encouragement of Peace**: Additionally, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:173), it mentions that necessity can lead to actions that would otherwise be prohibited, emphasizing God's understanding and mercy over strict enforcement:\n   - \"Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah...\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:173)**\n\nFrom these verses, it is evident that Islam strictly prohibits killing a believer and assisting in such acts. The teachings underline the sanctity of human life, promoting justice, peaceful coexistence, and righteousness among individuals.\n\nIn summary, the prohibition of assisting in the killing of a Muslim is rooted in the Quran's teachings, underscoring justice and the grave consequences of taking innocent life. The encouragement of mutual support in goodness, alongside the prohibition of acts of aggression, further encapsulates the intended moral framework within Islamic teachings."

        "question": "The Hadeeth “There is no Mahdi except ‘Eesa” is not Saheeh",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This hadeeth was narrated by Ibn Majah in his Sunan (4039). \n\n    Almost all the muhadditheen (hadeeth scholars) are agreed \n    that this hadeeth is da’eef (weak).” \n\n    It was classed as da’eef by al-Bayhaqi, al-Hakim, Shaykh \n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in Manhaj al-Sunnah (8/256), and Ibn al-Qayyim in \n    al-Manar al-Muneef (p.148). \n\n    Al-Thahabi said in Meezan al-I’tidal (3/535): it is a munkar \n    (rejected) report. \n\n    Al-Qari said in Mirqat al-Mafateeh (10/183): it is da’eef \n    according to the consensus of the muhadditheen. \n\n    It was mentioned by al-Shawkani in al-Qawaa’id al-Majmoo’ah, \n    127. He said: al-San’ani said: (it is) mawdoo’ (fabricated). \n\n    Al-Albani said in Silsilat al-Ahadeeth al-Da’eefah (77): It \n    is munkar. \n\n    Even if this hadeeth were saheeh – but it is not saheeh – the \n    meaning would be that there is no one who is perfectly guided (mahdi) or \n    protected from sin and error except ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him). \n    This was stated by al-Qurtubi, Ibn al-Qayyim and Ibn Katheer. \n\n    This does not contradict the fact that the Mahdi will emerge \n    at the end of time and that he will join forces with ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace \n    be upon him), and ‘Eesa will pray behind him in congregation. \n\n    We have already stated in the answer to question no. \n    \n    \n    1252 the evidence showing that the Mahdi \n    will emerge at the end of time with the attributes that the Prophet (peace \n    and blessings of Allah be upon him) described.

Al-Mawsoo’ah \n    fi Ahadeeth al-Mahdi al-Da’eefah wa’l-Mawdoo’ah by al-Bastawi, p. 94-104.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith stating \"There is no Mahdi except ‘Eesa\" is often contested regarding its authenticity. However, to delve into the topic thoroughly, let’s examine certain aspects of Islamic eschatology and evidence from the Qur'an to understand the role of Jesus (Eesa) and the Mahdi.\n\n### Concept of the Mahdi and Jesus in Islam\n\n1. **The Mahdi**:\n   - The Mahdi is traditionally seen as a messianic figure who appears before the Day of Judgment to restore justice and lead the Muslim community. While the Qur'an does not explicitly mention Mahdi, various hadith literature provides insights and attributes to this figure.\n\n2. **Jesus (Eesa)**:\n   - In Islamic belief, Jesus is considered one of the great prophets of Islam, but he is not viewed as the son of God as per Christian beliefs. Instead, he is regarded as a messenger who performed miracles and conveyed God's message. \n\n### Evidence from Hadith and Qur'an\n\n- **Role of Jesus in Eschatology**:\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:75)** states: “The Christ, son of Mary, was but an apostle... and many apostles had (come and) gone before him.” This verse reinforces the understanding that Jesus is indeed an apostle and not divine. The Qur'an consistently emphasizes the oneness of God and the prophethood role of Jesus (Al-Ma'idah 5:75).\n\n- **Jesus’s Return**:\n   - In Islamic eschatology, Jesus is expected to return before the Day of Judgment. His return is well-documented in various hadith collections, which assert that he will play a pivotal role in the defeat of false messianic figures (like the Dajjal or Antichrist).\n\n- **Evidences Regarding Mahdi in Hadiths**: \n   - Numerous hadiths speak of the Mahdi as a significant figure who will lead the Muslim community. For instance, Sayyid al-Khoei mentions various resourced hadiths concerning the Mahdi being from the progeny of Prophet Muhammad, further supported by sayings attributed to the Prophet.\n\n#### Important Verses Regarding Jesus and Oneness of God\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:171)** cautions against extreme beliefs regarding Jesus: \"O people of the Book, do not be fanatical in your faith, and say nothing but the truth about God. The Messiah who is Jesus, son of Mary, was only an apostle of God, and a command of His which He sent to Mary, as a mercy from Him.\"\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:116)** encapsulates the affirmation of Jesus’s prophethood, where God queries Jesus on what his followers said about him, suggesting his return and role at the end of times: \"And [beware the Day] when God will say, 'O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides God'?\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe assertion that \"there is no Mahdi except 'Eesa\" may reflect a specific interpretation rather than universal belief in Islamic traditions. Islamic eschatology presents both figures – the Mahdi and Jesus – fulfilling distinct roles. The Mahdi is expected as a leader of the community to restore justice, while Jesus is prophesied to return as a sign of the end times who will confirm the truth of Islamic faith.\n\nIt is important to approach hadith literature with caution and refer back to the Qur'an, as many beliefs in Islam derive their primary legitimacy from the Qur'anic text. As such, dialogues surrounding the figures of Jesus and the Mahdi should adhere closely to the teachings and verses of the Qur'an and verified hadith. \n\nEach of the Qur'anic verses mentioned highlights the role of Jesus within the framework of Islamic belief without contradicting the central tenets of Tawhid (the oneness of God), which stands at the heart of Islam."

        "question": "Islam Began as Something Strange",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This hadeeth was narrated by Muslim (145) from Abu Hurayrah \n    (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam began as something strange and \n    will revert to being strange as it began, so give glad tidings to the \n    strangers.”\n\n    Al-Sindi said in Hashiyat Ibn Majah:\n\n    “Strange” refers to the small number of its adherents. The \n    basic meaning of ghareeb (a stranger) is being far from one's homeland. “And \n    will revert to being strange” refers to the small number of those who will \n    adhere to its teachings even though its followers are many. “So give glad \n    tidings to the strangers” means those who follow its commands. “Tooba (glad \n    tidings)” has been interpreted as meaning Paradise or a great tree in \n    Paradise. This shows that supporting Islam and following its commands may \n    require leaving one's homeland and being patient in bearing the difficulties \n    of being a stranger, as was the case in the beginning.\n\n    In Sharh Saheeh Muslim, Al-Nawawi quoted al-Qadi ‘Iyad as \n    saying concerning the meaning of this hadeeth:\n\n    “Islam began among a few individuals, then it spread and \n    prevailed, then it will reduce in numbers until there are only a few left, \n    as it was in the beginning.”\n\n    It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 2/170:\n\n    The meaning of this hadeeth is that Islam began as something \n    strange, when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) called people to Islam, but no one responded except a few here and \n    there. At that time it was something strange because its people were like \n    strangers amongst others and they were few in number and weak, in contrast \n    to the great numbers and strength of their enemies who persecuted the \n    Muslims. Then some of them migrated to Abyssinia, fleeing for the sake of \n    their religion from tribulation and to save themselves from persecution and \n    oppression, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) migrated at Allah’s command to Madeenah, after suffering intense \n    persecution and in the hope that Allah would give him people to support him \n    in his call and support Islam. Allah fulfilled his hopes, granted victory to \n    his troops and supported His slave. \n\n    The Islamic state was established and Islam spread, with the \n    help of Allah, throughout the land; Allah made the word of kufr (disbelief) \n    lowest and the word of Allah is (always) uppermost, for Allah is Almighty, \n    All-Wise, and honour, power and glory belong to Allah, and to His Messenger \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and to the believers [cf \n    al-Munafiqoon 63:8]. This continued for a long time, then division and \n    dissent spread among the Muslims and weakness and failure increased \n    gradually, until Islam once again became something strange as it was in the \n    beginning. But this is not because of their small numbers, because at that \n    time they will be many, rather it is because they do not adhere to their \n    religion or cling to the Book of their Lord and the teachings of the \n    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), apart from \n    those whom Allah wills. So they become distracted and turn to competing in \n    worldly matters, like those who came before them, and they fight amongst \n    themselves for leadership. So the enemies of Islam found a way in and they \n    colonized their lands, humiliated their people and treated them badly. This \n    is the way in which Islam returned to being strange as it was in the \n    beginning.\n\n    A number of scholars – including Shaykh Muhammad Rasheed Rida \n    – thought that this hadeeth gives glad tidings of a second victory of Islam \n    after it becomes something strange again. They base this on the metaphor \n    used by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said, \n    “… will revert to being strange as it began.” So just as following the \n    initial strangeness and alienation the Muslims were victorious and Islam \n    spread, this will happen again after the second period of strangeness and \n    alienation.\n\n    This view is more likely to be correct, and is supported by \n    what is proven in the ahadeeth (reports) about the Mahdi and the descent of \n    ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) at the end of time, when Islam will spread and the \n    Muslims will be victorious, and kufr and the kafirs (non-Muslims) will be \n    defeated.\n\n    And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings \n    and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.",
        "predicted_answer": "The statement \"Islam began as something strange\" is rooted in the perception of Islam at its inception and is supported by various teachings found in the Qur'an. Here, we will explore this idea along with relevant verses from the Qur’an to provide a deeper understanding of the context.\n\n### Introduction to the Concept of Strange Beginnings\n\nIslam, as a belief system, was regarded as alien or unusual by many of the people in the Arabian Peninsula at the time of its advent. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) faced a great deal of opposition and hostility, primarily from the Quraysh tribe in Mecca. The new message he brought challenged deeply entrenched social, religious, and economic norms. \n\n### The Concept of Strangeness\n\n1. **Emphasis on Belief over Tradition**: The Qur'an frequently underscores the importance of monotheism and ethical conduct, contrasting these with the idolatrous practices prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia, which often included animism and the worship of multiple deities. This contrast made Islam initially appear strange. \n\n   - **Surah Al-Kafirun (Chapter 109, Ayah 1-6)**:\n     - **Translation**: \"Say: 'O you disbelievers, I do not worship what you worship. Nor do you worship what I worship. And I will not worship what you have been worshiping. Nor will you worship what I worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.'\"\n     - This verse highlights the clear distinction between the practices of the early Muslims and those of the disbelievers, a clear sign of strangeness to the latter.\n\n2. **Challenges and Opposition**: The Qur’an acknowledges the plight of its followers who face hostility and rejection. The strangeness of their beliefs drew ire and resulted in persecution.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (Chapter 5, Ayah 3)**:\n     - **Translation**: \"Today, the disbelievers have despaired of defeating your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you and completed My favor upon you and have chosen for you Islam as religion...\"\n     - This verse reassures the believers that the disbelievers have lost hope against Islam, emphasizing the transformation that had begun despite apparent strangeness.\n\n3. **The Fate of Early Muslims**: The early Muslims faced exile, torture, and societal ostracism, reinforcing the concept that their faith was seen as strange and unacceptable.\n\n4. **Rejection of Falsehoods**: The rejection of paganism and the promotion of a single, all-powerful God were radical at the time, leading Muslims to be viewed as outsiders.\n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2, Ayah 142-145)**:\n     - **Translation**: \"The foolish among the people will say, 'What has turned them away from their Qiblah which they used to face?' Say: 'To Allah belongs the east and the west. He guides whom He wills to a straight path.'\"\n     - This address of the Qiblah issue showcases the struggle and strangeness experienced by the believers as they shift their focus of worship.\n\n5. **Recognition of the Prophet's Unique Mission**: The Qur’an encourages the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to remain steadfast in the face of ridicule, stressing that the truth may appear strange to those who do not understand it.\n\n   - **Surah Ali 'Imran (Chapter 3, Ayah 67)**:\n     - **Translation**: \"Neither was Abraham a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim. And he was not of the polytheists.\"\n     - This verse emphasizes the continuity of monotheism and the strangeness of the Islamic faith relative to other established religions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the Qur'an embodies numerous themes illustrating the early strangeness of Islam, both in its theological assertions and the societal reactions it encountered. Verses from Surah Al-Kafirun, Al-Ma'idah, Al-Baqarah, and others reflect the initial challenges faced by early Muslims and the context in which their beliefs were regarded as strange. This narrative of strangeness highlights the resilience of faith against adversity, emphasizing that the very qualities that made Islam seem foreign or unconventional were central to its ultimate establishment and growth."

        "question": "A Fabricated Hadeeth About Advice Given to ‘Ali",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This \n    hadeeth is false and fabricated (mawdoo’). \n\n    The \n    scholars of the Standing Committee said concerning this hadeeth: \n\n    This \n    hadeeth has no basis, rather it is one of the fabricated reports and lies \n    made up by some of the Shi’ah, as has been pointed out by the imams (leading \n    scholars) of hadeeth. \n\n    Fatawa \n    al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 4/462, 463. \n\n    Shaykh \n    Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked \n    about this and he said: \n\n    This \n    hadeeth which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) gave this advice to ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) \n    is a lie that was fabricated against the Prophet (peace and blessings of \n    Allah be upon him).

        "predicted_answer": "To address your inquiry regarding a fabricated Hadeeth about advice given to ‘Ali and the context within Islamic teachings, it is crucial to highlight the importance of ensuring authenticity in religious texts. The authenticity of a Hadeeth can be critically important for those who seek guidance and knowledge about Islamic principles.\n\n### Fabrication of Hadeeth\n\nThe issue of fabricated Hadeeth is an important topic in Islamic scholarship. A Hadeeth is regarded as fabricated if it has no authentic chain of transmission or if it contradicts established teachings of Islam found in the Quran or authentic Sunnah. The Quran explicitly warns against the distortion of truth, and this can extend to fabricated sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad or his companions, such as ‘Ali.\n\n### Relevant Quranic Context\n\n1. **Warning Against Deception**: Surah Al 'Imran (3:71) emphasizes the importance of not mixing falsehood with truth. It states:\n   > “O people of the Book, why do you mix the false with the true, and hide the truth knowingly?” (Quran 3:71).\n\n   This verse prompts believers to be vigilant against the manipulation of information, including Hadeeth.\n\n2. **Responsibility of Scholars**: The Quran further elaborates on the role of those knowledgeable in the divine law. Surah Al 'Imran (3:78) warns against misrepresenting God’s words:\n   > “Among them is a section which distorts in reading the Scripture... and they lie about God, and knowingly.” (Quran 3:78).\n\n   Here, it indicates that misrepresentation is not only a matter of importance but a serious transgression against God and the community of believers.\n\n3. **Accountability**: Surah Al 'Imran (3:161-165) discusses accountability for falsehood, signifying that a prophet cannot mislead. It states:\n   > “It is not for a prophet to be false; and whoever is false will indeed bring his falsehood with him on the Day of Reckoning…” (Quran 3:161).\n\n   This reinforces the seriousness of adhering to truth in religious discourse and the consequences of spreading falsehoods.\n\n4. **Covenant with the Prophets**: Surah Al 'Imran (3:81) describes a covenant made with prophets concerning truthfulness and acknowledgment of divine guidance:\n   > “Remember when God covenanted the prophets… 'If after I have given you the Law...there comes an apostle to you who confirms the truth already with you, you will surely believe him and help him;' and asked: 'Do you accept and agree to the terms of My covenant?'” (Quran 3:81).\n\n   This verse highlights the expected fidelity of prophets to God's message, which extends to their historical followers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of fabricated Hadeeth attributed to figures such as ‘Ali serves as a reminder of the obligation upon Muslims to strive for authenticity in religious teachings. The verses from Surah Al 'Imran stress the significance of maintaining truth, recognizing the consequences of deception, and the role of scholars in educating the community about authenticated teachings. Adherents are encouraged to seek knowledge from trustworthy sources, ensuring that their understanding and practice of Islam remain aligned with the Quran and authentic Sunnah."

        "question": "Soundness of the Narration About Fifteen Punishments for One Who Neglects Prayer",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe hadeeth, “Whoever neglects prayer, Allah will send fifteen punishments upon him, six in this world, three when he is dying, three in the grave and three when he emerges from the grave…” is a fabricated (mawdoo’) hadeeth which is falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nConcerning this hadeeth, Sh. Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in the magazine al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah (22/329): With regard to the hadeeth which the author of this pamphlet attributes to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the punishment of the one who does not pray, and which says that fifteen punishments will be sent upon him, etc., this is one of the fabricated ahadeeth (reports) that are falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as was stated by the scholars (may Allah have mercy on him) such as al-Hafiz al-Dhahabi in Lisan al-Meezan, and al-Hafiz ibn Hajar and others. \nSimilarly the Standing Committee issued a fatwa, no. 8689, declaring this hadeeth to be false, as it says in Fatawa al-Lajnah, 4/468. Among the things mentioned in this fatwa which it is worth quoting here are: \nWhat has been narrated from Allah and from His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the punishment of the one who does not pray is sufficient. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, as‑salah (the formal prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.”\n[al-Nisa 4:103] \nAnd Allah says of the people of Hell (interpretation of the meaning): \n“‘What has caused you to enter Hell?’\nThey will say: ‘We were not of those who used to offer the salah (prayers).’”\n[al-Muddaththir 74:42-43]\nAnd He mentioned among their attributes the fact that they did not pray.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives up prayer is a kafir (disbeliever).” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasai, 431; Ibn Majah, 1079. Classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2113. And there are other verses and ahadeeth (narrations) which speak of giving up the prayer, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described it as kufr (disbelief).\nSee also question no.  2182.\nAl-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth is mawdoo’ (fabricated) and falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is not permissible to propagate it unless it is accompanied by a statement that it is fabricated, so that the people will have a clear understanding about it.\nFatawa al-Shaykh published by the Daw’ah center in ‘Anayzah, 1/6\nWe ask Allah to make you steadfast in your keenness to call your brothers and advise them, but you have to make it clear to everyone who is keen to do good for the people and to warn them against evil that it must be done in accordance with that which is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and that there is sufficient material in the saheeh reports that we have no need for the da’eef (weak) material.\nWe ask Allah to grant you success and to guide those whom you call and all the Muslims to follow the straight path.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The soundness of the narration regarding the fifteen punishments for neglecting prayer in Islam is a topic that involves assessing both the narrations found in Hadith literature and the implications of Quranic verses related to the importance of prayer.\n\n### Importance of Prayer in Islam\n\n1. **Commandment to Perform Prayer**: The Quran emphasizes the importance of the obligatory prayer (Salah) as one of the core practices of Islam. In Surah An-Nisa (4:101-103), it mentions that there is no sin in shortening prayers under certain conditions but emphasizes that prayer is a duty that must be performed:\n   - **Surah An-Nisa 4:101-103**: “When you travel in the land, there is no sin if you curtail your service of prayer if you fear the unbelievers may harass you... But when you have security, perform your prayer fully... And remember Allah.”\n   - This highlights both the necessity of prayer and the conditions in which it might be modified.\n\n2. **Punishments for Neglecting Prayer**: Several Hadith narrations emphasize severe consequences for neglecting the prayer. However, these narrations must be critically examined, and while some are considered strong by scholars, others may be weak or subject to interpretation. For instance, some narrations speak of spiritual and physical consequences for neglecting prayer, such as loss of blessings or even punishment in the grave.\n\n3. **Dangers of Hypocrisy**: Surah Al-Tawbah (9:66-70) mentions the consequences for those who turn away from faith, drawing a connection to the hypocrites who do not perform their prayers sincerely. \n   - **Surah At-Tawbah 9:66-70**: “...If We pardon a section of you, We shall punish the other for being guilty...the hypocrites are indeed transgressors...God has reserved for hypocrites...the fire of Hell…”\n\n### Evaluating the Narration of Fifteen Punishments\n\nWhile the Quran discusses the consequences for neglecting prayer in various contexts, the specific narration attributing fifteen distinct punishments is not directly sourced from the Quran but rather from Hadith sources. Scholars interpret these narrations in the light of Quranic teachings. It's essential to note that:\n\n- **Context Matters**: The context in which prayers are neglected matters—whether intentionally or due to forgetfulness or circumstances beyond control.\n- **Repentance and Forgiveness**: Many Quranic verses highlight the importance of repentance. For example, in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:39-43), it reassures believers about God's forgiveness for those who repent.\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:39-43**: “...those who repent after a crime and reform, shall be forgiven by God...”\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe validity of the narration regarding the fifteen punishments associated with neglecting prayer hinges on its sources and the broader understanding of related Quranic injunctions and principles. The Quran emphasizes the gravity of prayer with potential spiritual consequences for neglecting it, but specifics on punishments are often detailed in Hadith literature and can vary in their acceptance among scholars.\n\nIt is critical for Muslims to maintain regular prayers, as highlighted in the Quran, and to understand both the spiritual implications and the communal responsibilities tied to fulfilling this pillar of Islam. As with all matters of faith, understanding should come from a balance of Quranic verses and authenticated Hadith, approached with scholarly guidance."

        "question": "The hadeeth, “I ask You by the glory from Your Throne”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth mentioned was narrated by al-Hakim and was quoted by al-Hafiz and al-Mundhiri in al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb. He said, It was narrated only by ‘Amir ibn Khadash al-Nisapuri. He said: our shaykh, al-Hafiz Abu’l-Hasan said: he was a narrator of munkar (rejected) reports. He was the only one who narrated it from ‘Umar ibn Haroon al-Balkhi, who is matrook and mutahham (i.e., his hadeeths are rejected), and only Ibn Mahdi praised him. \nHence it is known that this hadeeth is da’eef (weak) from the point of view of its isnad (chain of narrators). \nMoreover, the saheeh ahadeeth (authentic narrations) indicate that it is not allowed to recite Quran when prostrating, so the hadeeth is also weak from the point of view of its text. It is not permissible to act upon it because it is not saheeh (sound) and because it contradicts the saheeh ahadeeth. \nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the phrase \"I ask You by the glory from Your Throne\" generally expresses a deep invocation of God’s majesty and power. When someone invokes God by His attributes, particularly His glory (or greatness), it signifies a humble request for assistance or mercy.\n\n### The Significance of Invoking God's Glory:\n\n1. **Recognition of God's Supreme Authority**:\n   - By invoking God's glory, a believer acknowledges that God is the ultimate authority over all creation, as echoed in several Quranic verses that emphasize His majesty and omnipotence. For instance, Surah 21:22 states, \"Had there been gods apart from God, both (the heavens and the earth) would have been despoiled. Much too glorious is God, the Lord of the mighty throne, for things they assert!\" (Surah Al-Anbya, ayah 22).\n\n2. **Emphasis on Worship and Fear of God**:\n   - When one invokes God by recognizing His might and glory, it is also a call for humility and submission to His will. Surah 39:3 illustrates this concept: \"Remember that devotion is exclusively for God.\" (Surah Az-Zumar, ayah 3). This indicates the importance of directing worship and requests solely to God, who is all-powerful and transcendent.\n\n3. **Understanding Mercy and Forgiveness**:\n   - Invoking God's glory is also linked to seeking His forgiveness and mercy. The acknowledgment of His attributes plays a crucial role in the supplicant's reliance on God's compassion. Surah 25:70 states, \"Except for those who repent, believe and do righteousness. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.\" (Surah Al-Furqan, ayah 70).\n\n### Related Quranic Verses Supporting the Theme:\n\n1. **God's Omnipotence and Glory**:\n   - \"His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He is the Creator, the Maker, and the Fashioner.\" (Surah Al-Hadid, ayah 2).\n   - \"He created the heavens and the earth with precision.\" (Surah Az-Zumar, ayah 5).\n\n2. **Invocation and Acceptance of Prayer**:\n   - \"To call on Him is true. For those they invoke other than Him do not answer them at all, except like a man who stretches his hands towards the water that it reach his mouth...\" (Surah Ar-Ra'd, ayah 14).\n\n3. **Call to Faith and Recognition of God’s Greatness**:\n   - \"And ask: 'Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?' (They will) say: 'Allah.'\" (Surah Al-An'am, ayah 14).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn summary, invoking God by His glory, particularly by referencing His throne, serves multiple purposes in a believer's life: it is a form of worship, an acknowledgment of God's supreme power, an appeal for His mercy, and an expression of humility. This invocation underlines the importance of recognizing God’s attributes in the life of a Muslim and reinforces the connection between glorifying God and seeking His guidance and assistance in all matters."

        "question": "Fabricated Hadith About Virtue of Praying Qiyam al-Layl on Saturday Night",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadith is fabricated. It was quoted by al-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) in al-Fawaid al-Majmoo’ah fi’l-Ahadith al-Mawdoo’ah (p.44), as quoted in the question. He said: It was narrated by al-Jawzaqani from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) in a marfoo’ report (i.e. attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)). But it is mawdoo’ (fabricated), and the men of its isnad (chain of narrators) are either majhool (unknown) or matrook (rejected). \nPrayer at night is mustahabb (recommended) on all days, and is not restricted to what is mentioned in this fabricated hadith.  \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (in charity in Allah’s Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them.\nNo person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.”\n[32:16-17] \n“Verily, the Muttaqoon (the pious) will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs (in the Paradise),\nTaking joy in the things which their Lord has given them.

        "predicted_answer": "### Question: Fabricated Hadith About Virtue of Praying Qiyam al-Layl on Saturday Night\n\n#### Introduction:\nThe practice of Qiyam al-Layl, or night prayers, holds a significant position in Islamic tradition. However, certain specific claims about its virtue—such as praying specifically on Saturday night—may not find solid bases in authentic Islamic texts. \n\n#### Understanding Qiyam al-Layl:\nQiyam al-Layl—often associated with Tahajjud—is about praying at night, especially in the latter part before dawn. The importance of night prayers is illustrated in several verses of the Qur'an, emphasizing the significance of the night for worship and reflection.\n\n1. **Surah Al-Isra (17:79)**:\n   > \"And during part of the night, pray with it as additional [worship] for you; it is expected that your Lord will resurrect you to a praised station.\"\n   - This verse establishes the merit of night prayers and indicates the closeness of such practices to divine acceptance and reward.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Layl (92:1-5)**:\n   > \"I CALL THE night to witness when it covers over, And the day when it shines in all its glory, And Him who created the male and female, That your endeavor is for different ends.\"\n   - This surah underscores the importance of the night and day and highlights the different journeys of people, implying that during the night, the opportunity for spiritual pursuits, including prayer, is available.\n\n#### The Specific Claim About Saturday Night:\nRegarding the specific claim about the virtue of praying Qiyam al-Layl on Saturday night, we must note that there are no authentic hadiths or verses from the Qur'an that directly highlight this particular night as having special virtues over other nights when it comes to night prayer.\n\n1. **Authenticity of Hadith**: \n   - Many scholars criticize hadiths attributing particular virtues to specific nights without strong, reliable sources. Fabrication in hadith literature is common since many were transmitted orally until centuries later, leading to potential inaccuracies.\n\n2. **General Night Prayer**:\n   - While any night can serve as a blessed time for prayers, specific nights being singled out often comes from cultural practices rather than from legitimate Islamic teachings or scriptures. \n\n#### The General Importance of Night Prayers:\nThe act of performing night prayers is universally recognized for its high spiritual benefits. Engaging in Qiyam al-Layl aligns with the Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) teachings about seeking forgiveness, mercy, and guidance during the stillness of the night, as indicated by:\n\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:78-79)**, which emphasizes the importance of prayer throughout the night.\n- **Surah Al-Qadr (97:1-5)**, highlighting the spiritual significance of the Night of Decree, showing how much higher the value is of worship during specific nights like Ramadan, but again, without singling out a particular weekly night.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile Qiyam al-Layl is a commended act of worship, any fabricated claims about specific virtues concerning Saturday night do not hold up against the scrutiny of authentic Islamic teachings. The emphasis should remain on the practice of night prayer in general rather than on specific times without strong evidence from the Qur'an or authentic Sunnah. Therefore, practitioners are advised to focus on the quality of their nightly prayers rather than seeking out specific nights without substantiated teachings supporting such practices."

        "question": "Falseness Hadeeth About Adam Praying by Virtue of the Prophet",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth is mawdoo’ (fabricated). It was narrated by al-Hakim via ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muslim al-Fahri (who said), Isma’eel ibn Muslimah narrated to us, ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam told us, from his father, from his grandfather, from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “When Adam committed his sin…” Then he quoted the hadeeth as the questioner quoted it. \nAl-Hakim said: The isnad (chain of narrators) of this hadeeth is saheeh. \nThis is what al-Hakim said! But a number of scholars rebuked him and denounced him for classing this hadeeth as saheeh. They ruled that this hadeeth is false and fabricated, and they pointed out that al-Hakim contradicted himself when commenting on this hadeeth. \nThere follow some of their comments: \nAl-Thahabi said, criticizing the words of al-Hakim quoted above: \nRather it is mawdoo’ (fabricated), and ‘Abd al-Rahman is not reliable, and I do not know who ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muslim al-Fahri is. \nAl-Thahabi also said in Meezan al-I’tidal: It is a false report. \nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar agreed with him in Lisan al-Meezan. \nAl-Bayhaqi said:  \n‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam is the only one who narrated it with this isnad, and he is da’eef (weak). Ibn Katheer agreed with him in al-Bidayah wa’l-Nihayyah, 2/323. \nAl-Albani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 25: (it is) mawdoo’. \nAl-Hakim himself (may Allah forgive him) accused ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd of being a fabricator of hadeeth, so how could his hadeeth be saheeh? \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Qa’idah al-Jaleelah fi’l-Tawassul wa’l-Waseelah (p. 69): \nAl-Hakim’s narration of this hadeeth is something for which he was denounced, and he himself said in his book al-Madkhil ila Ma’rifat al-Saheeh ‘an al-Saqeem:  \n‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam narrated fabricated hadeeths from his father, and it is obvious to any competent hadeeth scholar that he is the one to blame for fabricating hadeeths. I say: ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam is da’eef (weak) because he made a lot of mistakes.\n See Silsilat al-Ahadeeth al-Da’eefah by al-Albani, 1/38-47.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question regarding the false hadith about Adam praying by virtue of the Prophet Muhammad requires a nuanced examination of Islamic teachings. The hadith in question typically asserts that Adam prayed to Allah by invoking the name of the Prophet Muhammad. However, this claim is subject to scrutiny based on Islamic theology and the understanding of prayer (dua) and intercession.\n\n### Key Points of Discussion:\n\n1. **Adam’s Prophethood and Prayer**: \n   According to Islamic belief, Adam is recognized as the first prophet (Nabi) and was created with the purpose of worshiping Allah. Prayer is a fundamental act of worship in Islam, and while Adam did pray, there is no authentic hadith from the Prophet Muhammad that explicitly states Adam prayed by invoking his name. The Qur'an, rather, presents Adam's dialogues with Allah regarding his guidance and repentance, emphasizing the direct relationship he had with his Creator.\n\n2. **Intercession**:\n   The notion of intercession in Islam is a significant concept. However, as per Islamic teachings, it is understood that the capacity for intercession is ultimately held by Allah alone. Specific hadith discuss different forms of intercession by the Prophet Muhammad on the Day of Judgment, but these do not extend backward in time to influence the actions of figures such as Adam before their own prophethood was established.\n\n3. **Relevant Verses**:\n   The Qur'an emphasizes Allah's direct communication with prophets, including Adam. For instance:\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:37)** deals with Adam's fall and return to guidance: \n     - \"Then his Lord chose him and turned towards him and guided him.\" \n   - **Surah Taha (20:115-122)** discusses the commands given to Adam and the consequences of his actions, underlining that he had a direct relationship with Allah: \n     - \"We had commanded Adam before, but he disregarded it: We found him lacking in resolution.\"\n   - In **Surah 9:113-117**, it is clarified that the Prophet Muhammad and the believers are not to seek forgiveness for idolaters, emphasizing direct accountability to Allah without intermediaries.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: \n   Many hadith and interpretations have arisen over time that might not all have accurate historical validation. Scholars of hadith science categorize narrations based on their authenticity. Hadith that suggest Adam prayed to Allah via mentioning the Prophet Muhammad (who came long after Adam) often belong to the category of weak or fabricated.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   Ultimately, while the Quran establishes a clear narrative of the relationship between Allah and His prophets—including Adam—any assertion that Adam prayed specifically invoking the Prophet Muhammad as a mediator lacks strong textual support in the Qur’an or authentic hadith. The practice of prayer (dua) is a direct appeal to Allah, reflecting the fundamental monotheistic belief in Islam that emphasizes direct servitude and supplication to God alone. \n\n### Summary of Helpful Verses:\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah 2:37**: \"Then his Lord chose him and turned towards him and guided him.\"\n- **Surah Taha 20:115-122**: Discusses Adam's disregarding of a command and his subsequent turn to Allah.\n- **Surah Ibrahim (14:31-36)**: Reminds believers to be grateful for Allah's favors and includes prayers from prophets like Abraham (Ibrahim). \n\nThus, while Adam prayed, the notion of him doing so by invoking the Prophet Muhammad does not find support in the core Islamic texts."

        "predicted_answer": "The phrase “Praise be to Allah who has fed me and granted me provision” reflects a deep appreciation for Allah’s blessings and sustenance. This sentiment finds resonance in multiple verses within the Quran that emphasize Allah's generosity and provisions. Here’s a detailed examination of relevant verses supporting this idea, along with citations:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Fatihah (1:1-3)**  \n   *“In the name of Allah, Most Beneficent, Ever-Merciful. All praise be to Allah, Lord of all the worlds, Most Beneficent, Ever-Merciful.”*  \n   This opening chapter underscores the acknowledgment of Allah's attributes of mercy and beneficence, serving as a primary declaration of praise towards Him for His provisions and care.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:261-263)**  \n   *“The semblance of those who expend their wealth in the way of Allah is that of a grain of corn from which grow seven ears, each ear containing a hundred grains. Truly Allah increases for whomsoever He wills, for Allah is Infinite and All-Wise. Those who spend in the way of Allah and do not boast or inflict pain (by word or deed) will get their reward from their Lord and will have no fear nor regret.”*  \n   This verse illustrates the immense spiritual and material benefits that come from being thankful and generous with the provisions Allah has bestowed.\n\n3. **Surah Ar-Rahman (55:13)**  \n   *“So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?”*  \n   Repeated throughout this Surah, this verse acts as a reminder to reflect on the countless blessings provided by Allah. The rhetorical question calls for gratitude and acknowledgment of His sustenance.\n\n4. **Surah Ar-Rahman (55:10-14)**  \n   *“He positioned the earth for all the creatures. There are fruits of all kinds on it, and date-palms with their clusters sheathed, Grain with husk, and fragrant grasses. How many favors of your Lord will then both of you deny?”*  \n   This verse emphasizes the physical provisions that Allah has made available in creation, reinforcing the idea that the sustenance received is a direct act of His grace.\n\n5. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:267)**  \n   *“O believers! Give in charity what is good of the things you have earned, and of what We have produced for you from the earth; and do not choose to give what is bad.”*  \n   The verse highlights the importance of recognizing what Allah provides and the obligation to use these provisions wisely, demonstrating appreciation for what has been granted.\n\n6. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:172-173)**  \n   *“O believers! Eat of the good things We have provided for you, and give thanks to Allah if it is Him that you worship.”*  \n   This passage directly connects gratitude and worship with the consumption of the provisions Allah has granted, reinforcing the idea that acknowledgment of His bounty is integral to faith.\n\nIn conclusion, the phrase “Praise be to Allah who has fed me and granted me provision” draws from a fundamental appreciation of Allah's generosity as outlined in various verses throughout the Quran. It resonates with the overarching themes of thankfulness for sustenance, recognition of divine blessings, and an obligation to share in charity. These principles illustrate a deep-seated connection between faith, gratitude, and reliance on Allah as the Provider."

        "question": "Hadeeth Concerning the Virtue of Praying Forty prayers in the Prophet’s Mosque",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by Ahmad (12173) from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who is reported to have said, “Whoever prays forty prayers in my Mosque, missing no prayer, it will be recorded that he is safe from the Fire, is saved from punishment and is free of hypocrisy.” This is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth. \nThis was mentioned by al-Shaykh al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (364), who said: It is da’eef. He also mentioned it in Da’eef al-Targheeb (755) and said, it is munkar (a kind of weak hadeeth). \nAl-Albani said in his book Hujjat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (p.185) that it is an innovation (bid’ah) to visit Madeenah and tell the visitors to Madeenah to stay there for a week so that they will be able to offer forty prayers in the Prophet’s Mosque so that they will be free from hypocrisy and saved from the Fire. \nAl-Shaykh Ibn Baz said: \nWith regard to the widespread idea that the visitor should stay for eight days so that he can offer forty prayers in the Mosque is wrong. Although it says in some hadeeths, “Whoever offers forty prayers therein Allah will decree that he is safe from the Fire and free from hypocrisy,” this hadeeth is da’eef according to the scholars and cannot be taken as proof or relied upon. There is no set limit for visiting the Prophet’s Mosque. If a person visits for an hour or two, or a day or two, or for more than that, there is nothing wrong with that. \nFatawa Ibn Baz, 17/406 \nInstead of this hadeeth we should look at the hasan (sound) hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmithi (241) concerning the virtue of always being present for the opening takbeer (saying Allahu Akbar) of prayer in congregation. It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever prays for forty days with the congregation, always being present for the first takbeer, it will be written that he will be safe from two things: he will be safe from the Fire and safe from hypocrisy.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmithi, 200. \nThe virtue mentioned in this hadeeth is general and applies to any mosque where prayers are offered in congregation, in any land; it does not apply only to al-Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah] or al-Masjid al-Nabawi [in Madeenah] in particular. \nBased on this, whoever consistently prays forty days in congregation in which he is present for the first takbeer, it will be recorded that he will be safe from two things: safe from the Fire and safe from hypocrisy, whether the mosque is in Madeenah, Makkah or anywhere else. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "### The Virtue of Praying in the Prophet’s Mosque\n\nThe importance and virtue of praying in the Prophet Muhammad's Mosque (Masjid al-Nabawi) in Medina is highlighted in various traditions, including hadith. One of the well-known hadith states that praying in this mosque is equivalent to a significantly multiplied reward compared to praying in other mosques. Specifically, it is said that a prayer in the Prophet’s Mosque is equal to a thousand prayers made elsewhere, except for the Sacred Mosque in Makkah.\n\n### Supporting Verses and References\n\n1. **Surah Al-Fath (The Victory) - 48:27-29**\n   - Allah promises victory to the Prophet and the believers, which lends great significance to the Prophet's Mosque:\n     > \"God has truly made the vision of His Apostle come true: You will surely enter the Holy Mosque in security if God please, without any fear, having shaved your heads and cut your hair. He knew what you did not know, and has vouchsafed you, apart from this, a victory near at hand.\" \n   - (Surah Al-Fath, 48:27-29)\n\n2. **Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow) - 2:196**\n   - This verse emphasizes the importance of pilgrimage and may indirectly connect to the virtue of attending sacred places:\n     > \"Perform the pilgrimage and holy visit ('Umrah, to Makkah) in the service of God.\"\n   - (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:196)\n\n3. **Surah Al-Ma'idah (The Table Spread) - 5:6**\n   - The verse encapsulates the purification rituals that are part of worship, hinting that praying in mosques like the Prophet’s Mosque is an opportunity for this kind of spiritual purification:\n     > \"O believers, when you stand up for the service of prayer wash your faces and hands up to elbows, and also wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles.\"\n   - (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:6)\n\n4. **Surah An-Nisa (The Women) - 4:101-103**\n   - This passage discusses the guidelines about prayer during times of fear, suggesting the significance of maintaining prayer as an act of faith, especially in sacred locations:\n     > \"When you travel in the land there is no sin if you curtail your service of prayer if you fear the unbelievers may harass you, for indeed your open enemies are the infidels.\"\n   - (Surah An-Nisa, 4:101-103)\n\n5. **Surah Al-Ahzab (The Combined Forces) - 33:56**\n   - This ayah commands believers to send blessings on the Prophet, indicating the high status and reverence of the Prophet and places associated with him:\n     > \"Indeed, Allah and His angels send blessings upon the Prophet. O you who have believed, ask [God to confer] blessing upon him and ask [God to grant him] peace.\"\n   - (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:56)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPraying in the Prophet's Mosque is highly virtuous due to the multiplied rewards indicated in hadith, as well as the supportive verses from the Qur’an that emphasize the significance of such sacred places in Islam. The Prophet’s Mosque stands as a focal point for believers seeking spiritual growth, community, and connection to the prophetic tradition. \n\nThe verses from Surah Al-Fath, Al-Baqarah, Al-Ma'idah, An-Nisa, and Al-Ahzab collectively emphasize the sanctity and communal nature of worship and the specific significance attached to places associated with the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)."

        "question": "“Were it not for you, I would not have created the universe.”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Many false and fabricated ahadeeth (narrations) have been narrated that say similar things. For example: \n“Were it not for you, I would not have created the universe.” \nThis was quoted by al-Shawkani in al-Fawaid al-Majmoo’ah fi’l-Ahadeeth al-Mawdoo’ah (p. 326). He said:  \nAl-San’ani said: (it is) mawdoo’ (fabricated). \nAl-Albani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (282): (it is) mawdoo’. \nAnother example is the hadeeth narrated by al-Hakim according to which Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \n“Allah revealed to ‘Eesa (Jesus, peace be upon him): ‘O ‘Eesa, believe in Muhammad, and tell whoever you meet of your ummah (followers) to believe in him. For were it not for Muhammad, I would not have created Adam, and were it not for Muhammad, I would not have created Paradise and Hell. I created the Throne over the water and it would not settle until I wrote on it, La ilaha ill-Allah Muhammad Rasool Allah (There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah).” \nAl-Hakim said: its isnad (chain of narration) is saheeh! But al-Thahabi commented on this and said: I believe it is fabricated and falsely attributed to Sa’eed. \nMeaning, Sa’eed ibn Abu ‘Aroobah (one of the narrators of this hadeeth). This hadeeth was narrated from him by ‘Amr ibn Aws al-Ansari, who is the one who is accused of fabricating it. Al-Thahabi mentioned him in al-Meezan where he said: “He produced a munkar (rejected) report,” then he quoted this hadeeth, and said, “I believe that it is mawdoo’ (fabricated).” Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar agreed with him, as it says in al-Lisan. \nAl-Albani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (280): There is no basis for it. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \nIs the hadeeth which some people quote – “Were it not for you, Allah would not have created the Throne or the Kursiy (lit. Footstool) or the earth or the heavens or the sun or the moon or anything else” saheeh or not? \nHe replied:\nMuhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the leader of the sons of Adam (peace be upon him), and the best and noblest of creation, hence some people say that Allah created the universe because of him, or that were it not for him, Allah would not have created the Throne or the Kursiy or the earth or the heavens or the sun or the moon. \nBut this hadeeth that is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is neither saheeh (sound) nor da’eef (weak), and it was not narrated by any scholar in a hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Neither was it known from the Sahabah/Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Rather it is the words of one who is unknown. \nMajmoo’ al-Fatawa, 11/86-96. \nThe Standing Committee was asked: \nCan it be said that Allah created the heavens and the earth for the purpose of creating the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? What is the meaning of the hadeeth, “Were it not for you the universe would not have been created,” and does this hadeeth have any basis? \nThey replied: \nThe heavens and the earth were not created for the sake of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather they were created for the purpose which Allah mentions (interpretation of the meaning): \n“It is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge.” [65:12] \nAs for the hadeeth mentioned, it is falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and has no sound basis. \nFatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 1/312 \nShaykh Ibn Baz was asked about this hadeeth and he said: \nThe answer is that this was transmitted from the words of some of the common people who have no understanding. Some people say that the world was created for the sake of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and were it not for Muhammad the world would not have been created and mankind would not have been created. This is false and has no basis, and these are corrupt words. Allah created the world so that He would be known and worshipped. He created the world and He created mankind so that His names and attributes, His power and knowledge, would be known and so that He alone would be worshipped with no partner or associate, and so that He would be obeyed – not for the sake of Muhammad or for the sake of Nooh or Moosa or ‘Eesa or any other Prophet (peace be upon them all). Rather Allah created the universe so that He alone would be worshipped, with no partner or associate.\n Fatawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb, 46.\n And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase “Were it not for you, I would not have created the universe” is not a literal quotation from the Quran, but it can reflect the Islamic understanding of the purpose and significance of creation, which is often articulated in relation to humanity's role as stewards of the Earth and servants of God.\n\n### Creation in the Quran\n\n1. **Divine Creation and Purpose**: The Quran emphasizes that God is the sole creator of the universe and everything within it. For example, in Surah Al-Waqi'ah (Chapter 56: Ayah 57-61), Allah poses rhetorical questions to emphasize His unique ability to create life, indicating the insignificance of human power in contrast to divine. The verses state:\n   > \"It is He who created you, then why do you not affirm the truth? Just consider (the semen) that you emit. Do you create it, or We are its Creator? We have incorporated death in your constitution, and We shall not be hindered from replacing you with others or raising you in a way you do not know.\"\n   (Surah Al-Waqi'ah, 56:57-61)\n\n2. **In Need of God**: Another relevant verse is found in Surah Fatir (Chapter 35: Ayah 11-15), which indicates that mankind is wholly reliant on God for existence and sustenance:\n   > \"O men, it is you who stand in need of God. As for God, He is above all need, worthy of praise.\"\n   (Surah Fatir, 35:15)\n\n3. **Human Responsibility**: Furthermore, the Quran asserts that while God is the creator, humanity has a specific role to play in the stewardship of His creation. This is exhibited in Surah An-Naml (Chapter 27: Ayah 60-64), which cites God's creation and provision, thereby reminding humans of their responsibility to reflect on and honor the natural world around them:\n   > \"Who created the heavens and the earth, who sends down water from the sky for you, with which He causes graceful gardens to grow? It was not in your power to make trees germinate.\"\n   (Surah An-Naml, 27:60)\n\n4. **Divine Power**: Surah Ya-Sin reinforces the idea of God's supreme power over creation: \n   > \"Say: 'He who created you the first time. He has knowledge of every creation. How can He who created the heavens and the earth not be able to create others like them? Why not? He is the real creator, all-knowing.'\"\n   (Surah Ya-Sin, 36:79-81)\n\n5. **All Bounty is from God**: The Quran also underlines that the benefits and capabilities humans possess are gifts from God, meant to inspire gratitude and reflection, as shown in Surah Az-Zukhruf (Chapter 43: Ayah 9-13):\n   > \"If you ask them: 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' they will answer: 'The Mighty and All-knowing created them.'\"\n   (Surah Az-Zukhruf, 43:9)\n\n### Theological Significance\n\nThe essence of saying \"Were it not for you, I would not have created the universe\" can be interpreted in the sense that human existence holds a special relationship to creation; humans are viewed as the pinnacle of God's creation, endowed with intellect and conscience to fulfill His commandments and propagate His worship on Earth. \n\nThis notion does not mean that humans are the reason for creation in a literal sense, but rather highlights the purpose of creation: the worship of God, as indicated in Surah Adh-Dhariyat (Chapter 51: Ayah 56):\n> \"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.\"\n(Surah Adh-Dhariyat, 51:56)\n\nOverall, the Quran asserts that all of creation serves a higher purpose, which is ultimately centred around the worship and servitude to God. Thus, while the quoted phrase might not appear explicitly in the text, its underlying sentiment aligns with Islamic doctrinal beliefs regarding creation, purpose, and the human role within it."

        "question": "A Fabricated Hadeeth",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The stories which this preacher told are all false and are \n    lies against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that \n    have no basis. He did not mourn after the death of Khadeejah (may Allah be \n    pleased with her), or slaughter a camel, or invite the people to mourn, as \n    some people do nowadays. He used to make a lot of du’a (supplication) for \n    Khadeejah (may Allah be pleased with her), and sometimes he would slaughter \n    a sheep and distribute the meat among her friends as a gift and act of \n    kindness, and he would pray for her and be kind to her by means of this \n    du’a.\n\n    Similarly, what he said about the tree is also false and has \n    no basis, and what he said about the Jew is all lies, like the lies made up \n    by the evil fabricators. The same applies to what he narrated about ‘Uthman \n    (may Allah be pleased with him) and that man. Moreover Qatadah was not a \n    Sahabi (Companion of the Prophet), rather he was a Tabi’i (Successor). \n\n    The point is that these four reports are all false and are \n    not sound at all, But it was narrated in other, saheeh hadeeths (authentic \n    narrations) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) \n    called some trees and they came to him– and that was one of the signs of \n    Prophethood. This story was proven in Saheeh Muslim, where it says that on \n    one of his journeys he wanted to relieve himself, so he called two trees and \n    they came together, and he sat between them to relieve himself, then each \n    tree went back to its place. This was a sign from Allah that was evidence of \n    His almighty power, and that he says to a thing “Be!” and it is. This was \n    also a sign of the truth of the Messenger of Allah and that he was indeed \n    the Messenger of Allah. This is something other than the story that this \n    liar told. We must beware of these liars, and the preacher must fear Allah \n    when he preaches to people; he should remind them of things that will \n    benefit them in their spiritual and worldly affairs of verses of the Quran \n    and saheeh hadeeths from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him). That is sufficient. It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that the \n    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever \n    narrates a hadeeth from me knowing that it is false, he is one of the \n    liars.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). And he (peace and blessings of \n    Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever narrated from me something that I did not \n    say, let him take his place in Hell.” (Saheeh, agreed upon). And there are \n    many similar hadeeths.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question regarding fabricated Hadith refers to the accusations made against the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) by some individuals or groups, who claimed that he invented or fabricated the revelations from God. Understanding the context and authenticity of such claims is essential in Islam. \n\nIn the Quran, several verses address the notion of fabrication and the responsibilities of the Prophet as a messenger of God's word. Here are some key points and corresponding verses that illustrate this:\n\n1. **Rebuttal of the Fabrication Accusation**: \n   The Prophet is often challenged by disbelievers who claim he has fabricated his message. In Surah Al-Ahqaf (46:8-12), Allah addresses these accusations directly. The verses encourage reflection on the consequences of such denial, asserting the Prophet's role solely as a messenger who follows what is revealed to him:\n\n   > \"Do they say: 'He has fabricated it?' Tell them: 'If I have fabricated it, you have no power to save me from God. He knows what you are busy with concerning this...'\" (Al-Ahqaf, 46:8)\n\n2. **Distinguishing Between Truth and Falsehood**: \n   Similar sentiments are expressed in Surah Hud (11:13-17), where the Prophet is instructed to challenge those who accuse him of bringing falsehood by inviting them to produce something similar. This highlights the unmatched nature of the Quran and its divine origin:\n\n   > \"Do they say (of the Prophet): 'He has forged (the Qur'an)?' Say: 'Then bring ten Surahs like it...'\" (Hud, 11:13)\n\n3. **Acknowledgment of the Role of Witnesses and Evidence**: \n   In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:103-107), the text indicates that many disbelievers fabricate lies about God, and distinguishes between true guidance and the misguided beliefs of previous generations. The Quran encourages individuals to seek knowledge and truth rather than adhere to inherited beliefs without question:\n\n   > \"The unbelievers fabricate lies of God, for many of them are devoid of sense.\" (Al-Ma'idah, 5:103)\n\n4. **Ultimate Accountability to God**: \n   The Quran emphasizes that all people are responsible for their beliefs and that they will ultimately return to God for judgment. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:105) states:\n\n   > \"O you who believe, on you rests the responsibility for your own selves...\" (Al-Ma'idah, 5:105)\n\n5. **The Example of Previous Prophets**: \n   In Surah Al-Ahqaf (46:10), a reference is made to previous prophets and how they faced similar accusations. The mention of Moses serves to show a continuity of the divine message and the universality of rejection faced by true messengers:\n\n   > \"Tell them: 'Think (of the consequence) if this is from God and you deny it...'\" (Al-Ahqaf, 46:10)\n\nThrough these verses, the Quran provides a strong foundation for defending the message of the Prophet Muhammad against claims of fabrication. It serves as a reminder that the task of the Prophet is to convey God's message faithfully, and any accusations against him should be approached with reflection and understanding of the broader context of divine revelation. It reinforces the importance of seeking the truth and being accountable for one's own beliefs and actions."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Hadith about saying “Allahumma ajirni mi nan-nar” \nThis hadith (prophetic narration) was narrated by al-Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad, 17362, and by Abu Dawud, 5079. The hadith is as follows: \nProphet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you pray Fajr, then say before speaking to any of the people, ‘Allahumma ajirni min an-nar (O Allah, protect me from the Fire)’ seven times. Then if you die on that day, Allah will grant you protection from the Fire. And when you pray Maghrib, then say before speaking to any of the people, ‘Allahumma inni as-aluka al-jannah, Allahumma ajirni min an-nar (O Allah, I ask You for Paradise, O Allah, protect me from the Fire)’ seven times. Then if you die that night, Allah will grant you protection from the Fire.” \nAuthenticity of the hadith on saying “Allahumma ajirni min an-nar”\nTwo things may be noted about the hadith. \n1. It does not say that this du’a (supplication) is to be said after ‘Isha (night prayer), as mentioned in the question.\n2. The hadith is not sahih (authentic) in its narration from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). See al-Silsilah al-Da’ifah by al-Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him), 1624. \nBased on this, it is not mustahabb (desirable) to recite this du’a after Fajr and Maghrib prayers. \n3. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever asks Allah for Paradise three times, Paradise will say, ‘O Allah, admit him to Paradise.’ Whoever seeks protection from the Fire three times, Hell will say, ‘O Allah, protect him from the Fire.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2572; Ibn Majah, 4340. This is a sahih hadith; it was classed as sahih by al-Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih al-Jami’, 6275) \nBut there is nothing to state that this should be recited in conjunction with any particular prayer, or at any particular time. \nIt is mustahabb for the believer to ask Allah for Paradise a great deal, and to seek protection from Hell a great deal, without saying such words in conjunction with any particular prayer, or at any particular time.\nFor more, please see these answers: 217496 , 105396 , and 148174 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase \"Allahumma ajirni min an-nar,\" which translates to \"O Allah, save me from the Fire,\" is a supplication that reflects the believer's recognition of Allah’s mercy and the fear of His punishment in the Hereafter. The act of repeating this supplication seven times is a practice rooted in Islamic tradition, particularly emphasized during moments of prayer and supplication.\n\n### Importance of Asking for Protection from Hellfire\n\n1. **Understanding the Significance of Supplication**: \n\n    In Islam, supplication (dua) is not only a means of communication with Allah but also a way to seek His mercy, guidance, and protection. Allah has encouraged believers to ask Him for what they need.\n\n    - **Surah Al-An'am (6:52-56)** states: \n    > \"Do not turn away those who supplicate their Lord morning and evening, seeking His magnificence. You are not accountable for them in the least, nor they for you at all. If you drive them away you will only be unjust...\"\n\n    This verse highlights that believers should not hesitate to turn to Allah in supplication, particularly those who seek His mercy and forgiveness.\n\n2. **The Requests for Protection from Torment**:\n\n    The Qur’an emphasizes that Allah is the most merciful and forgiving. The act of asking for protection from the Hellfire is acknowledging one's weakness and dependence on Allah’s mercy. \n\n    - **Surah Al-A'raf (7:54-58)** encourages believers to pray with humility and expectation:\n    > \"Pray to your Lord in humility and unseen. He does not love the iniquitous...So shall We raise the dead that you may think and reflect. The soil that is good produces (rich) crops by the will of its Lord...\"\n\n3. **Recitation and Number of Times**: \n\n    Though the specific number seven is not explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an for this supplication, repeating phrases in prayer holds significant spiritual merit within Islam. The number seven is considered important in various aspects of Islamic practice and is often associated with completeness and divine mercy.\n\n4. **Additional Context from Hadith**:\n\n   While your question specifically requests Qur’anic citations, there are many Hadith narrations that encourage repeatedly supplicating for protection from Hellfire. For example, it is narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) would often call upon Allah for protection from Hellfire and encourage his companions to do the same.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the supplication \"Allahumma ajirni min an-nar\" reflects a fundamental aspect of Islamic belief; it is an expression of a believer's fear of Allah's punishment and a plea for His mercy. The verses from *Surah Al-An'am* (6:52-56) and *Surah Al-A'raf* (7:54-58) clarify the importance of supplication, humility in prayer, and seeking refuge from the consequences of one's sins. This practice of repeating such supplications underscores a believer's longing and hope for salvation, making it a spiritually rewarding tradition within the faith."

        "predicted_answer": "### Virtues of Memorizing Forty Hadeeths\n\nMemorizing hadeeths (sayings of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) holds significant virtues in Islam. The act of absorbing these statements nurtures a deeper understanding of Islamic teachings and enhances personal virtue, character, and guidance. Here, we will explore these virtues while providing relevant citations from the Qur'an.\n\n1. **Enhancing Knowledge and Guidance**:\n   Memorizing and understanding hadeeths greatly contributes to a Muslim's knowledge base. Surah Hud emphasizes the purpose of the narratives of past prophets—these stories provide strength and guidance. In Surah Hud (11:120-123), Allah states:\n   - \"The histories of apostles that We relate to you are (meant) to strengthen your heart. Through them has the truth come to you, and guidance, and reminder to those who believe.\"\n   This reflects the importance of having knowledge, which is vital for making informed decisions that align with faith.\n\n2. **Remembrance and Reflection**:\n   The act of memorization is in itself a form of worship and remembrance of Allah. When we memorize and reflect upon hadeeths, we are reminded of the teachings of the Prophet and encouraged to implement them in our daily lives. This is emphasized in Surah Al-Muddaththir (74:56):\n   - \"But they will not remember except as God wills: He is worthy to be feared, and He is worthy of forgiving.\"\n   This verse highlights the spiritual benefit of reflecting upon guidance, which can lead to personal growth and accountability.\n\n3. **Good Deeds and Morality**:\n   Hadeeths often provide guidance on moral conduct and the importance of good deeds, which are emphasized throughout the Qur'an. For instance, Surah Hud (11:114) instructs believers to maintain prayer and offers assurance that good deeds will nullify bad ones:\n   - \"Remember that good deeds nullify the bad.\"\n   By memorizing and practicing the teachings of hadiths, individuals are better equipped to perform good deeds, thus purifying their hearts and actions.\n\n4. **Calling to Righteousness**:\n   Memorizing hadeeths enables Muslims to convey the message of Islam more effectively. Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:7) reminds believers of their responsibilities, including standing as witnesses for justice:\n   - \"O you who believe, stand up as witnesses for God in all fairness...\"\n   When Muslims memorize hadeeths, they carry the tools necessary to spread righteous teachings and encourage others.\n\n5. **Creating a Foundation for Faith**:\n   Surah Ghafir (40:54) presents an essential perspective on guidance:\n   - \"A guidance and reminder for men of wisdom.\"\n   Memorizing hadeeth serves as a foundation for building proper beliefs that are based on the Sunnah (the practices of the Prophet), ensuring that one's faith is well-founded.\n\n6. **Spiritual Reward**:\n   Allah promises a great reward for those who believe and act upon their beliefs, as noted in Surah Al-Ahzab (33:35):\n   - \"For them, God has forgiveness and a great reward.\"\n   The insights gained through memorizing hadeeths lead to a greater chance of receiving divine blessings.\n\n7. **Unity and Community**:\n   The teachings encapsulated within hadeeths promote values of unity within the community. They remind Muslims to work together for the common good and uphold the tenets of Islam collectively, as the teachings bind individuals through mutual understanding and shared beliefs.\n\n8. **Encouragement of One's Character**:\n   By embodying the noble characteristics reflected in the hadeeths, individuals can cultivate commendable traits, as encouraged in the impactful reminders found throughout the Qur'an. Surah Sad (38:46-50) discusses recognizing the best in one another and aiming for excellence:\n   - \"We distinguished them for the distinct remembrance of the abode (of the Hereafter). They are the chosen ones, the excellent in Our sight.\"\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the memorization of forty hadeeths offers a pathway to personal growth, communal strength, and divine rewards. It serves as an essential aspect of a well-rounded Islamic education, allowing believers to embody the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and thus navigate life's challenges with wisdom and faith."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws – as al-Hafiz al-‘Iraqi said – from the report of Makhool from Abu’l-Darda. It is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth, for Makhool did not hear anything from Abu’l-Darda. \nSee Takhreej Ihya ‘Uloom al-Deen, 4/191. \nIt was also narrated by Abu Na’eem in al-Hilyah (6/5) from the report of Mujahid from Ka’b al-Ahbar. \nAnd he narrated it in 6/37 from the report of Qutadah from Ka’b al-Ahbaar. \nBoth isnads (chains of narration) include Ishaq ibn Bishr al-Kahili, who is matrook [i.e., his hadeeth is not accepted]. Abu Zar’ah said: he used to tell lies.  \nAl-Daraqutni said he is kaththab matrook (i.e., a liar whose hadeeth is not to be accepted). Al-Azdi said: his hadeeth is to be rejected and is not valid, and he was accused of lying. Ibn Hibban said: he used to fabricate hadeeth and attribute them to trustworthy narrators (thiqat); his hadeeth should not be written down except by way of amusing oneself with something weird. \nSee al-Jarh wa’l-Ta’deel, 2/214; al-Du’afa wa’l-Matrookeen by Ibn al-Jawzi, 1/100. \nHe is one of the storytellers and time-wasters.

Ibn Jareer and others narrated from him, and in it he spoke of weird and disastrous things. \nSiyar A’lam al-Nubala, 9/477, 478.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith \"If you see poverty coming to you then say, ‘Welcome, O sign of the righteous’\" emphasizes the virtue of embracing challenges such as poverty, as they are associated with spiritual rewards and righteousness in the eyes of Allah. This perspective aligns with the Islamic understanding that hardships can be a test of one's faith and an opportunity for personal growth and charitable acts.\n\n### Concept of Poverty and Charity in Islam\n\n1. **Embracing Hardships**: Poverty is often viewed in Islamic teachings as a potential blessing that can lead to greater faith and reliance on God. The struggle associated with poverty can draw one's heart closer to Allah and serve to purify one's intentions.\n\n2. **The Virtue of Charity**: Numerous verses from the Qur'an emphasize the importance of giving in charity, especially to those in need. For instance:\n\n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:271-275)**:\n     > \"If you give alms openly, it is well; but if you do it secretly and give to the poor, that is better. This will absolve you of some of your sins; and God is cognizant of all you do. It is not for you to guide them: God guides whom He will.\"\n    \n     This verse shows that giving to the needy is an essential part of faith and can lead to the forgiveness of sins.\n\n3. **Spending in the Way of God**: In Islam, spending one's wealth in Allah's path is rewarded manifold. The encouragement of charitable giving is articulated clearly in:\n   \n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:261)**:\n     > \"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of God is like a seed of grain that sprouts seven ears; in every ear there are a hundred grains. God multiplies the reward for whom He wills.\"\n\n   This verse illustrates that charitable actions yield significant rewards, reaffirming the importance of how Muslims view wealth and poverty.\n\n4. **The Goodness of Suffering**: The perception that suffering through poverty is associated with righteousness is further supported by:\n   \n   - **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:253)**:\n     > \"Some of these are preferred above others. To each Allah has appointed a share of their provisions; and if Allah had willed, He would have made them one community. But He admits whom He wills into His mercy. And the wrongdoers will have no protector.\"\n\n   This verse suggests that God's selection of individuals for different trials, including poverty, is part of His divine plan and wisdom.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe hadith you mentioned highlights a significant teaching within Islam: seeing poverty as a marker of a righteous life aligns with the Qur'anic teachings about charity, reliance on Allah, and the intrinsic value of humility. Muslims are encouraged to give generously despite their own circumstances and to welcome trials, as these can be moments of spiritual elevation and an opportunity for divine mercy. \n\nPoverty and hardships in life are viewed not merely as misfortunes but as necessary tests that cultivate deeper faith and compassion within the community. By adhering to these principles, Muslims can foster a spirit of solidarity and support toward those less fortunate, emphasizing the importance of charity in building a just society.\n\n### References:\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:271-275)**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:261)**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:253)**"

        "predicted_answer": "The concept of being content with what Allah provides is deeply rooted in Islamic teachings. The hadith you mentioned, \"Whoever is content with a little provision from Allah will receive much from Him,\" highlights the virtue of contentment and gratitude towards Allah's provisions. This is supported by numerous verses in the Quran that emphasize the importance of gratitude, the value of contentment, and the consequences of envy and ingratitude.\n\n### Contentment and Gratitude\n\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:261-269)**:\n   Allah describes the rewards of those who spend their wealth in His cause. The investment in charity is likened to a seed that produces bountiful yields, illustrating that generosity leads to divine rewards:\n   > \"The semblance of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is that of a grain of corn from which grow seven ears, each ear containing a hundred grains. Truly God increases for whomsoever He will... For God sees all that you do.\" \n   *(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:261-265)*\n\n2. **Surah Ad-Duhaa (93:5-9)**:\n   Allah reassures Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) of His bounties and blessings, and how Allah has enriched him after his period of hardship:\n   > \"Did He not find you poor and enrich you?\" \n   *(Surah Ad-Duhaa, 93:5)*\n\n3. **Surah Al-Hadid (57:20-24)**:\n   This surah references the fleeting nature of worldly possessions and encourages believers to seek Allah's forgiveness and rewards in the hereafter rather than get lost in material pursuits:\n   > \"Know that the life of this world is only a frolic and mummery, an ornamentation, boasting and bragging among yourselves, and lust for multiplying wealth and children...\" \n   *(Surah Al-Hadid, 57:20)*\n\n### The Consequences of Ingratitude\n\n4. **Surah An-Nahl (16:71-75)**:\n   Allah discusses how He has favored some over others in terms of sustenance, and warns against denying His blessings:\n   > \"God has favoured some of you over others in the means of subsistence… Will they even then believe in the false and deny God's grace?\" \n   *(Surah An-Nahl, 16:71-73)*\n\n5. **Surah Al-Ma’un (107:1-3)**:\n   This surah raises the issue of those who deny the Day of Judgment and disregard the needy:\n   > \"Have you seen him who denies the Day of Judgement? It is he who pushes the orphan away, and does not induce others to feed the needy.\" \n   *(Surah Al-Ma’un, 107:1-3)*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe teachings of Islam encourage believers to be content with what Allah has given them, emphasizing that true wealth is not only in material possessions but in the satisfaction and blessings of being grateful and generous. The verses from the Quran support this teaching, encouraging believers to recognize the transient nature of worldly possessions and to focus on fostering a spirit of gratitude and community support. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) consistently emphasized this through his teachings, illustrating that contentment leads to peace of mind and a sense of divine favor. \n\nThese principles, rooted in the Quran, portray that being content with what little one has is a pathway to Allah's mercy and rewards."

It was also classed as saheeh by al-Hafiz ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari, 15/3 and 11/345.",
        "predicted_answer": "The statement “Of the things of this world, women and perfume have been made dear to me,” refers to the love for beauty and companionship that exists in human nature, and this affection is recognized within the teachings of Islam. This saying is attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and captures the essence of the joys granted to humans in this life while also emphasizing the importance of responsibility and moral conduct.\n\n### Women in Islam\nWomen hold a significant place within Islam, as reflected in several verses of the Quran. For instance, in Surah An-Nisa (Chapter 4), it is stated:\n\n1. **Surah An-Nisa (4:32-33)**:\n   - \"Do not covet what God has favored some with more than He has some others. Men have a share in what they earn, and women have theirs in what they earn. Ask God for His favors. Surely God has knowledge of everything.\"  \n   - It emphasizes that both men and women have their own rights and shares in their earnings, highlighting the importance of respecting and valuing women's contributions.\n\n2. **Surah An-Nisa (4:34)**:\n   - \"Men are the protectors of women.\"  \n   - This verse indicates that men have a responsibility to support and protect women, establishing a framework for mutual respect and care in relationships.\n\n### The Companionship of Women\nThe Quran also encourages the institution of marriage, presenting it as a sacred bond:\n\n3. **Surah An-Nur (24:32)**:\n   - \"Marry off those who are single among you, and those of your male and female servants who are righteous.\"  \n   - This verse stresses the importance of marriage as a means of fulfilling one’s desires lawfully and establishing stable family units.\n\n4. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:223)**:\n   - \"Your wives are a place of sowing seed for you; so go to your place of cultivation as you wish.\"  \n   - This metaphorical reference illustrates the profound bond between spouses and the acknowledgment of women's roles in family life.\n\n### Perfume in Islam\nPerfume and adornment are also appreciated in Islamic teachings. The use of pleasant scents is encouraged, and a well-known hadith states:\n\n5. **Surah An-Nahl (16:67)**:\n   - \"And from the fruits of the date-palm and the vine, from which you obtain inebriating drinks and excellent food.\"  \n   - Although this verse is primarily about benefits derived from nature, it indirectly highlights that beauty and enjoyment in life, such as good scents and wholesome sustenance, are part of Allah’s blessings.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the love for women and perfume as mentioned in the phrase reflects a broader Islamic principle that treasures beauty, companionship, and ethical relationships. Women are honored within Islam, both in their roles as individuals and as integral parts of the family and society. The appeal of perfume as a sign of attractiveness and pleasantness highlights the Islamic appreciation for beauty in various forms. Both subjects encourage believers to appreciate and respect the gifts of this world while adhering to moral and ethical guidelines. \n\nThis synthesis of respect for women and the acknowledgment of beauty through adornments like perfume signifies the balanced approach that Islam advocates for in the realm of worldly pleasures and responsibilities."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2326) and Abu Dawood (1645). \nIt was classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Tirmidhi and al-Hakim (1/566), and al-Dhahabi agreed with him.",
        "predicted_answer": "The statement \"Whoever is afflicted with poverty and refers it to the people, his poverty will not be brought to an end…\" emphasizes a critical perspective on how individuals should approach their challenges, especially poverty, in the context of Islamic teachings on charity and reliance on God.\n\n### Context of Poverty in Islam\n\nIn Islam, poverty is recognized as a potential test from God, and the response of the believer to poverty is paramount. The verses from Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2) provide significant insights into the attitudes and responsibilities related to charity, helping the poor, and reliance on God.\n\n### Charity and Financial Support\n\nSurah Al-Baqarah, particularly verses 271 to 275, underscores the virtue of giving alms, whether openly or secretly, while emphasizing that it is better to assist the needy discreetly. Here are some relevant points made in these verses:\n\n- **Giving Charity**: \"If you give alms openly, it is well; but if you do it secretly and give to the poor, that is better.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:271). This suggests that while both forms of charity are commendable, helping in secret can often be more beneficial for the recipient's dignity.\n- **Intentions Matter**: It is also emphasized that whatever you spend should primarily be for one's own good in seeking God's pleasure (2:273).\n- **God's Knowledge**: The verse also communicates that God is fully aware of the contributions made, assuring believers that their efforts are recognized and accounted for by Him.\n\n### Reliance on God\n\nMoreover, the Quran emphasizes the idea that trust and reliance on God are vital. Those who turn to people for help without first seeking God's assistance can find themselves perpetually in need, as mentioned in the statement provided. The teachings in these verses encourage individuals to turn to God rather than depending solely on others for their sustenance and support.\n\n### Consequences of Rejecting Charity and Usury\n\nSurah Al-Baqarah further discusses the consequences of engaging in usury (riba) and the blessings of charitable spending:\n\n- \"God takes away (gain) from usury, but adds (profit) to charity; and God does not love the ungrateful and sinners.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:276). This contrast highlights God's preference for acts of charity over exploitative financial practices and underlines that assistance to the needy is rewarded significantly more by God than interest-based earnings.\n\n### Charity as a Means of Relief\n\nThe Quran teaches that spending in the way of God can lead to abundant rewards and relief from poverty. Verses 261 to 265, for example, compare the expression of wealth through charity to a grain that grows multiple ears, signifying the exponential benefits of charitable giving.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the statement regarding poverty reinforces the Islamic principle that reliance on God, alongside sincere charitable actions, is the correct approach to alleviate poverty. The Quran encourages believers to give willingly, without seeking recognition, and to have faith in God’s provision. This norm serves two purposes: it protects the dignity of the needy and strengthens the spirit of community and solidarity among members of society. The associated guidance in the Quran builds an understanding that faith and good deeds align with the purpose of alleviating hardship, including poverty, while fostering a deeper reliance and connection to God. \n\n**References**:\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2): Ayah 271-275\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2): Ayah 276-280\n- Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2): Ayah 261-265"

        "predicted_answer": "The Hadeeth, \"Do not please anyone by angering Allah,\" highlights an essential principle in Islamic teachings: the prioritization of God's pleasure over that of others. This principle emphasizes that in all circumstances, a believer should seek the approval of Allah, even if it means discontenting others. To understand the essence of this Hadeeth better, we can refer to various Quranic verses that reflect this concept.\n\n### Understanding the Status of the Hadeeth\n\n1. **Prioritizing God's Commands**: The Quran instructs believers not to fear people but to fear Allah. This is illustrated in:\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:44-47)**:\n     > “So do not fear men, fear Me, and barter not My messages away for a paltry gain. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, then it is those who are the disbelievers.” \n     - This verse stresses that pleasing others at the cost of angering Allah leads to disbelief, reinforcing the importance of prioritizing God's commands.\n\n2. **Trust in God**: The Quran also reminds believers that trust should be placed solely in Allah, especially when facing opposition or discontent from others:\n   - **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:10)**:\n     > “Surely scheming is the work of Satan that he may cause the faithful grief; but he cannot harm them unless God dispenses.”\n     - It implies that believers should remain steadfast in their faith and not become distracted by the reactions of others.\n\n3. **Response to Opposition**: The Quran teaches that believers may face ridicule or pressure from others, yet they should remain firm in their commitment to Allah:\n   - **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:8)**:\n     > “Have you not considered those who were forbidden to conspire, but reverted after a time to what was forbidden to them?”\n     - Believers are cautioned about distractions that can lead one away from truth, reflecting the need to be careful about alliances or decisions that can upset Allah.\n\n4. **The Eternal Consequence of Choices**: The Quran warns that the anger of Allah is severe and has eternal ramifications:\n   - **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:57)**:\n     > “Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger – Allah is severe in penalty.”\n     - This serves as a reminder that discontenting people while pleasing Allah is the right path, as the ultimate consequence of one's actions lies before Allah.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Hadeeth \"Do not please anyone by angering Allah\" encapsulates a profound ethical guideline for Muslims that resonates with the teachings found in the Quran. The verses from Surah Al-Ma'idah and Surah Al-Mujadila illuminate the importance of aligning one’s actions and intentions with God’s will, prioritizing divine pleasure amidst worldly pressures. \n\nIn essence, for a Muslim, the pursuit of Allah's pleasure is paramount, and this Hadeeth reinforces the necessity to uphold one’s faith and integrity, even in the face of potential displeasure from others. Seeking Allah’s satisfaction ensures lasting success in both this world and the Hereafter, reflecting the ultimate wisdom of divinely guided living."

        "question": "Reliability of Hadeeths?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Among the ahadeeth which are attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there are some which are saheeh (sound), concerning which there is no doubt that they are the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There are others which are da’eef (weak) and there are doubts that they can be attributed to him. Both saheeh and da’eef are well known to the scholars. Books of saheeh have been compiled which include saheeh ahadeeth such as Saheeh al-Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim; there are other books which include saheeh ahadeeth and others, like the other books of hadeeth, The scholars have gone to great lengths to distinguish the saheeh from others, as is well known to young students let alone those who have specialized in the study of the Sunnah.",
        "predicted_answer": "The reliability of Hadiths, which are the recorded sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), is a critical subject in the study of Islamic jurisprudence and theology. The authenticity and veracity of Hadiths play a significant role in understanding the Sunnah, or the way of the Prophet, which complements the Quran. Here are several aspects highlighting their reliability, supported by Quranic verses and Islamic scholarship.\n\n### 1. **Role of Hadiths in Complementing the Quran**\nHadiths provide context, explanation, and practical application of the Quran. The Quran instructs believers to obey the Prophet and clarifies that he is a model for them:\n- **Surah Al-Imran (3:32)**: \"Say, 'Obey Allah and the Messenger.' But if they turn away, indeed, Allah does not like the disbelievers.\"\n\n### 2. **Verification of Authenticity**\nThe Islamic tradition places a strong emphasis on verifying Hadith authenticity. Scholars developed a rigorous methodology for classifying Hadiths as authentic (Sahih), good (Hasan), weak (Da'if), and fabricated (Maudu). This methodology evolved over centuries and reflects the importance of safeguarding the integrity of the Hadith. The Prophet Muhammad's last sermon emphasized adherence to his guidance:\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:92)**: \"And obey Allah and the Messenger, and beware. And if you turn away, then know that upon Our Messenger is [only] the responsibility for clear notification.\"\n\n### 3. **Character of the Narrators**\nThe reliability of Hadiths heavily relies on the integrity (Adalat) and memory (Dabt) of the narrators. Scholars investigated the biography of each narrator. A verse from the Quran reflects the importance of honest testimony and integrity:\n- **Surah Al-Hujurat (49:12)**: \"O you who have believed, avoid much [unverified] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite each other...\"\n\n### 4. **Hadith as Witnesses of Truth**\nSome Hadiths emphasize the importance of witnesses and truthful testimony, which resonates with the Quranic injunction for honesty in relaying information. \n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:106)**: \"O you who have believed, when death approaches [any] one of you, if he leaves wealth, the testament [should be] for the parents and near relatives, according to what is acceptable—a duty upon the righteous.\"\n\n### 5. **Response to Claims of Fabrication**\nThe Quran addresses claims of falsehood against divine revelations, reinforcing the authenticity of the truth it conveys. The same concern is echoed in the scrutiny of Hadiths. The Quran indirectly encourages believers to strive for the truth, including the examination of Hadith:\n- **Surah Hud (11:13-17)**: \"Do they say [about the Prophet], 'He has fabricated it'? Say, 'Bring me a surah like it and invoke whoever you can besides Allah, if you should be among the truthful.'\"\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the Quran establishes the importance of the Prophet Muhammad’s role and the necessity of following his guidance, it also reinforces the inherent responsibility among Muslims to verify and uphold truthful transmissions. The rigorous sciences of Hadith, bolstered by scholarly traditions, aim to ensure that believers have access to a reliable understanding of both the Quran and the Prophet's teachings. \n\nIn summary, the reliability of Hadiths is deeply rooted in a comprehensive system of authenticity verification highlighted in both scholarly traditions and Quranic injunctions."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Hadeeth means the \n    words, actions, approvals or attributes that have been narrated from the \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  \n\n    A hadeeth may \n    either confirm things that are mentioned in the Quran, such as prayer, zakah \n    (poor-due), etc., or it may give details of things that are mentioned in the \n    Quran in general terms, such as the numbers of rak’ahs (units) in each \n    prayer, the thresholds for paying zakah, the details of Hajj, etc. It may \n    also explain rulings which are not mentioned in the Quran, such as the \n    prohibition on being married to a woman and her (paternal or maternal) aunt \n    at the same time.  \n\n    Allah revealed the \n    Quran to His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) \n    and commanded him to explain it to the people, as He said (interpretation of \n    the meaning):  \n\n    “And We have also \n    sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the \n    Quran)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and \n    that they may give thought.” \n\n    [al-Nahl 16:44] \n    \n\n    The hadeeth of the \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is a revelation (wahy) \n    from his Lord. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  \n    \n\n    “Your companion \n    (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred. \n\n    Nor does he speak \n    of (his own) desire. \n\n    It is only a \n    Revelation revealed.” \n\n    [al-Najm 53:2-4] \n    \n\n    Allah sent His \n    Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to call \n    mankind to worship Allah alone, and to disbelieve in any (god) apart from \n    Him, and (He sent him) to bring the glad tidings of Paradise and warnings of \n    Hell:  \n\n    “O Prophet \n    (Muhammad)! Verily, We have sent you as witness, and a bearer of glad \n    tidings, and a warner, \n\n    And as one who \n    invites to Allah [Islamic Monotheism, i.e. to worship none but Allah \n    (Alone)] by His leave, and as a lamp spreading light (through your \n    instructions from the Quran and the Sunnah/the legal ways of the Prophet).\n    \n\n    [al-Ahzab 33:45-46 \n    – interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    The Messenger \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was anxious over this ummah; he \n    did not know of anything good but he told them of it, and he did not know of \n    anything evil but he warned them against it:  \n\n    “Verily, there has \n    come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him \n    that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He (Muhammad) is anxious \n    over you; for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful.”\n    \n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:128 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Every Prophet was \n    sent only to his own people, but Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace \n    and blessings of Allah be upon him) to all of mankind:  \n\n    “And We have sent \n    you (O Muhammad) not but as a mercy for the ‘Alameen (mankind, jinn and all \n    that exists).” \n\n    [al-Anbiya 21:101 \n    – interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Because the \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) conveyed the revelation \n    that was sent down to him from His Lord, it is obligatory to obey him. \n    Indeed, obedience to him is obedience to Allah:  \n\n    “He who obeys the \n    Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed Allah.” \n\n    [al-Nisa 4:80 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Obedience to Allah \n    and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the way to \n    salvation and victory, and to happiness in this world and in the Hereafter: \n    \n\n    “And whosoever \n    obeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed achieved a great achievement \n    (i.e. he will be saved from the Hellfire and will be admitted to Paradise).”\n    \n\n    [al-Ahzab 33:71 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Hence it is \n    obligatory for all people to obey Allah and His Messenger (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him), because therein lies their success and \n    salvation:  \n\n    “And obey Allah \n    and the Messenger (Muhammad) that you may obtain mercy.” \n\n    [Al ‘Imran 3:132 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Whoever disobeys \n    Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only \n    harms himself, he does not harm Allah in the slightest:  \n\n    “And whosoever \n    disobeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He \n    will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a \n    disgraceful torment.” \n\n    [al-Nisa 4:14 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Once Allah and His \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have decided a matter, \n    no one has the right to choose concerning it or to object to it; rather it \n    is obligatory to obey and to believe in the truth:  \n\n    “It is not for a \n    believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter \n    that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys \n    Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error. \n    \n\n    [al-Ahzab 33:36 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    A person's faith \n    is not complete until he loves Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings \n    of Allah be upon him), and love implies obedience. Whoever wants Allah to \n    love him and forgive his sins must follow the Messenger (peace and blessings \n    of Allah be upon him):  \n\n    “Say (O Muhammad \n    to mankind): ‘If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept \n    Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you \n    and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’”\n    \n\n    [Al ‘Imran 3:31 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Love of the \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not simply the \n    matter of words to be repeated, rather it is the matter of belief and \n    conduct, i.e., obedience to what he commands, belief in what he tells us, \n    avoidance of what he forbids, and avoidance of worshipping Allah in any way \n    except that which he prescribed.  \n\n    When Allah had \n    perfected this religion and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be \n    upon him) had conveyed the message of his Lord, Allah took him to be with \n    Him. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left this \n    ummah (his followers) with clear proof in which there is no ambiguity. No \n    one deviates from it but he is doomed:  \n\n    “This day, those \n    who disbelieved have given up all hope of your religion; so fear them not, \n    but fear Me. This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My \n    favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” \n    \n\n    [al-Maidah 5:3 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    By the grace of \n    Allah, the Sahabah/Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) preserved the \n    ahaadeeth (prophetic teachings) of the Messenger (peace and blessings of \n    Allah be upon them), then the righteous salaf (pious predecessors) who came \n    after them compiled them in books which are known as the Sihah \n    (Saheehs/authentic collections), Sunan and Musnads. The most sound of them \n    are Saheeh al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim, the four Sunans, the Musnad of al-Imam \n    Ahmad and the Muwatta of al-Imam Malik, etc.  \n\n    Allah has \n    perfected this religion. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) did not know of anything good but he taught it to his ummah, and he did \n    not know of anything evil but he warned them against it. So whoever \n    introduces anything into the religion,  of bid’ah (innovation) or myths, \n    such as praying to the dead or circumambulating (tawaf) their tombs, or \n    praying to the jinn and awliya (“saints”), and other things that have not \n    been prescribed by Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be \n    upon him), all of this is to be rejected and not accepted, as the Prophet \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates \n    something in this matter of ours (Islam) that is not a part of it will have \n    it rejected.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1718) .",
        "predicted_answer": "### Understanding Hadeeth in Islam\n\nHadeeth refers to the recorded sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). These texts play a crucial role in Islamic teachings, providing additional context and guidance beyond what is found in the Quran. They cover various aspects of life and offer detailed insights into the practice of faith, Islamic law (Sharia), and moral conduct.\n\n#### Significance of Hadeeth\n\n1. **Complement to the Quran**: Hadeeth serves as a complementary source of guidance, helping to explain the Quranic text and illustrate its application in daily life. This is evidenced by the Quran emphasizing the importance of obeying the Prophet. For instance, in Surah Al-Ma'idah, Allah commands believers:\n\n   - **\"O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you...\"** (Surah 4:59)\n\n   This verse highlights the obligation of Muslims to follow the guidance provided by both Allah and His Messenger.\n\n2. **Basis for Islamic Law**: Many of the rules and regulations in Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh) derive from Hadeeth. They form the basis for understanding the application of Sharia in areas such as prayer, fasting, and personal conduct. In Surah Al-Ma'idah, the emphasis on following divine guidance is reiterated:\n\n   - **\"When you say to them: 'Come to what Allah has revealed, and the Prophet,' they say: 'Sufficient for us is the faith that our fathers had followed...'\"** (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:104)\n\n   This calls attention to the need for adherence to prophetic traditions rather than solely relying on ancestral practices.\n\n3. **Moral and Ethical Guidance**: The sayings of the Prophet Muhammad often contain profound moral lessons that guide personal conduct and interpersonal relations. For example, one fundamental Hadeeth states that actions are judged by intentions, which sets a basis for the integrity of one's actions in Islam.\n\n4. **Preservation of Religious Knowledge**: The Hadeeth is a form of preserving the teachings of Islam, as the Prophet's companions (Sahabah) took great care to memorize and transmit these teachings after his passing. The transmission process is documented through a sophisticated system of Hadeeth classification, distinguishing between authentic (Sahih), weak (Da'if), and fabricated (Mawdu) reports.\n\n5. **Narrative of Prophets' Lives**: Hadeeth provides insights into the lives of previous prophets and the lessons derived from their experiences. As reflected in the Quran, such stories are often used to reinforce the faith and provide encouragement to believers facing challenges. For instance, in Surah Hud:\n\n   - **\"The histories of apostles that We relate to you are (meant) to strengthen your heart. Through them has the truth come to you, and guidance, and reminder to those who believe.\"** (Surah Hud, 11:120)\n\n   This underlines the importance of learning from the past and the examples set by other prophets.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHadeeth is an indispensable component of Islamic teachings. It provides deeper insights into the Quran, forms the basis for jurisprudence, offers moral guidance, preserves religious knowledge, and narrates the experiences of previous prophets. The respect and reverence given to Hadeeth stems from its integral role in guiding the faith and practices of Muslims worldwide. Therefore, understanding and studying Hadeeth is essential for anyone who wishes to grasp the full depth of Islamic teachings."

        "question": "Meaning of the Hadeeth, “Faith retreats to Madeenah”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    In this \n    hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Faith \n    retreats to Madeenah like a snake returns to its hole.” The word “retreats \n    to” means to return and settle in Madeenah, just as a snake, when it goes \n    out from its hole, returns to it. Here the Prophet (peace and blessings of \n    Allah be upon him) was saying that this religion will retreat to Madeenah \n    after all other countries become corrupt, just as a snake comes out of its \n    hole and wanders about the land, then it goes back to its hole.  \n    \n\n    This \n    hadeeth also indicates that just as Islam spread from Madeenah, it will \n    return to it. Islam with its strength and authority spread from Madeenah, \n    although its roots stemmed from Makkah. Makkah was the place where the first \n    Revelation came down, but the Muslims did not have a state and power, and \n    engage in jihad (battle), until after they migrated to Madeenah. Hence Islam \n    with its power and authority, spread from Madeenah and will retreat to it at \n    the end of time.  \n\n    Some of \n    the scholars said: this hadeeth refers to something that has already \n    happened, i.e., the people came in delegations to Madeenah and went back \n    there again to learn about sharee’ah (Islamic law) and the teachings of \n    Islam from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him). But the first meaning is the apparent meaning of the hadeeth and is \n    more correct.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadeeth, “Faith retreats to Madeenah,” refers to a profound concept in Islamic theology about the positioning of faith and its connection to the city of Medina (Madeenah). This statement reflects various aspects of the historical, emotional, and spiritual significance of Medina within the Islamic tradition.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nMedina is significant in Islamic history as the city that welcomed the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the early Muslims after they faced severe persecution in Mecca. It became the first Islamic state and a center of Islamic governance and community. The reference to faith \"retreating\" to Medina highlights the city's role as a sanctuary for believers during challenging times.\n\n### Interpretation of the Hadeeth\n\n1. **Sanctuary and Resilience of Faith**: \n   The phrase suggests that during trials and tribulations, true faith finds refuge in Medina and that this city embodies the ideal atmosphere for nurturing and preserving Islamic beliefs. It also conveys a sense of hope; no matter how far faith may waver, it always returns to the purity and sincerity found in the community of Medina.\n\n2. **Community and Support**: \n   The people of Medina, known as the Ansar (helpers), provided unwavering support to the migrants (Muhajirun) from Mecca. They exemplified the ideals of brotherhood, generosity, and sacrifice. This nurturing community helped solidify faith among the believers. Relevant verses in the Qur'an, such as in Surah Al-Hashr, illustrate the qualities of the Ansar:\n   - \"Those who came to the city and to faith before them, love those who take refuge with them, and do not feel for themselves any need for what is given them, and give them preference over themselves even if they are indigent.\" (Surah Al-Hashr, 59:9)\n\n3. **Contrast with Hypocrisy**: \n   The hadíth may also imply a contrast with the hypocrites who, in times of difficulty, do not support the Prophet or the community. Verses describe these hypocrites and their false pledges of loyalty, reflecting that genuine faith prevails in times of testing:\n   - \"Have you never considered the hypocrites? They say to their brethren among the people of the Book who do not believe: 'If you are driven out we shall go with you...'\" (Surah Al-Hashr, 59:12)\n\n4. **Cohesion of the Muslim Ummah**: \n   The idea also emphasizes the unity and strength found within the Muslim community, especially as it occurred in Medina. The Qur'an encourages believers to stand firm and loyal, referring to how the early community supported each other:\n   - \"And those who take God and His Prophet and the faithful as their friends are indeed men of God, who will surely be victorious.\" (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:55)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe hadeeth “Faith retreats to Madeenah” encapsulates the spiritual essence of the city as a haven for faith and a model for the Islamic community. Medina is portrayed not only as a physical location but also as an ideal of ethical and spiritual integrity, emphasizing support, genuine belief, and resilience in the face of adversity. This historical context and the supportive characteristics of the community are reinforced by the verses from the Qur'an that reflect these qualities and the nature of faith amidst challenges. \n\nThe relevance of this hadeeth is particularly paramount today as it encourages Muslims to foster communities rooted in mutual assistance and genuine belief, as found in the early days of Islam in Medina."
