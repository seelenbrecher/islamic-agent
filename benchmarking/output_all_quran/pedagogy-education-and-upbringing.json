        "question": "Is it wrong to feel more connected to an adopted child than to my own child?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.You should understand – may Allah keep you safe and sound – that it is possible, on the basis of real-life experience and rational thinking, for a father to form a bond with a child other than his own that is stronger than his bond with his own child, because of spending a great deal of time with him, or because the way the child acts and speaks indicates that the child is attached to that man in a manner that he does not see in his own child.\nIt is also possible that a child does not bond with his father, even if they live in the same house, either because the father treats him harshly or neglects him. These are natural feelings that fathers and children may feel in such circumstances.\nYet despite that, the natural inclination that Allah has instilled in people remains deeply rooted in the soul of the father and the soul of the son, and this prevents the father from becoming no more than a stranger like other people, and prevents the son from becoming a stranger like other children.\nNo matter what happens, this natural inclination that Allah has instilled in people will remain deep in your child’s heart, and he will not be able to ward it off or ignore it under any circumstances.\nMoreover, it will increase in strength and depth if you show love to him, let him know that you care for him and treat him kindly.\nThe point is that it is important for you to be a positive and active presence in your child’s life – in this situation – and you cannot do without that. So you should strive to see him regularly and do not stop visiting him, following his progress and showing him that you are keen to see him by all possible means.\nYou should also strive to show your love for him in words and deeds and in the way in which you interact with him.\nYou should show him that you appreciate him and praise him every time you meet him; you should encourage him, support his skills and hobbies that are dear to his heart, be gentle when advising him, and show him your disapproval in a gentle and loving manner when he behaves in a manner that is not appropriate.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In discussing the emotional bond one may feel toward an adopted child compared to a biological child, it's important to reference Islamic teachings regarding kinship and love. The Qur'an emphasizes the concept of blood relations and the distinction between them and adoptive relationships while still encouraging kindness and compassion towards all, including adopted individuals.\n\n### 1. Understanding Relation and Affection\n\nThe Qur'an explicitly states that adoptive sons are not the same as biological sons: \n\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:4-5)**: \"God has not provided two hearts in the breast of a man, nor made your wives, whom you pronounce 'mothers' (in order to divorce them), your real mothers, nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. This is only what your lips pronounce. God says what is just, and shows the right way. Call them by the names of their fathers. This is the right course in the sight of God...\" (Qur'an 33:4-5).\n\nThis verse clarifies that while adopted children may not share the same biological lineage, they still deserve love and kindness. The distinction must be made, but it does not diminish the emotional bond. \n\n### 2. Blood Relations\n\nMoreover, the Qur'an places emphasis on the importance of biological relationships:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:6)**: \"Yet blood relations are closer to one another according to God's decree, more than other believers and the emigrants.\" (Qur'an 33:6).\n\nThis verse indicates that biological ties carry a special significance, which might explain why one may feel more connected to their biological child. However, it does not imply that love for an adopted child is wrong; rather, it highlights the natural instinct to be more closely connected with blood relations.\n\n### 3. The Nature of Love and Kindness\n\nIslam teaches that love and kindness should be extended universally. It is not wrong to feel a strong emotional connection to an adopted child. Emotional attachment can often transcend biological ties, as bonds are built through love, care, and nurturance.\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233)**: \"... but fear God, and remember that God sees all that you do.\" (Qur'an 2:233).\n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of how we treat others, encouraging good relationships and care regardless of biological relations. \n\n### 4. The Exemplary Model of Adoption\n\nIn addition to these principles, we can look at historical examples within Islamic tradition. The story of Musā (Moses) illustrates that he was adopted by the family of Pharaoh, which emphasizes that relationships formed through care and nurturing can be significant:\n\n- **Surah Al-Qasas (28:8-9)** describes how the wife of Pharaoh saw potential in the baby Moses and chose to adopt him despite him being from a different background.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while it is natural according to Islamic teachings to feel a stronger connection with one's biological child due to the emphasis on blood relations, it is not wrong to feel deep affection for an adopted child. Islam encourages love, kindness, and care towards all, irrespective of biological ties. Emotional bonds can be strong and valid, and one should embrace these feelings without guilt. Both the biological child and the adopted child can be equally deserving of love in varying contexts, and such love is not in contradiction with Islamic teachings. The key takeaway is to act with kindness and compassion while acknowledging the distinct natures of these relationships. \n\nCitations obtained from:\n- Qur'an, Surah Al-Ahzab (33:4-6)\n- Qur'an, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233)\n- Qur'an, Surah Al-Qasas (28:8-9)"

        "question": "He Fears For His Kids in Non-Muslims Lands",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is no doubt that the situation your children have ended up in is the harsh and heavy price that families pay as a result of living in non-Muslim countries, whether in the West or the East, which ultimately leads to the children becoming westernized or easternized, or following whatever their desires dictate, in a direction far from the Religion of Allah and His pleasure; except for those whom my Lord has mercy upon; and they are few.\nFor benefit, please see the answer to question no. 52893 .\nSecondly:\nWhat you are considering, migrating to a Muslim country and leaving your family and children behind, is not the ideal solution; because it involves neglecting the trust and responsibility of raising children, which is a significant matter.\nFrom `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock: the ruler who governs the people is a shepherd and is responsible for them, a man is a shepherd over the members of his household and is responsible for them, a woman is a shepherd over her husband's house and children and is responsible for them, and a slave is a shepherd over his master's property and is responsible for it. So, all of you are shepherds and each of you is responsible for his flock.\" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (2554) and Muslim (1829).\nAnd from Ma`qil ibn Yasar, who said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) saying: \"There is no servant whom Allah has given responsibility over a flock, and he does not protect them with sincere advice, except that he will not find the fragrance of Paradise.\" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (7150) and Muslim (142).\nTherefore, your staying with your family, advising them, striving in their upbringing and guidance, falls under the reform mentioned in the words of Allah (translation of the meaning):\n{I only intend reform as much as I am able. And my success is not but through Allāh. Upon Him I have relied, and to Him I return.} Hud (88).\nA Muslim sometimes faces situations in life where he is between two goods and chooses the better of them, or between two evils and chooses the lesser of them.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\"The perfection of 'piety (scrupulousness)' is for a person to know the better of two goods and the worse of two evils, and to know that the Shari`ah is built upon achieving and perfecting benefits, and eliminating and minimizing harms. Otherwise, one who does not weigh the benefits and harms of an action or inaction according to the Shari`ah might neglect obligations and commit prohibitions.\" End quote from \"Majmu` al-Fatawa\" (10/512).\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\"The intelligent person should know that reason and Shari`ah mandate achieving and perfecting benefits and eliminating and minimizing harms. When an intelligent person faces a matter in which he sees both a benefit and a harm, he is obliged to do two things: a matter of knowledge and a matter of action. The matter of knowledge is to seek to understand which is more predominant between the two sides of benefit and harm. Once it becomes clear to him which is more predominant, he is obliged to choose what is better for him.\" End quote from \"Al-Da' wa Al-Dawa'\" (p. 491).\nIn conclusion:\nThe first thing you should do, if you are unable to reform them in your place and they do not agree to move with you to a better country, is to try to get custody of the younger ones, whom you can take care of, control, and reform, and bring them back to the path of their Religion as much as possible and within your capacity. Move with them to a Muslim country, where you can live among (Muslim) people and where you can reform their Religion.\nIf you are unable to do so, then move with them to another region, in the midst of a Muslim community, where you can be stronger in establishing your Religion for yourself and reforming your children as much as you can.\nHowever, in any case, we see that your leaving your children behind - if you are unable to migrate with them - leaving them in the hands of your wife, whose condition you have described, is a kind of neglecting the trust; and the better thing to do, if you are unable to move with them, is to stay with them as a guide, educator, and advisor, striving to reform them and yourself, and your wife as much as you can; until Allah provides relief and a way out for you and them, and enables you to improve them and guide them, or they grow up, and your authority over them ceases, and you are unable to return them or reform anything from them; then at that time, you are on your own; and every soul is held in pledge for what it has earned.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "When a Muslim parent feels concerned about their children living in non-Muslim lands, it can be an expression of their fears regarding the spiritual and moral upbringing of their children in an environment that may not align with Islamic values and teachings. This concern can be understood through various Quranic verses that highlight the importance of caring for one's family and the spiritual implications of the environments we inhabit.\n\n1. **Responsibility Toward Children**: Surah An-Nisa (4:9-13) emphasizes the importance of being mindful of what we leave behind for our children and the moral responsibilities that come with parenthood. It states, “Let people fear the day when they leave small children behind them unprovided, and how concerned they would be for them.\" This verse underscores the significance of ensuring that children are provided for, both materially and spiritually, which can be particularly challenging in non-Muslim contexts where different values may prevail (Quran 4:9).\n\n2. **The Nature of Friendships**: Surah Ali 'Imran (3:28-32) warns against having non-believers as close friends over fellow believers, indicating that such relationships can lead to compromising one's faith. The verse states, “Those who believe should not take unbelievers as their friends in preference to those who believe... But God commands you to beware of Him.” This serves as a cautionary note for parents to be vigilant about the influences their children may encounter in non-Muslim settings (Quran 3:28).\n\n3. **Insecurity and Fear of Poverty**: In Surah Al-Isra (17:31-35), Allah assures believers not to abandon their children out of fear of poverty, saying, “Do not abandon your children out of fear of poverty. We will provide for them and for you.” This reassurance can greatly alleviate parental anxiety regarding their children's wellbeing (Quran 17:31).\n\n4. **The Fragility of Life and Faith**: Surah Al-Hashr (59:16-18) depicts the danger of being influenced or failed by those who do not share one's faith. It states that the enemies will behave deceitfully and the hearts of those not anchored in faith are not reliable. For parents, this highlights the responsibility to guide their children in holding onto their Islamic faith amidst potentially negative influences in non-Muslim environments (Quran 59:16).\n\n5. **God's Protection**: Many verses reiterate that God is a protector and provider for those who are faithful. For instance, Surah An-Nisa (4:98) speaks about the mercy of God towards the weak who are unable to defend themselves, which can give parents confidence that their children, when raised with the right values, will be under God's protection (Quran 4:98).\n\nWhile concerns are valid, it is essential for Muslim parents to maintain a strong Islamic identity and actively foster an environment at home that promotes their values, regardless of external factors. They can draw encouragement and strength from the Quranic assurances of God’s presence and care, all while striving to instill a solid understanding of Islam in their children. Seeking community support and proper educational resources that align with their beliefs can also be beneficial in raising children in differing sociocultural contexts."

        "question": "Ruling on making a video cartoon series for children",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that it is forbidden to draw and make images of animate beings, whether that is by carving (statues) or on paper, fabric or anything else, and whether the image is realistic or imaginary, because of the stern warning concerning that which is narrated in the religious texts, such as the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The people who will be most severely punished on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5950) and Muslim (2109).\nBut an exception is made from that for images and three dimensional objects (toys) with which children play, because of the hadith of ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came back from the campaign to Tabuk or Khaybar and there was a curtain over her niche. The wind lifted the edge of the curtain and uncovered ‘A’ishah’s toy dolls. He said: “What is this, O ‘A’ishah?” She said: My dolls. He saw among them a horse with two wings made of cloth and he said: “What is this that I see in the midst of them?” She said: A horse. He said: “What is this that I see on it?” She said: Two wings. He said: “A horse with wings?” She said: Have you not heard that Sulayman had horses with wings? She said: And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) smiled so broadly that I saw his eyeteeth. Narrated by Abu Dawud (4932); classed as sahih by al-‘Iraqi in Takhrij al-Ihya’ (2/344) and by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari (10/527): This hadith is quoted as evidence that it is permissible to keep dolls and toys for girls to play with. This is an exception from the general prohibition on keeping images. This was stated definitively by ‘Iyad, who narrated it from the majority of scholars, and said that they permitted the sale of dolls to girls for the purpose of training them from a young age to take care of their houses and their children. End quote.\nThis indicates that it is permissible for children to make these three-dimensional objects themselves, or for them to be made for children.\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with producing cartoons for children, if they are free of haram things such as music, because of the proven concession regarding images for children, and because making such films in accordance with Islamic guidelines helps to reduce evil and occupies children with that which is beneficial or permissible.\nThere is nothing wrong with making a lion-type baby character, and giving it eyes and a nose.\nDr. Ahmad al-Qadi (may Allah preserve him) said: I asked our shaykh [i.e., Ibn ‘Uthaymin, may Allah have mercy on him]: What is the ruling on educational cartoons for children, such as the movie Muhammad al-Fatih?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with that, because it is beneficial, and because it will distract them from things that would harm them…\"(Thamarat at-Tadwin min Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: I hope that you can explain to me the ruling on buying videos if there are cartoons in them, noting that these cartoons are for a good purpose and benefit children. And is the ruling different if the images are static (not moving) or animated (moving), or not?\nHe replied: With regard to these movies which contain beneficial material, and benefit children and keep them away from things that are worse than them, if there is no other alternative, then undoubtedly they are less serious than indecent movies, and concessions are granted for children with regard to leisure and play that are not granted to adults. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and his family) granted a concession to ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) allowing her to play with dolls, because he married her when she was young. When he married her she was six years old, and he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine years old, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the best of people to his family. He would allow her to play with these toys. Thus a concession is granted to children that is not granted to adults. So if a person buys movies which entertain children and do not contain any haram elements, there is nothing wrong with that.(Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri, no. 47).\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: Many toys contain images of animate beings drawn by hand, and the purpose behind them is usually to educate the child, such as those that are found in talking books. Is that permissible?\nHe replied: If that is for the purpose of entertaining children, then the scholars who permitted toys for children also permitted such images, on the grounds that these images are not exactly like the images in which Allah created the creatures that are depicted, as is clear from what I see before me, so the matter is not that serious.\"(Majmu‘ Fatawa wa Rasa’il al-‘Uthaymin  12/339).\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible to make a cartoon series on the internet and to design an animated character to answer questions, if that is specifically for children, because of the concession allowing that, as noted above. And there is nothing wrong with receiving payment for that, because whatever is permissible to make or produce, it is permissible to sell it or rent it out.\nTo sum up:\nIt is permissible to make a cartoon video series for children, if it is for a good purpose and is free of haram things such as music or spreading deviant ideas and beliefs.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether it is permissible to create a video cartoon series for children in Islam can be explored by considering relevant principles derived from the Qur'an as well as the appropriateness of content for children. Here, I will discuss the key principles that may guide such a decision, supported by specific verses.\n\n### 1. **Content Appropriateness and Morality**\n\nOne of the fundamental principles emphasized in the Qur'an is the need to avoid shameful acts and immoral content. The creator of a children's series must ensure that the themes, narratives, and visuals are suitable for young audiences and do not promote conduct or ideas contrary to Islamic ethics.\n\n**Relevant Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-An'am (6:151)** - \"Tell them: 'Come, I will read out what your Lord has made binding on you: That you make none the equal of God, and be good to your parents, and do not abandon your children out of poverty, for We give you food and We shall provide for them; and avoid what is shameful, whether open or hidden...'\"\n\nThis verse highlights the importance of avoiding shameful content and underlines the moral responsibility of providing good examples, especially for children who are impressionable.\n\n### 2. **Positive Representation and Guidance**\n\nThe Qur'an emphasizes the significance of nurturing a positive relationship with children and ensuring their well-being. The content of any children's show should guide them toward good behavior and moral values, including kindness, respect for parents, and honesty.\n\n**Relevant Verses:**\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:5)** - \"Do not entrust (their) property God has given you to maintain (On trust), to those who are immature; but feed them and clothe them from it, and speak to them with kindness.\"\n  \nThis encourages the nurturing of young minds with positive messages that foster a sense of care, compassion, and ethical behavior.\n\n### 3. **Avoiding Fear and Promoting Hope**\n\nThe Qur'an advises against instilling fear in children. Instead, fostering a sense of security, hope, and trust in God will guide their understanding of faith and life.\n\n**Relevant Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Isra (17:31)** - \"Do not abandon your children out of fear of poverty. We will provide for them and for you...\"\n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of positivity and reassurance, which can be integrated into the content of a children’s series.\n\n### 4. **Educational Content**\n\nThe series can serve an educational purpose, imparting knowledge and wisdom aligned with Islamic teachings. The Qur'an emphasizes learning and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\n**Relevant Verses:**\n- **Surah Al-Ankabut (29:69)** - \"And those who strive for Us, We will surely guide them to Our ways...\"\n\nThis verse underscores the importance of striving for understanding and knowledge, which can be an integral theme in the series.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCreating a video cartoon series for children is permissible in Islam, provided that the content adheres to Islamic values and principles, avoids any immoral or shameful themes, and promotes positive behavior, kindly interactions, and educational content. It is crucial to aim for a nurturing and supportive portrayal that aligns with Islamic teachings while engaging the curiosity of young audiences.\n\nFor any specific concerns, such as particular contents or themes of the series, consulting knowledgeable scholars or educators in the community may provide additional insight and guidance tailored to those issues."

        "question": "How should fathers and mothers deal with their children’s questions having to do with pregnancy and how it comes about?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is very beneficial for the parents to show interest in their children’s questions, regardless of what the parents really think of these questions, then they should not behave as if these questions are causing some sort of embarrassment to them, so that the child will not develop some kind of sensitivity regarding some issues that he is asking about.\nWith regard to the question mentioned here, the mother could refer in her answer to Allah the Creator and His might, and how He can bring forth the living from the dead, and bring forth the dead from the living; how Allah created Adam from dust, then created his offspring and children after that in the bellies of their mothers; and how the might of Allah, may He be exalted, is manifested in making the belly, even though it contains what it contains, a suitable place for the foetus to live in for a while; and that the foetus goes through stages from a nutfah (sperm drop) to a ‘alaqah (blood clot) to a mudghah (chewed piece of flesh), shaped and unshaped.\nThus the mother will shift the conversation to speaking of Allah’s might, His power of creation, His care, His wisdom and how He guarantees provision to the foetus in its mother’s belly, even though this foetus is powerless and its mother has no control at all over its provision. And the mother can speak of how Allah has allocated a particular length of time for the foetus to remain in the mother’s belly, then by His might He brings the baby forth from his mother’s belly, as He brings forth the chick from the egg.\nSimilarly, the mother could answer her child’s question, at this age, by giving general answers so that the child will be able to understand what he hears, and it will undoubtedly be correct information. It is good to support the answer with appropriate verses from the Holy Qur’an, so as to shift the conversation to a different category altogether, and spare the mother from having to give blunt, embarrassing and sensitive answers, and also to avoid giving incorrect information.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "When addressing questions that children may have about pregnancy and its origins, it is essential for parents to approach the topic with care, honesty, and a level of appropriateness for their children's age and understanding. The Quran provides guidance on the importance of nurturing, respect, and the responsibilities associated with parenthood, which can be foundational when discussing sensitive topics like pregnancy.\n\n### 1. **Importance of Nurturing and Understanding**\nThe Quran emphasizes the bond between parents and children, and the responsibilities of parents toward their offspring. For instance, the Quran states:\n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233)**: \"Mothers may breastfeed their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period]. Upon the father is their provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable... And upon the father is their provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable...\" \n\nThis verse not only establishes the nurturing role of the mother but also implies the father's responsibility, indicating that discussions about pregnancy should occur within a context of care and mutual respect.\n\n### 2. **Addressing Questions with Honesty**\nWhen children ask about pregnancy, parents should answer truthfully while framing their responses in a manner that matches the child's comprehension level. Using simple language and concepts, parents can explain the biological aspects of how babies are conceived and born, integrating it with an understanding of the emotional and communal aspects of family life.\n\nFor example, **Surah An-Nur (24:59)** mentions the stages of growth and development, and while it mainly pertains to older children reaching puberty, it sets a context for a respectful and gracious learning atmosphere about human development and relationships.\n\n- **Surah An-Nur (24:59)**: \"When your children reach the age of puberty, they should ask permission to enter... that is how Allah makes clear His commandments to you so that you may understand.\"\n\nThis verse underlines the importance of communication between parents and children, encouraging open discussions about changes and milestones in life.\n\n### 3. **Modeling Respect and Responsibility**\nChildren can learn about the responsibilities of parenthood through the education provided by their parents. The Quran encourages good behavior and respect towards parents:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ahqaf (46:15)**: \"...We have enjoined upon man, [care] for his parents. But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. To Me is your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do.\"\n\nBy modeling good relations and responsibilities, parents can demonstrate the values of care and respect, thus setting a practical example when discussing the matter of pregnancy and family.\n\n### 4. **Utilizing Proper Timing and Context**\nParents could choose appropriate moments in daily life to educate their children about the human body's functions and the beauty of God’s creation in human development. The discussion should be initiated gently and perhaps sparked by a consistent inquiry from the child. Providing context about human life as a gift from God can make these discussions more meaningful.\n\n### 5. **Reinforcing The Concept of God's Creation**\nFinally, parents can relate discussions about pregnancy to the broader concept of God's plan and creation. They can explain that children, as part of a family, are blessings and serve a greater purpose in life.\n\n- **Surah Al-Imran (3:36)**: \"When she delivered her, she said, 'My Lord, indeed I have delivered a female.' And Allah was most Knowing of what she delivered...\"\n\nThis verse reflects how the Quran acknowledges the unique attributes and roles of each child. Parents can invoke such verses to celebrate birth and creation.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn dealing with children’s questions about pregnancy, parents should provide answers in a loving, respectful, and truthful manner, using the guidance of the Quran. Emphasizing care, respect, and shared understanding will not only help children grasp the concept of pregnancy but also reinforce the familial bonds and responsibilities implied in the teachings of Islam."

        "question": "Will the maternal uncle be brought to account for the immodesty of his sister’s daughters?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe maternal uncle has no guardianship over his sister’s daughters if their father is still alive\nThe maternal uncle has no guardianship over his sister’s daughters if their father is still alive, is of sound mind, is accountable and is present. It is well known that care of children is a duty on parents so long as they are alive, and they are the ones who are responsible before Allah, may He be exalted, for taking care of them and bringing them up.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. The ruler of the people is in a position of responsibility and is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care. A woman is in a position of responsibility over her husband’s house and children and is answerable for those under her care. The slave is in a position of responsibility over his master’s wealth and is answerable for it. Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2554) and Muslim (1829).\nBut the maternal uncle has a responsibility with regard to enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong. So if he sees his sister’s children doing something wrong, he must rebuke them.\nIt was narrated that Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever among you sees an evil deed, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim (49).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the Prophet’s words “let him change it,” this is in the sense that doing this is obligatory, according to the consensus of the ummah. The obligation to enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong is in accordance with the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the consensus of the ummah. It is also part of that sincere advice (naseehah) which is Islam.\nEnd quote from Sharh Saheeh Muslim (2/22).\nSecondly:\nDoes the maternal uncle have the right to discipline his sister’s children?\nIn a situation such as this, the maternal uncle does not have the right to smack his sister’s children, because disciplining them by smacking them is only the right of the father or the one who has guardianship over the child, as appointed by the father or by the judge of an Islamic court.\nIt says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (10/25):\nIt is permissible for the father or mother to smack their child by way of disciplining him, and the same applies to the one who is appointed as the child’s guardian…\nAs for the teacher, he may obtain the authority from the child’s guardian to discipline the child. End quote.\nBut if the father knows what the maternal uncle is doing and keeps quiet about it, then this is approval on his part of what the uncle is doing, so it is like delegating the uncle to educate and discipline them as he sees fit.\nIn some families, the maternal uncle has a status that allows him to discipline the children, and this is a matter of custom that people acknowledge and do not object to it.\nBut if the father objects to what the maternal uncle is doing, then the uncle should limit his involvement to offering advice [to the children], and he should also offer advice to the father and mother, because this is their responsibility regarding their daughters, and they are the ones who have the authority to prevent their daughters from wearing haraam clothing by force.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, accountability for actions and behavior is individual and personal. Therefore, a maternal uncle is not held accountable for the immodesty or actions of his sister's daughters. Each person is judged based on their own actions as emphasized throughout the Quran.\n\n### Personal Accountability in the Quran\nOne of the key principles in Islam is that every individual is responsible for their own deeds. This is supported by verses in the Quran that emphasize personal responsibility and the idea that no one bear the burden of another. \n\n**1. Surah Al-Anfal (8:53)**\n- \"And this is because Allah would not change a favor which He had bestowed upon a people until they change what is within themselves. And indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing.\"\n- This verse highlights that individuals will change (or face consequences) based on their own actions and internal states. \n\n**2. Surah Al-Isra (17:15)**\n- \"And whoever strives, he strives only for himself. Indeed, Allah is Free from need of the worlds.\"\n- This verse reinforces that one's striving or actions are for their own benefit or detriment, not for others.\n\n### Accountability for Family Members\nWhile relatives may influence one another, Islam explicitly states that a person cannot be held accountable for the actions of someone else. For instance, God has set clear parameters regarding individual responsibility and consequences. \n\n**3. Surah Al-Najm (53:38-39)**\n- \"And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives. And that his effort is going to be seen.\"\n- These verses further clarify that accountability lies with individual effort and actions, not with those of family or others.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn terms of accountability for actions related to modesty or immodesty, a maternal uncle is not responsible for the behavior of his sister's daughters. Each individual is accountable for their own actions. Thus, from an Islamic perspective based on the cited verses, it is clear that accountability is personal and cannot be transferred to family members."

        "question": "How can this student keep away from other students who are a bad influence?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.First of all, it is essential to differentiate between mere supposition and imagination, and what it is feared may actually happen. Not everyone who makes friends with someone who is younger than him has bad intentions, unless he is known for doing bad things or he is not someone who is known for being righteous, in which case it is essential to be careful and take precautions.\nIn that case, what may be done is the following:\n\nAlert his family and urge them to keep an eye their son and watch his behaviour, whilst trying to get to know his friends better.\nExplain to him in a convincing manner the danger of making friends with such people, and the necessity of keeping away from them, whilst informing him of the intentions that some of them may have in making friends with him.\nExplain to the students as a whole the rulings having to do with the ‘awrah and the obligation to cover it and guard it from people in general, and the obligation to avert the gaze, and to beware of mixing with bad friends.\nAddress those young men directly and advise them, and explain to them the warnings that the scholars gave against making friends with beardless youths, the danger of looking at them, and that the opinion of the scholars is that it is unlawful to look with desire at the face of a good-looking beardless young man; in fact some of the scholars stated that it is unlawful to look at him at all.\n\nAn-Nawawi said: The evidence for that is that is some ways he is like a woman, because he is desired as a woman is desired, and his appearance is beautiful like that of a woman. In fact, many of them may even be better looking than many women; indeed the prohibition may be more applicable to them for another reason, which is that in their case the ways of evil are more available than in the case of women.\nEnd quote. Sharh Saheeh Muslim (4/31).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The one who looks repeatedly at a beardless young man and the like, or persists in looking, and says, I am not looking with desire, is not to be believed, because if he has no reason for which he needs to look at him, then persisting in looking at him can only be interpreted as the result of the pleasure he finds in that. As for an accidental glance, it is pardoned if he then averts his gaze.\nEnd quote. Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (15/419).\n\nIf nothing of the sort is happening, but you still fear for him, then advise his family to move him to another circle, so as to keep him away from those mischief-makers.\n\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "To keep away from other students who are a bad influence, a student can draw upon several teachings from the Quran. The guidance provided in these verses emphasizes the importance of companionship, discernment regarding one's social circle, and aligning oneself with individuals who foster faith and righteousness. Here are some relevant insights and supporting verses:\n\n### 1. **Selecting Companions Wisely**\nThe Quran advises believers to be cautious about their associations, particularly with those who do not share their values. In Surah Ali 'Imran (3:28-32), it states:\n\n> \"Those who believe should not take unbelievers as their friends in preference to those who believe -- and whoever does so should have no expectation of God -- unless to safeguard yourselves against them...\"  \n> (Surah Ali 'Imran, 3:28)\n\nThis verse emphasizes the need to prioritize friendships with those who share your faith and morals, and to remain mindful of the potential for negative influences from those who do not.\n\n### 2. **Avoiding Unjust Company**\nSurah Al-An'am (6:68-72) advises believers to withdraw from those who argue against God's messages:\n\n> \"When you see them argue about Our messages, withdraw from their company until they begin to talk of other things.\"  \n> (Surah Al-An'am, 6:68)\n\nThis implies that if certain students are promoting harmful or contrary beliefs, it is prudent to distance oneself from them.\n\n### 3. **Response to Mischief-Makers**\nBelievers are encouraged to avoid companions who deride and are frivolous regarding their faith. In Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:9), it says:\n\n> \"He only forbids you from making friends with those who fought over faith with you and banished you from your homes...\"  \n> (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60:9)\n\nThis suggests that friendships with those who could potentially lead one away from their faith are to be avoided.\n\n### 4. **The Nature of Companionship**\nSurah Al-Jathiyah (45:19-23) mentions that wicked individuals may be friends with one another:\n\n> \"Surely the wicked are each other's friends, but God befriends those who fear and follow the right path.\"  \n> (Surah Al-Jathiyah, 45:19)\n\nThis verse reinforces the importance of surrounding oneself with individuals who embody righteousness.\n\n### 5. **Effect of Bad Company**\nMoreover, in Surah Al-Mu’minun (23:96-100), it articulates that good deeds can dispel evil:\n\n> \"Dispel evil with what is good...\"  \n> (Surah Al-Mu’minun, 23:96)\n\nThis underscores a proactive approach: while it's essential to avoid bad influences, one should also focus on engaging positively with those of good character.\n\n### 6. **Seeking God’s Guidance**\nLastly, staying connected with God is crucial for maintaining a steadfast path. In Surah Ali 'Imran (3:118-122), it warns believers about trusting those who do not genuinely wish them well:\n\n> \"O believers, do not make others except your own people your confidants. They will spare no effort to ruin you...\"  \n> (Surah Ali 'Imran, 3:118)\n\nThis is a call to remain vigilant and discerning regarding relationships, maintaining one's reliance on God for guidance and strength.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo avoid negative influences from peers, the student should engage closely with friends who encourage positive behaviors, uphold the values of faith, and strive to excel in righteousness. The advice laid out in these Quranic verses promotes careful consideration of friendships and the value of surrounding oneself with righteous individuals while seeking God’s guidance in all matters."

        "question": "What is the best approach to provide a proper Islamic education?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is obvious to anyone who reflects that there has arisen a division and separation between knowledge and action, between knowledge and proper manners and attitudes, in the minds of many of the ordinary people and of the elite. As a result of that, many of them think that the issue of good manners and morals is purely theoretical, and that it is connected to the parents’ ability to fill their children’s minds with all kinds of knowledge and memorisation of texts, in addition to their efforts to acquire and read the greatest possible number of books and research material that discuss approaches to teaching morals and manners, and the like – to the extent that in their minds, dealing with Islamic texts has become something purely theoretical and academic, without thinking that those texts should have an impact on people’s behaviour and attitude, and on their deeds and actions.\nOne example of that is their interpretation of the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge” [Faatir 35:28]. They interpret this verse as referring to everyone who has knowledge of shar‘i rulings, or of empirical science, even though the verse does not mean that every knowledgeable person fears Allah; rather it means that everyone who fears Allah is knowledgeable.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (7/539):\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge” [Faatir 35:28]. This indicates that everyone who fears Allah has knowledge, and this is true; it does not indicate that everyone who has knowledge fears Him. End quote.\nElsewhere (7/21), he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant is that no one fears Him except one who has knowledge. Allah tells us that everyone who fears Allah has knowledge, as He says in another verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing [in prayer], fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]? Say, ‘Are those who know equal to those who do not know?’” [az-Zumar 39:9].\nEnd quote.\nThis second verse is the other verse to which Shaykh al-Islam was referring, and which is misinterpreted as being praise for knowledge and understanding, even if they are disassociated from righteous deeds and good manners and attitude. That is because they quote the last part of the verse, and not the first part. The words “Say, ‘Are those who know equal to those who do not know?’” are to be understood in the light of what comes before them: “Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing [in prayer], fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]?” Therefore “those who know”, in this instance, are those who stand and pray to Allah during the night, out of fear of His fire and hoping for His paradise and His mercy; those who do not know are who are heedless of that, so think about this! Hence Imam Ibn al-Qayyim said in Miftaah Dar as-Sa‘aadah (1/89), affirming an important guideline in this regard:\nThe early generations only used the word fiqh (lit., understanding) to refer to knowledge accompanied by action (and not just theoretical knowledge). End quote.\nThis is the real meaning of fiqh according to our righteous predecessors: Knowledge which is accompanied by action. But when many daa‘iyahs and educators overlooked this fact, they ended up focusing on knowledge as something theoretical and academic, and they did not think of it as a means of correcting behaviour, purifying hearts, striving against one’s evil inclinations and developing right attitudes, because they thought that the academic side of knowledge and fiqh was all there was to it and was all that one should seek – but that is not the case.\nRaising the young generation and teaching them good morals and attitudes, and how to adhere to religious teachings, is something that cannot be achieved except by pious people, whether they are scholars, daa‘iyahs, reformers or teachers. The word translated here as pious scholar (rabbaani) refers to one who is greatly devoted to the Lord, may He be glorified, in his knowledge, his deeds and his teaching of others.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“…but [instead, he would say], ‘Be pious scholars of the Lord because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:79].\nImam ash-Shawkaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fat-h al-Qadeer (1/407):\nThe word translated here as pious scholar (rabbaani) refers to one who is devoted to the Lord (ar-Rabb). The suffix -aani is added by way of emphasis, just as one who has a large beard (lihyah) may be described as lihyaani, and so on.\nAnd it was said that the pious scholar (rabbaani) is the one who teaches the people minor issues of knowledge before major issues, as if he is following the approach of the Lord, may He be glorified, in making things easy.\nEnd quote.\nConclusion:\nEducation is not mere words that have no impact on people’s behaviour and attitude, and it is not mere theory separated from belief. Rather the aim of education is to help the student to develop a strong character, and to both acquire knowledge and develop patience, acquire understanding and develop wisdom, so that he acts upon what he learns and teaches others about it.\nHence Imam ash-Shawkaani said regarding the words “because of what you have taught of the Scripture [bima kuntum tu‘allimoona al-kitaab]” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:79]:\nThose who read it as tu‘allimoona [so that the phrase means: because of what you have taught of the Scripture] must interpret the word rabbaani [translated above as pious scholar] as meaning one who has something in addition to knowledge and teaching; he should also be sincere or wise or patient.\nThose who read it as ta‘lamoona [so that the phrase would mean: because of what you know of the Scripture] may interpret the word rabbaani as meaning a knowledgeable person who teaches the people. Thus the meaning is: be teachers, for you have knowledge, and because you have studied knowledge.\nThis verse offers the greatest motivation for the one who has knowledge to act upon his knowledge, and one of the best ways of implementing what one knows is to teach it and to be sincere to Allah, may He be glorified.\"(Fat-h al-Qadeer  1/407)\nThus it becomes clear that the essence and foundation of proper education is to educate by example, not by mere empty words that are detached from one’s behaviour and deeds.\nHence al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his interesting essay, Fadl ‘Ilm as-Salaf ‘ala ‘Ilm al-Khalaf (p. 5):\nMany seekers of knowledge among the later generations got it wrong when they thought that one who speaks a great deal about issues of religion, and argues and debates, is more knowledgeable than one who is not like that. This is pure ignorance; look at the senior Sahaabah and the most knowledgeable among them, such as Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Ali, Mu‘aadh, Ibn Mas‘ood and Zayd ibn Thaabit, and how they were. They spoke less than Ibn ‘Abbaas, but they had more knowledge than he did.\nSimilarly, the Taabi‘een spoke more than the Sahaabah, but the Sahaabah had more knowledge than they did.\nSimilarly, the followers of the Taabi‘een spoke more than the Taabi‘een, but the Taabi‘een had more knowledge than they did.\nKnowledge does not mean memorising a lot of religious texts or speaking a great deal in khutbahs and lessons; rather knowledge is a light that is instilled in the heart, by means of which a person may understand issues on the basis of truth and be able to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and he expresses that in concise words that serve the purpose. End quote.\nThis is the greatest calamity that has befallen Muslim households and educational institutions, namely their lack of righteous and pious teachers who could educate and guide them by example, not only by their words, and when teaching would be able to combine sound words and sound deeds, using a wise approach and proper understanding of the religion of Allah, may He be exalted, and what He wants from His slaves.\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt should be understood that this education is like a seed and the educator is like the soil; if the soil is of poor quality, then the seed will be lost and wasted, but if the soil is good, the seed will grow and develop.\"(Al-Adaab ash-Shar‘iyyah by Ibn Muflih 3/580).\nBecause of the above, some of the scholars and reformers were able to raise righteous children and teach them good morals and attitudes, and many fuqaha’ and educators were able to discipline their students. Here we may confirm that there is a limit to causes and measures that may be taken, and all matters are to be entrusted to the Lord of Lords, the Creator of people’s deeds, the One Who guides to the straight path. All that educators and parents can do is discipline their children and teach them morals and manners. As for making a person truly righteous and purifying his heart, no one can do that except Allah.\nHence it is said that all that parents can do is teach their children good manners; righteousness may be attained by the help of Allah.\"(Al-Adaab ash-Shar‘iyyah by Ibn Muflih 3/552)\nFinally:\nThe way to achieve this, realistically, may be summed up in a few brief points:\n1. Daa‘iyahs and teachers should be made aware of what education means in a comprehensive sense.\n2.Reformers who work with ordinary Muslims should be made aware of various approaches to education.\n3.Reformers should cooperate with people of virtue and prominence in Muslim societies to establish educational institutions that focus on manners and behaviour, to work in conjunction with existing educational institutions, and to train some people to carry on the mission of educating people and teaching them proper manners, morals and behaviour.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Providing a proper Islamic education is a multifaceted endeavor, one that involves teaching both spiritual and practical aspects of life according to Islamic principles. Here are several key approaches supported by Quranic verses:\n\n### 1. **Teach the Faith (Iman) and Acts of Worship (Ibadaat)**\n\nThe foundation of Islamic education lies in reinforcing the core beliefs of the faith and the obligatory acts of worship. This includes teaching about the oneness of God (Tawhid), the Prophets, the Quran, prayer (Salah), fasting (Sawm), charity (Zakat), and pilgrimage (Hajj). \n\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:177)** states, \"Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is in one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, and the Prophets and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zakat; [those who fulfill their] promise when they promise; and [those who are] patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous.\"\n\n### 2. **Encourage Moral Character and Good Conduct**\n\nIn addition to teaching the religious obligations, it’s essential to emphasize moral character, ethics, and good conduct. The education should instill values such as honesty, compassion, patience, and justice.\n\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:35)** highlights the characteristics of righteous believers: \"Indeed, the Muslim men and women, the believing men and women, the devout men and women, the truthful men and women, the patient men and women, the humble men and women, the charitable men and women, the fasting men and women, the men and women who guard their private parts, and those who remember Allah often—Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward.\"\n\n### 3. **Focus on Kindness and Compassion**\n\nAn essential aspect of Islamic education is nurturing kindness and compassion among individuals, particularly toward family, orphans, and the community.\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:36)** states, \"Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents, do good, and to relatives, orphans, the needy, the near neighbor, the neighbor farther away, the companion at your side, and those whom your right hands possess. Indeed, Allah does not like those who are self-deluding and boastful.\"\n\n### 4. **Promote Critical Thinking and Knowledge Acquisition**\n\nIslam encourages seeking knowledge and wisdom, promoting the understanding that learning is a lifelong journey. \n\n- **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:11)** teaches the value of knowledge: \"Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do.\"\n\n### 5. **Encourage Community Values and Cooperation**\n\nIslamic education should advocate for collective well-being, helping students understand their role in the community and society at large.\n\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2)** encourages cooperation in goodness and piety: \"O you who have believed, do not violate the rites of Allah or the sacred month or the sacrificial animals or the garlands. And do not let your hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness.\"\n\n### 6. **Utilize Family and Home as a Base of Education**\n\nThe family is the primary unit of education, and parents are encouraged to provide moral and spiritual guidance from a young age. This starts with basic Islamic teachings and practices in the home.\n\n- **Surah An-Nur (24:31)** encourages families to nurture modesty and respect among members, especially in the presence of the opposite gender.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the best approach to providing an Islamic education revolves around instilling faith, nurturing good character, promoting knowledge, understanding community responsibilities, and utilizing the home as a primary source of learning. These principles ensure that educational efforts are balanced and rooted in the foundational teachings of Islam, as illustrated through various verses in the Quran. In establishing such an educational framework, one can foster a strong Islamic identity and ethical culture."

        "question": "Serious consequences of falling short in raising children",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Just as the parents have rights over their children, so too the children have rights over their parents.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, over which are [appointed] angels, harsh and severe; they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded”\n[at-Tahreem 66:6].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her flock…” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (893) and Muslim (1829).\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no person whom Allah puts in charge of others, and when he dies he is insincere to his subjects, but Allah will forbid Paradise to him.” Narrated by Muslim (142).\nTherefore children have rights over their parents to which the parents must pay attention. These rights are many and include the following:\n1. A man must choose a good wife for himself and a woman must choose a good husband for herself. A man should choose a woman who will be a good mother for his children in the future, and a woman should choose a man who will be a good father to her children.\n2. Giving the child a good name, taking care of him, and fulfilling his basic needs of food, drink, clothing and accommodation, according to what one can afford, without falling short or being extravagant.\n3. One of the most important rights that children have over their parents is that they should give them a good upbringing and take care of them, paying attention to their manners and behaviour, and their practice of their religion in a manner that is pleasing to Allah, and following up with them regarding worldly matters in such a way that will help them to live a dignified and righteous life.\nMany parents fall short with regard to this duty that they owe to their children, then they suffer the consequences of their falling short, which is defiant disobedience from their children, and the children’s mistreatment of them.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhoever neglects to teach his child that which will benefit him, and leaves him without any guidance, has wronged him gravely. Most children’s deviance is because of their parents and the parents’ neglect and failure to teach them the obligatory religious duties and the sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so they neglected them when they were small.…\nHow many are the parents who were the cause of their children’s misfortune and suffering in this world and the hereafter, because of their negligence and failure to discipline the child, and their encouraging and helping him to pursue his whims and desires. By doing that, they think that they are being kind to the child, at the time when they are disgracing him, and they think that they are showing mercy to him at the time when they are wronging him. Thus the child will be of no benefit to his parent, and the parent is the cause of the child’s misfortune and of his missing out on opportunities for success in this world and the hereafter…\nIf you think of the causes of children’s misguidance and corruption, you will see that it is mostly the fault of the parents.\nEnd quote from Tuhfat al-Mawdood bi Ahkaam al-Mawlood (p. 229, 242).\nIt should be noted that if the father and mother fall short in raising their child, that does not mean that the child should fall short in his duties towards his parents and mistreat them; rather he has to treat them kindly and forgive any mistreatment on their part towards him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and to parents, good treatment”\n[al-Isra’ 17:23]\n“But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them but accompany them in [this] world with appropriate kindness”\n[Luqmaan 31:15].\nFor more information on the rights of children over their parents, please see question no. 20064.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The responsibilities of parents in raising children are of utmost importance in Islam, and falling short in these duties can have serious spiritual and social consequences. Here is a thorough exploration of this issue, supported by relevant Quranic verses.\n\n### Serious Consequences of Neglecting Responsibilities towards Children\n\n1. **Fear of Abandonment**: The Quran warns against neglecting the responsibilities towards children. It emphasizes the gravity of the fear of abandoning one's offspring due to economic concerns. Surah Al-Isra (17:31) states: \n   > \"Do not abandon your children out of fear of poverty. We will provide for them and for you. Killing them is certainly a great wrong.\"  \n   This verse indicates that neglecting children can lead to dire consequences, including moral corruption and divine disapproval.\n\n2. **Accountability for Orphans**: Surah An-Nisa (4:9) expresses the importance of treating orphans and vulnerable children with care, reinforcing that those who neglect them will be questioned on the Day of Judgment: \n   > \"Let people fear the day when they leave small children behind them unprovided, and how concerned they would be for them. So fear God and say the right things to them.\"  \n   This highlights that neglecting the well-being of children directly correlates with accountability before God.\n\n3. **Consequences of Dishonesty**: If a parent fails in providing for their children, whether materially or ethically, it can lead to exploitation or unjust behavior towards the children, particularly concerning their inheritance. In Surah An-Nisa (4:10), it is stated: \n   > \"Those who devour the possessions of the orphans unjustly devour only fire, and will surely burn in Hell.\"  \n   The consequences of such unethical behavior are severe in this life and the Hereafter.\n\n4. **Divine Justice and Accountability**: The neglect of children's rights can lead to a breakdown in familial relationships and societal structures. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:233) underscores the nurturing role that parents must play in assuring their children's needs are met:\n   > \"The mothers should suckle their babies for a period of two years for those (fathers) who wish that they should complete the suckling... But fear God, and remember that God sees all that you do.\"\n   This indicates a fundamental obligation to care for one’s children, reflecting God's overarching witness over human actions.\n\n5. **Social Responsibility and Community Welfare**: Parents are urged to provide not only for their own children but also for orphans and the needy in their community. Surah An-Nisa (4:8) says:\n   > \"And when the relatives and orphans and the needy collect at the time of the division (of property) provide for them too, and talk kindly to them.\"\n   This nurtures a sense of communal responsibility, and ignoring these responsibilities can lead to societal decay.\n\n6. **Consequences of Disbelief**: Surah Ali 'Imran (3:116) warns that ignoring the spiritual education of children can lead to disbelief, which will lead to eternal consequences: \n   > \"As for those who disbelieve, neither wealth nor children will avail them in the least against God. They are the residents of Hell where they will live forever.\"\n   This emphasizes the need for parents to nurture faith in their children as part of their upbringing, as neglecting this can lead to dire consequences in the Hereafter.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the Holy Quran makes it explicitly clear that parents have serious responsibilities towards their children that encompass not only material support but also moral, ethical, and spiritual training. Neglecting these duties can lead to severe social and spiritual consequences, both in this life and in the Hereafter. The Quran insists on accountability, urging parents to recognize their roles and act with justice and compassion towards their children. Thus, thorough attention to raising children is fundamental for the integrity of families, communities, and ultimately, for the individual's standing before God."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The ways in which you can give up watching movies: you can \n    achieve that by means of several things that were mentioned by the scholars \n    and educators, such as the following: \n\n    1.Finding out about the shar‘i \n    ruling, which has been discussed previously in many answers.\n\n    2.Bearing in mind that Allah, may \n    He be exalted, is always watching and that He knows what is secret and is \n    even more hidden. One of the early generation was asked about what they did \n    that help them to lower their gaze and refrain from looking at haraam \n    things. He said: By knowing that Allah sees you more quickly than you see \n    what you are looking at.\n\n    3.Righteous friends who will \n    remind you if you forget and alert you if you are heedless. They are close \n    friends who love one another for the sake of Allah and you are brought \n    together in obedience to Allah, may He be exalted. Allah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): “Friends on \n    that Day will be foes one to another, save those who kept their duty (to \n    Allah)” [al-Zukhruf 43:67]. That is the good companion whom the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) likened to the bearer of \n    musk. It was narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    said: “The likeness of a good companion and a bad companion is that of one \n    who carries musk and one who works the bellows. With the carrier of musk, \n    either he will give you some or you will buy some from him, or you will \n    notice a good smell from him; as for the one who works the bellows, either \n    he will burn your clothes or you will notice a bad smell from him.”\n\n    4.Keeping yourself busy with \n    things will benefit you in religious and worldly terms. You should have a \n    daily wird that you recite; memorize the Book of Allah; study some books by \n    the scholars or listen to them, and busy yourself with things that are \n    beneficial and serve the people and society.\n\n    5.Marriage, which is what the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recommended to help lower \n    their gaze and guard chastity, as he said: “O young men, whoever among you \n    can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the \n    gaze and guarding one’s chastity. And whoever cannot afford it, let him \n    fast, for it will be a shield for him.” \n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4779) and Muslim (1400).\n\n    6.Always asking Allah to help \n    you, guide you and purify your hearing and sight.

Here are several steps, along with citations from the Qur'an to support each point:\n\n### 1. **Recognize the Mistake and Seek Forgiveness**\nThe first step is to acknowledge the mistake and sincerely seek forgiveness from Allah. Every believer makes mistakes, and the key is to turn back to Allah in repentance.\n\n**Supporting Verse:** \n- **Surah At-Tahrim (66:8)** mentions, “O you who have believed, repent to Allah with sincere repentance...” This verse emphasizes the importance of repentance and returning to Allah.\n\n### 2. **Strengthen Your Intentions**\nBefore taking steps to abstain from watching movies, it is crucial to reinforce your intention (Niyyah) to please Allah by avoiding such activities.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah An-Naml (27:47)** states, \"...But they were divided into two groups disputing with one another.\" Reflect on the divisions this verse mentions and remind yourself of the importance of unity within faith and obedience to Allah, which can motivate you to stay on the right path.\n\n### 3. **Fill Time with Beneficial Activities**\nOne effective way to avoid movies is to replace the time spent watching them with productive and beneficial activities, like reading Qur'an, studying Islamic teachings, or community service.\n\n**Supporting Verse:** \n- **Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:8)** states, “Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them.” Engage with those who support your faith and utilize your time for righteous deeds.\n\n### 4. **Avoid Triggers and Temptations**\nIdentify the triggers that lead you to watching movies. This could be boredom, specific groups of friends, or social media. Avoiding these influences can help mitigate the temptation.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:219)** provides wisdom regarding worldly temptations, indicating that even though there might be some profit in them, the harm often outweighs the benefits. “They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, 'In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit.'\"\n\n### 5. **Surround Yourself with Supportive Companions**\nConnecting with friends who share your desire to avoid watching movies can reinforce your commitment and provide accountability.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah An-Naml (27:46)** suggests, “Why do you wish to hasten evil rather than good? Why not ask for God's forgiveness? You may well be forgiven.” This emphasizes the importance of support and goodness.\n\n### 6. **Continuously Ask for Guidance**\nRegularly ask Allah for guidance and the strength to maintain your resolve. Make du’a (supplication) for help.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Ya-Sin (36:67)** reflects on Allah’s control over human perception and direction, highlighting that guidance and the ability to follow the straight path is in His hands.\n\n### 7. **Remember the Bigger Picture**\nReflect on the purpose of life and the striving for the hereafter. Keeping the focus on your ultimate goal can help prioritize your choices.\n\n**Supporting Verse:**\n- **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:91-95)** reminds believers of the distractions in this world and the ultimate importance of remembering Allah and prayer. Strengthening your relationship with Allah through regular prayer and remembrance is essential.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, overcoming the habit of watching movies involves sincere repentance, reinforcing good intentions, filling your time with beneficial activities, avoiding triggers, seeking supportive communities, continuously asking Allah for guidance, and focusing on the bigger picture. Remember, Allah is Most Merciful, and He responds to those who sincerely seek His guidance."

        "question": "Hitting Female Students",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is good for the teacher to be kind and gentle towards young and old, but if the situation calls for discipline or a (light) smack that is not severe, that is permissible. It is the habit of the foolish to behave badly and not show any respect, so there is a need for strictness and strength that is more effective than kindness and gentleness. End quote. \nShaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) \nFataawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haraam, p. 399 \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The topic of hitting or physically punishing female students, or women in general, requires careful consideration of the Islamic teachings regarding treatment and interactions among members of society, particularly focusing on women.\n\n### Understanding Treatment of Women in Islam\n\nIn Islam, women are to be treated with respect, dignity, and kindness. They hold a significant position within the family and the society, and this is emphasized in several verses of the Quran.\n\n#### 1. **Compassion and Justice**\nThe Quran encourages believers to live with their spouses and others in a manner that reflects justice and compassion:\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:19)**: \"O believers, you are not allowed to take perforce the women (of dead relatives) into your heritage, or tyrannize over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them, unless they are guilty of open adultery. Live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them. For it may well be you may not like a thing, yet God may have endued it with much goodness.\"\n  \nThis verse emphasizes the importance of treating women with tolerance and justice, even if there are personal grievances.\n\n#### 2. **Prohibition of Harshness**\nIslam places significant importance on the prohibition of harsh and unjust behavior towards women:\n\n- **Surah An-Nisa (4:34)**: \"Men are the support of women as God gives some more means than others, and because they spend of their wealth (to provide for them). So women who are virtuous are obedient to God and guard the hidden as God has guarded it. As for women you feel are averse, talk to them suasively; then leave them alone in bed (without molesting them) and go to bed with them (when they are willing).\" \n\nThis verse encourages a method of dialogue and understanding rather than resorting to violence or punishment.\n\n#### 3. **Importance of Education and Respect in Relationships**\nIslam values education and respectful treatment of all individuals, including students:\n\n- **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:48)** emphasizes compassion and avoiding any actions that could harm others. This implies that physical punishment has no place in educational settings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHitting female students, or using physical punishment against women in general, is not aligned with Islamic principles that promote dignity, respect, and kindness. The Quran consistently emphasizes the importance of living with compassion, justice, and understanding. \n\nThe ethical framework set by the Quran provides a clear indication that such behavior would be considered oppressive and unjust. Instead, educators and individuals are urged to model a demeanor of patience and wisdom, reflecting the core values of Islam regarding interpersonal relationships. \n\nIn summary, actions that promote violence, such as hitting, contradict the teachings of respect and justice ordained in the Quran. Therefore, educators and society at large should focus on fostering a nurturing environment conducive to learning and respectful interaction. \n\n### Citations\n- Surah An-Nisa (4:19)\n- Surah An-Nisa (4:34)\n- Surah Al-Ahzab (33:48) \n\nThese verses guide the character and ethics expected of Muslims in their daily interactions, especially in nurturing and educational contexts."

        "question": "Ruling on setting up a recorder to watch over a relative’s conversations",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy\non him) and he said:\nI think that this is a kind of spying\nand it is not permissible for anyone to spy on anyone else, because we have no\nright the judge anybody except by what is apparent. If we start spying on\npeople we will have a lot of headaches because of this spying and we will be\nupset by what we hear and see. \nAllaah says\n(interpretation of the meaning) “And spy not” [al-Hujuraat\n49:12]\nafter saying (interpretation of the meaning), “O you who believe! Avoid much\nsuspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not” [al-Hujuraat 49:12].\nBut if the head of the household sees indications\nof these evil telephone calls, then there is nothing wrong with setting up a\nrecording device without their knowledge, but he realizes that there is\nsomething going on, he should not keep quiet and keep listening, rather he\nshould rebuke them straightaway, because if he communities to listen,because he may hear\nsomething that will upset him even more. For example, if he comes across a bad\ntelephone conversation, he must rebuke the one who is doing it straight away,\nand not delay it until the next day; he must put a stop to it from the\nbeginning.\nBut with regard to mere suspicion\nbased on waswaas (insinuating whispers of the Shaytaan), it is not permitted (for him to set up this\ndevice), but if he knows that the matter is serious and that it is actually\nhappening, then it is OK to set up a recorder so as to find out what is going on.",
        "predicted_answer": "The act of setting up a recorder to watch over a relative's conversations raises significant ethical and theological concerns in Islam, particularly regarding privacy and the prohibition of eavesdropping or spying. The following analysis draws upon relevant Quranic verses to highlight these principles.\n\n### Privacy and Eavesdropping\n\n1. **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:9-10)** advises believers to refrain from private conversations that involve wrongdoing, including preparing for rebellion or disobedience. The verse suggests a strong emphasis on ethical conduct during conversations: \n   > \"O you who believe, when you converse privately, do not talk of iniquity, rebellion, and disobedience to the Prophet, but talk of goodness and piety, and fear God before whom you will be gathered. Surely scheming is the work of Satan that he may cause the faithful grief; but he cannot harm them unless God dispense. So in God should the believers place their trust.\" \n   - **(Surah Al-Mujadila, Ayah 9-10)**\n\n   This indicates that conversations should be positive and constructive, underlying the notion of mutual respect in communication.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Mujadila (58:7)** reminds that God is aware of what is in the heavens and the earth, emphasizing His omnipresence:\n   > \"Have you not considered that God knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth? No three persons confer secretly but He is the fourth among them, and no five but He is the sixth; and neither fewer nor more but He is with them wheresoever they be.\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Mujadila, Ayah 7)**\n\n   This verse implies that human surveillance, like eavesdropping, is unnecessary since God is already aware of all. This argues against the moral justification for secretly recording others and underscores the importance of a respectful relationship built on trust.\n\n### Ethical Standpoint on Spying and Eavesdropping\n\n3. **Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:42)** highlights the consequences of malicious spying and dishonesty:\n   > \"Eavesdropping for telling lies, earning through unlawful means! So, if they come to you, judge between them or decline.\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Ma'idah, Ayah 42)**\n\n   This further emphasizes the prohibitions connected to deceitful behavior, thereby discouraging actions like secretly recording conversations which could lead to misrepresentation or scandal.\n\n4. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:283)** emphasizes honesty and integrity in communication and transactions:\n   > \"O believers, when you negotiate a debt for a fixed term, draw up an agreement in writing... And have fear of God, for God gives you knowledge, and God is aware of everything.\"\n   - **(Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 283)**\n\n   This teaches that clarity and transparency should be central to all forms of engagement—an approach that extends to interpersonal relationships.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn Islam, respect for privacy is paramount, and eavesdropping or secretly recording conversations contradicts the teachings of honesty, integrity, and respect for others' private matters as encapsulated in the principles derived from the cited verses. Believers are urged to foster trustful and honest relationships rather than resorting to deceitful practices such as recording conversations without consent. Doing so aligns not just with the ethical framework of Islam but also reinforces the communal bonds that are integral to the faith. Therefore, setting up a recorder to watch over a relative's conversations would generally be viewed as inappropriate and discouraged within the Islamic tradition."

        "question": "How can she teach her five-year-old sister to memorize Qur’aan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Raising children to follow Islam from an early age, teaching \n    them to memorize the Book of Allaah and educating them is the Sunnah of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and is regarded as \n    a very important matter, especially in this day and age. But it is something \n    that many people neglect with regard to their children and those under their \n    care, and they get distracted by things that will be of no benefit to them \n    in the Hereafter and may indeed harm them, and make them emotionally \n    attached to those who do not even deserve to be mentioned, let alone taken \n    as role models, such as actors, sports players and singers. \n\n    We appreciate our sister’s question and we ask Allaah to make \n    her steadfast and to help her in this matter and others, and to decree \n    reward for her on the Day of Judgement. What can be greater than meeting \n    one's Lord with a record of good deeds which includes guiding others to do \n    good or sharing in establishing good? \n\n    With regard to this little sister and teaching her to \n    memorize Qur’aan, we advise our sister to do the following: \n\n    1-Start with that which is \n    easiest to read and memorize, namely Soorat al-Faatihah, then with the last \n    juz’, working from the end. Starting with something easy helps one to move \n    on to more difficult material. Moreover she will have a real need for that \n    when she starts to learn the prayer.\n\n    2-The amount to be memorized \n    every day should be small, so that she will be able to memorize it and it \n    will be easy for her to memorize what comes next. This amount will vary from \n    one child to the next, depending on his or her intelligence and memory.\n\n    3-Review often so that what has \n    been memorized will stick. Do not let any day go by without memorizing \n    something new and reviewing the old.\n\n    4-Encourage her by giving her a \n    prize every time she finishes a juz’ – for example – and memorizes it well.\n\n    5-Start to move from prompting \n    her and having her repeat, which is usually the first stage in memorization, \n    to teaching her how to read, so that it will be easy for her to read the \n    Qur’aan by herself at times when her sister or teacher are not present.\n\n    6-Let her get used to reciting \n    what she has memorized in her prayer, whether that is obligatory or naafil \n    prayer, once she reaches an age where prayer is required of her and she can \n    understand it.\n\n    7-Let her get used to listening \n    to what she has memorized on tapes or on the computer, so that she can hear \n    both a good pronunciation and good recitation, and she can review and \n    consolidate what she has learned.\n\n    8-Choose a good time for \n    memorization when there are few distractions – such as after Fajr or between \n    Maghrib and ‘Isha’. Avoid times when she is hungry, tired or sleepy.\n\n    9-Praise her for what she has \n    memorized in front of neighbours and relatives, so as to encourage her and \n    encourage them to do the same thing; at the same time, pray for refuge for \n    her with Allaah for fear of the evil eye and envy (hasad).\n\n    10-It is essential for \n    her to have one style of Mus-haf with no changes, so that the layout of the \n    verses will be imprinted in her memory.\n\n    11-You should encourage \n    her to write out what she has memorized so that she may combine learning how \n    to write with reinforcing what she has memorized.\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "Teaching a child to memorize the Qur'an can be both a rewarding and spiritually enriching experience. Here are some suggestions and methods that can be employed to help your five-year-old sister memorize the Qur'an effectively, supported by relevant verses from the Qur'an.\n\n### 1. **Create a Positive Environment**:\n   - Ensure that the environment is conducive to learning. A quiet, comfortable space dedicated to memorization will help in maintaining focus.\n\n### 2. **Start with Short Surahs**:\n   - Begin with shorter Surahs, as these are easier for children to memorize. Surahs like Al-Fatiha (Chapter 1) and Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112) are good starting points.\n\n### 3. **Repeated Recitation**:\n   - Follow a method of repetition. Reciting the verses multiple times helps in retention. As mentioned in Surah Al-A'la:\n     - **“We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it, unless God wills.”** \n     - (Surah Al-A'la, Ayah 6: 87:6).\n\n### 4. **Use of Listening Aids**:\n   - Utilize recordings of the Qur'an being recited. Listening to the verses can reinforce memory. The practice of listening is supported by the verse:\n     - **“When the Qur'an is recited, listen to it in silence.”** \n     - (Surah Al-A'raf, Ayah 204: 7:204).\n\n### 5. **Engagement in Meaning**:\n   - Explain the meanings of the verses. Understanding the context can make memorization easier and more meaningful. This ties into the importance of understanding and reflecting upon the Qur'an:\n     - **\"This (Qur'an) is a message for mankind; that they may be warned thereby.\"** \n     - (Surah Al-Ankabut, Ayah 51: 29:51).\n\n### 6. **Set a Routine**:\n   - Establishing a regular schedule for memorization can help in forming a habit. It is also beneficial to recite what has already been memorized as a part of daily routine.\n\n### 7. **Positive Reinforcement**:\n   - Encourage and reward progress. Positive reinforcement can motivate the child to continue learning. You could relate this to the divine promise of reward:\n     - **“...what you send ahead of you of good, you will find it with Allah better and greater in reward.”** \n     - (Surah Al-Muzzammil, Ayah 20: 73:20).\n\n### 8. **Use of Visual Aids**:\n   - Flashcards with the Arabic text and translation can help in memorization. Visual learning can enhance the memorization process.\n\n### 9. **Collaborative Learning**:\n   - Encourage other family members to join in. Memorizing together can enhance motivation and create a supportive atmosphere.\n\n### 10. **Patience and Compassion**:\n   - Be patient. Understanding that each child has a different learning speed is essential. It relates to the gradual approach the Qur'an encourages:\n     - **“We shall take you slowly towards ease.”** \n     - (Surah Al-A'la, Ayah 7: 87:7).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy applying these techniques and embedding spiritual significance into each learning session, memorizing the Qur'an can become a joyful journey for your sister. Regular practice combined with a supportive atmosphere will foster her love and respect for the Qur'an. Always remember the guidance that God provides to those who endeavor in such righteous deeds."

        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the annoyance of a teacher towards the misbehavior of some Qur’aan-memorization students, it is important to adapt the response not only with wisdom but also with references to the Qur'an that encourage patience, guidance, and a perspective of understanding.\n\n### Key Principles from the Qur’an\n\n1. **Patience and Perseverance:**\n   The Qur'an emphasizes patience in dealing with individuals who may not be fully committed or who exhibit negative behavior. For instance, Surah Al-Ghashiyah (Surah 88), Ayah 21-25 states:\n\n   **Translation:** “Remind them; you are surely a reminder. You are not a warden over them. Other than him who turns his back and denies, in which case he will be punished by God with the severest punishment. To Us is surely their returning.”  \n   (Surah Al-Ghashiyah 88:21-25)\n\n   This verse serves as a reminder that educators and teachers should focus on delivering their message and guidance without forcing outcomes, as they are not accountable for the actions of others. Instead, reflect on their eventual return to God for accountability.\n\n2. **Encouraging Self-Reflection:**\n   Surah Al-Mu’minun (Surah 23), Ayah 67-71 encourages reflection and understanding:\n\n   **Translation:** “Insolently, treating them like tales told at night. Why did they not think over the message? Or has something come to them which had not come to their fathers?”  \n   (Surah Al-Mu’minun 23:67-68)\n\n   Teachers can utilize this as an opportunity to encourage students to reflect on their actions and reconsider the significance of their studies in a spiritual context. \n\n3. **Importance of Guidance:**\n   Surah Al-Muddaththir (Surah 74), Ayah 52-56 highlights how many disbelieve even the clear reminders sent to them. \n\n   **Translation:** “In fact every one of them wants to be given open books (like the prophets). By no means. In fact they do not fear the Hereafter. Never so, as this is a reminder. Let him then who heeds remember it.”  \n   (Surah Al-Muddaththir 74:52-55)\n\n   This reminds teachers that it’s common for students to resist reminders. Thus, they can approach misbehavior with the understanding that it is often a human tendency to be resistant to guidance.\n\n4. **Dealing with Hypocrisy:**\n   In Surah Al-Munafiqun (Surah 63), something pertinent is discussed about the hypocrites, which can also echo the attitude of students who may not be genuine in their pursuit of knowledge:\n\n   **Translation:** “They have made their oaths a shield in order to obstruct others from the way of God. It is certainly evil what they do.”  \n   (Surah Al-Munafiqun 63:2)\n\n   Recognizing signs of insincerity can help teachers prepare and plan their teaching methods. Teachers should focus on those who are striving towards goodness rather than the misbehavior of a few.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile it can be frustrating to deal with misbehaved students, the Qur'an emphasizes the importance of patience, understanding, and guidance. Remembering that not everyone will respond positively at once can lead to a more constructive approach in teaching. Therefore, it is essential to remain steadfast and committed to providing positive reinforcement and guidance, as outlined in the above verses. These reminders help shape a more supportive educational environment and aid in cultivating sincere and committed students."
