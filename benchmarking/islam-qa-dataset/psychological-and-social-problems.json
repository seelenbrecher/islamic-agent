        "question": "He is being treated for addiction and finds it difficult to do the prayers and fast",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe praise Allah, may He be exalted, for guiding you and enabling you to repent, and we ask Him to help you and grant you a full recovery.\nSecondly:\nYou must do what you are able to of religious duties, and you will be excused \u2013 in sha Allah \u2013 with regard to what you are unable to do or what is definitely too difficult and is more than you can bear, according to your situation.\nYour praying in the mosque is something that is required according to Islamic teachings, and it is also part of your recovery, because mixing with people and good people will have a beneficial impact, in sha Allah.\nIf you sleep and miss Zuhr, or it is too difficult for you to go out to pray in the mosque, then you may pray at home or when you wake up, because of the report narrated by Muslim (684) from Anas ibn Maalik, who said: The Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, his expiation is to offer that prayer when he remembers it.\u201d\nThirdly:\nFasting is an important obligation which it is not permissible to omit except when one has an excuse. If you will be harmed by delaying taking your medicine until after iftar, this is an excuse which makes it permissible for you not to fast, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous.\n\u00a0[Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]}\u00a0[Al-Baqarah 2:183-184].\nIf you will not be harmed by delaying taking your medicine until after iftar, then you must fast.\nIf you will face hardship and find it too difficult to carry on fasting during the day, even though you are physically healthy \u2013 meaning that you are not feeling any symptoms of sickness, not even a headache, for example \u2013 then you must intend to fast from the night before, then if you start finding it too difficult to carry on and you become certain that it is beyond your capability to continue fasting, and you fear that you may be harmed by severe thirst, then you may drink, then you must refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and make up that day later on.\nIt says in Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da\u2019imah (10/233): It is not permissible for the accountable person not to fast during the day in Ramadan just because he is working.\nBut during the day, if he faces extreme hardship and realises that he has no choice but to break the fast during the day, he may do so by eating or drinking that which will ward off the hardship, then he should refrain from eating and drinking until sunset and break the fast with the people, and he must make up that day on which he broke the fast. End quote.\nBut if you are suffering from illness, such as a severe headache, this makes it permissible to not fast.\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There are several different scenarios with regard to the sick person and fasting.\n1.. He will not be affected by fasting, such as if he has a mild cold, a mild headache or a toothache and the like. In this case, it is not permissible for him not to fast, even though the scholars say that it is permissible for him not to fast because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {and whoever is ill} [al-Baqarah 2:185].\nBut we say: If this ruling is connected to a scenario in which breaking the fast will ease the hardship for him, then in that case we say that he may break the fast. But if the sick person will not be affected by fasting, then it is not permissible for him not to fast, and he is obliged to fast.\n2.. If it is difficult for him to fast (because of his sickness), but it will not harm him, then in this case it is disliked (makruh) for him to fast, and it is Sunnah for him to not fast.\n3.. If it is difficult for him to fast and it will harm him, such as a man who is suffering from kidney disease, diabetes or the like, then in that case fasting is prohibited for him.\"(Ash-Sharh al-Mumti\u2018\u00a0 6/341).\nWe advise you to offer a great deal of supplication and beseech Allah, may He be exalted, to accept your repentance and grant you good health. Strive to offer supplication at the times when a response is likely.\nWe ask Allah to comfort you, make things easy for you and accept your repentance.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on Men Imitating Women",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Ruling on men imitating women\nIslam forbids men to imitate women and women to imitate men , and in fact it emphatically forbids that, to such an extent that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed those who go against the human nature with which Allah created them.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men, and he said: \u201cThrow them out of your houses.\u201d (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5885)\u00a0\nUndoubtedly one of the most obvious signs of an effeminate man is that he wears women\u2019s clothing and imitates their ways.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the man who wears women\u2019s clothing and the woman who wears men\u2019s clothing. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4098 and classed as authentic by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu`, 4/469 and by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\u00a0\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed masculinized women. \u201cNarrated by Abu Dawud, 4099; classed as good by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu`, 4/469 and as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\u00a0\nAl-Munawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\u201cAs An-Nawawi said, this indicates that it is prohibited for men to imitate women and vice versa, because if it is prohibited with regard to clothing then imitating them in one\u2019s movements and tone of voice is even more abhorrent. So it is prohibited for men to imitate women and vice versa with regard to clothing that is unique to one\u2019s sex, and the one who does that is subject to the threat of being cursed.\u201d (Fayd Al-Qadir, 5/343)\u00a0\nOnce this is established, we will know that the Islamic ruling on this kind of sexual perversion is that it is prohibited, and it is a major sin. So it is not permissible to do that whether alone or with one\u2019s wife, because going against the sound human nature (Fitrah) that Allah has created in us can only result in corruption and evil. Allah has created man with masculine qualities that cannot go with wearing women\u2019s clothing or imitating women\u2019s mannerisms.\u00a0\nUndoubtedly the one who seeks to be effeminate and derives pleasure from that and thinks that it fulfils his desire is sick with a disease that the doctors describe as a \u201cfetish\u201d. They have behavioural programs to treat such cases that are presented to them, so anyone who is faced with this problem should not hesitate to go to a psychologist to supervise his treatment for this sickness.\u00a0\nRemedy to issue of men imitating women\nAll we can do is remind him of Allah and make his religious commitment a positive and effective factor in ridding him of this Waswas . He should remember the wrath of Allah towards effeminate men, and he should remember that He can see everything they do, and that this life is a few short days that will quickly cease to be, and a man will be left with his deeds in the Hereafter.\u00a0\nWe remind him to seek the help of Allah, for He is the best of helpers and the best One to ask for help. If a person is sincere in his du\u2019a\u2019 and seeking help and turning to Him, Allah will answer his prayer and relieve him of his problem. But part of praying sincerely is sincerely applying the means and striving hard and being patient until full healing comes and he gives up these evil haram practices. And for his efforts and patience he will be rewarded by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\u00a0\nThe best thing that will help him to give up this inclination is marriage, because it opens the door to satisfying sexual desires in good and permissible ways. Whilst he is waiting for that, he should distract himself from desires by filling his time with acts of worship and beneficial habits, and he should try to fast, because it is very helpful in controlling desires. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning it: \u201cWhoever cannot afford (to get married) should fast, for it will diminish his desire.\u201d (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1905 and Muslim, 1400)\u00a0\nOne of the most important things that will help him is: respecting the sacred limits set by Allah, by refraining from looking at people\u2019s `Awrahs and refraining from thinking of desires, because looking at prohibited things is the basis of every calamity, and that is what leads one to these bad, perverted habits that he sees among some perverts. \u00a0\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\u201cLooking generates thoughts, then thoughts generate ideas, then ideas generate desire, then desires generate will, then the will grows strong and resolves to do the deed, and then the deed will inevitably take place unless there is something to prevent it. Concerning this it was said that patience in lowering the gaze is easier than patience in bearing the pain that comes afterwards.\u201d (Al-Jawab Al-Kafi, p. 106)\u00a0\nIt should be noted that thinking about such perversions will inevitably lead to doing them, so it is essential to divert oneself from such thinking, and to distract oneself with permissible kinds of pleasure with one\u2019s wife. He should not try to connect fulfilment of desire with those bad practices. That is the whispers of the Shaytan.\nUndoubtedly the best kind of pleasure is that which is achieved in accordance with the sound human nature with which Allah has created people.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to guide you to the straight path.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Punishment for Masturbation in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is masturbation prohibited?\nThe masturbation is prohibited , as we have explained in the answer to question no.\u00a0329 . You have to repent from this action and give it up , and regret what you have done , and resolve not to go back to it.\u00a0\nThere are many punishments for the sinner in this world, let alone the punishment that he deserves in the Hereafter. We have already mentioned some of these punishments in the answer to question no.\u00a023425 .\u00a0\nSo hasten to repent sincerely before you are no longer able to do so, and before you feel regret at the time when regret will be to no avail.\u00a0\nIf Allah honours you by enabling you to repent, you will be forgiven for this sin, and it will be as if it never happened. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe one who repents is like the one who did not sin.\u201d (Narrated by Ibn Majah; classed as good by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 3427)\u00a0\nPunishment for Masturbation in Islam\nBreaking the hymen as a result of masturbation is not Zina, and no Hadd (fixed prescribed punishment) or expiation is required.\u00a0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about masturbation and he replied:\u00a0\nWith regard to masturbation, the basic ruling is that it is prohibited according to the majority of scholars, and the one who does it should be given a Ta`zir punishment (punishments that are not fixed in Islam and are decided by the ruler), but it is not like Zina. And Allah knows best.\u201d (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 3/439)\u00a0\nIf it is obvious that the hymen has been broken as a result of masturbation, then you have to tell your fianc\u00e9 what happened to you, without giving any details that may cause you embarrassment. It is sufficient for him to know that this happened without any fornication, because the hymen may be broken because of exercise, being beaten, falling or being sick.\u00a0\nYou will never be exposed if you repent to Allah and are sincere in your repentance, for Allah is the Concealer and loves concealment.\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 37673 , 127290 , 826 , and 2571 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "When to Announce Pregnancy in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to bless you with righteous offspring and to bless this child.\u00a0\nThere is nothing wrong with telling other people about the pregnancy after you find out about it, and it is not essential to wait until three months have passed. Rather it is permissible to tell others before then, but you should limit that to family and close friends only. This is a general principle which should be paid attention to when telling others of blessings. The news should be given only to those who wish good for you and will rejoice over it, so as to ward off the evil eye and destructive envy.\u00a0\nThe evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \u201cBe discreet in order to achieve what you want, for everyone who is blessed is envied.\u201d (Narrated by At-Tabarani and Abu Nu`aym; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, no. 943)\u00a0\nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 82465 , 119767 , 12368 , 7889 , 12287 , and 88734 . \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "He is complaining that he does not feel reassurance in his heart when remembering Allah, may He be exalted",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It should be understood that the more a person tries to draw close to Allah, the more the Shaytan will try to block his path in order to undermine his efforts and make his life difficult, and divert him from worshipping and obeying Allah, may He be exalted.\nSo the Muslim must strive to be patient and strive against his nafs and evil inclinations and against the Shaytan. He should offer a lot of supplication and beseech Allah, may He be exalted, to help him to remain steadfast.\nUpholding regular prayer, keeping away from haram things, remembering Allah a great deal, and seeking to draw close to Him by doing supererogatory (nafil) acts of worship \u2013 all of this is the straight path, which you must strive hard to adhere to and be patient in bearing its hardships.\nRemember the words of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): \u201cA person will still be answered so long as his supplication does not involve sin or severing ties of kinship, and so long as he does not become impatient.\u201d It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what does being impatient mean? He said: \u201cSaying, I offered supplication, and I offered supplication, and I did not receive any response, then he becomes frustrated and stops offering supplication.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (2735).\nSo do not say, \u201cI remembered Allah a great deal, and I prayed and I spent the night in prayer, but my heart was not softened.\u201d Rather you should strive hard in remembering Allah (dhikr), praying and spending the night in prayer (qiyam), until you attain what you are seeking.\nAs it is said: Whoever keeps knocking on the door, it will be opened to him; as for the one who knocks only once and goes away\u2026\nYou should understand that what befalls you sometimes of grief, sadness, distress and lack of motivation is part of the Shaytan\u2019s scheme that he uses against the believers to make them despondent. Once a person realizes that, and he becomes certain that it is the scheme of the Shaytan, then he will be on the alert and will seek refuge with Allah from that.\nAnd you should understand that the sweetness of faith and finding pleasure in the remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted, is something that the believer will never attain except after striving against his nafs and evil inclinations, and against the Shaytan. Hence one of the early generations said: I struggled to make myself read the Quran for twenty years, then I found pleasure in it for twenty years. Similarly, finding pleasure in the remembrance of Allah and obeying Him can only come after persisting in doing righteous deeds and striving hard for a long time, until the believer starts to taste the sweetness of faith.\nMay Allah help you to do that which He loves and is pleased with, and may He suffice you against the evil of your own self (nafs) and the evil of the Shaytan.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "How to Solve Problems with Your Husband's Family",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Causes of wife\u2019s problems with husband\u2019s family\nThere are many problems that may arise between the wife and her husband\u2019s family . In order to solve any problem, we should examine the causes before anything else:\n\nThe causes may be connected to the attitude of the husband\u2019s family . There are some people for whom causing trouble is second nature, and they make mountains out of molehills and exaggerate about trivial, insignificant matters. But when people are like this, problems do not exist only between them and their son\u2019s wife; rather they have troubles with everyone.\n\nSolving this problem requires a great deal of effort to teach them right from wrong and good from evil, and to educate them about faith and obedience to Allah. In this case, the husband who is aware of his family\u2019s nature and attitude should not pay any attention to what they say about his wife, and he should not attach any significance to it. Rather he should try to advise his family and call them to what is good, and he should comfort his wife if she suffers mistreatment at the hands of his family.\n\nThe cause of troubles may be the fault of both sides: jealousy that takes root in the hearts of the husband\u2019s family , when they see how fond he is of his wife and how he shows compassion to her.\n\nThe solution to this problem is compensating them by showing extra compassion and special care towards them and giving them a lot of gifts, whilst not showing affection to his wife in front of them. Moreover, the husband should pay special attention towards them, and offer a great deal of supplication asking Allah to remove the jealousy from their hearts.\n\nThe cause of these problems may be what the husband\u2019s family see in the wife of falling short with their son, or with her children, or in taking care of her house, or what she demonstrates of shameful behaviour by not showing respect to their mother, and other things that could be real \u2013 not made-up \u2013 in many wives. This is the silver lining to these problems, because through it the wife may come to realise her shortcomings and negligence, and thus be able to make up for her shortcomings and rectify the situation, for the wife cannot claim to be perfect in her behaviour and attitude.\n\nThis is the easiest cause of such problems to fix, because the solution is easy and possible; the wife can rectify herself and mend the relationship between her and her husband\u2019s family by improving her behaviour and giving each person his or her due respect. Thus she will be able to rectify the situation, resolve the problem and gain her husband\u2019s appreciation.\nWife\u2019s obedience to husband\nWhat we think is that the wife should obey her husband if he tells her not to tell anyone else of what happens between her and his family. This decision on the husband\u2019s part serves an important interest that surpasses the interest of the wife venting and getting things off her chest. That is because if, in such cases, the problems become widely known, everyone will have an opinion or will use it to come up with some scheme, or will give bad advice for solving these problems, which will only make matters worse and create further problems, and will generate more causes of trouble, with the result that it may become very difficult to find a solution after that.\nIt is permissible for the wife to complain to a wise person, and that does not come under the heading of backbiting, which is prohibited. See the answer to question no. 7660 . At the same time, the husband has the right to prevent her from doing this permissible thing, if he thinks that there is a legitimate purpose to be served by that.\nWhat we think is that you made a mistake by not complying with his advice, and speaking to your sister and your brother\u2019s wife about what has been going on between you and your husband\u2019s family. In order to rectify that, you must repent and seek forgiveness, and not carry on talking to them about this matter. You should urge them not to tell anyone else about anything that you told them. There is no need to confess to your husband what you did, because it will serve no purpose; rather it could result in more trouble. For example, he could start resenting you and what you did; or he could prevent you from speaking to your sister and your brother\u2019s wife at all.\u00a0\nAll of that is possible, because the devil is always present and has a great impact at such times, for he will fan the flames, exacerbate the matter and will do his utmost to create enmity and resentment because of this trouble.\nHow can you get along with your husband's family?\nDealing with your husband and his family requires great wisdom on your part. But you \u2013 in Sha Allah \u2013 are able to cope with that, as is quite evident to us from your saying \u201cbecause we, my sisters and I, were raised not to answer back to the one who mistreats us. I even do not know how to respond politely, except very rarely, and afterwards I feel guilty\u201d and from your other comment \u201cand when I visit them I do not show that I am upset. Sometimes she says hurtful or embarrassing things, and I act normally, but I am very angry inside.\u201d This is a thing that no one can do except one who has self-control, and no one can do that except wise people.\nWhat is required of you now is the following:\n\nIgnore what you hear from your husband\u2019s\u00a0 family which you can tell is aimed at upsetting and provoking you and is pure fabrication, with no substance.\nPay attention to yourself, your house, your children and whatever you hear from them that is true [in terms of shortcomings]; you have to rectify these things and do them properly.\nTry to be friendly towards his family, showing good manners, speaking gently and behaving kindly. Make sure to give them appropriate gifts from time to time, or some food that you have made for them, or some sweets that you have made specially for them. For it is well known that gifts have a great impact in bringing people together and spreading love and affection between them.\nBe kind to your husband by not telling anyone about how his family treats you, and make him trust you more; do not let him hear or see anything from you that he does not like.\nHowever, that does not mean that you should keep completely quiet about fabricated accusations that may be made against you. We advise you to refer that to your husband, and let him take responsibility for putting things right and giving each person their due. Show him that your family raised you well.\nFinally, there is nothing wrong with suggesting to your husband that you should move away and not live close to his family. However, he is not obliged to respond. Your right is only to have separate accommodation, and you already have that. But wisdom and your best interests dictate that the husband should move further away from his family, if he realises that there is no harmony between them and his wife. Perhaps moving away may contribute to strengthening the bonds between all parties, and may remove some of these ill feelings and resentment from everyone\u2019s hearts.\n\nSeek the help of Allah your Lord by offering supplication, and doing the duties that are required of you. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to enable you to do that which pleases Him, and to reconcile between you all.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Are Women Deficient in Intellect and Religion?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Does Islam respect and honour women?\nThe believer should be certain that Islam respects and honours women , and treats them fairly and gives them their rights. Islam honours the woman as a mother, as a daughter, as a sister and as a wife. This is well known in the religious texts and teachings.\nAllah, may He be Glorified, is the Creator of male and female; He is their Lord, the One Whom they worship, and He is far above any injustice:\n{And your Lord is not ever unjust to [His] servants.}\u00a0[Fussilat 41:46]\n{And your Lord does injustice to no one.}\u00a0[Al-Kahf 18:49]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was compassionate and merciful towards his Ummah; he did not differentiate between men and women in that regard. Rather he specifically instructed men to treat women kindly, lest they be oppressed or mistreated. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the greatest in showing kindness to and honouring his wives, to the extent that he said that the best of people is the one who is best to his wife, and he said: \u201cThe most perfect of the believers in faith is the best of them in attitude, and the best of you are those who are best in attitude to their wives.\u201d (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1082; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in\u00a0Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nHe (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) also said: \u201cThe best of you is the one who is best to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.\u201d (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3895 and Ibn Majah, 1977; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in\u00a0Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI urge you to be kind to women.\u201d (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3331 and Muslim, 1468)\nWhoever takes these facts into account will be able to understand the texts referred to in the question in an appropriate manner. There is nothing in our religion that undermines the status of women or scorns them. How could that be the case when a woman is the mother who is more deserving of honour and kindness than the father; and she is the wife whom Allah has described as a source of comfort and joy and, in fact, the best of worldly joys; and she is the mother of children and progeny \u2013 so how could a man accept for the mother of his children to be blameworthy and despised?\nAre women deficient in Intellect?\nWith regard to a woman\u2019s lack of reason , it is explained in the Hadith. It is because women are easily swayed by emotions, which make them unable to deal appropriately with new issues that arise. Hence there is a need, with regard to giving testimony, for someone who will complete her testimony and remind her if she forgets.\nAre women deficient in religion?\nAs for their lack of religious commitment, it is also explained. It is because women do not pray and fast during the days of their menses and when they are bleeding following childbirth. They are not to be blamed for that shortcoming, and it is not possible for them to avoid it; rather it is only a shortcoming in comparison to the one who is not prevented from praying and fasting. This is the bounty of Allah which He bestows upon whomever He wills.\nAllah has told the believers that no one among them should wish for what someone else has been favoured with over him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of his bounty. Indeed Allah is ever, of all things, Knowing.}\u00a0[An-Nisa\u2019 4:32]\nIt was narrated from Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him), from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), that she said: Men go on campaign [Jihad] and women do not go on campaign, and we only receive half of the share of inheritance. Then Allah revealed the words: {And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others.} [An-Nisa\u2019 4:32] Mujahid said: And the verse {Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward} [Al-Ahzab 33:35] was revealed concerning her. (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3022; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\nWe have previously explained what is meant by women lacking in reason and religious commitment in the answer to question no.\u00a0111867 \u00a0. There we stated that they are lacking only in what is mentioned in the Hadith, and this does not apply to everything.\nWe do not think that the fact that a woman is easily swayed by her emotions and, as a result, cannot handle some issues rationally is to be regarded as a criticism, for Allah has prepared women to deal with some serious issues that men are unable to handle, which includes taking care of her children and putting up with hardship that no one else but women can bear. The woman also shows patience in putting up with her husband and his annoyance, but she quickly forgives him and reconciles with him.\nMeaning of creating women from rib\u00a0\nThe fact that woman was created from a rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is the top, is something that was decreed by the divine decree, and woman is not responsible for that and she cannot object to her Creator so long as she is a believer, for He is Most Wise, Most Aware of what He creates and decrees.\nThe fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke about that is for the purpose of urging men to show kindness to women and to be patient in putting up with any annoyance that may come from them; they should not criticise women, rebuke them or belittle them.\nAl-Bukhari (1468) and Muslim (1468) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI urge you to treat women kindly , for woman was created from a rib. The most crooked part of the rib is the top of it. If you try to straighten it you will break it, but if you leave it alone, it will remain crooked. So I urge you to treat women kindly.\u201d\nMuslim (1468) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cA woman was created from a rib and she will never be consistent with you in any way. If you want to, you can enjoy your life with her, even though there is some crookedness in her, but if you try to straighten her you will break her \u2013 and breaking her means divorcing her.\u201d\nAhmad (20093) and Al-Hakim (7333) narrated from Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWoman was created from a rib, and if you want to straighten the rib, you will break it. So be kind to her and you will be able to live with her.\u201d (Classed as authentic by the commentators on\u00a0Al-Musnad, and by Al-Albani in\u00a0Sahih Al-Jami`, 1944)\nWomen were created with some natural weakness and their own inclinations; they are very jealous and easily swayed by emotions. Whoever overlooks that and forgives his wife\u2019s mistakes will have an easy life with her, but whoever picks on every minor issue and wants to correct her in every single matter will have a lot of trouble with her and will not enjoy his life with her, and that will lead to his divorcing her.\nThis is something that husbands and anyone who has dealt with marital issues is aware of.\nIf a woman does not accept these facts, it is because she has never studied the issues of women with their husbands.\nA man may treat his wife kindly for a lifetime, then if he does one thing to upset her, she says: I have never seen any good in you!\nShowing ingratitude in this manner is something that may also occur among men, but it is more common among women, and it is part of the inclination that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) described as crookedness and instructed men to be patient in putting up with it.\nIt has been explained above that the idea of showing kindness to avoid trouble is referred to in a Hadith; it is not something that the scholars came up with. What it means is overlooking shortcomings, as noted above. It does not mean thinking that the woman is insane or has a mental illness, as you suggested.\nAs for crookedness in attitude and similar expressions, this description does not apply to every woman, or suggest that the attitude of all women is like that. Rather what is referred to is the mistakes that they make, and what results from them being swayed by their emotions and reacting too quickly, and the like.\nThe words of any person may be accepted or rejected, except the words of the infallible Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThink about what you said: \u201cAnd many more questions spring to mind when I read the Quran and tafsir.\u201d This is an example of exaggeration and jumping to conclusions, which is something that reflects the attitude of women. What have you found in the Quran that is akin to what you have mentioned in your question?\nFurthermore, we find such questions, in which there is objection to the words of Allah or the words of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) very off-putting. We wonder about one in whose heart faith has become established; why is he worrying about such things?\nIt is sufficient for the believing man or believing woman to strive to do righteous deeds, in order to attain bliss and happiness in this world and the hereafter, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] according to the best of what they used to do.}\u00a0[An-Nahl 16:97]\n{And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, while being a believer - those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged, [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.}\u00a0[An-Nisa\u2019 4:124]\n{And their Lord responded to them, \u201c\"Never will I allow to be lost the work of [any] worker among you, whether male or female; you are of one another.\u201d}\u00a0[Al `Imran 3:195]\nSo focus on your worship and doing righteous deeds, and ignore these intrusive thoughts and specious arguments, for this world is the realm of striving, and tomorrow each soul will be paid in full what it has earned, and those who sowed will reap what they sowed.\nWe ask Allah to fill your heart with reassurance and comfort, to make your affairs easy for you, and to protect you against the tricks of the Shaytan.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "How to Overcome Fear of Losing Means of Provision",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Difference between the means and causes and the One Who created them\u00a0\nThe best remedy for you is to differentiate between the means and causes and the One Who created them, for it is Allah, may He be Exalted, Who decrees the means and causes and brings them into existence. As for humans, employment and work, these are nothing but means or causes.\nIt is Allah, may He be Exalted, Who is the Provider, and He, may He be Glorified, has decreed that there should be causes and means for provision. The one who has some problems in his `Aqidah regards the means or causes as being the same as the One Who creates and brings about these causes.\nAccording to Islam, the Muslims should not rely on these means and causes and ignore the One Who created them, and at the same time there is no room for ignoring these means and causes and giving them up.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the Muslim should know is what was stated by a group of scholars. They said: \u00a0Paying attention to means and causes is a kind of Shirk that undermines belief in the oneness of Allah (Tawhid); ignoring the means and causes and not taking them into consideration is a sign of a lack of rational thinking; and turning away from the means and causes altogether is contrary to Islamic teachings; rather putting one\u2019s trust and hope in Allah is something that is in complete harmony with Tawhid, rational thinking and Islamic teachings.\nTo explain further: paying attention to means and causes means relying on them in your heart and putting your hope in them, but there is nothing in creation that deserves that, because nothing in creation is independent; there must inevitably be other factors that either enhance them or oppose them. Moreover, if the Creator of the cause does not make the cause lead to results, it will not work. This is one of the things that prove that Allah is the Lord and Sovereign of all things, and that the heavens and the earth, everything in between them, the stars and planets, and what they contain all have a Creator and Controller Who is distinct from them.\" (\u00a0Majmu` Al-Fatawa,\u00a08/169)\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cThe individual should rely in his heart on Allah, not on any means or causes, for Allah will make available to him means and causes that will rectify his condition in this world and the hereafter. If these means and causes are measures that he can take \u2013 and he is enjoined to take them \u2013 then he should do that, whilst putting his trust in Allah, just as he does obligatory duties, and just as he strives against the enemy, takes up arms and wears a helmet in battle, and he does not think that it is sufficient, when warding off the enemy, to merely put one\u2019s trust in Allah without doing what is enjoined of striving in Jihad. The one who neglects the means and measures that he is enjoined to take is a failure, negligent and blameworthy.\"\u00a0(Majmu` Al-Fatawa,\u00a08/528, 529)\nHow to overcome fear of losing means of provision\u00a0\nIn your case, for example, your parents are the means of your maintenance, but you should realise that Allah, may He be Exalted, has caused them to be like that. You must believe that Allah, may He be Exalted, is able to decree more than one means of your provision and maintenance.\u00a0\nLook around you: do you think that all the students are being supported by their families who spend on their maintenance? The answer is: Definitely not, and if you reflect on the means of their provision and maintenance, you will see that they are many and various.\u00a0\nSo this matter is not limited to your parents, such that you should fear that the means of your maintenance may be cut off, and it is not right for you to put them on the same level as Allah, the Provider, may He be Exalted. There is a vast difference between the Creator and the created being, between the One Who decrees and brings about the means and causes, and the means and causes themselves.\nReflect upon the words of Allah, may He be Exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0{Or who is it that could provide for you if He withheld His provision? But they have persisted in insolence and aversion.} [Al-Mulk 67:21] You will find that this matter is very clear.\nIn this verse, Allah, may He be Exalted, informs the disbelievers that He, may He be Exalted, decrees provision by means of its causes, such as rain, rivers, and springs, and that if He, may He be Exalted, willed, He could withhold these means, so He could prevent the rain from falling and the rivers from flowing, and could cause the springs to dry up. Who is it that could prevent that, and who is it that could bring these means of provision?\nAnother remedy for your issue is to reflect upon the verse in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out,\nAnd will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a [decreed] extent.}\u00a0[At-Talaq 65:2-3]\nYou think that if your parents die, your maintenance will be cut off, but Allah, may He be Exalted, is telling you that if a person fears Him, does what is required and refrains from what is forbidden, He will grant him provision from where he does not expect!\nIn other words, He will make available to him means of provision that he did not expect and that never crossed his mind. If a person truly put his trust in Allah, Allah, may He be Exalted, would suffice him and take care of all his worries. This is the exact remedy for your case, for your conflation between the means of provision and the One Who created those means, and for your anxiety and worry.\nRead the words of this great scholar to find the remedy to heal your anxiety, distress and sorrow:\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the verse,\u00a0{But if they separate [by divorce], Allah will enrich each [of them] from His abundance. And ever is Allah Encompassing and Wise} [An-Nisa 4:130 - interpretation of the meaning]:\n\u201cThis verse indicates that the individual should put his hope in Allah alone, and that if Allah decrees for him some means of earning a living and being comfortable, he should praise Him for that and ask Him to bless it for him. If that means of provision becomes no longer available, or it becomes difficult for him to attain it, he should not feel anxious, for this is just one of many, unlimited means, and a person\u2019s provision is not dependent upon that particular means. Allah may make available another means that is better and more beneficial than it, or He may make available to him a number of means. Whatever the case, he should always keep in mind the blessings of his Lord and hope for His generosity, and he should focus on that, and offer a great deal of supplication accompanied by hope. For Allah says in the Hadith Qudsi: \u201cI am as My slave thinks I am. If he thinks well of Me, then that is what he will get, and if he thinks ill of Me, then that is what he will get.\u201d (Narrated by Ahmad; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in\u00a0Sahih At-Targhib, 3386). And He says: \u201cSo long as you call upon Me and put your hope in Me, I shall forgive you regardless of your sin, and I will not mind.\u201d (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2805; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in\u00a0Sahih At-Tirmidhi).\"\u00a0(Taysir Al-Latif Al-Mannan fi Khulasat Tafsir Al-Ahkam,\u00a0 p. 85, Al-Ma`arif edn.)\nThen reflect upon the Hadith of `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which he heard the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: \u201cIf you truly put your trust in Allah as you should, He would provide for you as He provides for the birds: they go out in the morning hungry and they return in the evening with full bellies.\u201d (Narrated by Ahmad, 205 and At-Tirmidhi, 2344; classed as authentic by Al-Albani)\nYou should understand that your remedy is to develop trust in Allah, and truly put your hope in Him and be connected to Him. It has nothing to do with the death or life of anyone , because Allah\u2019s way in dealing with His creation is not to change anything for the death or life of anyone.\nGet rid of sins and repent to Allah\nOne last thing: it may be that what you are feeling of anxiety, worry and distress is because of some sins that you have been committing. So examine yourself and deal with whatever you may have fallen into of sins, for Allah, may He be Exalted, may hasten the punishment for the one who is like this. We know about the wrongdoing and sins that occur in mixed universities, so strive to rid yourself of them and repent from them .\nImam Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cOne of the punishments for sin is that Allah, may He be Glorified, casts terror and fear into the heart of the sinner, so you always see him nervous and scared. Obedience to Allah is the great fortress , and whoever enters it will be one of those who are safe from the punishments of this world and the hereafter, whereas the one who exits it will be surrounded with fears on all sides. So for the one who obeys Allah, his fears will dissipate and turn into feelings of security, but for the one who disobeys Him, his feelings of security will turn into fear. You will never find any sinner but it is as if his heart is filled with anxiety: if the wind moves the door, he thinks that people are coming to get him; if he hears footsteps, he fears that he will soon be finished; he thinks that everyone is against him and that every bad thing will happen to him. The one who fears Allah will be safe from everything, but the one who does not fear Allah, Allah will cause him to be afraid of everything.\" (Al-Jawab Al-Kafi,\u00a0 p. 50).\nFor more details, please see the following answers:\u00a020088 \u00a0and\u00a022704 ."

        "question": "Being Successful in Life",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Peace of mind, contentment, happiness and freedom from worries and anxiety\u2026 these are what everyone wants, and these are the ways in which people can have a good life and find complete happiness and joy. There are religious means of achieving this, and natural and practical means, but no one can combine all of them except the believers; although other people may achieve some of them, they will miss out on others.\u00a0\nHere follows a summary of the means of achieving this aim for which everyone is striving. In some cases, those who achieve many of them will live a joyful life and a good life; in other cases, those who fail to achieve all of them will live a life of misery and hardship. And there are others which are in between, according to the means they are able to attain. These means include the following:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Faith and righteous deeds:\nThis is the greatest and most fundamental of means. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cWhoever works righteousness \u2014 whether male or female \u2014 while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).\u201d\u00a0[al-Nahl 16:97]\nAllah tells us and promises us that whoever combines faith with righteous deeds will have a good life and a good reward in this world and in the Hereafter.\u00a0\nThe reason for this is clear: those who believe in Allah \u2013 with sincere faith that motivates them to do righteous deeds that change hearts and attitudes and guides them to the straight path in this world and the Hereafter \u2013 follow principles and guidelines by means of which they deal with everything that happens to them, be it the causes of happiness and excitement or the causes of anxiety, worry and grief.\u00a0\nThey deal with the things that they like by accepting them and giving thanks for them, and using them in good ways. When they deal with them in this manner, it creates in them a sense of excitement and the hope that it will continue and that they will be rewarded for their gratitude, which is more important than the good things that happen to them. And they deal with bad things, worries and distress by resisting those that they can resist, alleviating those that they can alleviate, and bearing with goodly patience those that they cannot avoid. Thus as a result of the bad things they gain a lot of benefits, experience, strength, patience and hope of reward, which are more important and which diminish the hardships they have undergone and replace them with happiness and hope for the bounty and reward of Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) expressed this in a saheeh hadeeth (authentic report) in which he said: \u201cHow wonderful is the situation of the believer, for all his affairs are good. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him. This does not apply to anyone but the believer.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2999).\u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that the believer is always gaining and the reward for his deeds is always multiplying, no matter what happens to him, good or bad.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 Being kind to people in word and deed, and all kinds of doing good. This is one of the means of removing worry, distress and anxiety. By this means Allah wards off worries and distress from the righteous and immoral alike, but the believer has the greater share of this, and is distinguished by the fact that his kindness to others stems from sincerity and the hope of reward, so Allah makes it easy for him to be kind to others because of the hope that this will bring good things and ward off bad things, by means of his sincerity and hope of reward. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThere is no good in most of their secret talks save (in) him who orders Sadaqah (charity in Allah\u2019s Cause), or Ma\u2018roof (Islamic Monotheism and all the good and righteous deeds which Allah has ordained), or conciliation between mankind; and he who does this, seeking the good Pleasure of Allah, We shall give him a great reward.\u201d[al-Nisa 4:114]\nPart of this great reward is relief from worry, distress, troubles, etc.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Another of the means of warding off anxiety that stems from nervous tension and being preoccupied with disturbing thoughts is to occupy oneself with good deeds or seeking beneficial knowledge. This will distract one from dwelling on the matters that are causing anxiety. In this way a person may forget about the things that are making him worried and distressed, and he may become happy and more energetic. This is another means that believers and others have in common, but the believer is distinguished by his faith, sincerity and hope of reward when he occupies himself with the knowledge that he is learning or teaching, or with the good deeds that he is doing.\u00a0\nThe work with which he occupies himself should be something that he likes and enjoys, for that is more likely to produce the desired results. And Allah knows best.\u00a0\n4 \u2013 Another thing that may ward off worry and anxiety is focusing all one\u2019s thoughts on the present day, and not worrying about the future or grieving about the past. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sought refuge with Allah from worry and regret, from regret for things in the past which cannot be put right or changed, and worry which may come because of fear for the future. So one should focus only on the present day, and focus one's efforts on getting things right today. If a person is focused on the present, he will do things properly and forget about worry and regret.\nWhen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said a du\u2019a (supplication) or taught a du\u2019a to his ummah (followers), as well as urging them to seek the help of Allah and hope for His bounty, he was also urging them to strive to attain the thing they were praying for through their own efforts and to forget about the thing which they were praying would be warded off from them because du\u2019a (supplication) must be accompanied by action. So a person must strive to attain that which will benefit him in worldly and spiritual terms, and ask his Lord to make his efforts successful, and he should seek His help in this, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cStrive for that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah, and do not be helpless. If anything (bad) happens to you, do not say, \u2018If only I had done such-and-such, then such-and-such would have happened.\u2019 Rather you should say, \u2018Qaddara Allah wa ma sha a fa\u2019ala (Allah decrees, and what He wills He does),\u2019 for (the words) \u2018If only\u2019 open the door to the Shaytan.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) connected the matter of striving to achieve good things with the matter of seeking the help of Allah and not giving in to feelings of helplessness which are a harmful kind of laziness, and with the matter of accepting things in the past which are over and done with, and acknowledging that the will and decree of Allah will inevitably come to pass. He described matters as being of two types:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Matters which a person may strive to achieve or to achieve whatever he can of them, or to ward them off or alleviate them. In such cases a person must strive and make the effort, and also seek the help of Allah.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 Matters where such is not possible, so he must have peace of mind, accept them and submit to Allah\u2019s will.\u00a0\nUndoubtedly paying attention to this principle will bring happiness and relieve worry and distress.\u00a0\n5 \u2013 One of the greatest means of feeling content and relaxed and of acquiring peace of mind is to remember Allah a great deal (dhikr). That has a great effect in bringing contentment and peace of mind, and relieving worry and distress. Allah says:\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.\u201d\u00a0[al-Ra\u2019d 13:28]\nRemembering Allah (dhikr) has a great effect in achieving this aim because it has a special influence and because of the hope that it brings of reward.\u00a0\n6 \u2013 Another of the means of bringing happiness and relieving worry and distress is striving to eliminate the things that cause worry and to achieve the things that bring happiness. That may be done by forgetting about bad things in the past which cannot be changed, and realizing that dwelling on them is a waste of time. So a person must strive to stop himself from thinking of them, and also strive to stop himself from feeling anxious about the future and the things that he may imagine of poverty, fear and other bad things that he thinks may happen to him in the future. He should realize that the future is something that is unknown, he cannot know what good or bad things are going to happen to him. That is in the hand of the Almighty, the Most Wise, and all that His slaves can do is to strive to attain the good things and to ward off the bad things. A person should realize that if he diverts his thoughts from worrying about his future and puts his trust in his Lord to take care of his situation, and puts his mind at rest concerning this, if he does this, then his heart will be at peace and his situation will improve and he will be relieved of worry and anxiety.\u00a0\nOne of the most effective ways of dealing with worries about the future is to recite this du\u2019a which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite:\u00a0\n\u201cAllahumma aslih li deeni alladhi huwa \u2018ismatu amri, wa aslih li dunyaya allati fiha ma\u2019ashi, wa aslih li akhirati allati ilayha ma\u2019adi, waj\u2019al al-hayata ziyadatan li fi kulli khayr, wa\u2019l-mawta rahatan li min kulli sharr (O Allah, correct my religious commitment which is the foundation of my life, and correct my worldly affairs in which is my livelihood, and grant me good in the Hereafter to which is my return. Make my life a means of accumulating good, and make death a respite for me from all evil).\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 2720).\u00a0\nAnd he said, \u201cAllahumma rahmataka arju fa la takilni ila nafsi tarfata \u2018aynin wa aslih li shani kullahu, la ilaha illa anta (O Allah, for Your mercy I hope, so do not abandon me to myself even for a moment. And correct all my affairs. There is no god but You).\u201d (Narrated by Abu Dawood with a saheeh isnad [chain of transmitters], no. 5090; classed as hasan/good by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Kalim al-Tayyib, p.49). \u00a0\nIf a person utters these du\u2019as, which ask that his spiritual and worldly affairs may be set right or corrected, with proper presence of mind and sincerity of intention, whilst striving to achieve this, Allah will grant him what he has prayed for, hoped for and striven for, and He will turn his worry into joy and happiness.\u00a0\n7 \u2013 If a person experiences anxiety and distress because of a disaster, then one of the most effective means of relieving himself of that is to think of the worst scenario to which that may lead, and try to accept that. When he has done this, then he should try to alleviate it as much as possible. By means of this acceptance and these efforts, he will relieve himself of his worries and distress, and instead of worrying he will strive to bring about good things and to deal with whatever he can of the bad things. If he is faced with things that cause fear or the possibility of sickness or poverty, then he should deal with this by striving to make himself accept it, or something even worse, with contentment, because by making himself accept the worst-case scenario, he lessens the impact of the thing and makes it seem less terrible, especially if he occupies himself with efforts to ward it off as much as he can. Thus as well as striving to achieve something good which will distract him from his worries about calamity, he will also renew his strength to resist bad things, and put his trust and reliance in Allah. Undoubtedly these matters are of great benefit in attaining happiness and peace of mind, as well as bringing the hope of reward in this world and in the Hereafter. This is something which is well known from the experience of many who have tried it.\u00a0\n8 \u2013 Steadfastness of heart and not being disturbed about the imaginary things that bad thoughts may bring to mind. For when a person gives in to his imagination and lets his mind be disturbed by these thoughts, such as fear of disease and the like, or anger and confusion stirred up by some grievous matter, or the expectation of bad things and the loss of good things, it will fill him with worries, distress, mental and physical illness and nervous breakdowns, which will have a bad effect on him and which causes a great deal of harm, as many people have seen. But when a person depends on Allah and puts his trust in Him, and does not give in to his imagination or let bad thoughts overwhelm him, and he relies on Allah and has hope of His bounty, this wards off his worries and distress, and relieves him of a great deal of mental and physical sickness. It gives indescribable strength, comfort and happiness to the heart. How many hospitals are filled with the mentally sick victims of illusions and harmful imagination; how often have these things had an effect upon the hearts of many strong people, let alone the weak ones; how often have they led to foolishness and insanity.\u00a0\nIt should be noted that your life will follow your train of thought. If your thoughts are of things that will bring you benefit in your spiritual or worldly affairs, then your life will be good and happy. Otherwise it will be the opposite.\u00a0\nThe person who is safe from all of this is the one who is protected by Allah and helped by Him to strive to achieve that which will benefit and strengthen the heart and ward off anxiety. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.\u201d\u00a0[al-Talaq 65:3]\ni.e., He will be sufficient for all that is worrying him in his spiritual and worldly affairs. The one who puts his trust in Allah will have strength in his heart and will not be affected by anything he imagines or be disturbed by events, because he knows that these are the result of vulnerable human nature and of weakness and fear that have no basis. He also knows that Allah has guaranteed complete sufficiency to those who put their trust in Him. So he trusts in Allah and finds peace of mind in His promise, and thus his worry and anxiety are dispelled; hardship is turned to ease, sadness is turned to joy, fear is turned to peace. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound, and to bless us with strength and steadfastness of heart, and complete trust, for Allah has guaranteed all good things to those who put their trust in Him, and has guaranteed to ward off all bad and harmful things from them.\u00a0\nIf bad things happen or there is the fear of such, then you should count the many blessings that you are still enjoying, both spiritual and worldly, and compare them with the bad things that have happened, for when you compare them you will see the many blessings that you are enjoying, and this will make the bad things appear less serious.\u00a0\nSee al-Wasail al-Mufeedah li\u2019l-Hayat al-Sa\u2019eedah by Shaykh \u2018Abd al-Rahman ibn Sa\u2019di\u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim summed fifteen ways through which Allah may dispel worries and regret. These are as follows:\u00a0\n1-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tawheed al-Ruboobiyyah (belief in the Oneness of Divine Lordship)\n2-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (belief in the Oneness of the Divine nature)\n3-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tawheed of knowledge and belief (i.e., Tawheed al-Asma\u2019 wa\u2019l_Sifaat, belief in the Oneness of the Divine names and attributes)\n4-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thinking of Allah as being above doing any injustice to His slaves, and above punishing anyone for no cause on the part of the slave that would require such punishment.\n5-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The person\u2019s acknowledging that he is the one who has done wrong.\n6-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Beseeching Allah by means of the things that are most beloved to Him, which are His names and attributes. Two of His names that encompass the meanings of all other names and attributes are al-Hayy (the Ever-Living) and al-Qayyoom (the Eternal).\n7-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seeking the help of Allah Alone.\n8-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Affirming one's hope in Him.\n9-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Truly putting one\u2019s trust in Him and leaving matters to Him, acknowledging that one's forelock is in His hand and that He does as He wills, that His will is forever executed and that He is just in all that He decrees.\n10- Letting one's heart wander in the garden of the Quran, seeking consolation in it from every calamity, seeking healing in it from all diseases of the heart, so that it will bring comfort to his grief and healing for his worries and distress.\n11- Seeking forgiveness.\n12- Repentance.\n13- Jihad.\n14-Salah (prayer).\n15-Declaring that he has no power and no strength, and leaving matters to the One in Whose hand they are.\nWe ask Allah to keep us safe and sound from worries and to relieve us of distress and anxiety, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Responsive, and He is the Ever-Living, Eternal.\nSee Alhomoom \u2013 Dealing with Worries and Stress, in the Books section of this site.\nAnd Allah knows best.\nMay Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions."

        "question": "Is it permissible to put the sperm of the husband and the egg of the wife in the uterus of the second wife?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This method of fertilisation, putting the egg with the husband\u2019s sperm in the womb of the other wife is a method that is not permissible according to Islamic teaching, and many of the scholars are of the view that it is prohibited. Two statements concerning it have been issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and by the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League, which originally thought that this method was permissible, then retracted that view. There follows some of what was mentioned in these two statements:\n1.. The statement of the Fiqh Council belonging to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (formerly the Organisation of the Islamic Conference):\nThe session of the Islamic Fiqh Council that was held 8-13 Safar 1407 AH/11-16 October 1986.\nAfter examining the issue of artificial insemination (test-tube babies), studying the research presented, and listening to the explanations given by experts and doctors, and after discussing the matter, the council determined:\nThat the methods of artificial insemination that are known at present are seven:\n1.. Fertilisation occurs between sperm taken from the husband and an egg taken from a woman who is not his wife, then the embryo is implanted in the wife\u2019s uterus.\n2.. Fertilisation occurs between the sperm of a man who is not the husband and an egg taken from the wife, then the embryo is implanted in the wife\u2019s uterus.\n3.. Fertilisation occurs between the sperm and egg of the couple, then the embryo is implanted in the uterus of a woman who volunteers to bear it (surrogate pregnancy).\n4.. Fertilisation occurs externally between the sperm of a man and the egg of a woman [not of the married couple] and the embryo is implanted in the wife\u2019s uterus.\n5.. Fertilisation occurs externally between the husband\u2019s sperm and the wife\u2019s egg, then the embryo is implanted in the uterus of the other wife.\n6.. Sperm is taken from the husband and an egg is taken from his wife and fertilisation occurs externally, then the embryo is implanted in the wife\u2019s uterus.\n7.. Sperm is taken from the husband and injected into the right place in his wife\u2019s vagina or uterus, so that fertilisation may occur internally.\nThe council determined:\nThe first five methods are all haraam according to Islamic teachings, and are to be completely banned because of the way in which they are done, or because of what results from them of mixing of lineage and the child not being brought up with his real mother, and other matters that are contrary to Islamic teachings.\nRegarding the sixth and seventh methods, the council thinks that there is nothing wrong with using them in the case of necessity, whilst affirming that it is essential to take all necessary precautions. End quote.\nMajallat al-Majma\u2018 (3/1/423).\n2.. The statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League:\nPraise be to Allah and blessings and peace be upon our master and Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and upon his family and companions. To proceed:\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council, in its eighth session, held in the headquarters of the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah, Saturday 28 Rabee\u2018 al-Aakhir 1405 \u2013 Monday 7 Jumaada al-Oola 1405 AH (19-28 January 1985 CE) examined the concerns expressed by some of its members regarding what the council had permitted in the second clause of the fifth statement having to do with artificial insemination and test-tube babies, which was issued during its seventh session that was held 11-16 Rabee\u2018 al-Aakhir 1404 AH, the text of which was:\n\u201cRegarding the seventh method, in which the sperm and egg are taken from the married couple, and after fertilisation in the laboratory, the fertilised egg is implanted in the uterus of the other wife of the same husband, as she volunteers willingly to carry that pregnancy for her co-wife, who has had a hysterectomy: it appears to the council that this is permissible in the case of necessity, in accordance with the general conditions that have been mentioned.\nSummary of the concerns:\nThe other wife, in whose uterus the fertilised egg of the first wife is implanted, may become pregnant before her uterus closes following implantation of the fertilised egg, as a result of her husband having intercourse with her around the time that the fertilised egg is implanted, then she may give birth to twins and not know which came from the fertilised egg and which resulted from intercourse with her husband. As a result, it will be not possible to know who is the mother of which twin. Moreover, one of the two embryos may die in the early stages of pregnancy, and not be expelled except with the birth of the other, and it will not be known whether the surviving child grew from the fertilised egg or from the pregnancy that resulted from the husband having intercourse with her. This would result in mixing of lineages and it would not be known who the true mother is of either child, and this would affect rulings that are connected to that. All of this dictates that the council should retract its ruling regarding the case mentioned.\nThe council also listened to opinions presented by gynaecologists and obstetricians who attended the session and confirmed the possibility that a pregnancy could result from intercourse with the husband at the same time as the pregnancy resulting from the implanting of the fertilised egg, and that could lead to mixing of lineages in the manner mentioned in the concerns referred to.\nAfter discussing the topic and exchanging views on it, the council decided to retract its view regarding the permissibility of the seventh method referred to in the statement previously issued by the Council in its seventh session held in 1404 AH. End quote.\nQaraaraat al-Majma\u2018 al-Fiqhi (p. 159-161).\nBased on that:\nIt is not permissible to take the sperm of the husband and the egg of the wife and put this mixture in the uterus of the husband\u2019s other wife.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Our worries are bothering us a great deal!",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.I thank you for your trust and ask Allaah to give us and you strength and wisdom, and to show us what is true and help us to follow it, and to show us what is false and help us to avoid it, and not to let it confuse us and lead us astray\u2026 With regard to what you asked about, my comments on it are as follows:\u00a0\n1 \u2013Thinking about the matters of our daily lives, and our private and public affairs is something that is essential and important, it is necessary in order for us to deal with these matters and benefit from them in the appropriate manner. The Qur\u2019aan \u2013 which is the word of Allaah \u2013 urges us to think, in more than one verse, for example:\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying): Our Lord! You have not created (all) this without purpose\u2026\u201d\u00a0[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:191]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd on the earth are signs for those who have Faith with certainty.\nAnd also in your ownselves. Will you not then see?\u201d\u00a0[al-Dhaariyaat 51:20-21]\u00a0\n\u201cWill you not then take thought?\u201d\u00a0[al-An\u2019aam 6:50]\u00a0\n\u201cHave you then no understanding?\u201d[al-Baqarah 2:76]\nAnd there are other verses which encourage us to think about our affairs and indeed about the life and creation around us.\u00a0\nSo thinking in and of itself is not a problem, rather it is required, important and essential, and it is enjoined by our religion and encouraged by our Qur\u2019aan.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 This \u201cthinking\u201d may become a psychological or social problem if it prevents a person from playing his natural role that is expected of him in life.\u00a0\nSuch as thinking that things are more serious than they really are, or thinking too much about matters where thinking about them will not change anything at all, rather that only causes distress and becomes an obstacle prevents one from taking any initiative, and make him hesitant and confused, and unable to take any decision.\u00a0\nThinking may become a problem in shar\u2019i terms if it makes a person go beyond his intellectual limits in thinking about matters of the unseen and things that he can never comprehend, which may open many doors for the accursed Shaytaan to influence him.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 With regard to thinking a great deal about everything and worrying about every problem, this is to some extent a natural thing, so long as it does not prevent you from living your lives in a natural manner. What I mean here is, is this thinking helping you to come up with solutions to these problems that you are facing? Do these situations deserve all the time that you are spending on thinking about them? If the answer is yes, then there is no problem! But if the answer is no, then you yourself are admitting that they do not warrant that, and then you are halfway to solving the problem, which is to identify the problem and take a decision concerning it. Because when we know what the problem is, it is easy for us to find the right way of dealing with it.\u00a0\n4 \u2013 Overcoming these problems needs some discipline and some time. You can make the decision to start and you are able, with the help and support of Allaah, to do that. You have to trust yourselves in this regard!\u00a0\n5 \u2013 I suggest to you that you divide your concerns and problems into three categories or levels:\u00a0\n\u00b7Concerns and problems that have a direct impact upon your married and social lives in a serious manner that may lead to breakdown in relationships. These must be given their due measure of objective thought and you should try to reach an agreement and settle the matter. They should not be ignored for so long that it becomes too difficult to deal with them.\n\u00b7The second level is concerns or problems in which the positive and negative aspects are equal and in which you are involved. In these cases you should pray istikhaarah to Allaah, and it is o.k. to consult others concerning them and to weigh up alternatives, then decide what you think is the solution, bearing in mind issues of sharee\u2019ah and custom, without going to extremes in worrying about it.\n\u00b7The third level is concerns and worries that do not concern you at all, because they have to do with other people. It is better not to get involved in them and waste your time with them, because they simply do not concern you and your opinion does not matter.\n6 \u2013 The concerns and matters of our daily lives inevitably fall into one of three categories:\u00a0\n\u00b7Matters which are in the past and are over and done with. We should not worry about these too much, except to the extent from which we can learn from our mistakes and experiences when dealing with things in the future. The past cannot come back and there is no need to worry about things that are over and done with.\n\u00b7Matters which lay ahead in the future. It is more appropriate not to think about these a great deal before they happen, because the future is part of the unseen, and all that we have to do in this case is to examine the choices we have in this matter if it comes to pass. When the time comes, we have to put our trust in Allaah and take a decision.\n\u00b7Matters of day-to-day life. This is where we attempt to weigh up all the available alternatives, and it is o.k. to consult others with regard to these things and to exchange ideas without going to extremes or worrying too much. In the end, things will turn out as we hope, by Allaah\u2019s leave, so long as we pursue the means of praying istikhaarah and consulting others, and good lies in that which is chosen by Allaah.\n7 \u2013 Getting used to this requires some discipline. You could agree with your husband to cooperate in this matter and remind one another when you are worrying more than you need to about a matter. Gradually you will find that you are becoming able to deal with day-to-day matters in an objective manner.\u00a0\n8 \u2013 There is a good book on the topic of anxiety which gives practical means of dealing with this matter, and I advise you to read it. It is called How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Dale Carnegie.\u00a0\n9 \u2013 First and last, have a good intention and pray sincerely that Allaah will give you strength and help you and set your thinking straight."

        "question": "What to Do When You Are Losing Faith in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.My brother, have great hope in Allah, and do not let the devil cause you to despair of the vast mercy of Allah which He has guaranteed for His believing slaves. What you are telling yourself about this being a sign that you will die following something other than that which Allah wants is only insinuating whispers (Waswas ) from the devil and his deviant ideas by means of which he wants to tempt the slaves of Allah and lead them away from their religion.\u00a0\nSo he comes to a righteous slave and whispers to him that his good deeds are of no avail, or that he is doing them not for the sake of Allah but to show off to people, so that they will think he is good.\n\u00a0All of these are the usual ways with which the devil tries to trick the slaves of Allah, especially those who show signs of being righteous \u2013 of whom I think that you are one, although I do not praise anyone before Allah \u2013 to hinder their efforts. We seek refuge with Allah from him.\u00a0\nYou need to increase your hope and trust in Allah Who forgives all sins, and who accepts the slave who seeks His protection and refuge, for He is the Most Merciful, the Oft-Forgiving and the\u00a0Most Loving. \u00a0\nYou should increase your good deeds , such as reading the Quran, giving charity , remembering Allah (Dhikr ), upholding the ties of kinship, etc.\u00a0\nThe weakness which you feel also happens to others, for it is something natural. How many people were examples followed by others and had a great deal of drive and ambition, then they lost their drive and ambition for a long time, then it came back to them by the grace of Allah.\u00a0\nRemember the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \u201cEverybody has his time of energy, and every time of energy is followed by a time of lethargy. But if a person tries to follow a moderate path, then I have hope for him, but if he becomes one who is pointed out (in the street), then do not think anything of him.\u201d (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2453; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi, 1995)\u00a0\nWhat is meant by \u201cEverybody has his time of energy\u201d is eagerness for a thing, energy and the desire to do good.\nWhat is meant by \u201cevery time of energy is followed by a time of lethargy\u201d is tiredness, weakness and lack of movement.\n\u201cBut if a person tries to follow a moderate path\u201d means that the one who has energy does his deeds in moderation and avoids going to extremes when he is feeling energetic and avoids being negligent when he is feeling lethargic.\n\u201cThen I have hope for him\u201d means, I have hope that he will be successful, for he can continue following a middle course, and the most beloved deeds to Allah are those which are continuous.\n\u201cbut if he becomes one who is pointed out (in the street)\u201d means, if he strives hard and goes to extremes in doing good deeds so that he will become famous for his worship and asceticism, and he becomes famous and people point him out to one another,\n\u201cthen do not think anything of him\u201d means, do not think that he is one of the righteous, because he is showing off. He did not say, \u201cdo not have hope for him,\u201d as an indication that he has already fallen, and he will not be able to make up for what he has missed out on.\u00a0[Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi]\u00a0\nThink about this Hadith, and relate it to your own situation and the situation of others: you will see a clear similarity. This Hadith clearly states that man goes through a stage of incomparable eagerness and great focus and ambition, then suddenly he becomes weak and loses that focus and eagerness and ambition. When he reaches this stage, he must strive even harder to do obligatory duties and avoid prohibited things. If he does that, then there is the hope that he will succeed and progress, but if he falls into prohibited things and stops doing obligatory things, he will be lost and doomed.\nSo you must turn to Allah a great deal, seek His forgiveness and ask Him to make you steadfast until death. I also advise you to keep away from prohibited things. May Allah forgive your sins and make things easier for you.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 9356 , 10776 , 14041 , and 223615 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Treating the husband\u2019s addiction to pornography",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Many young men in our ummah nowadays are facing addiction to pornography, because it is so easily available online. This type of addiction makes a person unable to be content with real-life, permissible intimacy with his wife, because he is addicted to a haraam virtual reality and because of his following his whims and desires.\nThe issue is not merely one of whether he feels happy with you and enjoys intimacy with you; rather it has to do with his addiction to viewing other women, especially as he did this in the first month of his marriage to you.\nThis addiction is a sickness which needs a remedy.\nSome of the greatest and most effective remedies for addiction include: keeping away \u2013 voluntarily or otherwise \u2013 from the source of this addiction; keeping oneself busy with things that will benefit one in this world or the hereafter; and visiting a psychologist who can intervene with medicines and talk therapy, if necessary.\nThis requires effort on your part to help him give up this addiction, by trying to distract him from electronic devices that opened the door to that, and speaking to him about research that warns against addiction to these devices. You can also try to fill his time with beneficial matters, both worldly and religious, and help him to strive to obey Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.\nIf you find that he is reluctant and rejects these attempts, then you can suggest to him to go to a psychologist, to try to rid himself of his addiction to these devices and the symptoms of anxiety that result from that.\nWe advise you, as a matter of urgency, to consult a trustworthy and religiously committed female advisor, even if that is online, so that she can advise you in detail about how to handle different issues of life with him in general, and your marital relationship in particular.\nPlease note that it is not permissible to divulge details of your marital relationship and the like to any man other than your father, whether he is a psychologist or otherwise, because of what that may lead to of opening the door to temptation or haraam infatuation.\nIn brief, your aim here is to distract him with yourself from others, and make him content with that which is halaal so that he will not seek that which is\u00a0 haraam. Strive hard to achieve that and seek reward with Allah with regard to this important matter.\nWith regard to him looking at clips of the third sex \u2013 may Allah guide us and him \u2013 this is perverse behaviour, because he is enjoying looking at something that is perverse. But that does not necessarily mean that he is homosexual, because a homosexual man does not usually enjoy looking at female forms; rather it is the exact opposite.\nWe ask Allah to guide us and you, for He, may He be glorified, is indeed able to do that.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "She forsook her friends, but this had a negative effect on her \u2013 advice",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nUndoubtedly what you are feeling towards your sisters is caused by the shaytaan and his plots and tricks. According to what you say in your letter, these sisters have not done anything to make you treat them in this manner; even if they made some mistakes or did something wrong, all people are like that; who is there who never did anything wrong?\u00a0\nThis indicates that the matter is no more than a trick of the shaytaan to make you fall into the situation you are in now. We are sorry to see that he has succeeded in that and that he has made these friends hateful to you and caused you to give up on doing acts of obedience and worship.\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cO you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al\u2011Fahsha\u2019 [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al\u2011Munkar [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islam)]\u201d\n[al-Noor 24:21]\nYou should understand that the tricks that the shaytaan uses with those who are obedient to their Lord are:\u00a0\n1.Sowing discord among the Muslims, especially between righteous\u00a0 friends\nIt was narrated that Jaabir said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: \u201cThe Shaytaan has despaired of being worshipped in the Arabian Peninsula, but he will sow seeds of discord among them.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (2812).\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi said: This hadeeth is one of the miracles of Prophethood. What it means is that he has despaired of being worshipped by the people of the Arabian Peninsula, but he will strive to sow discord among them, with arguments, disputes, wars, tribulations and so on.\nSharh Muslim (17/156).\u00a0\n2.He makes righteous company hateful to them, and causes them to prefer harmful isolation\nIt was narrated that Abu\u2019l-Darda\u2019 said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: \u201cThere are no three men in a town or in the desert among whom prayer is not established, but the shaytaan has taken control of them, so you must adhere to the jamaa\u2019ah, for the wolf only eats the sheep that wanders away on its own.\u201d\nNarrated by Abu Dawood (547) and al-Nasaa\u2019i (847); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Mu\u2019aadh ibn Jabal that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe shaytaan is the wolf of man like the wolf of sheep takes the stray sheep and the one that wanders far. Beware of division, and adhere to the jamaa\u2019ah.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by Ahmad (22029); classed as hasan by the editors of al-Musnad.\u00a0\nAl-Manaawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: i.e., he corrupts man, by tempting him, and he destroys him, like a wolf running loose among a flock of sheep.\u00a0\n\u201cHe takes the stray sheep\u201d i.e., the one that wanders far from its companions. This is a metaphor for the one who is separate from the jamaa\u2019ah (main body of Muslims) and keeps away from them, then the shaytaan overpowers him, like the sheep that wanders away from the flock, then the wolf catches it because it is alone. \u00a0\nThe metaphor ends with a warning: \u201cbeware of division\u201d i.e., beware of separation and dissent. \u201cAnd adhere to the jamaa\u2019ah\u201d, affirmation after affirmation, i.e., cling to it, stay with the main group, for the one who drifts away will end up in the Fire. \u00a0\nFayd al-Qadeer (2/350).\u00a0\nStrive to bar both ways to the shaytaan, and do not open any doors to evil. You did not become bored and lose resolve to obey Allaah until after the shaytaan was able to overpower you and lead you in the way he wanted. Perhaps if you compare your situation now with your situation before, you will be able to see that it is the result of the shaytaan\u2019s plots and tricks, so beware and pay attention.\u00a0\nRighteous friends are one of the greatest means by which a Muslim can remain steadfast in adhering to his religion, so strive to form such friendships as Allaah has prescribed.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Moosa that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe believers are like a structure, parts of which support other parts.\u201d\n\u00a0Narrated by al-Bukhaari (467) and Muslim (2585).\u00a0\n\u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \u201cYou should seek sincere brothers, for they are an adornment at times of ease and a support at times of calamity.\u201d\u00a0\nStrive to do acts of worship and righteous deeds, for they are the best help in remaining steadfast, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u201cAllaah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allaah Alone and none else), and in the Hereafter. And Allaah will cause to go astray those who are Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers), and Allaah does what He wills\u201d\n[Ibraaheem 14:27]\u00a0\n\u201cbut if they had done what they were told, it would have been better for them, and would have strengthened their (Faith)\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 4:66]\u00a0\nStrive to persist in saying du\u2019aa\u2019 and beseech Allaah to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion, and to increase you in guidance and strength and righteousness, for this is the state of the believers, as Allaah tells us of them in the verse where He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201c(They say): \u2018Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower\u2019\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:8]\nIt was narrated that Anas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) often used to say: \u201cO Turner of the hearts, make my heart steadfast in adhering to Your religion.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2140) and Ibn Maajah (3834); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. \u00a0\nSetting things straight between you and them need not take a great deal of effort. You can restore this good relationship by replying to their messages, talking to them, and telling them that you have some personal problems, with no need to tell them the details; it is sufficient to be a lesson for you in the future.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nBeware of being alone and remaining isolated, because they are the first steps on the road to deviation and falling into the pit. If your withdrawing is for the purpose of worship and devotion, then it has some basis in sharee\u2019ah, but the kind of isolation that leads to apathy is a haraam kind of isolation. In that case mixing with your friends becomes obligatory, so you should pay attention to that.\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAs for the words \u201cis it better for the one who is striving hard to be isolated or mix with people?\u201d, although people disagree concerning this issue, in whole or in part, the truth of the matter is that mixing with people may, at different times, be obligatory or mustahabb, and an individual may, at different times, be required to mix with people or to isolate himself. It depends: if mixing with people will involve cooperation in righteousness and piety, then he is enjoined to do it, and if it will involve cooperation in sin and transgression, then he is forbidden to do it. Mixing with the Muslims for some types of acts of worship, such as the five daily prayers, Jumu\u2019ah, the eclipse prayer, prayers for rain (istisqa\u2019) and so on, is something that is enjoined by Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\u00a0 The same applies to mixing with them at the time of Hajj, when fighting the kuffaar, even if the leaders are evildoers or there are evildoers among those groups.\u00a0\nThe same applies to meetings which increase a person in faith, either because they benefit from him or he benefits from them, and so on.\u00a0\nBut there are times when the believer must be alone in his du\u2019aa\u2019, dhikr, prayer, thinking, taking stock of himself, setting himself straight, and private matters which have nothing to do with anyone else. At these times he needs to be alone, either in his house \u2013as Tawoos said: The best cell of a man is his house, where he restrains his gaze and tongue \u2013 or elsewhere.\u00a0\nChoosing to mix in absolute terms is wrong and choosing isolation in absolute terms is also wrong. So too the amount of each that a person needs, and what is best for him in each case, is something that depends on each person, as stated above.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (10/425, 426)\u00a0\nYou should realize that the calamities that have befallen your heart, of resentment and envy are all connected to the situation you are in. The reward of a good deed is another good deed like it, and the punishment of a bad deed is another bad deed.\u00a0\nIf you had understood things as they should be understood, you would know that Allah knows best about His creation, and He raises some of them above others in status, by His knowledge of His creation and His wisdom for a purpose that He wants for them. \u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSee how We prefer one above another (in this world), and verily, the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:21]\n\u201cThus We have tried some of them with others, that they might say: \u2018Is it these (poor believers) whom Allaah has favoured from amongst us?\u2019 Does not Allaah know best those who are grateful?\u201d\n[al-An\u2019aam 6:53]\nShaykh Ibn Sa\u2019di said: i.e., this is a way in which Allaah tests His slaves, whereby He makes some of them rich and some poor, some noble and some lowly. When Allaah blesses a poor or lowly person with faith, that is a test for the rich and noble. If his aim is to find the truth and follow it, he will believe and become Muslim, and the fact that there are poor and lowly people who are less then him in wealth and status who are Muslim does not prevent him from embracing Islam. But if he is not sincere in seeking the truth, this will be an obstacle that will prevent him from being among the followers of the truth.\u00a0 They said, mocking those whom they regarded as inferior to them, \u201cIs it these (poor believers) whom Allaah has favoured from amongst us?\u201d That prevented them from following the truth. Allaah said, responding to their words which implied objection to Allaah for guiding these people and not guiding them: \u201cDoes not Allaah know best those who are grateful?\u201d, those who acknowledge the blessing and appreciate it, and do what it requires of righteous deeds. So He bestows His grace and favour upon them, and not those who are not grateful, for Allaah is wise and does not bestow His grace on those who are not deserving of it; those who objected do not deserve it, unlike those whom Allaah has blessed with faith of the poor and others, who are grateful. Tafseer al-Sa\u2019di (258).\u00a0\nWhat you should have done was to hasten to do good deeds, and give up evil, and compete with people in that, as the Lord of the Worlds says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cso compete in good deeds. The return of you (all) is to Allaah; then He will inform you about that in which you used to differ\u201d\n[al-Maa'idah 5:48].\nAl-Hasan al-Basri (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Whoever competes with you in religious commitment, compete with him, and whoever competes with you in worldly matters, give it up to him.\u00a0\nBut refraining from doing good deeds and being preoccupied with these problems, this is not the action of wise people at all.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to guide you to that which He loves and which pleases Him, and to set your thinking and your affairs straight, and to make your heart steadfast in faith and obedience. We hope that you will understand what we have said about reviewing your disconnection from your sisters, including being keen to resume those good friendships, and keeping away from the traps of the shaytaan and shunning his waswaas. We hope that Allaah will help you to do that.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "A righteous young man is overwhelmed with worry and anxiety. What is the remedy?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We are happy to see your concern for this young man and your eagerness to find an effective remedy to offer him in the hope that Allah will benefit him thereby. By doing that you are strengthening the ties of Islamic brotherhood. We hope that Allah will reward you for that.\u00a0\nYou have explained this young man\u2019s situation, and we will reply in the following points:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 In this dunya (this world \u2013 the name in Arabic carries connotations both of that which is close and that which is base and vile), a man\u2019s life is not consistent, rather his circumstances will vary between that which he likes and that which he does not like.\u00a0 The wise man, when he thinks about this world, will realize that he needs to develop an optimistic outlook and put an end to worries and distress that could disturb him and cause him stress. \u00a0\nWhat the Shaytaan wants to do is to cause the Muslim grief and stress. Being introverted and thinking constantly about pain and sorrow gives the Shaytaan a great opportunity and may cause the worries and stress to multiply. Looking forward to a happy life and being optimistic is one of the means of feeling content and at peace. It is known that this world is a mixture of ease and hardship, joy and sorrow, hope and pain, so why should a person help the dark side to prevail over the bright side?\u00a0\nWisdom dictates that if a man cannot make optimism prevail, then at the very least he should think in a balanced and objective manner.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nFeelings of stress and that life is too hard do not control a man's mind unless there are reasons that provoke these kinds of feelings. Rather they are indicative that the relationship between a person and his Lord is not sound. The more a man turns to Allah and focuses on Him, the more he will feel a sense of peace and comfort, to an extent that no one knows except Allah. Hence those who know Allah, are close to Him and fear Him are the happiest of people, to such an extent that one of them said, in a well known expression: \u201cIf the kings and the sons of kings knew what joy we have, they would fight us for it with the sword.\u201d This is also what is expressed in the Quran, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cWhoever works righteousness \u2014 whether male or female \u2014 while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)\u201d\u00a0[al-Nahl 16:97]\nBut feeling stressed is a kind of wake-up call that alerts a person to check on his relationship with his Lord, because sins may have the effect of making a person feel scattered and unfocused. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cBut whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Quran nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection\u201d\u00a0[Ta-Ha 20:124]\nThere is a great deal of goodness in the young man whom you are asking about, for he is a person who is keen to seek knowledge, and he does naafil acts of worship such as fasting, and he upholds ties of kinship with his aunt. However you must draw his attention to the fact that he has to check on his relationship with Allah, for there may be some sin that is preventing him from achieving this sense of happiness, some sin that he has committed with regard to the rights of Allah or the rights of others. So encourage him to repent and seek forgiveness a great deal, especially since you said that he sometimes sleeps and misses the prayer \u2013 this is a serious matter although many people take it lightly.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nIt may be that this test of this person through disasters and calamities is something that has been decreed by Allah for him in order to raise him in status, if he persists in obeying what Allah has commanded, which is to be patient and accept whatever Allah decrees. Everything that Allah decrees for a believer is good for him and his affairs, both spiritual and worldly. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cHow wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and that applies to no one except a believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is also good for him.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 2999)\u00a0\nIf something bad happens to a believer, he either bears it with patience or panics. If he is patient he earns a great reward and accepts the will and decree of Allah, because he knows that it comes from Allah, so he feels content with it and accepts it. So what reason is there to panic and feel stressed?\u00a0\nOn the contrary, if he is not patient and he reacts to what befalls him of sin with panic and anger, and worry and stress, he will lose the reward that Allah has promised to those who are patient. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cOnly those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning\u201d\u00a0[al-Zumar 39:10]\nFourthly:\u00a0\nHe should sincerely turn towards Allah and call upon Him (du\u2019a\u2019), beseeching Him to relieve him of this waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan) and seeking refuge in Him a great deal from the accursed Shaytaan. For it annoys the Shaytaan to see a believing slave feeling peace of mind and contentment, so he whispers to him to distract him from that and make him fearful and confused. \u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us a du\u2019aa\u2019 by which we may ward off worries and distress. Ahmad (3528) narrated that \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Mas\u2019ood said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n\u201cThere is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: \u2018Allahumma inni \u2018abduka ibn \u2018abdika ibn amatija naasyati bi yadika, maada fiyya hukmuka, \u2018adlun fiyya qadaa\u2019uka. As\u2019aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw \u2018allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw ista\u2019tharta bihi fi \u2018ilm il-ghayb \u2018indaka an taj\u2019al al-Qurana rabee\u2019 qalbi wa noor sadri wa jalaa\u2019 huzni wa dhihaab hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant; my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Quran the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety),\u2019 but Allah will take away his distress and grief, and replace it with joy.\u201d He was asked: \u201cO Messenger of Allah, should we learn this?\u201d He said: \u201cOf course; everyone who hears it should learn it.\u201d\u00a0\n(Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 199)\u00a0\nFifthly:\u00a0\nTry to suggest that he change something in his daily routine, to allow himself the opportunity to do different kinds of permissible things that will relieve him of boredom and renew his energy. There is nothing wrong with travelling for leisure purposes or to relax, so long he does not go to extremes. Even better than that is if he can travel for the purpose of \u2018Umrah and to visit the Prophet\u2019s mosque, because a change of scene can be very beneficial.\u00a0\nSixthly:\u00a0\nHe has to keep away from places that he feels make his worry and distress worse, or that stir these feeling up again. He should avoid reading novels that tell sad stories, and he should try not to sit with people who are worried and distressed, even if his intention is to console them.\u00a0 On the contrary, he should try to read useful books that will take him away from these worries. If he feels stressed and upset, he should not isolate himself or think constantly about his problems in this situation. \u00a0\nFinally:\u00a0\nOur advice to this young man is that he should raise his head and look forward, and view the future with optimism and the certainty that he will succeed. I say to him: You have a great deal of potential for success and high achievement, and a lot is to be expected of someone like you. We hope that these troubles and worries will be lifted from you. May Allah make things easy for you and relieve you of your distress and worry.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "He is afraid of meeting people",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Faith becomes weaker as a result of neglecting obligatory duties and doing haraam things. So long as you are doing your duty towards Allaah and heeded His prohibitions, your introversion and keeping away from people, and your fear of them,\u00a0 will not harm you. But if your fear keeps you from doing any obligatory duty then you will have committed sin thereby, for example, if your fear stops you attending prayers in congregation in the mosque, or stops you denouncing any evil action that you could change by speaking out or taking action, or stops you from offering advice that you should offer to those who need it.\u00a0\nYou should not give in to these fears or accept them, rather you should look for the causes and try to deal with them. It may help you to know that created beings have no power to bring benefit to themselves or to ward off harm, rather if the nation were to gather together to benefit you in some way, they could not do so unless Allaah has decreed that for you, and if they were to gather together to harm you in some way, they could not do that unless Allaah has decreed that for you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.\u00a0\nEverything is in the hand of Allaah, and He is the One Whom you should fear and put your hopes in. The criticism of people has no value and carries no weight; it is sufficient for the believer to attain the pleasure of Allaah even if all the people are displeased with him.\u00a0\nWhoever adheres to the command of Allaah and persists in doing so, is the most honoured of people, for Allaah has decreed honour for His believing slaves. As Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cBut honour, power and glory belong to Allaah, and to His Messenger (Muhammad), and to the believers...\u201d\n[al-Munaafiqoon 63:8]\nThe effects of this honour should be manifested in the believer\u2019s words and actions, in all circumstances. He should speak up for the truth, offer sincere advice, remind people and teach them. His approval and anger should be for the sake of Allaah, and he should only get angry when the limits of Allaah are transgressed.\u00a0\nThis is what a person will be able to do when he becomes aware of his role in life, for he is commanded to worship Allaah and to convey and spread His religion as much as he can. This means that he should mix with people and bear any annoyance they cause with patience, especially close relatives. According to a hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1307 and Ibn Maajah (4032) from Ibn \u2018Umar, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe believer who mixes with people and bears any annoyance they cause with patience, is better than the believer who does not mix with people and does not bear any annoyance they cause with patience.\u201d (This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, no. 6651).\u00a0\nPerhaps you can start to get to know some righteous friends with whom you can feel comfortable and secure, who can help you to overcome your feelings of fear of people, and this will help you to find the sincere brotherhood, good treatment, clear goals and sincere intentions that you are missing in the people around you.\u00a0\nWe also advise you to go to a doctor who specializes in treating psychological illness, perhaps he could help you to solve your problem.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to help you and give you strength."

        "question": "He hates life and wishes for death",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim to hate life and despair of what Allah, may He be exalted, could grant him of relief and good health. What is required of him is to bear with patience whatever he is facing of what Allah has willed and decreed, and to seek reward with Him, may He be exalted, for what befalls him of calamities, and to ask Him, may He be glorified, to avert that from him, to help him and to reward him for what He decrees should befall him of that. And he should wait for relief from Allah, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cFor indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.\u00a0 Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease\u201d [ash-Sharh 94:5-6]. It is makrooh for a Muslim to wish for death because of some harm that befell him, such as sickness, hardship or anything else. In as-Saheehayn it is narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cNo one of you should wish for death because of some harm that befalls him. But if he must do that, then let him say: \u2018O Allah, cause me to live so long as life is good for me, and cause me to die so long as that is good for me.\u2019\u201d From the wording of the hadith, we understand that this is a kind of delegating one\u2019s affairs to Allah and submitting to His will and decree. Whatever befalls a Muslim of calamities in this world is an expiation for him, if he seeks reward for that with Allah, may He be exalted, and does not become discontent. This is a wake-up call to turn away from heedlessness, and a lesson for the future.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

        "question": "causes of apathy and the remedy for that",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There are several causes of apathy and before dealing with the problem we have to pause and find out the cause. There are several ways of finding out the cause and dealing with apathy.\u00a0\nSome of these causes are: a weak relationship with Allaah, laziness in worship, keeping company with careless people, being distracted by this world and its delights, and not thinking about the end of this world and the consequences of being ill-prepared to meet Allaah.\u00a0\nAs for how to treat the Muslim who has been afflicted by apathy in worship, there are several ways of doing so including the following:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Strengthening his relationship with his Lord, by reading the Qur\u2019aan and pondering its meanings, realizing the greatness of Allaah by seeing the greatness of His Book, thinking about the greatness of His names and attributes and actions.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 Regularly offering naafil prayers and persisting in doing so, even if they are few, because one of the greatest causes of the Muslim becoming apathetic is when he starts to do acts of worship and does a great deal in the beginning. This is not the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and is not what he advised his ummah to do. \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) described his actions as ongoing, i.e., not interrupted or infrequent. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that, \u201cThe most beloved of actions to Allaah are those which are done persistently, even if they are little.\u201d If a Muslim wants not to be afflicted by apathy, then let him strive to do a small action persistently, because this is better than doing a lot infrequently.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Striving to keep company with righteous and active people. A man who is energetic (in worship and Islamic activities) will make you more active and lazy people do not like active companions. So look for active friends who strive to memorize Qur\u2019aan, seek knowledge and call people to Allaah. Friends like that will encourage you to worship and will show you the way to good things.\u00a0\n4 \u2013 Read books that tell the stories of active people so that you will have good examples in your journey towards Allaah. For example, \u2018Uluw al-Himmah by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ismaa\u2019eel al-Muqaddim; Salaah al-Ummah fi \u2018Uluw al-Himmah by Shaykh Sayyid \u2018Afaani.\u00a0\n5 \u2013 We advise you to make du\u2019aa\u2019, especially in the latter part of the night. The one who turns to his Lord and seeks His help to remain steadfast in worshipping Him and to worship Him well will never be let down.\nWe ask Allaah to help you to do that which pleases Him and to guide you to the best attitudes, words and deeds.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Motives for success and overcoming failure",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The name of failure is enough to put us off it and strive for success, regardless of the material gains that a man may attain as the result of his success, because failure is a word that implies shortcomings and loss, and success is a word that implies perfection and praise.\u00a0\nFailure and success are two sides of the same coin, although they may seem to contradict one another at first glance. But in fact they are interconnected if you think about it, based on experience and real life.\nSuccess is the path in this life which Allaah wants to be the aim of every believer. He has created the universe and subjugated it to meet this aim. He, may He be glorified, has enjoined man to believe, and has asked him to adhere to full submission to Him, as he cannot be anything but a slave to Allaah, and He has made that the purpose of creation, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I (Allaah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)\u201d\n[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]\nAnd He has promised that the one who dies following this path will be the successful one, and others will be losers:\u00a0\n\u201cAnd whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:185]\nSo success is the story of life, the purpose for which Allaah has created this universe. He only sent the Messengers and revealed the Books to call people to attain true success before Allaah. He has decreed certain matters in order to motivate us to attain success in this world and in the Hereafter, as follows:\u00a0\n-He decreed eternal and everlasting delight for those who pass the test of faith and full submission, and adhere to that path and die following it:\n\u201cThen as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand will say: \u2018Here! read my Record!\n20.\u00a0\u2018Surely, I did believe that I shall meet my Account!\u2019\n21.\u00a0So he shall be in a life, well\u2011pleasing.\n22.\u00a0In a lofty Paradise,\n23.\u00a0The fruits in bunches whereof will be low and near at hand.\n24.\u00a0Eat and drink at ease for that which you have sent on before you in days past!\u201d\n[al-Haaqqah 69:19-24]\n-The Qur\u2019aan depicts the state of those who refused to follow the path of success and insisted on following the path of evil and failure, and described their situation on the Day when results will be shown, and it will be known who succeeded and who failed:\n\u201cBut as for him who will be given his Record in his left hand, will say: \u2018I wish that I had not been given my Record!\n26.\u00a0\u2018And that I had never known how my Account is!\n27.\u00a0\u2018Would that it had been my end (death)!\n28.\u00a0\u2018My wealth has not availed me;\n29.\u00a0\u2018My power (and arguments to defend myself) have gone from me!\u2019\u201d\n[al-Haaqqah 69:25-29]\n-Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, decreed a good life in this world for the one who follows the path of success, He said (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cWhoever works righteousness \u2014 whether male or female \u2014 while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)\u201d\n[al-Nahl 16:97]\nIbn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\nThis is a promise from Allaah to the one who does righteous deeds, that Allaah will give him a good life in this world, and a good life includes all kinds of comfort and delight. It was narrated from Ibn \u2018Abbaas and others that they interpreted it as meaning a goodly halaal provision, and it was narrated from \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he interpreted it as meaning contentment. \u2018Ali ibn Abi Talhah said, narrating from Ibn \u2018Abbaas, that it means happiness. The correct view is that a good life includes all of these things. Tafseer al-Qur\u2019aan il-\u2018Azeem (4/601).\u00a0\nThis is the way according to which the Muslim should live throughout his life. The one who starts out on the basis of this understanding will inevitably be led to success and achievement in all his affairs, both religious and worldly, because the believer knows that he is required to establish truth and justice in this world, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cIndeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance (justice) that mankind may keep up justice\u201d\n[al-Hadeed 57:25]\nAn individual\u2019s success is part of the success of the ummah in achieving justice and fairness.\u00a0\nAnd the believer also hears the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: \u201cAllaah loves, when one of you does a thing, that he should do it well.\u201d Narrated by Abu Ya\u2019la (7/349) and classed as hasan by al-Albaani on the basis of corroborating evidence in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (1113). Doing things well is one of the pillars of success.\u00a0\nThese motives are all things that prepare the believer to attain the highest degrees of success. He always strives to develop his talents and learn useful skills, and to develop himself on the educational, moral, social and economic levels. He knows that the successful, striving believer is better than the one who is idle and lazy, who earns nothing from his laziness but loss in both worldly and religious terms.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe strong believer is better and more beloved to Allaah than the weak believer, although both are good. Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allaah, and do not feel helpless. If anything befalls you, do not say \u2018If only I had done (such and such), the such and such would have happened,\u2019 rather say: \u2018Allaah has decreed and what He wills He does,\u2019 for \u2018if only\u2019 opens the door to the work of the shaytaan.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (2664).\u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth includes several important principles of faith, including the following:\u00a0\nThat a person\u2019s happiness lies in his seeking that which will benefit him in this life and in the Hereafter, and this striving means expending effort and doing one\u2019s utmost. Because a man\u2019s striving and action can only be with the help of Allaah and by His will and support, He commanded him to seek His help, so that he will be acting in accordance with the meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cYou (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)\u201d [al-Faatihah 1:5]. His striving for that which will benefit him is an act of worship to Allaah, which cannot be done except with His help, so He commanded him to worship Him and seek His help.\u00a0\nThen he said: \u201cand do not feel helpless\u201d, because feeling helpless is contrary to striving for that which will benefit him, and it is contrary to seeking the help of Allaah. The one who strives for that which will benefit him and seeks the help of Allaah is the opposite of the one who feels helpless, so this is telling him, before what has been decreed happens, of that which is one of the greatest means of attaining it, which is striving for it whilst seeking the help of the One in Whose hand is control of all things, from Whom they come and to Whom they will return. If he does not attain what was not decreed for him, then he may feel either of two things: helplessness, which opens the door to the work of the shaytaan, so his sense of helplessness leads him to say \u201cif only\u201d, but there is nothing good in saying \u201cif only\u201d in this case, rather that opens the door to blame, panic, discontentment, regret and grief, all of which are the work of the shaytaan, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us to open the door to his works in this manner, and told us to adopt the second option, which is looking at the divine decree and bearing it in mind, for if it was decreed for him it would never have missed him and no one could have prevented him from attaining it. Hence he said: \u201cIf anything befalls you, do not say \u2018If only I had done (such and such), the such and such would have happened,\u2019 rather say: \u2018Allaah has decreed and what He wills He does,\u2019\u201d and he taught him that which will benefit him in either case, whether he gets what he wanted or not. Hence this hadeeth is one which a person can never do without.\u00a0\nShifa\u2019 al-\u2018Aleel (37-38).\u00a0\nWith this thinking one can overcome every obstacle and every failure, and there is nothing that he cannot achieve; there will be no limit to his hopes and no end to his ambition and resolve. \u00a0\nRather he will realize that failure is a sign of someone who is striving, because the one who strives is the one who may fail, but the one who does nothing and is lazy will neither fail nor succeed. Effort must inevitably lead to success one day, even if it is a long way off. So he should take failure as a step towards success, learning from it the causes of shortcomings, and trying to overcome them and set them straight, so that he becomes stronger than he was before, until he attains the success for which he is striving.\u00a0\nThe door of repentance which Allaah, may He be exalted, has opened to those who make mistakes and fail is another incentive to overcome failures and attain success, especially if the one who falls short learns from his experience. One of the salaf said: A sin that generates humility and regret is better than an act of obedience that generates self-admiration and arrogance.\u00a0\nFinally, with all these motives for attaining success and overcoming failure, there remains no excuse for being inactive or lazy. The way is easy and all it requires of you is some determination, will power and wisdom.\u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAll of my ummah will enter Paradise except those who refuse.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7280).\u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 22704.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "What are the limits within which parents may interfere in their son\u2019s marriage? Is he sinning if he goes against their wishes?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nWe hope that you will pay attention to the things you have done that go against sharee\u2019ah, such as getting to know that girl who is a stranger (non-mahram) to you, talking to her, making friends with her and other shortcomings to which you have admitted. You should understand that these sins mean that you must give them up, regret doing them and resolve not to do them again, as well as praying a great deal for forgiveness and doing righteous deeds.\u00a0\nWith regard to your relationship with this girl, it is not permissible for you to talk to her or see her, let alone make friends with her and be alone with her. It is good that you and she have thought of marriage, because it is the only legitimate shar\u2019i way that you can be together, so do your best to attain that; but if that is not possible for you, then this relationship should be ended completely and perhaps Allaah will compensate you with someone better than her and will compensate her with someone better than you.\u00a0\nWe have discussed the issue of correspondence between the sexes being haraam in the answer to question no. 26890 and 10221.\u00a0\nWith regard to haraam infatuation and its effects, and marriage to the one with whom one is infatuated, please see the answer to question no. 47405.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWith regard to your family\u2019s objections to this marriage, you should note that the parents\u2019 relationship to their son\u2019s marriage may take several forms, such as the following;\u00a0\n1-\nNot approving of any girl whom he chooses for himself as a wife.\u00a0\n2-\nNot approving of a girl whom he chooses, but their objection is for legitimate shar\u2019i reasons, such as if she has a bad reputation, or she is not Muslim \u2013 even though marriage to a Christian or Jewish woman is basically permissible.\u00a0\n3-\nNot approving of a girl whom he chooses, but it is not for any legitimate shar\u2019i reason, rather it is for personal or worldly reasons, such as if she is not beautiful or is not from a good family, and he is not infatuated with her and he does not fear any harm to himself if he does not marry her.\u00a0\n4-\nThe same scenario as that mentioned above, but he is infatuated with her, and fears fitnah for himself if he does not marry her.\u00a0\n5-\nForcing him to marry a girl whom they choose for him, even if she is religiously committed and of good character.\u00a0\nIt seems to us from the rulings on the scenarios mentioned above that the son should obey his parents in the second and third cases, and that it is definitely obligatory for him to do so in the second case. In the second case the matter is clear and he has to obey them, because he is going to do something that is bad for their son and may also affect them.\u00a0\nIn the third case it is permissible for him, but obeying them is obligatory, and what is obligatory takes precedence over what is permissible.\u00a0\nAs for the first, fourth and fifth scenarios, it does not seem that he is obliged to obey them, because choosing a wife is the son\u2019s right, not the parents\u2019; they may intervene in some cases but not in all. Preventing him from marrying any girl he chooses, regardless of whether she is religiously-committed or not, is pointless and he does not have to obey them.\u00a0\nThe same applies if he is infatuated with a woman and fears fitnah if he does not marry her. In this case he does not have to obey them if they tell him to leave her and not marry her, because that may lead to evil and fitnah that Islam came to prevent.\u00a0\nIt is definite that he should not obey them in the fifth case, which is where they force him to marry a girl whom they have chosen. This is not a matter in which he is obliged to obey them. Rather it is akin to food and drink: he may choose whatever he wants to eat and drink, and they have no right to control that.\u00a0\nIbn Muflih al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe parents have no right to force their son to marry someone he does not want. Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen (i.e., Ibn Taymiyah \u2013 may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Neither of the parents has the right to force their son to marry someone whom he does not want, and if he refuses then he is not sinning by disobeying them, because no one has the right to force him to eat food he finds off-putting when there is food that he wants to eat, and marriage is like that and more so. Food that one is forced to eat is unpleasant for a short while, but a forced marriage lasts for a long time, and it harms a person and he cannot leave it. End quote.\u00a0\nAl-Adaab al-Shar\u2019iyyah (1/447)\u00a0\nBased on this, we say:\u00a0\nIf that girl has embraced Islam and become a good Muslim, and you are infatuated with her, and you fear fitnah if you leave her, then we think that you should marry her, even if your mother does not agree. That applies even more so if you fear that her religious commitment may be affected if she has no one to look after her.\u00a0\nWe advise you to try to convince your parents so that you can combine two good things: obeying them and marrying the one with whom you are infatuated. You can get married without your mother\u2019s knowledge, and try to guide her and advise her, and say du\u2019aa\u2019 for her and for your father.\u00a0\nYou should remember that because it is permissible for you to marry whomever you want and you do not have to obey your parents (in this matter), you should not fear their du\u2019aa\u2019 against you or their being angry with you, because that is a sinful du\u2019aa\u2019 which Allaah will not accept from them, in sha Allaah, unless you are wronging them and transgressing against them. Because it is permissible for you to marry without adhering to their wishes, you will not be sinning or doing wrong.\u00a0\nSee the answers to questions no. 82724 and 84052.\u00a0\nSee also 21831 and 5512.\u00a0\nIn those answers you will see more examples of that which we have discussed above.\u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 5053 for a discussion on the rights that your mother has over you, and your rights over your mother.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nYou should remember that it is not permissible for you to marry this girl without her having a wali (guardian). If she has a wali from among her family who is Muslim, then he must agree to the marriage \u2013 but a kaafir cannot be her guardian if she becomes Muslim. If there is no Muslim among her guardians then a Muslim should act as her wali, such as a shar\u2019i judge (qaadi) or Mufti, or the imam of an Islamic centre. Whatever the case, it is not permissible for her to get married without a wali.\u00a0\nSee also question no. 7989\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Her son apostatised from Islam and refuses to come back to the faith",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe offer our condolences to this mother, and we ask Allah, may He be exalted, to guide her and her son, and to inspire him to follow the right path.\nSecondly:\nThis poor mother has nothing to do with whether her son is guided or goes astray, and none of his sin is on her. Each individual is responsible for his own deeds and will be brought to account for them.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cWhoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul. And whoever errs only errs against it. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another\u201d\n[al-Israa\u2019 17:15]\n\u201cAnd no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And if a heavily laden soul calls [another] to [carry some of] its load, nothing of it will be carried, even if he should be a close relative\u201d\n[Faatir 35:18].\nShaykh as-Sa\u2018di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cAnd no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another\u201d i.e., on the Day of Resurrection, each person will be requited for his deeds, and no person will carry the sins of another. \u201cAnd if a heavily laden soul calls [another]\u201d i.e., if a person who is heavily laden with sins and transgressions calls upon someone else to carry some of his burden, \u201cnothing of it will be carried, even if he should be a close relative\u201d; he will not be able to carry some of the burden of his relative. The hereafter is not like this world, in which a person can help his close friend; rather on the Day of Resurrection, a person will wish that he had some rights over other people, even over his parents and relatives.\nEnd quote from Tafseer as-Sa\u2018di (p. 687).\nIt was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2159), who classed it as saheeh, from \u2018Amr ibn al-Ahwas, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say to the people during the Farewell Pilgrimage: \u201cNo one commits a sin but he does so to his own detriment, and no sinner commits a sin to the detriment of his child, or any child to the detriment of his parent.\u201d\nAlso classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan at-Tirmidhi.\nAbu Dawood (4495) narrated that Abu Rimthah said: I went to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with my father, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to my father: \u201cIs this your son?\u201d He said: Yes, by the Lord of the Ka\u2019bah. He said: \u201cIs it true?\u201d He said: I bear witness to it. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) smiled at my resemblance to my father and my father\u2019s oath concerning me, then he said: \u201cHe does not commit any sin to your detriment and you do not commit any sin to his detriment.\u201d And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recited the verse: \u201cand no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another\u201d [al-An\u2018aam 6:164].\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood.\nAl-Qaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Mirqaat al-Mafaateeh (6/2272):\n\u201cHe does not commit any sin to your detriment\u201d means: you will not be brought to account for his sin, and \u201cand you do not commit any sin to his detriment\u201d means: he will not be brought to account for your sin. End quote.\nSo there is no blame on this mother for her son\u2019s sin, but she must continue to advise him and exhort him, and she should show him that she dislikes the path that he is on. If her cutting off ties with him will have an impact on him and bring him back to his senses, then she should cut off ties with him, out of mercy and compassion towards him.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "She weeps constantly because her mother has died",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The calamity of death is a calamity that no one can escape, and it is a test for us so that we may do righteous deeds and thus attain reward and the good pleasure of Allah. Grief and weeping at the loss of a relative is something permissible, if it is within normal bounds and is not accompanied by wailing or discontent. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wept at the death of his son Ibraaheem, and he said: \u201cThe eye weeps and the heart grieves, but we do not say anything but that which pleases our Lord, and indeed we are saddened by your departure, O Ibraaheem.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1220) and Muslim (4279).\nCalamities in this world expiate sins. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cNo hardship, pain, worry, grief, harm or distress befalls a believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allah will expiate some of his sins thereby.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5210) and Muslim (4670).\nBut this weeping and grief should be moderate, so that they do not affect a person\u2019s interests in this world or in the hereafter, or distract him from his work and duties, and his worship of Allah. Rather he should be patient and seek reward with Allah, so that he may attain the reward of those who are patient, and so that Allah will expiate his bad deeds and raise him in status.\nOur advice to your friend is that she should distract herself from the calamity that has befallen her by doing some worthwhile deeds, such as seeking knowledge, reading, reciting Qur\u2019an, or permissible leisure pursuits. She should seek refuge with Allah from worry and grief, and avoid being alone, for that is something that may give the Shaytaan power over her.\nShe should understand that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade women to mourn the deceased for more than three days, except in the case of a husband. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIt is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days for anyone who dies, except for a husband; she should mourn him for four months and ten days.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1280) and Muslim (1486).\nSo it is not permissible for a woman to continue to grieve, avoiding adornment, because of the death of anyone for more than three days, except in the case of her husband, in which case she should continue to avoid adornment for the entire duration of the \u2018iddah.\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to grant her patience and help her to be obedient to Him.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Her husband has changed completely and treats her differently, and he commits haraam deeds; what should she do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nMarital problems are very common. If the problems stem from the husband, then the wise woman must look for the reasons why her husband\u2019s behaviour towards her has changed, and the reasons why he is causing trouble for her. She may not be listening to him and being stubborn in her dealings with him, or she may be falling short in obeying him, or she may be neglectful regarding the house and raising her children, and so on. It cannot be imagined that a couple would have a happy married life, then things turn upside down suddenly and the husband begins to hate his wife and like to stay out at night, smoking shisha and so on, unless there are reasons that push the husband to do such things, although we know that in many instances the wife has nothing to do with that \u2013 rather it is a kind of upheaval that a man goes through after having been steadfast; we ask Allah to keep us steadfast and guide us \u2013 or it could be because of bad company, until his friends lead him astray from the straight path of his Lord and distract him from taking care of his best interests in this world and the hereafter, as appears to be the case here.\nIf it becomes clear to the wife that she has nothing to do with the changes in her husband, then this is a test for her from Allah, so she must choose between bearing with patience what her husband is doing, whilst continuing to advise him and pray for him, or seeking divorce, if she cannot put up with his mistreatment, or if she fears for herself or her religious commitment or her children if she stays with him, or if his sin reaches the level of disbelief, Allah forbid.\nSecondly:\nThe wife must do her utmost to advise her husband and remind him, in the way that is best. She should not speak harshly to him or frown at him; rather she should speak gently to him and treat him kindly. She should also speak to her family so that they can find a good person who is close to him and can advise him, remind him and point him in the right direction. At the same time, she should be keen to offer supplication when prostrating and at the end of the night, asking her Lord to guide him.\nShaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said:\nIt is not permissible for the husband to mistreat his wife, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cTreat them [women] with kindness\u201d [an-Nisaa\u2019 4:19]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cYour wife has rights over you.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari from the hadith of \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018Aas. If he mistreats her, then she should respond with patience and do her duty towards him, so that she will have the reward for that, and in the hope that Allah may guide him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend\u201d [Fussilat 41:34].\nAl-Muntaqa min Fataawa ash-Shaykh al-Fawzaan (4/177).\nAlthough there may be some sins that he is committing, and his wife may be able to put up with that, his forsaking prayer does not come under that heading, because forsaking prayer constitutes disbelief (kufr) and apostasy, so she should not allow him to be intimate with her unless he starts to pray again.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nThere is a woman who is married to a man who commits some sins, including major sins, such as taking drugs and the like, and she is suffering because of this man. She is a righteous and believing woman \u2013 we think she is like that, but Allah knows best. What should this woman do, given that she has tried to advise and guide him to give up this haraam deed and to turn back to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, but to no avail? What do you think? Should she go to her family or should she continue to put up with it in the hope that Allah might guide him? He also prevents his children from praying.\nAnswer: This man who does haraam deeds \u2013 does he pray or not?\nQuestioner: He prays but is not very serious about it. Sometimes he prays at home, sometimes he prays at work, and sometimes he delays the prayer.\nAnswer: I think that if she has tried to advise him without success, then she has the right to seek an annulment of the marriage, but in a situation like that there may be other issues that make it not possible to ask for annulment, because she has children and annulment of the marriage may lead to further troubles. So if his sin does not reach the level of disbelief (kufr), there is no blame on her if she stays with him, for fear of further problems. But if his sin does reach the level of disbelief, such as if he does not pray at all, then she should not stay with him a minute longer.\nLiqaa\u2019aat al-Baab al-Maftooh (13/question no. 18).\nThirdly:\nHusbands should fear Allah, may He be exalted, with regard to their wives, and they should realise that Allah, may He be exalted, has commanded them to treat their wives with kindness and has instructed them to keep them in an acceptable manner. He has told them that a man may dislike his wife, yet Allah has instilled much good in her. Likewise, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that if the husband dislikes one characteristic in his wife, he may be pleased with what she has of other, good characteristics.\n\u00a0Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cTreat them with kindness even if you dislike them; it is quite possible that you dislike something in which Allah has placed much good\u201d [an-Nisaa\u2019 4:19].\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cNo believing man should hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her characteristics, he may be pleased with another.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (1469).\nThese husbands should realise that their example is the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he was the best husband to his wives.\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words \u201cTreat them [women] with kindness\u201d [an-Nisaa\u2019 4:19] mean: speak nicely to them, treat them kindly, make yourself look good for them as much as you can, just as you would like them to do for you. So treat (your wife) as you would like to be treated. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:228]. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe best of you are those who are best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives.\u201d Narrated and classed as saheeh by at-Tirmidhi (3892). It was in his character (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to be kind to people; he was always cheerful; he would joke with his wives, treat them kindly, spend generously on them and laugh with them. He even raced with \u2018Aa\u2019ishah the Mother of the Believers, as an act of kindness and affection towards her. She said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) raced with me and I beat him, but that was before I put on weight. Then when I had put on weight, I raced with him again and he beat me, and said: \u201cThis is in return for that.\u201d Narrated by Abu Daawood (2578); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Daawood. His wives would gather every night in the house of the one with whom the Messenger of Allah (sa) (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was going to spend that night, and sometimes he would eat supper with them, then each of them would go back to her own house. He used to sleep with his wife under one blanket, taking off his upper garment and sleeping in his lower garment. When he had prayed \u2018Ishaa\u2019, he would stay up for a while with his wives, before going to sleep, thus comforting them and putting them at ease. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThere has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern (example)\u201d [al-Ahzaab 33:21].\nTafseer Ibn Katheer (2/242)\nPerhaps a large part of the remedy is trying to keep him away from the bad friends who have distracted him from his home, his family and his religion. If you can seek help with that from righteous people in his family, so that he will have no need of the bad friends who caused him to change, then that is good.\nYou must also seek the help of Allah, so that your husband will find compensation for those bad companions in the comfort, love and mercy that you create at home, in the hope that Allah will grant you and your husband relief and a way out from this test.\nWe ask Allah to guide your husband and enable him to seek His pleasure, and to bring about reconciliation between you.\nSee also the answers to questions no. 45600 and 9463.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength."

        "question": "A young man is faced with desires when awake and has wet dreams about his sister!",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nBy the grace of Allah, may He be exalted, towards you, He has enabled you at this age to worship Him and obey Him. By His grace towards you, He has blessed you with the ability to rebuke yourself when you fall short in obeying Him, and when you do something that it is not appropriate for you to do. These blessings from the Lord, may He be exalted, require you to give thanks in your heart, in your words and in your deeds, especially when you see young people around you of a similar age who go with the flow of lust and are drowning in a sea of misguidance and deviation.\nSecondly:\nYou must understand that wet dreams happen to both women and men, single people and married people. They may happen to one who recites adhkaar before sleeping and to one who does not do that. There is no sin on a person for what he sees in his dreams, because he does not have any control over it or any ability to ward it off. The Muslim is not accountable for such things, just as he will not be rewarded for what he does in his dreams of acts of obedience and worship. There is a saheeh hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which states that the Pen of accountability is lifted from \u201cthe sleeper until he wakes up.\u201d\nSo you should not feel anxious about what you see in your dreams. What you should worry about and be concerned about is what you do when you are awake, and this is what you suggested as a remedy for the problem of having wet dreams about your sister. Both of your suggestions are haraam and it is not permissible for you to do them. It is not permissible to look at pictures of actresses, singers and other attractive girls. For information on the prohibition on doing that, please see the answer to question no. 1774. Similarly, it is not permissible to engage in the secret habit (masturbation). For information on the prohibition on doing that, please see the answer to question no. 329. In addition to both actions being haraam, they will never avail you anything, and they will never prevent you from having wet dreams. We mentioned above that wet dreams happen even to married people and those who fulfil their desires in permissible ways.\nYou should understand that looking at your sister with desire is emphatically forbidden. In addition to being forbidden, it also has a strong connection to what you see in your dreams. It is well-known that some of what is seen in dreams is the outcome of the thoughts that the person thinks when he is awake. This means that looking at your sister \u2013 or any other woman \u2013 in haraam ways and thinking about sex before going to sleep may lead to seeing that in your dream. Hence the advice of the scholars to one who is faced with this problem is to purify himself [do wudoo\u2019] before sleeping, recite Aayat al-Kursiy, and stop thinking about sex and desire. If, after that, he sees something in his dream that he dislikes, he should not blame himself if no heedlessness occurred whilst he was awake. So pay attention to this, and bear it in mind.\nAmong the things stated by those who specialise in dream interpretation is that wet dreams like those that you see come from the Shaytaan, in order to make it easier for you to commit shameful deeds whilst awake. This is a serious matter to which you should pay attention, for the Shaytaan may also toy with the other party, and show her something similar to what you see in your dreams, for the same purpose. This is completely in accordance with those who say that the Shaytaan has something to do with wet dreams, and there is a great difference between the one who sees himself in his dream committing shameful deeds with his sister,\u00a0 although he is chaste and decent in his dealings with her when he is awake, and the one who sees such dreams, and looks at her with desire when he is awake. The former is the one who is fearful and anxious about his dreams, and he is unlikely to do such a thing in reality, in contrast to the one who is tempted when he is awake, so the Shaytaan does not leave him alone when he is asleep, just as he did not leave him alone when he was awake.\nThirdly:\nSome specialist doctors have stated that a person may do something when he is awake that will cause him to have a wet dream when he goes to sleep, although it should be noted that there is a difference of opinion among scholars concerning the cause of this phenomenon. That includes looking at women in unlawful ways, thinking about sex and desire, not urinating before going to sleep, and filling the stomach with food. We hope that you will avoid all of these things, and go to sleep in a state of purity and after reciting dhikr, so that you can rid yourself of these dreams which are causing you anxiety.\nFourthly:\nThe ultimate solution to your problem is to get married. If you are not able to do that, then you should fast, because fasting purifies the soul and leads to taqwa (mindfulness of Allah), which will help to prevent you from doing haraam things. Both of these are the recommendation of your Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to young people like you.\nIt was narrated that \u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018ood said: We were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and we could not afford to get married. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to us: \u201cO young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one\u2019s chastity. And whoever cannot afford it should fast, for it will be a shield for him.\u201d\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (4779) and Muslim (1400).\nSee the answer to question no. 9208, where we explained that wet dreams are something natural for which a person is not to be blamed. You can also refer to question no. 20229, which discusses means that will help you to lower your gaze; and question no. 20161, which discusses the solution to the problem of desire and how to control it. In the answer to question no. 39768, we discussed the health implications of the secret habit for the body, mind, face and memory, and we discuss ways of giving up this habit and avoiding falling into it.\nFifthly:\nIf you are suffering from this problem, and the Shaytaan is filling your mind with such thoughts about your sister, then you should take precautions to protect yourself. So you should avoid looking at her or being alone with her, for she is your sister. Tell her not to be careless in the way she dresses in front of you, for mahrams are not all the same when it comes to the ruling on showing adornment in front of them. A woman may show all of her adornment to her husband, but when it comes to other mahrams, such as her father, brother and the like, she should not show in front of them anything but that which ordinarily appears of her, such as the forearm, neck and so on. This is a basic ruling, regardless of problems that may arise, such as your problem.\nBut when a problem does arise, such as the problem that you are talking about, then precautions should be more stringent and covering should be more complete. But you should not draw her attention to anything that is crossing your mind. Rather you should try to guide her to do that through your parents, if possible, without giving any indication of what is going on in your mind or of what you see in your dreams.\nThe great scholar Ibn al-Qattaan (may Allah have mercy on him) said in an-Nazr fi Ahkaam an-Nazr (312):\nQuestion: He may only see of her \u2013 meaning his mahram \u2013 her face, hands and feet, whether she is young or old. That is permissible, with no difference of scholarly opinion, because it is something that ordinarily appears (when at home), unless he looks at those parts of his mahram with desire. There is no doubt that this is haraam, and I think that there is no difference of scholarly opinion concerning that. Ibn \u2018Abd al-Barr stated that it is prohibited, and he did not narrate any different view concerning it.\nEnd quote.\nAbu Bakr al-Hasani ash-Shaafa\u2018i (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Kifaayat al-Akhyaar (1/460:\nIt is haraam to look at mahrams with desire, and there is no scholarly difference of opinion concerning that.

        "question": "She wants to imagine married life in the future",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islam does not forbid the Muslim to let his thoughts wander and imagine permissible things, because this is human nature. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has created in them a wonderful world of imagination, images and talk that may cross their minds, and a person may not be able to ward them off completely, but he does have the power to control them and guard against those that are harmful.\nIt is well-known that some of these thoughts that a person may find himself immersed in may turn to some kind of illusion, and lead to mental exhaustion and an inability to focus. Oftentimes that results in a real-life situation filled with frustration and despair, or leads to bad conduct as a result of repeated thoughts, and the individual would not have found himself in that situation if he had restrained his thoughts and prevented them from wandering into that wilderness.\nWe think that the thoughts that could lead to success are realistic thoughts, in which one plans for a better future, within the framework of what is possible, not what is impossible, and strives to work out practical steps that may lead to success in one\u2019s family life, academic life and social life, through beneficial reading, righteous deeds, and good conduct. If there is no opportunity to achieve such goals, then patience and contentment are two guiding principles that should always be in the mind of the believer.\nThis is the difference between harmful, bad thoughts and beneficial, realistic thoughts. Young men and women in particular should pay attention to this, and beware of following in the footsteps of the Shaytaan who, by means of thoughts and imagination, opens the door to evil and sin. Sin begins with a thought and ends with regret. If what is meant by imagining emotional life is imagining having intercourse with a particular young man in the hope that he will be one\u2019s husband in the future, this comes under the heading of corrupt thoughts and imagination which bring no benefit and result in nothing but pain, regret and thinking of sin. This has been discussed in detail previously on our website, in the answer to question no. 84066.\nAbu Haamid al-Ghazaali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt should be understood that the likeness of the heart is that of a target that is struck by arrows from all sides.\nOr it is like a mirror in front of which different things pass constantly, and image after image is reflected in it; there is always something reflected in it.\nOr it is like a cistern into which water flows from various channels that lead to it.\nThese constantly-renewed impacts on the heart either come from the outside, through the five senses, or they come from within, through imagination, desire, anger, and attitudes that are instilled in man\u2019s nature. \u2026 As one\u2019s thoughts move from one thing to another, the condition of the heart moves from one state to another.\nThe point is that the heart is always changing and is constantly affected by these causes. The greatest impact on the heart comes from thoughts. Moreover, thoughts lead to desires, and desires lead to resolve, and resolve leads to intention (niyyah), and intention leads to physical action.\nThoughts that lead to desires may be divided into those that motivate one to do evil, and those that motivate one to do good. These are two different types of thoughts. The good thoughts are called inspiration, and the bad thoughts are called waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan).\nEnd quote from  Ihyaa\u2019 \u2018Uloom as-Deen (3/26).\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Grave disagreement and arguments between the spouses; should we advise them to get divorced?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nFamilies are not without problems, some of which are easy to resolve and some of which are difficult. One who wants to solve his own problems or the problems of someone else must understand the causes that led to those differences and conflict and resentment, whether it is between spouses, between friends, or between father and son, or any parties to a conflict.\nWe do not know the cause of the differences between you and your wife, so we can only offer general advice that may be suitable for you and for others.\nYou should look for the cause of those differences between you and your wife. You may be the main cause, or a large part of the cause, because of something in your nature that you cannot change, or because of poor treatment on your part of your wife, or because you pay little attention to her and your children, or for any other out of many possible reasons. So you must correct your mistakes, and put an end to those differences by putting an end to their causes, if the problem is on your side. You cannot be unaware that kind treatment of your wife, showing her compassion, praising her for what she does, and taking good care of the children, whilst striving to bring what the household needs, will all make a wife pleased with her husband, which will create love between the spouses and spread compassion in the household.\nBut if the causes of the problems and differences between you stem from the wife, then you must also deal with this matter with wisdom and kindly exhortation. The easiest thing for the husband \u2013 in principle and in most cases \u2013 is to win his wife over and make her love what she hates, and hate what she loves, because when a wife is pleased with a man as her husband, she will be content to live according to his wishes and interests, and she does not necessarily have to love that and be pleased with it. This is the nature of wives in general; hence a woman follows her husband. Therefore it is prohibited for a Muslim woman to marry a disbeliever. This is also the reason why it is advised to make a good choice of husband, and to choose one who is of good character and religiously committed, lest the woman be negatively affected by his lack of religious commitment and character.\nSecondly:\nIt may be that a husband is not compatible with his wife, so he will not be able to improve the way he deals with her, and she will not be able to fulfil the permissible desires of her husband. In that case it is better for them to separate, because their staying together will be a waste of time and will cause a great deal of problems and distress.\nBased on what is mentioned in the question, we say: if the husband does not think that his wife is not willing to change her attitude towards him, and he is not the cause of these problems, then he has no choice but to divorce her, taking the last option for remedying the situation. It is not required that the wife should accept this as a solution, because her approval is not a factor in the case of divorce. We are only saying that the solution for these problems is divorce for several reasons, based on your question:\n\nIt is not possible that your wife will change her attitude and manners, because the problems between you have been going on for a long time.\nYou are not able to take another wife, because of your environment.\nThe fear that you may fall into haraam because she does not fulfil your sexual desires.\n\nSo give her one last chance, and set a deadline for her to change her attitude. then if there is no change on her part, do not hesitate to issue a divorce, and beware of falling into haraam, for according to the laws of Allah you are muhsan (married or previously-married), and the hadd punishment is stoning if you fall into haraam \u2013 Allah forbid. There are many warnings in Islam for the one who transgresses the sacred rights of others and the one who commits the shameful deeds that Allah has forbidden, so be very, very careful.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength."

        "question": "How can he complete what he starts?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The problem cannot be solved through advice and preaching; rather what you are suffering from is a behavioural problem, which requires a practical solution and remedy, and mere words of exhortation and verbal advice will not be sufficient.\nThe first thing you should do to overcome this shortcoming is clearly to persist until you complete the deed. Probably the first successful experience will motivate you to keep going until you complete all your deeds and do them perfectly. What will help you to achieve that is two things:\n1. Dividing the deed into small steps, so that you will feel more motivated to complete each stage on its own, and keep going until you reach the last stage and complete it. That is because human nature finds large, lengthy tasks burdensome. So there is no alternative but to break the task down into stages until you achieve it.\n2. Choosing short and quick tasks and beginning with them, so that you will be able to complete them. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cO people, you should only do deeds that you are able for, for Allah does not grow weary but you do. The most beloved of deeds to Allah is that which is done persistently, even if it is little.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5861) and Muslim (782). And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe most beloved of actions to Allah are those which are done persistently, even if they are little.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5861) and Muslim (783).\u00a0\nImam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In other words, that which you will be able to do regularly without it causing you any harm. This indicates that it is encouraged to be moderate in doing acts of worship and to avoid taking on too much. The hadith is not speaking only of prayer; rather it is general in meaning and applies to all righteous deeds. End quote.\nSharh an-Nawawi \u2018ala Muslim (6/70-71).\nWe advise you to read some books and psychological studies, which you can benefit from regarding this matter. Such books include: al-Futoor, Asbaabuhu wa \u2018Ilaajuhu by Shaykh Dr. Naasir al-\u2018Umar, and \u2018Ajz ath-Thiqaat by Shaykh Dr. Muhammad Moosa ash-Shareef.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "How to form friendships",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly:\n\n\tForming \n\tfriendships, in the light of what you have mentioned of your love for people \n\tand your kindness and politeness towards them, should be easy, in sha Allah.\n\n\tThat is because \n\tthe basic foundation for success in social relationships is love for people, \n\tand being kind and polite towards them.\n\n\tAfter that, all \n\tyou have to do is take some effective practical steps to establish and build \n\tfriendships and strengthen bonds, such as trying to take part in some \n\tcollective activities, the most important of which is praying in \n\tcongregation in the mosque in your university, if possible, or joining some \n\twomen\u2019s activities in your college.\n\n\tYou can also try \n\tto join various student clubs \u2013 that are for females only \u2013 which will give \n\tyou the opportunity to get to know people and make friends with other female \n\tstudents in your class.\n\n\tYou can also \n\testablish contact with other female students with whom you share common \n\tinterests, such as sharing a love of reading, exchanging useful books with \n\tone another and encouraging one another to do good deeds, such as reading \n\tQur\u2019an, praying regularly, attending study circles, helping the needy among \n\tyour fellow students and neighbours, and other activities that are of \n\tbenefit in both religious and worldly terms.\n\n\tAnother \n\tbeneficial means of establishing friendships is helping students who have \n\tdifficulties in understanding some subjects and topics, by providing them \n\twith notes and trying to explain the material to them and make it easy for \n\tthem.\n\n\tSecondly:\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tyour infatuation with that young man, what appears to be the case is that \n\tthis is the result of some hidden emotions that have manifested themselves \n\tin a wrong way, because of your ongoing anxiety at not being able to form \n\tfriendships, and your feeling that the students are ignoring you. \n\t\n\n\tWhatever the \n\tcase, what you must do in this situation, according to Islamic teachings, is \n\tto release this energy and these emotions in a manner that is pleasing to \n\tAllah and that will benefit you in this world and in the hereafter, such as \n\texpressing it in the form of love for Allah, may He be exalted, and striving \n\tto obey Him, and love for the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \n\tAllah be upon him) and following his Sunnah, forming friendships and sound \n\trelationships with others, doing charitable or humanitarian deeds, honouring \n\tyour parents, upholding ties of kinship, and showing kindness to neighbours.\n\n\tThere is nothing \n\twrong with devoting some of your energy to keeping pets or growing plants, \n\tor other appropriate, permissible deeds, in order to provide an outlet for \n\thidden emotions.\n\n\tYou must also \n\tclose every door that could enable you to follow this young man and become \n\tmore attached to him, because of what could result from that of sin, first \n\tof all, and also psychological and spiritual exhaustion.\n\n\tMoreover, this \n\tyoung man does not know you or love you or care about you, and following him \n\twill lead to nothing except a vicious circle of emotional and psychological \n\tpain, in addition to what you will accumulate of sin as a result of loving \n\tone whom Allah has commanded you to hate, let alone the corruption that this \n\tmay cause to your heart, soul and spirit as a result of getting used to \n\tfollowing this evil person and listening to his foul language and shameless \n\twords and deeds.\n\n\tMay Allah help \n\tus and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him, may He be \n\tglorified."

        "question": "A plea for help from a mother whose son was righteous then he became an atheist",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to \n\tincrease your reward and grant you the best reward for your efforts in \n\tcaring for your children and giving them an Islamic upbringing. From your \n\tletter, we sense that you have done what Allah, may He be exalted, enjoined \n\tupon you with regard to the trust with which He entrusted you.\n\n\tThe fact that your son has drifted away \n\tfrom obedience to his Lord, may He be exalted, and has chosen for himself \n\tthe path of deviation, misguidance and atheism, should not make you feel \n\tanxious or guilty, or feel that the way in which you brought up your \n\tchildren was the cause of that, as was suggested by this deviant son. Rather \n\tyou have done well and are in a good state, if Allah wills, and others who \n\tdid not make the effort you made are the ones who have fallen short with \n\tregard to themselves and with regard to their children. So do not pay any \n\tattention to the whispers of the Shaytaan and do not let what your son said \n\tbar you from continuing in your efforts to give your children a good Islamic \n\tupbringing and to remain committed and adhering to Islamic teachings.\n\n\tYou should realise that it is not your \n\tfault that your son got into this situation and you will not carry the \n\tburden of his sins, for you did not spare any effort in teaching him and \n\tguiding him to the path of Islam. One who is like you (and spared no effort) \n\tcannot be held responsible if some members of his family drift away from the \n\tright path (and will not incur any sin). Rather the one who will incur sin \n\tis the one who fell short or was negligent in taking care of his children.\n\n\tWe see what happened to the son and wife \n\tof Nooh (peace be upon him), and how they were doomed along with those who \n\twere doomed, despite the fact that Nooh (peace be upon him) never spared any \n\teffort in calling them and trying to guide them. But they did not respond to \n\thim, so Allah punished them and they were among those who drowned. Something \n\tsimilar may be said concerning the wife of Loot (peace be upon him) and the \n\tfather of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), and Abu Taalib, the uncle of the \n\tProphet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Each of these Prophets \n\tand Messengers did what Allah, may He be exalted, had enjoined him to do and \n\tfulfilled the trust in the most perfect manner. They did not fall short with \n\tregard to their families, but hearts are in the hand of Allah, may He be \n\texalted; He guides whom He wills and He leaves astray whom He wills, and He \n\tleaves no one astray astray except the evildoers. Allah, may He be exalted, \n\tsays (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t\u201cNot upon \n\tyou (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) is their guidance, \n\tbut Allah guides whom He wills\u201d\n\n\t[al-Baqarah 2:272]\n\n\t\u201cVerily! \n\tYou (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) guide not whom \n\tyou like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He knows best those who are \n\tthe guided\u201d\n\n\t[al-Qasas 28:56].\n\n\tShaykh \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa\u2018di (may Allah \n\thave mercy on him) said:\n\n\tHere Allah, may He be exalted, is saying: \n\tVerily you, O Muhammad \u2013 and others more so \u2013 cannot guide anyone, even \n\tthose who are the dearest of people to you. No one has the ability to guide \n\tanyone, that is, to make them accept guidance or to create faith in their \n\thearts. Rather that is in the hand of Allah alone, may He be glorified and \n\texalted: He guides whomever He wills, and He knows best who is deserving of \n\tguidance, so He guides him, and who is not deserving of that, so he leaves \n\thim to go astray.\n\n\tAs for the attribution of guidance to the \n\tMessenger in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says \n\t(interpretation of the meaning), \n\t\u201cAnd verily, you (O Muhammad \n\t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) are indeed guiding (mankind) to \n\tthe Straight Path (i.e. Allah\u2019s religion of Islamic Monotheism)\u201d \n\t[ash-Shoora 42:52], that \n\tis guidance in the sense of explaining and teaching. The Messenger shows the \n\tstraight path and encourages people to follow it, doing his utmost to see \n\tpeople follow the path. But as for creating faith in people\u2019s hearts and \n\tenabling them to act upon it, he has no ability to do that at all.\n\n\tTafseer as-Sa\u2018di \n\t(620).\n\n\tSee also the answer to question no.\n\t12053.\n\n\tBased on that, you have no option but to \n\tpray that he be guided. So turn to your Lord, may He be exalted, and offer a \n\tgreat deal of supplication (du\u2018aa\u2019) to Him before dawn and when prostrating, \n\tin the hope that Allah, may He be exalted, may answer your prayers.\n\n\tIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: \n\tThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n\t\u201cThere are three prayers that will undoubtedly be answered: the prayer of \n\tone who has been wronged; the prayer of the traveller; and the prayer of a \n\tfather concerning his child.\u201d\n\n\tNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (1905), Abu Dawood \n\t(1563), and Ibn Maajah (3862); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh \n\tat-Tirmidhi.\n\n\tAl-Azeemabaadi (may Allah have mercy on \n\thim) said:\n\n\t\u201cthe prayer of a father\u201d \u2013 i.e., for or \n\tagainst his child. The mother is not mentioned because her right is greater, \n\tso her prayer is more likely to be answered.\n\n\t\u2018Awn al-Ma\u2018bood, \n\t4/276.\n\n\tAn-Minnaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid:\n\n\t\u201cthe prayer of a father for his child\u201d \u2013 \n\tbecause he sincerely loves him and gives him precedence over himself. \n\tBecause he is so sincere towards his child, his supplication is more likely \n\tto be answered. The mother is not mentioned, despite the fact that she has \n\tmore right and is closer to her son, which means that her supplication is \n\tmore likely to be answered than that of the father, because that is \n\tself-evident.\n\n\tFayd al-Qadeer, \n\t3/301.\n\n\tShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen \n\t(may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\t\u201cthe prayer of a father\u201d \u2013 in some \n\tversions of the hadith it says \u201cagainst his child\u201d and in some version it is \n\tnot mentioned; in other words, the father\u2019s prayer may be for or against his \n\tchild. This is the more correct version; the father\u2019s prayer for or against \n\this child will be answered. As for his praying for him, he prays for him out \n\tof compassion and mercy, and whoever shows mercy to people, Allah, may He be \n\tglorified and exalted, will show mercy to him. As for praying against him, \n\the cannot pray against his son unless the son deserves that, and if he prays \n\tagainst him when he deserves it, then Allah will answer his prayer.\n\n\tThese are the three answered prayers: the \n\tprayer of one who has been wronged; the prayer of the traveller, and the \n\tprayer of the parent, whether that is the mother or the father.\n\n\tSharh Riyadh as-Saaliheen \n\t(3/157), Dar Ibn Haytham edition.\n\n\tWe have explained the conditions of \n\tsupplication so that it might be acceptable to Allah and be answered, in the \n\tanswer to question no. 13506.\n\n\tWe have explained the places and times \n\twhen supplications are answered in the answer to question no.\n\t22438.\n\n\tWith regard to your not helping him to get \n\tmarried, and not going with him to anyone, this is what you should do, even \n\tif he stays like that (i.e., single) until the end of his life. That is \n\tbecause people, as you say, will be deceived by what they know of your \n\treligious commitment, and will think that your son is like you \u2013 or at \n\tleast, if he is different or has drifted away, no one would ever imagine \n\tthat he has sunk to that level (i.e., atheism). You should carry on advising \n\thim and seek the help of someone who is specialised in such matters who \n\tcould sit with him, debate with him and answer his doubts. This may be more \n\teffective and beneficial than debating on websites.\n\n\tWe ask Allah to guide us and you to the \n\tstraight path, and to set straight for us the affairs of our spouses and \n\tchildren.\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "She is suffering because of problems in the relationship between her and her husband, and she wants advice",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tUndoubtedly a great deal of criticism and arguing in front of \n\tthe children is something negative that undermines harmony and love. \n\tOur advice to you and your husband is to reduce that as \n\tmuch as possible, and to show restraint; each of you should force himself to \n\tbe patient with the other and to delay issues of arguments and discussion \n\tuntil you are by yourselves.\n\n\tOur advice to the husband is not to think that any human \n\tbeing could be free of faults or shortcomings, because that is part of human \n\tnature, so how about the woman, whose basic nature the Prophet (blessings \n\tand peace of Allah be upon him) has told us about, and said that there is no \n\thope of changing her nature completely.\n\n\tIt was narrated from Samurah ibn Jundub that the Messenger of \n\tAllah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n\n\t\u201cWoman was created from a rib; if you try to straighten her \n\tyou will break her.

Being \n\tmore easy-going and diplomatic is something that is required from both \n\tparties. It is required from the husband, in the form of kindness, \n\toverlooking mistakes and showing compassion, and it is required from the \n\treligiously committed, smart and wise wife to put up with the annoyance \n\tof her husband, and not to be so harsh with him if he is harsh with her; \n\trather she should be easy-going, as much as she can, avoid provoking his \n\tanger and not be confrontational. She should be as gentle as she can, and be \n\tsoft with him.\n\n\tIt was narrated that \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abbaas said: The \n\tMessenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cShall I \n\tnot tell you about your wives among the people of Paradise: the one who is \n\tloving, fertile, and beneficial to her husband, who if she is upset or \n\tannoyed, she comes and takes her husband\u2019s hand, then she says: \u2018By Allah, I \n\tshall not sleep until you are pleased with me.\u201d\n\n\tNarrated by an-Nasaa\u2019i in as-Sunan al-Kubra (9094); \n\tclassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (287)\n\n\tWhat is well-established in psychology, and what is known \n\tfrom experience, is that stubbornness and arguing with a husband who is not \n\tpatient with lengthy discussions and arguments will only result in bad \n\tconsequences for the marriage and will increase resentment between the \n\tspouses.\n\n\tOur advice to our sister is to discuss less and go along with \n\thim, and to show a great deal of admiration for his thoughts and opinions in \n\tgeneral, even if you differ concerning some of the details. With this \n\tattitude you can reduce arguments, dispel resentment and make him more open \n\tto listening to your discussion and point of view. It would be a good idea \n\tfor you to go to a psychologist who specialises in couples counselling, \n\tbecause that can help to uncover the subtle causes of the problem between \n\tyou and deal with the matter in an effective manner.\n\n\tYou should realise that it is not a must for the husband to \n\tconsult his wife; rather he may consult someone whose opinion and experience \n\the trusts among his family and friends, or experts other than people whom he \n\tknows.\n\n\tThe most that can be said regarding the issue of a man \n\tconsulting his wife is that it is something that is encouraged and is good, \n\tand it comes under the heading of kind treatment and noble character. \n\tMoreover, people vary in their nature, attitude, way of thinking and \n\tbehaviour. So be wise, and do not take risks with regard to your family life \n\tand marriage. Forgive him some of his harshness and put up with some of his \n\tobstinacy, so long as it does not involve sin and no obvious harm will \n\tresult to you or your family. Put up with what you dislike, for in patiently \n\tbearing what one dislikes there is a great deal of good, as the most \n\ttruthful one (the Prophet \u2013 blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.\n\n\t\u00b7\n\t\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe mother\u2019s instinct, from a linguistic point of view the Arabic word for \n\tinstinct means nature. In terms of psychology, it refers to human behaviour \n\tthat is based on nature and heredity. Every person has instincts and \n\tinclinations that differ according to his inherent nature and hereditary \n\tfactors. Based on that, the mother\u2019s instinct is no more than maternal \n\tbehaviour that is based on her nature and genetic makeup. One of the most \n\twell-known manifestations of these natural instincts is the mother\u2019s \n\tinstinct to protect her child and ward off anything that may harm him.\n\n\tBut this instinct may become contaminated and malfunction \n\tbecause of unsound social influences and customs because of which the mother \n\tsees what is beneficial as harmful, so that facts are turned upside down in \n\ther mind and she becomes confused.\n\n\tTherefore the mother should not be regarded as reliable \n\tunless it is proven that she is mature and well balanced, and that she is \n\tnot influenced by unsound standards that are alien to sound human nature.\n\n\tThe same may be said concerning the father\u2019s instinct and \n\twhat may result from it.\n\n\t\u00b7\n\t\n\tFinally:\n\n\tYour husband should be kind to your mother and treat her \n\twell, even if she has a different point of view than him. That is because \n\tshe is like his own mother, and responding in a better way to bad treatment \n\thas a magical effect on people. Allah, may He be exalted, says \n\t(interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t\u201cRepel (the evil deed) with one \n\twhich is better (i.e. Allah ordered the faithful believers to be patient at \n\tthe time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly), then verily! \n\the, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a \n\tclose friend\u201d\n\n\t[Fussilat 41:35].\n\n\tIn addition to that, you should pay attention to the fact \n\tthat your husband does not like you to consult your mother, because your \n\tinsistance on consulting her and seeking her opinion, despite what you \n\tsay about the relationship between them not being good, makes matters \n\tworse. A man does not like even someone who agrees with him to interfere in \n\this decisions and leadership, so what you think about one who differs with \n\thim?!\n\n\tSo do not do what he resents and do not refrain from doing \n\twhat he likes. We give you the glad tidings that the Messenger of Allah \n\t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave: \u201cIf a woman offers her five \n\tdaily prayers, fasts her month (of Ramadan), guards her chastity and obeys \n\ther husband, she will enter through whichever of the gates of Paradise she \n\twants.\u201d\n\n\tNarrated by Ibn Hibbaan (4163); classed as hasan by al-Albaani\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Advice to someone who has a stammer and wants to seek knowledge and teach it to people",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to decree healing and reward \n\tfor you, healing from this problem with which Allah is testing you and \n\treward for attaining knowledge and for your intention to spread it among \n\tpeople.\u00a0\n\n\tThis stammer with which Allah is testing you is a problem \n\tthat requires patience in order to rid yourself of it, and training to teach \n\tthe tongue to pronounce words steadily and out loud, with confidence. But \n\tbefore all of that you should seek the help of Allah, may He be exalted. It \n\thas to do with your psychology and sometimes, in some people, it has to do \n\twith a physical problem. We advise you to consult specialists in speech \n\ttherapy and diseases of the jaw and tongue.\u00a0\n\n\tIn al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-\u2018Arabiyyah al-\u2018Aalamiyyah it says:\u00a0\n\n\tThere are a number of ways in which those who have a stammer \n\tcan attain perfect fluency. These ways include: reading out loud with \n\tothers, talking in supportive environments, or talking with friends. End \n\tquote.\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0Whatever the case:\u00a0\n\n\tYou should understand that you will be rewarded for attaining \n\tknowledge, and the difficulty that you suffer in attaining it will increase \n\tyou in reward.\u00a0\n\n\tIt was narrated that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah said: The Messenger of Allah \n\t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe one who is skilled in \n\treciting Qur\u2019an will be with the noble, obedient scribes and the one who \n\trecites Qur\u2019an and falters therein, and finds it difficult, will have a \n\tdouble reward.\u201d\n\n\tNarrated by Muslim (798)\u00a0\n\n\tImam al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n\tFaltering refers to stumbling and having difficulty in \n\tspeech. He will have a double reward, because of his recitation and because \n\tof the difficulty he encounters.\u00a0\n\n\tTafseer al-Qurtubi \n\t(1/30).\u00a0\n\n\tIf you want to benefit others with what you learn of \n\tknowledge, then you have two options:\u00a0\n\n\t1.\n\n\tYou can benefit people with your writings, in which case it \n\tis not essential that the one who seeks to benefit others should be able to \n\tpronounce the letters well. There are leading scholars of Islam from among \n\tthe early generations of whose knowledge nothing has reached us except their \n\tbooks; we have not heard a single letter from them. Some of the contemporary \n\tscholars and callers decided to refrain from addressing people directly \u2013 \n\twhich does not necessarily mean that they cannot express themselves well \u2013 \n\tand they focus their efforts on benefitting others by their pens and writing \n\tvery useful books. There is a great deal of room for writing in newspapers, \n\tmagazines, websites and other options.\u00a0\n\n\t2.\n\n\tYou can make your resolve firm and face reality head-on by \n\tmeeting people face-to-face and teaching them verbally. Some of the imams \n\tand other scholars also had a stammer, but when they ascended the minbar and \n\tspoke to people, they would speak fluently and with ease, and there would be \n\tno stumbling over even a single letter. One of these scholars was Shaykh \n\t\u2018Abd ar-Rahman ad-Dawsari (may Allah have mercy on him), and there are other \n\tfamous scholars. This was their situation; the stammer did not prevent them \n\tfrom being eloquent khateebs, and in some cases they combined that with \n\tbrilliant writing.\u00a0\n\n\tThere is another example, a virtuous sister who studied \n\tsharee\u2018ah until she obtained her PhD in that field. Read what she herself \n\tsays:\u00a0\n\n\tWhen I looked at my peers and colleagues in the department, I \n\tfound that some of them were able to brush off the dust of the Shaytaan \u2013 \n\tnamely blameworthy shyness when calling people to Allah \u2013 and why could I \n\tnot do that too? Why could I not instil in myself trust in Allah? So I \n\tdecided to begin straightaway in the prayer room of the university. My \n\tspecialisation in da\u2018wah had given me particular insight into the scheming \n\tof our enemies, and their ongoing war against Islam, so how long would we \n\thave to wait to respond? I thought about a way to treat my stammer, which \n\twas by not speaking quickly and \u2013 in the beginning \u2013 not looking at the \n\taudience; rather I would look around the room so that I would not feel \n\tnervous. Any letter that I could not pronounce easily, I would change it to \n\tanother letter that was easier for me.\u00a0\n\n\tBy the grace of Allah, I began to give lessons in the prayer \n\troom of the University, but without supervision from any of the female \n\tprofessors. Obviously, supervision of the female professors may give \n\tstrength and support to the one who wants to call people to Allah, and make \n\ther more precise and correct in what she is discussing and teaching, so that \n\tit will not be mere expressions of emotion.\u00a0\n\n\tEnd quote.\u00a0\n\n\tWe also give you the glad tidings that one of the people we \n\tknow who are active in seeking and spreading knowledge also has a stammer; \n\teven though he cannot rid himself of it, his classes and lectures have \n\tbenefitted many seekers of knowledge. Giving classes is different from \n\tpreaching, and it is possible to benefit seekers of knowledge and teach them \n\tmany books, even before ridding oneself of this problem. So go ahead with \n\tthat to which Allah has opened your heart of seeking beneficial knowledge, \n\tand remember that if you\u00a0 are sincere towards Allah, may He be exalted, in \n\tyour intention to seek and spread knowledge, then you will be rewarded \n\twhatever the case, whether you are able to actually spread knowledge and \n\tteach, or something prevents you from doing that.\u00a0\n\n\tWe ask Allah to make your affairs easy for you and to enable \n\tyou to do that which pleases Him.\u00a0\n\n\tFor information on the virtues of seeking knowledge and of \n\tthe scholars, please see the answer to question no. \n\t10471.\u00a0\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on one who says that the poverty of Muslims is because they have too many children",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tWe think that this opinion is wrong, because it is Allah, may \n\tHe be exalted, who grants abundant provision to whomever He wills or grants \n\tit in scant measure. The reason is not the large size of the population, \n\tbecause there is no creature on earth but its provision is granted by Allah, \n\tbut Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, gives and withholds on the basis \n\tof wisdom.\u00a0\n\n\tOur advice to the one who holds such views is that he should \n\tfear Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and give up this false belief. \n\tHe should understand that no matter how much the population of the world \n\tincreases, if Allah so willed, He could grant them all abundant provision, \n\tbut Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd if Allah \n\twere to enlarge the provision for His slaves, they would surely rebel in the \n\tearth, but He sends down by measure as He wills. Verily! He is in respect of \n\tHis slaves, the Well-Aware, the All-Seer (of things that benefit them)\u201d\n\n\t[ash-Shoora 42:27].\u00a0\n\n\tShaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him)\u00a0\n\n\tFataawa \u2018Ulama\u2019 al-Balad al-Haraam \n\t(p. 1084)\n\n\tUndoubtedly calling for restrictions or reductions on the \n\tnumbers of children one has is contrary to the command of the Prophet \n\t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: \u201cMarry women who are \n\tloving and fertile, for I shall be proud of your large numbers before other \n\tnations.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood (2050); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in\n\tIrwa\u2019 al-Ghaleel (1784)\n\n\tAllah, may He be exalted, has guaranteed provision for all \n\tcreatures, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd no \n\t(moving) living creature is there on earth but its provision is due from \n\tAllah\u201d\n\n\t[Hood 11:6].\n\n\tOpposing population increase, whether by imposing means of \n\tcontraception or abortion or otherwise, based on the belief that resources \n\tare not sufficient for an increased population, or that the interests of \n\thumanity dictate reduction in population growth, this is explicitly denying \n\tthe Lordship of Allah and His care for His creation, and the abundance of \n\tHis provision. It is akin to the beliefs of the polytheists, who used to \n\tkill their children for fear of poverty. Allah, may He be exalted, says \n\t(interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t\u201ckill not \n\tyour children because of poverty - We provide sustenance for you and for \n\tthem\u201d\n\n\t[al-An\u2018aam 6:151]\n\n\t\u201cAnd kill not \n\tyour children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely, \n\tthe killing of them is a great sin\u201d\n\n\t[al-Isra\u2019 17:31].\n\n\tThe large size of the ummah is one of the blessings of Allah, \n\tmay He be exalted, for which He deserves to be thanked and He alone deserves \n\tto be worshipped. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that His Prophet \n\tShu\u2018ayb (peace be upon him) reminded his people of some of the blessings \n\tthat Allah had bestowed upon them, as he said (interpretation of the \n\tmeaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd remember when you were but few, and He multiplied you\u201d\n\n\t[al-A\u2018raaf 7:86].\n\n\tThe large size of the ummah is one of the means of its \n\tstrength and victory over its enemies. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says \n\tconcerning the Children of Israel (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t\u201cThen We gave you once again, a return of victory over them. \n\tAnd We helped you with wealth and children and made you more numerous in man \n\tpower\u201d\n\n\t[al-Isra\u2019 17:7].\n\n\tAccording to a future study about Egypt, Dr Muhammad Sayyid \n\tGhallaab said:\n\n\tPopulation increase has never been a burden, and it is not \n\tright to regard it as such in the coming century, for it is what allowed \n\tEgypt to achieve progress in all eras.\n\n\tAccording to another study, Dr Mustafa al-Fiqqi indicates \n\tthat one of the most important factors that allowed Egypt to play an \n\tinfluential role in the Arab world is that it is regarded as the storehouse \n\tof human resources.\n\n\tProf Khurshid Ahmad, the expert economist, says: \n\t\n\n\tIn the future, prevalence and power can only be on the side \n\tof countries that enjoy an increase in population and at the same time are \n\tadvanced in various scientific fields. There is nothing that could enable \n\tthe Western nations to maintain their international dominance and leadership \n\tapart from trying to support the movement that promotes population control \n\tand contraception in Asia and Africa. For that reason, the Western countries \n\ttoday are striving their utmost to increase their own populations, but at \n\tthe same time they are resorting to the best media and propaganda methods \n\tthat they have in order to support the population control movement in Asian \n\tand African countries.\n\n\tHe also said:\n\n\tHow true are the words of Organski [an American thinker] who \n\tsaid: In the future, power will only be on the side of the camp that has the \n\tgreater number of people.\n\n\tHe also said:\n\n\tIt is obvious to the student of history that population size \n\tis of fundamental political significance. Therefore every civilisation or \n\tsuperpower has focused its efforts on increasing its population during the \n\tstages of its rise and development. Hence the well-known historian Prof. \n\tWill Durant regards having a large population is one of the most important \n\tmeans of civil progress. Prof Arnold Toynbee also regards increasing the \n\tpopulation size as one of the most important challenges to be met in order \n\tfor any human civilization to exist and progress.\n\n\tIn order to avoid any misinterpretation of what is stated \n\tabove, we should note that population increase on its own is not sufficient \n\tto achieve progress, establish a civilisation and prevail over the enemy. \n\tRather it is an essential means of achieving that, but it is not the only \n\tmeans, because it should be accompanied by a strong education system, sound \n\tupbringing of the new generation, the establishment of justice and security \n\tin society, and fighting corruption, and \u2013\u00a0 over and above all of that \u2013 \n\tfaith and piety. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n\tmeaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd if the \n\tpeople of the towns had believed and had the Taqwa (piety), certainly, We \n\tshould have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but \n\tthey belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what \n\tthey used to earn (polytheism and crimes, etc.)\u201d\n\n\t[al-A\u2018raaf 7:96].\n\n\tThe voices of the enemies of Islam have begun to cry out, \n\twarning against the large numbers of Muslims, and saying that this is one of \n\tthe main dangers that threaten them.\n\n\tIn a book entitled Changes in the Geography of the Middle \n\tEast by Prof. Arnon Soffer (1984 CE) \u2013 which is a textbook in the Jewish \n\tstate that is regarded as a reference work for specialists there \u2013 the \n\twriter states that the high population increase in Egypt is of concern to \n\tIsrael, because of the possibility of establishing a strong army.\n\n\tOn 19/1/1988 the Daily Telegraph newspaper published \n\tan article entitled \u201cThe Population Time-Bomb in the Mediterranean Basin\u201d, \n\tin which the author discusses this issue that gives the West sleepless \n\tnights, namely the great population increase in the countries to the \n\tsouth-east of the Mediterranean, and the population decline of the countries \n\tto its north. The article quotes a report of the United Nations Environment \n\tProgram which states that two-thirds of the inhabitants of the Mediterranean \n\tin the nineteen-fifties were European, in countries extending from the \n\tStraits of Gibraltar to the Bosporus, but this picture will be reversed by \n\t2025, when the Mediterranean will become an Islamic \u2013 if not Arab \u2013 sea.\n\n\tThis article indicates, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that \n\tthe one who propagates the issues of population control and restricting \n\tpopulation increase among the Muslims, and supports all activities that are \n\tstriving to achieve that under many slogans, such as family planning, social \n\tplanning and so on\u2026 We say that the one who supports that is only serving \n\tthe enemies of Islam and the Muslims and is working in their interests, \n\twhether they are aware of that or not.\n\n\tShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tAs for the view that supports population control, this is \n\tundoubtedly one of the plots of the enemies of the Muslims, who want the \n\tMuslims not to increase in number, because the very idea scares them, for \n\tthe Muslims will become self-sufficient and will not need anyone else; thus \n\tthe Muslims will be able to produce their own food and establish their own \n\tbusinesses, and that will lead to improvement in the economy and serve other \n\tinterests and aims. But if the Muslims remain few, they will become \n\thumiliated and will need others in everything. End quote.\n\n\tTafseer Soorat al-Baqarah \n\t(2/88)\n\n\tFinally, we need to increase the population, along with \n\tIslamization of development plans, Islamization of regulations, and \n\tIslamization of laws, in addition to benefitting from modern sciences.\u00a0\n\n\tFor more information, please see the book Harakat Tahdeed \n\tan-Nasl (Birth Control Movement) by Abu\u2019l-A\u2018la al-Mawdoodi (Maududi) (p. \n\t178-186); Majallat al-Bayaan (issue no, 11/107, 191)\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best."

You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, and \n    you should not treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of the \n    Mahr you have given them, unless they are guilty of brazenly immoral \n    conduct. And live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that \n    you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good\u201d\n\n    [an-Nisa\u2019 4:19].\u00a0\n\n    \u201cbrazenly \n    immoral conduct\u201d \n    does not refer only to zina; rather it also includes open defiance and \n    disobedience towards a husband, and reviling him and his family. So it is \n    more apt that having a haraam relationship with another man should also be \n    included in that and come under the same ruling.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Katheer (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the words \u201cunless \n    they are guilty of brazenly immoral conduct\u201d, \n    Ibn Mas\u2018ood, Ibn \u2018Abbaas, Sa\u2018eed ibn al-Musayyab, ash-Sha\u2018bi, al-Hasan al-Basri, \n    Muhammad ibn Sireen, Sa\u2018eed ibn Jubayr, Mujaahid, \u2018Ikrimah, \u2018Ata\u2019, al-Khurasaani, \n    ad-Dahhaak, Abu Qilaabah, Abu Saalih, as-Suddi, Zayd ibn Aslam, and Sa\u2018eed \n    ibn Abi Hilaal said: What is meant by that is zina, i.e., if she commits \n    zina, then you have the right to ask her to return the mahr that you gave \n    her, and to\u00a0 put pressure on her so that she will give it up to you and you \n    will divorce her by khula\u2018, as Allah, may He be exalted, says in Soorat al-Baqarah \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cAnd \n    it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of your \n    Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) \n    which you have given them, except when both parties fear that they would be \n    unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah (e.g. to deal with each other on \n    a fair basis). Then if you fear that they would not be able to keep the \n    limits ordained by Allah, then there is no sin on either of them if she \n    gives back (the Mahr or a part of it) for her Al-Khul\u2018 (divorce)\u201d\n\n    [al-Baarah 2:229].\u00a0\n\n    Ibn \u2018Abbaas, \u2018Ikrimah and ad-Dahhaak \n    said: \u201cbrazenly \n    immoral conduct\u201d is \n    defiance and disobedience.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Jareer \u2013 i.e., at-Tabari - \n    favoured the view that it includes all of that: zina, disobedience, \n    defiance, being sharp-tongued, and so on.\u00a0\n\n    In other words, all of that \n    makes it permissible to put pressure on her so that she will give up her \n    rights, or part of them, so that he may leave her, and this is good. And \n    Allah knows best.\u00a0\n\n    Tafseer Ibn Katheer \n    (2/241).\u00a0\n\n    It is essential to understand \n    that the mere fact that the wife has committed zina does not mean that her \n    right to the mahr is waived.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The right to the mahr is not \n    waived just because she commits zina, as is indicated by the words of the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to the couple who engaged \n    in li\u2018aan, when the husband asked about his money; he said: \u201cNo, you are not \n    entitled to any money from her. If you were telling the truth against her, \n    then it is in return for what was made permissible to you of intimacy with \n    her, and if you were telling lies against her, then you have even less right \n    to it.\u201d That is because if a woman commits zina, she may repent, but the \n    fact that she has committed zina makes it permissible for him to put \n    pressure on her, so that she will ransom herself from him if she chooses to \n    leave him, or she should repent.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa \n    (15/320)\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    Whatever a woman takes from her \n    husband\u2019s wealth without his knowledge may be one of two things:\u00a0\n\n    1.She has taken it to spend on herself and on her children and house, \n    and the reason for her doing that is stinginess and miserliness on her \n    husband\u2019s part.\n\n    2.She has taken it in order to buy luxuries, or to give the money to \n    her family, and other kinds of spending.\u00a0\n\n    In the first case, it is not \n    permissible for the husband to ask her to give this money back, because she \n    took something that she is entitled to, because spending on the wife and \n    children is obligatory upon the head of the household. If he falls short in \n    that or refuses to do it, it is permissible to take from his wealth, even if \n    that is without his knowledge.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah \n    (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Hind \u2013 the wife of Abu Sufyaan \u2013 said \n    to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Abu Sufyaan is a \n    stingy man and he does not give me enough for me and my child, except what I \n    take from him without him knowing. He said: \u201cTake that which will suffice \n    you and your child on a reasonable basis.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5049) \n    and Muslim (1714).\u00a0\n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy \n    on him) said, discussing what we learn from this hadith:\u00a0\n\n    \u2026 If a person has some right \n    over another but he is not fulfilling it, it is permissible to take from his \n    wealth as much as he is entitled to, without his permission.\u00a0\n\n    Sharh Muslim \n    (4/373)\u00a0\n\n    In the second case, it is not \n    permissible for your wife to take anything from you without your permission, \n    and if she does that then she is sinning, and you have the right to ask her \n    to return what she took; if she refuses, you have the right to take back \n    your wealth from the deferred portion of her mahr or from anything else of \n    her wealth that you owe her.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    The basic principle is that the \n    mother is more entitled to custody of her children \u2013 before the age of seven \n    years \u2013 so long as she has not remarried. What is meant by custody is not \n    merely providing food, drink and shelter; it also includes teaching them, \n    educating them, teaching them morals and manners, and taking care of their \n    psychological wellbeing. If the mother is a disbeliever or an evildoer, it \n    is not permissible to give her custody of her children. What matters with \n    regard to custody is not that the one who has custody should be a father or \n    a mother; what matters is what he or she can offer the child of care and \n    Islamic upbringing and education. Based on that, the parent who is more \n    entitled to custody is one who is better in terms of religious commitment. \n    If the mother, after her divorce, is continuing to follow misguidance and \n    commit sin, it is not permissible to give her custody of her children, and \n    in that case custody should be given to the father, but if she repents and \n    mends her ways, then she is more entitled to custody of them so long as she \n    has not remarried, for \u201cthe one who repents from sin is like the one who \n    never sinned.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Our shaykh \u2013 i.e., Ibn Taymiyah \n    \u2013 said: If one of the parents fails to teach the child and enjoin upon him \n    that which Allah has enjoined, then he is a sinner and is not entitled to \n    guardianship over the child; rather anyone who fails to undertake the duties \n    of guardianship is not entitled to guardianship. In fact he should either \n    give up guardianship and hand it over to one who will do what is required, \n    or someone should be made a co-guardian with him who will do what is \n    required, because the aim is to achieve obedience to Allah and His \n    Messenger.\u00a0\n\n    Our shaykh said: \n\n    This right is not the right of \n    inheritance which is attained by ties of kinship, marriage or wala\u2019, and is \n    the same regardless of whether the heir is an evildoer or righteous; rather \n    it is more akin to rights of guardianship, with regard to which it is \n    essential that the individual be able to carry out the duties, have \n    knowledge thereof and do them to the best of his ability.\u00a0\n\n    He said: if we assume that the \n    father marries a woman who does not pay any attention to the interests of \n    his daughter, and does not take care of her, and her mother is more able to \n    take care of the daughter\u2019s interests than that co-wife, then in this case \n    custody should definitely be given to the mother.\u00a0\n\n    It should be understood that \n    there is no general shar\u2018i text to suggest that priority be given to one of \n    the parents in all cases, or that the child should be given the choice \n    between his parents in all cases. The scholars are unanimously agreed that \n    neither of them is given priority all cases; rather one who is a \n    transgressor and negligent should not be given precedence over one who is \n    righteous, fair and will treat him well. And Allah knows best.\u00a0\n\n    Zaad al-Ma\u2018aad \n    (5/475, 476)\u00a0\n\n    Please see also the answer to \n    question no. 20705.\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    Divorce of a pregnant woman is \n    acceptable according to sharee\u2018ah and is in harmony with the Sunnah. Many \n    ordinary people think that it does not count as such, but their view has no \n    basis in Islamic teaching; rather it is a divorce that is in harmony with \n    the Sunnah.\u00a0\n\n    Muslim (1471) narrated the \n    story of how Ibn \u2018Umar divorced his wife; according to this report the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cTell him to take her back, \n    then divorce her when she is pure or pregnant.\u201d\n\n    Ibn \u2018Abd al-Barr (may Allah \n    have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to one who is \n    pregnant, there is no difference of opinion among the scholars that divorce \n    in this case is in accordance with the Sunnah, from the beginning to the end \n    of pregnancy, because her \u2018iddah ends when she gives birth. Similarly, it is \n    proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in the \n    hadith of Ibn \u2018Umar, that he instructed him to divorce his wife when she was \n    pure or pregnant, and he did not specify either the beginning or end of \n    pregnancy.\u00a0\n\n    At-Tamheed \n    (15/80)\u00a0\n\n    We have quoted a fatwa from \n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) on the ruling on divorce of a \n    wife who is pregnant, in the answer to question no. \n    12287.\u00a0\n\n    As this is the case, you can \n    divorce your wife with one, revocable talaaq, after which you have the \n    choice: either you can take her back during the \u2018iddah\u00a0 \u2013 which lasts up \n    until the time she gives birth \u2013 if you see that she has mended her ways and \n    you are convinced that she has repented \u2013 or you can wait until the \u2018iddah \n    ends, after which she will become revocably divorced. At that time she will \n    become free to choose her own destiny, but you can take her back if she \n    wants that and her guardian agrees to it, with a new marriage contract and \n    mahr, because she will have become a stranger (non-mahram) to you.\u00a0\n\n    You should not issue three \n    divorces in one sitting, or in one sentence, because that is a way of \n    divorce that is contrary to the Sunnah.\u00a0\n\n    Please see the answer to \n    question no. 36580\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "The Shaytaan whispers to him to make him imagine a form for Allah, may He exalted, so that he can attain the level of ihsaan!",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    You should understand that Allah, may He be exalted, is screened from His \n    creation in this world, so no human can see him in this world, neither the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) nor anyone of lesser \n    standing.\u00a0\n\n    The Mother of the Believers \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: \n    Whoever claims that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw \n    his Lord has fabricated a great lie against Allah. Narrated by al-Bukhaari \n    (4855) and Muslim (177).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The imams \n    (leading scholars) of the Muslims are unanimously agreed that no one among \n    the believers can see Allah with his own eyes in this world; they only \n    disagree concerning the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    in particular. However the majority of imams are of the view that he did not \n    see Him with his own eyes in this world. This is what is indicated by the \n    saheeh reports that have been proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace \n    of Allah be upon him) and the Sahaabah and imams of the Muslims.\n\n    Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa \n    2/335\u00a0\nIf \n    humans \u2013 all humans \u2013 have been prevented in this world from seeing Allah, \n    then humans \u2013 all humans \u2013 are also incapable of comprehending His true \n    essence, may He be glorified, or the exact nature of any of His attributes, \n    because humans cannot imagine anything correctly unless they have seen it or \n    have seen something that resembles or is similar to this thing, so that they \n    can move, in the imagination, from the image of that which they have seen to \n    the image of that which they have never seen.\u00a0\n\n    Based on that, you should understand that whatever image you imagine or that \n    crosses your mind, Allah, may He be exalted, is different from that. Indeed \n    Allah, may He be exalted, is more glorious and greater than all of that. The \n    fact that you are distracted by these imagined images is the result of \n    whispers and temptation from the Shaytaan, so that he can distract you with \n    that which is harmful to you from that which would benefit you, and distract \n    you with falsehood from the truth. Imam at-Tahhaawi (may Allah have mercy on \n    him) said in his book al-\u2018Aqeedah:\u00a0\n\n    One\u2019s commitment to Islam cannot be steadfast except on the basis of \n    surrender and submission. So whoever seeks to know about that of which \n    knowledge is kept away from him, and he is not content to submit to Allah, \n    then his efforts (to know that which he has been prevented from knowing) \n    will hinder him from attaining pure Tawheed, proper knowledge and sound \n    faith. So you will see him wavering between belief and disbelief, accepting \n    and rejecting, confirming and denying, controlled by insinuating thoughts, \n    lost in his wandering, full of doubt, neither believing and affirming nor \n    denying and disbelieving.\n\n    \u00a0The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has taught us a way \n    of warding off the waswaas (whispers) that the Shaytaan throws into a \n    person\u2019s heart that have to do with Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, \n    as he said: \u201cThe Shaytaan may come to one of you and say: Who created such \n    and such? Until he says to him: Who created your Lord? If it goes that far, \n    let him seek refuge with Allah and stop (such thoughts).\u201d\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3276) and Muslim (134).\u00a0\n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n    What this means is: if this waswaas comes to him, let him turn to Allah, may \n    He be exalted, to ward off its evil from him, and let him turn away from \n    thinking about that; he should understand that this passing thought comes \n    from the whispers of the Shaytaan, and he is only trying to corrupt him and \n    misguide him. So let him avoid listening to his whispers and let him hasten \n    to cut them off by focusing on something else. And Allah knows best.\u00a0\n\n    For more useful information, please see Fataawa ash-Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen \n    (1/question no. 18)\u00a0\nAs \n    for the closeness to Allah that you are looking for and seeking in your \n    worship of your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, the best status of \n    those who worship Allah is: \n\n    \u201cTo worship Allah as if you see Him, for if you do not see Him, He sees \n    you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    But this great and noble status does not require you to exert yourself and \n    distract your focus by seeking something that you can never attain, which is \n    to imagine the form of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Rather it \n    requires you to bring to mind those attributes that Allah, may He be \n    glorified and exalted, has of majesty, perfection and beauty that will help \n    you to focus your heart on worshipping Him, may He be glorified, and turn to \n    Him with all your being. Al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) \n    said:\n\n    The words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), \n    explaining what is meant by ihsaan, \u201cto worship Allah as if you see Him\u201d \n    indicate that the slaves should worship Allah in this manner, which is \n    trying to feel His closeness and that He is before him. This requires one to \n    be filled with fear, awe and veneration, as it says in the report narrated \n    by Abu Hurayrah: \u201cto fear Allah as if you see Him.\u201d [This version was \n    narrated by Muslim (101)].\u00a0\n\n    That will also lead to being sincere in worship and striving one\u2019s utmost to \n    improve it and perfect it.\n\n    Jaami\u2018 al-\u2018Uloom wa\u2019l-Hukam \n    (1/104)\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The status of ihsaan is \n    the basis for all deeds of the heart, for it leads to feeling shy (before \n    Allah), awe, veneration, fear, love, turning to Allah, may He be glorified, \n    putting one\u2019s trust in Him, beseeching Him, humbling oneself before Him, \n    cutting off all insinuating thoughts and self-talk, and focusing the heart \n    and mind on Allah.\u00a0\n\n    The individual\u2019s level of closeness to Allah will be commensurate with his \n    level of ihsaan. On that basis, prayers may vary in quality, to the extent \n    that the difference between the prayers of two men may be like the \n    difference between heaven and earth, even though their standing, bowing and \n    prostrating may be the same.\u00a0\n\n    Risaalah Ibn al-Qayyim ila Ahad Ikhwaanihi \n    (p. 38, 39). See also: Jaami\u2018 al-\u2018Uloom wa\u2019l-Hikam by Ibn Rajab \n    (1/103ff), Dar Ibn al-Jawzi edn; Ma\u2018aarij al-Qubool by Shaykh Haafiz \n    al-Hikami (3/999, 1000).\u00a0\n\n    The scholars pointed out a number of actions and beliefs which, if a person \n    strives to attain and understand them, that will help him to draw closer to \n    his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and the more a person strives to \n    be closer to his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, the closer Allah, \n    may He be exalted, will be to him. So do as little or as much as you want.\u00a0\n\n    These things include the following:\u00a0\n\n    1.Attaining true \n    understanding of the Oneness of Allah (Tawheed) and avoiding both major and \n    minor shirk (attributing partners to Allah)\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    This is attaining true sincerity and Tawheed which, whoever attains them \n    will be the closest of all people to Allah. That is attaining the word of \n    true devotion, Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah).\u00a0\n\n    Al-Istiqaamah \n    (p. 195)\u00a0\n\n    2.Knowing the \n    attributes, names and actions of Allah, may He be exalted.\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The status of ihsaan, which is the state of being aware that Allah is always \n    watching, means worshipping Allah as if you can see Him. This status can \n    only stem from perfect belief in Allah and His names and attributes, to the \n    extent that it is as if you can see Allah, may He be glorified, above His \n    heavens, risen above His Throne, issuing His commands and prohibitions, and \n    controlling the affairs of creation. So the command descends from Him and \n    ascends to Him, people\u2019s deeds and souls are shown to Him when they return \n    to Him (at death). So he witnesses all of that in his heart, and he \n    witnesses His names and attributes, and he witnesses One Who is \n    Self-Sustaining and All-Sustaining, Ever-Living, All-Hearing, All-Seeing, \n    Almighty, Most Wise, Who issues commands and prohibitions, Who loves and \n    hates, Who is pleased and is angry, Who does whatever He will and rules \n    however He will; He is above His Throne and nothing is concealed from him of \n    people\u2019s actions, words or innermost thoughts. Rather He knows the fraud of \n    the eyes, and all that the hearts conceal (cf. 40:19).\u00a0\n\n    3.Becoming a true \n    close friend (wali, pl. awliya\u2019) of Allah, which is attained through faith \n    and piety, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cNo doubt! \n    Verily, the Awliya of Allah (i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allah \n    and fear Allah much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he \n    has forbidden), and love Allah much (perform all kinds of good deeds which \n    He has ordained)), no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve, -\n\n    Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic \n    Monotheism), and used to fear Allah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and \n    sins and by doing righteous deeds)\u201d\n\n    [Yoonus 10:62, 62].\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Wilaayah (being a close \n    friend of Allah) means being close to Allah, may He be glorified and \n    exalted. The wali of Allah is the one who is close to Him. \n    \n\n    Badaa\u2019i\u2018 al-Fawaa\u2019id \n    (3/621)\u00a0\n\n    4.Persisting in \n    prayer, especially bearing in mind that one is close to Allah, may He be \n    exalted, when prostrating, for that is the closest that a person may be to \n    his Lord, may He be exalted; and also praying at the end of the night.\n\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \n    \u201cFall \n    prostrate and draw near to Allah!\u201d \n    [al-\u2018Alaq 96:19].\u00a0\nIt \n    was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe closest that a person is to his Lord \n    is when he is prostrating, so say a great deal of du\u2018aa\u2019.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by Muslim (482)\u00a0\nIt \n    was narrated from \u2018Amr ibn \u2018Abasah that he heard the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) say: \u201cThe closest that a person is to his Lord \n    is in the depths of the latter part of the night, so if you can be among \n    those who remember Allah at that time, then do so.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3579) and an-Nasaa\u2019i (572); classed as saheeh by \n    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2018 (1173).\u00a0\n\n    5.Truly repenting \n    from sins, minor and major\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It should \n    be understood that repentance is essential for every believer, and no one \n    can attain perfect closeness to Allah and rid himself of everything that He \n    dislikes except by means of it.\n\n    Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa \n    (15/55)\u00a0\n\n    6.Remembering Allah, \n    may He be exalted, at all times, reciting adhkaar, du\u2018aa\u2019s, tasbeeh, tahmeed \n    and tahleel\n[adhkaar \n    = phrases of remembrance of Allah; du\u2018aas = supplications; tasbeeh = \n    reciting the phrase Subhaan Allah (glory be to Allah); tahmeed = \n    reciting Al-hamdu Lillah (Praise be to Allah); tahleel = reciting \n    Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (There is no god but Allah)]\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Dhikr brings one closer to \n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, which is a status that everyone \n    should strive for.\n\n    Al-Waabil as-Sayyib \n    (1/96)\u00a0\n\n    7.Attaining true \n    fear of Him, may He be glorified and exalted.\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The level of fear of Allah is commensurate with one\u2019s level of closeness to \n    Him and one\u2019s status before Him. The closer a person is to Allah, the \n    greater his fear of Him will be, because there is required of him what is \n    not required of others, and he has a duty to take care of that status and \n    give it its due in a manner that is not expected of others. That is similar \n    to the one who is present before one of the kings, and can see that king: he \n    is more fearful of him than one who is far away from him, and his fear will \n    be according to how close he is to the king and his status with him, and how \n    much he knows about the king and his rights. That is also because there is \n    required of him, in terms of serving the king, what is not required of \n    others. So he is more expected to fear the king than one who is far away. \n    Whoever understands this properly will understand the hadith in which the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI am the most \n    knowledgeable of Allah among you and I am the one who fears Him the most \n    among you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Tareeq al-Hijratayn \n    (1/427, 428)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    May Allah bless you for hastening to apologise to your friend, for this is \n    indicative of your good character.\u00a0\nI \n    ask Allah to relieve your distress and reconcile between you and your \n    husband.\u00a0\nI \n    also offer you the following advice:\u00a0\n\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Undoubtedly the husband has confirmed rights over his wife, so she is \n    enjoined to obey him, treat him well and give precedence to obeying him over \n    everything else. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\n\n    \u201cMen are the protectors and maintainers of women, because \n    Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to \n    support them) from their means\u201d\n\n    [an-Nisa\u2019 4:34].\u00a0\nIt \n    was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf a woman offers \n    her five daily prayers, fasts her month (Ramadan), guards her chastity and \n    obeys her husband, it will be said to her: Enter Paradise by whichever of \n    the gates of Paradise you wish.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by Ahmad (1661); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2018 \n    (660)\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    The husband has no right to enquire into his wife\u2019s private matters or her \n    correspondence or phone conversations with her female friends, so long as \n    everything is normal, praise be to Allah, and there is no cause for doubt or \n    suspicion.\u00a0\n\n    But the fact is that you asked him for advice when your problem with your \n    friend first began, which led to him asking to see the message, according to \n    what you mentioned in your question; he would not have asked to see that \n    message if you had not asked him for advice. Your refusing to show him the \n    message was not appropriate, especially since you were the one who asked him \n    for advice. Moreover he is your husband and he has rights over you.\u00a0\n\n    What you should do now is be kind to him and treat him nicely, and calm his \n    anger with nice words and good treatment. If you know that if he sees this \n    message, it will calm him down and put an end to this matter, then there is \n    no reason why you should not do that. In fact we advise you to let him see \n    it, even if that is contrary to the basic principle (and proper etiquette) \n    and even if that is part of your private matters. The interest of \n    reconciling between you and resolving the crisis takes precedence over \n    protecting this privacy.\u00a0\n\n    Seek reward with Allah for that and seek refuge with Him, so that you may \n    protect your family and your marriage.\u00a0\n\n    \u00a0Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    The problem is minor, in sha Allah, and it is not wise or reasonable \u2013 or \n    even prescribed in Islam \u2013 to let such minor problems lead to turning the \n    home upside down, as you say, or reaching a dead end.\u00a0\n\n    Take care of your household and your family, and be patient with your \n    husband, for this is a storm that will pass quickly, in sha Allah; it is a \n    temporary misunderstanding that will soon end by the grace of Allah.\u00a0\nBe \n    smart and wise in your interactions with him, and do not tell him about your \n    problems with your friends again, so that this problem will not be \n    repeated.\u00a0\nWe \n    ask Allah to reconcile between you and to restore your life to normal.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "How should the family deal with a disobedient son?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Parents should give their children a good upbringing and take care of them so that they will be in a good state in both religious and worldly affairs.\u00a0\nIf a child grows up disobedient and rebellious, then the parents must do more and try harder to guide him and make him righteous, by reminding him and advising him, showing patience towards him, praying for him, choosing good friends for him and choosing righteous acquaintances who can visit him, and advise him and befriend him.\u00a0\nHis brothers, friends and neighbours should help his parents with that as much as they can.\u00a0\nBut if the son becomes worse and the evil and trouble he causes increases, as mentioned in the question, and admonition and discipline do not succeed with him, then it is obligatory to denounce his evil by all possible means, by threatening to hit him or actually hitting him, or seeking the help of other men in the family against him, or taking the matter to the authorities, if it is not possible to stop his evil by any of the other means mentioned. His evil should not be taken lightly or be overlooked; rather it should be stopped before it goes further and causes greater harm.\u00a0\nSo first of all they should follow the steps mentioned above of offering advice and guidance, reminding him of Allah, instilling hope and fear; telling him about the rights that his parents, his sister and his guests have over him; telling him that his committing this evil will make him hateful to his family and neighbours and the people around him, and they should persist with him in that, whilst being gentle and patient, and using wisdom and beautiful preaching.\u00a0\nHis brothers should try hard in that regard, and use wisdom and patience with him, exhorting him gently and not being harsh towards him in speech.\u00a0\nBut if he persists in what he is doing of severing ties with his parents and his brothers and sisters, and shunning them, then they should not speak to him or interact with him, in the hope that Allah will set him straight, and they should keep praying to Him to guide him.\u00a0\nBut if he does not come back to his senses and he persists in his evil ways, then they should report him to the relevant authorities and the security forces who can restrain him from doing evil and deter him from what he is doing.\u00a0\nHe should not be left to persist in this transgression, because of the severity of his evil and the harm that he may do to his family and the people around him.\u00a0\nOver and above all that, his parents and family members should turn to Allah, for most such calamities come about because of the sins that bring evil and corruption to the household. Ibn al-Haaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said, when speaking about matters contrary to Islamic teaching that may be done by one or both spouses:\u00a0\nUndoubtedly reconciling between these spouses is very rare, and even if there is harmony between them, it is not free of ills, and if they happen to have a child, he will most likely grow up disobedient and doing all manner of inappropriate things, and all of that is the result of both of them not paying attention to their duties towards Allah, may He be exalted.\u00a0End quote from al-Madkhal (2/170)\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Signs of Death in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.No person knows when he will die\nNo one knows exactly when he will die , or in what land he will die. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cVerily, Allah! With Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die. Verily, Allah is All-Knower, All-Aware (of things).\u201d [Luqman 31:34]\u00a0\nAre there signs for death?\nThere are no specific signs by which a person may know that his death and the end of his life are approaching. This is by the mercy of Allah towards His slaves, for if a person knew when he was going to die, and he knew that repentance expiates the sins that come before it, perhaps he might indulge in sins and commit evil deeds, and promise himself that one hour before his death he will repent and give up his sin. But such a person does not deserve to be a slave of Allah; rather he is a slave to his whims and desires.\u00a0\nThis is in contrast to reality, for no person knows when he will die, so the wise person strives to make up what he has missed out on and hastens to do so by repenting and doing righteous deeds, for he does not know when his life will end, and he remains in this state until Allah takes his soul. Such a person deserves to be a righteous slave who loves to obey Allah and hates to disobey Him.\u00a0\nSigns that the end of a person\u2019s life is approaching\nBut there are some signs which may indicate that the end of a person\u2019s life is approaching , such as if he suffers a severe sickness from which people hardly ever recover. The same applies if he reaches extreme old age, or is in a serious accident, and other matters that may happen by divine decree.\u00a0\nIn the answer to question no.\u00a0184737 \u00a0we mentioned the signs which are indicative of a person being righteous at the time of his death, and the signs which are indicative of a bad end .\u00a0\nWhat to do if you feel that death is approaching\nIf a person feels that his death is approaching because of severe illness and the like, then what he must do is hasten to set things straight by repenting to Allah, making up for any wrongs done to people and asking them for forgiveness, hastening to do righteous deeds, being serious and focused in turning to Allah and obeying Him, and seeking pardon and forgiveness from Him by His grace, in addition to thinking positively of Allah, may He be glorified, and trusting in His abundant grace and mercy, and believing that He will never let down a slave who thinks positively of Him.\u00a0\nMuslim (2877) narrated that Jabir said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say, three days before he died: \u201cNo one of you should die except thinking positively of Allah.\u201d\u00a0\nHe should also do a great deal of those deeds that expiate and erase sins, such as praying for forgiveness, maintaining wudu, praying, Hajj and `Umrah, and so on.\u00a0\nDo agonies of death reduce the burden of sin?\u00a0\nThe agonies of death are the last hardship that a person encounters before meeting Allah, and they are the last thing by means of which Allah expiates the sins of His slave. We ask Allah to make these agonies easy for us and help us to bear them.\u00a0\nAl-Bukhari (4449) narrated from `Aishah that during the sickness of which he died, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) began to put his hand in water and wipe his face with it, saying: \u201cLa ilaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah), verily death has agonies.\u201d Then he held up his hand and started saying: \u201cWith the higher companions\u2026\u201d until he passed away and his hand fell.\u00a0\nAt-Tirmidhi (978) narrated from \u2018Aishah that she said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as he was dying. There was a vessel of water next to him, and he would put his hand in the vessel then wipe his face with the water, then he said: \u201cO Allah, help me to bear the agonies of death.\u201d\u00a0(Classed as hasan by al-Hafiz in al-Fath (11/362); classed as da\u2018if by al-Albani in Da\u2018if at-Tirmidhi)\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\u00a0\nDo the agonies of death reduce the burden of sin? Does sickness that precedes death do likewise?\u00a0\nHe replied:\u00a0\n\u201cEverything that befalls a person of sickness, hardship, worry, or distress, even a thorn that pricks him, is expiation for his sins. Then if he is patient and seeks reward, in addition to expiation of sin he will have the reward for that patience with which he faced the calamity that befell him. There is no differentiation in that regard between what happens at the time of death and what happens before that.\u201d (Fatawa Nur \u2018ala ad-Darb, 24/2)\u00a0\nAlongside the hardship and agonies of death, what the believer receives of glad tidings and being made steadfast at the time of his death are among the things that will make what he is faced with easier to bear and will make him long for what comes after it of meeting Allah .\u00a0\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cThe dying person can only be one of two things: either it is a relief for him or others are relieved of him. In either case things may be very hard for him at the time of death or they may be alleviated for him. In the former case, he is the one who is faced with the agonies of death, and that has nothing to do with whether he was pious or an evildoer; rather if he was one of the pious it will increase him in reward, otherwise it will expiate for him accordingly, then he will be relieved of the annoyances of this world, of which this is the last. \u2018Umar ibn \u2018Abd al-\u2018Aziz said: I would not like the agonies of death to be reduced for me, for that is the last thing by means of which sin may be expiated for the believer. Yet at the same time, what the believer receives of glad tidings and the angels being happy to meet him, and their accompanying him, and his joy at meeting his Lord, make it easier for him to bear whatever he may face of the pain of death, until it becomes as if he does not feel anything of that.\u201d (Fath al-Bari, 11/365)\u00a0\u00a0\nWe do not know of any way of reducing the agonies of death, except that the individual should turn to his Lord concerning that, and call upon Him at times of hardship and of ease. Perhaps we will do what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did, when he put his hands in the water then wiped his face with them and asked Allah to help him to face the agonies of death, as mentioned above.\u00a0\nHowever some of the early generations used to regard this hardship as a mercy, as quoted above from \u2018Umar ibn \u2018Abd al-\u2018Aziz. \u2018Abdullah ibn Ahmad narrated in Zawaid az-Zuhd (p. 388) that Ibrahim an-Nakha\u2018i said: They used to regard it as mustahabb for the sick person to go through some hardship at the time of death. And it was narrated from Mansur that Ibrahim used to like the severe agony of death.\u00a0\nWe do not know of anyone who is saved from this hardship apart from the martyr. Imam Ahmad (7953), at-Tirmidhi (1668 \u2013 and he classed it as sahih), an-Nasai (3161) and Ibn Majah (2802) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe martyr does not feel anything more when he is killed than one of you feels if he is pinched.\u201d (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi and elsewhere)\u00a0\nAl-Manawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cWhat this means is that Allah, may He be exalted, makes death easy for him and suffices him against its agonies and distress; in fact the martyr may enjoy giving himself for the sake of Allah willingly, as Khubayb al-Ansari said (in verse):\nI do not care if I am killed as a Muslim; it does not matter how I may be killed.\u201d (Fayd al-Qadir, 4/182)\u00a0\nHow to draw closer to Allah\nRighteous deeds are all deeds enjoined, encouraged and recommended by the Lawgiver, and some of them are superior to others. Among the best of righteous deeds by means of which a person may draw close to his Lord and which the Muslim is advised to do constantly are: to remember Allah a great deal,\u00a0 read Quran, honour one\u2019s parents, uphold ties of kinship, perform Hajj and \u2018Umrah, offer voluntary prayers at night, give charity in secret, have a good attitude, spread the greeting of salam, feed people, speak truthfully, enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, love good for people, refrain from harming them, cooperate in righteousness and piety, reconcile between people and other righteous deeds.\u00a0\nWe advise the questioner to take thinking of death and its hardships as a means of encouraging her to fear Allah and do righteous deeds, for if a person fears Allah and does good, Allah will make all difficulties easy for him, and relieve him of every distress and hardship .\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "When is it permissible to do a sex-change operation from male to female or vice versa?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nIt is not possible for anyone, no matter who he is, to change the creation of Allah, may He be exalted, from male to female or vice versa. Whoever Allah, may He be exalted, has created as a male can never become a female who menstruates and gives birth!\u00a0\nYes, the doctors may tamper with him to satisfy his perversion so that he will think that he has become a woman, but he will never be truly female and will live in a state of anxiety and worry, which may lead him to commit suicide.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWhat a person may feel in his mind and heart, that he is of a gender other than what he appears to be to us does not give him an excuse to change his gender; rather it comes under the heading of following the Shaytaan in changing the creation of Allah \u2013 outwardly but not truly \u2013 and those feelings do not make it permissible for him to undergo surgery or take medicines and hormones to change his outward appearance. Rather he must be content with the decree of Allah, may He be exalted, and treat his case on the basis of faith and obedience to Allah. It is not permissible for him to make himself appear outwardly to be of a gender other than his real gender with which Allah created him, otherwise he will be committing a major sin; if this person is really female then she will be masculinised and if he is really male then he will be effeminate.\u00a0\nPlease see also the answers to questions no. 21277 and  34553\u00a0\nThe surgery that is permissible in such cases is if a person was originally created male or female, but his genital organs are hidden. In that case it is permissible to do surgery in order to make those organs appear, and to give him or her medicine or hormones to strengthen the characteristics with which Allah originally created him or her.\u00a0\nBut in the case of one who was created with both female and male genitalia \u2013 this is what is called ambiguous intersex \u2013 it is not permissible to be hasty in removing one and making the other more apparent. Rather we should wait until it is known what Allah, may He be exalted, will decree for this individual, which may become apparent after some time has passed.\u00a0\nFor a more detailed discussion on intersex please see the answer to question no. 114670\u00a0\nThere follows a detailed fatwa from the scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas, who were asked about a case similar to what is mentioned in the question. They replied:\u00a0\nFirstly: Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cTo Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills. Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All-Knower and is Able to do all things\u201d [ash-Shoora 42:49].\u00a0 So the Muslim must accept and be content with whatever Allah creates and decrees.\u00a0\nIn your case, if you are as you mentioned, that you are certain of your masculinity and that you can play the male role efficiently, even if you have not actually engaged in any sexual activity with any person, then you must preserve your masculinity and accept that which Allah has granted to you of virtue and a favourable situation. .\u00a0\nSecondly: once your masculinity is proven and established, then having surgery to turn into a female \u2013 as you think \u2013 is changing the creation of Allah, and is an expression of discontent on your part with what Allah has chosen for you, even if we assume that the surgery is going to be successful and lead to what you want of becoming female. But there is no way that it can be successful, for both males and females have their own, distinct faculties and physical makeup, the development and characteristics of which are decreed only by Allah, may He be exalted, and are not just the penis of the male or the vaginal opening of the female. Rather the man has a complete, integrated system comprising the testicles and other organs, each of which has a special function and characteristics, and produces specific secretions and so on. Likewise the woman has a uterus and other connected parts that work in harmony with it, and each part has its own function and characteristics, and produces specific secretions and so on. Among all of them there are connections and harmony over which none of His creation have any power of estimation, creation, control, management or preservation. Rather all of that is under the control of Allah, the All-Knowing, Most Wise, Most High, Almighty, Most Kind and All-Aware.\u00a0\nTherefore the surgery that you want to do is a kind of tampering and striving for something in which there is no benefit. In fact it may be dangerous; if it does not lead to death, then at the very least it will lead to taking away that which Allah has given you without you attaining what you want, and you will still be affected by what you have mentioned of psychological problems that you want to get rid of by means of this surgery that is bound to fail.\u00a0\nThirdly: if your masculinity is not established, and you only think that you are a man because of what you see in your body of outward masculine appearance, in contrast to what you feel in yourself of having feminine characteristics and an inclination towards males and being sexually attracted to them, then you should examine your situation and not go ahead with the surgery that you have mentioned. You should consult experienced specialist doctors. If they determine that you are male in outward appearance but are in fact female, then you may submit yourself to their treatment, so that they can bring out your femininity by doing surgery. But that will not in fact be a sex change from male to female, because this will not be up to them; rather it will be bringing out your true nature and removing what is in your body, and what you feel deep inside you of confusion and ambiguity. But if nothing is clear to the experts, then do not take the risk of undergoing this surgery; be content with the decree of Allah and be patient with what has befallen you, seeking to please your Lord and protecting yourself against the possible consequences of doing an operation without guidance and insight concerning your condition. Turn to Allah and beseech Him to relieve you of what you are facing, and to heal you from your psychological problems, for control of all things is in His hand, may He be glorified, and He is able to do all things.

        "question": "He suffers from vasocongestion and pain, and the doctor advised him to masturbate",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Masturbation is haraam because of evidence that we have \n    quoted previously in the answer to question no.\n    329\n\n    As it is haraam, then there is no way that it could be a \n    remedy, because Allah has not put healing in that which He has forbidden to \n    His slaves.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Allah has \n    not put your healing in that which He has forbidden to you. Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari in a mu\u2018allaq report in Kitaab al-Ashribah, Baab Sharaab \n    al-Halwa wa\u2019l-\u2018Asl.\u00a0\n\n    A person may imagine that something is a remedy when in fact \n    it is a disease, such as the one who imagines that there is healing in khamr \n    (wine, alcohol), as it says in the hadeeth that was narrated by Muslim \n    (3670) via Suwayd al-Ja\u2018fi who said that he asked the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) about khamr and he forbade him or discouraged \n    him from making it. He said: I only make it as a remedy, and the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIt is not a remedy; rather \n    it is a disease.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Masturbation is also like that; you may think that it is a \n    remedy when in fact it is a disease. The one who suffers from it can hardly \n    give it up and has no limit at which he can stop. With regard to fasting, it \n    is a beneficial prophetic remedy, but it needs to be done regularly and on \n    an ongoing basis, whilst also following other preventative measures such as \n    lowering the gaze, avoiding idleness, keeping busy with acts of worship and \n    obedience, and choosing righteous friends.\u00a0\n\n    Some fuqaha\u2019 allowed masturbation in cases where the \n    individual fears for his religious commitment or physical well-being, under \n    the heading of committing the lesser of two evils.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n    was asked about a man who was faced with provocation of desire, so he \n    masturbated although he knew that the problem could be dealt with by \n    fasting, but it was too difficult for him.\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to that (semen) that is emitted involuntarily, \n    there is no sin on him for that, but he has to do ghusl if the water came \n    out gushing. But if it was emitted voluntarily, in that he masturbated, this \n    is haraam according to most of the scholars. It is also one of the two views \n    narrated from Ahmad; in fact it is the more correct view; according to \n    another view it is makrooh (disliked). But if he is compelled to do that, \n    such as if he feared that he might fall into zina if he did not masturbate, \n    or he feared that he might become ill, then in this case there are two \n    well-known scholarly views. Some of the earlier and later scholars granted a \n    concession in such cases, and others forbade it. And Allah knows best.\n\n    End quote from al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 3/439. See also \n    Mataalib Ooli an-Nuha, 6/225; Kashshaaf al-Qinaa\u2018, 6/125\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He \n    said: \u201cThe one who masturbates unnecessarily should be given a disciplinary \n    punishment.\u201d The phrase \u201cunnecessarily\u201d means if there was no need to do \n    that. Needs are of two types: religious or spiritual needs and physical \n    needs.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to religious or spiritual needs, that refers to \n    when the individual fears that he may fall into zina, if he is in a country \n    where it is easy to commit zina. If he experiences intense desire, he will \n    have two options: either he can extinguish it by doing this action or he can \n    go to any place where there are prostitutes and commit zina. In that case we \n    say to him that this is a legitimate need, because the established principle \n    in Islam says that it is essential to ward off the greater of two evils by \n    means of the lesser, and this is what is in accordance with reason. If this \n    person has no option but to fulfil his desire in one of these two ways, then \n    in that case we say that it is permissible for him to do this action because \n    it is a case of necessity.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to physical needs, that refers to when the \n    individual fears that some harm may befall his body if he does not discharge \n    this fluid from his body, because some people may experience strong desire, \n    and if this accumulating fluid is not discharged it will result in \n    psychological problems, so he will not like to mix with people or sit with \n    them.\u00a0\n\n    So if he fears some kind of physical harm, then it is \n    permissible for him to do this action because it is a physical need. But if \n    there is no need and he does this action, then he should be given a \n    disciplinary punishment that will serve as a deterrent.\n\n    End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti\u2018, 14/318\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    You should avoid anything that may provoke desire of looking, \n    listening, reading and so on, and you should avoid keeping company with \n    those whose company may lead to that, so as to protect your religious \n    commitment and your physical well-being. Please see the answer to question \n    no. 20161 for some advice on \n    resisting the danger of sexual temptation.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    If a man offers to give you his daughter in marriage and to \n    spend on you both, and this man is religiously committed and righteous, and \n    there is no fear that he will break his promise or remind you of his \n    kindness later on, then there is nothing wrong with accepting that from him; \n    perhaps this is provision that Allah has granted to you and a way out by \n    which you can be safe from falling into haraam.\u00a0\n\n    As for marrying with the intention of divorcing, that is \n    haraam, because it involves deceiving and cheating the wife. This has been \n    discussed previously in the answer to question no.\n    111841\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allah to make things easy for you, purify your heart \n    and protect your chastity.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "His mother mistreats his wife and her family",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Undoubtedly these kinds of family problems and annoyances are \n    things that affect one\u2019s life and occupy one\u2019s thoughts, but with a little \n    wisdom, proper conduct, more rational thinking, adhering to the path of \n    fairness and patience for the sake of pleasing the one who has the greatest \n    rights over you \u2013 namely your mother \u2013 and pleasing the one whom you love, \n    the source of your comfort and the mother of your children \u2013 namely your \n    wife \u2013 we can resolve the problem and handle the matter in the best manner \n    possible.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    We must \u2013 may Allah guide us and you aright \u2013 inform each \n    party of the rights of the other. The mother must understand that her son\u2019s \n    wife has rights that have been ordained by Allah and taught by the Messenger \n    of Allah; the wife must understand that the mother has rights ordained by \n    Allah and affirmed by the Messenger of Allah.\u00a0\n\n    Moreover, each of them must understand that when Allah \n    ordained rights for people, He forbade mistreatment and enmity, and He \n    forbade transgressing the limits that He has set for His slaves. So what we \n    must do is adhere to those limits and no one who has been given rights \n    should transgress the limits in order to transgress against the rights of \n    anyone else.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    We should explain the standard of fairness that has been \n    outlined in Islam, which is that a person\u2019s faith is not truly complete \n    until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself, and until he hates \n    for his brother what he hates for himself.\u00a0\n\n    So we ask the mother: would you accept for anyone \u2013 no matter \n    who he is \u2013 to direct hurtful words towards you, or to mistreat you by \n    behaving in an inappropriate manner, or to say bad things about your family, \n    and so on?\u00a0\n\n    We ask the wife: would you be happy for my mother to be angry \n    with me and not be pleased, and to pray against me instead of praying for \n    me? Would you like that for yourself, no matter what the reasons?\u00a0\n\n    By presenting the case in such a manner, discussing it with \n    two people you care for and who you do not want to make angry with you, you \n    can persuade them, without putting the one who is in the wrong \u2013 especially \n    your mother \u2013 on the spot and accusing her of transgression and hostility, \n    or speaking ill of her and her actions, which may make matters more \n    complicated and difficult to resolve. Rather you can achieve that with \n    wisdom and choosing your words carefully.\u00a0\n\n    Then you should speak to your wife, encouraging her to pardon \n    and overlook.\u00a0\n\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\n\n    \u201cThe good deed \n    and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better \n    (i.e. Allah ordered the faithful believers to be patient at the time of \n    anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly), then verily! he, between \n    whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend\u201d\n\n    [Fussilat 41:34].\u00a0\n\n    The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cNo one forgives, but \n    Allah increases him in honour.\u201d Narrated by \n    Muslim, 2588.\u00a0\n\n    According to another hadeeth: \u201cNo one is wronged and bears it \n    with patience but Allah will increase him in honour.\u201d Narrated by \n    at-Tirmidhi, 2325; classed as saheeh by al-Albani.\u00a0\n\n    Explain to her that forgiving is more beloved and more \n    pleasing to Allah, and tell her: \u201cYou will only be forgiving the most \n    beloved of people to me, namely my mother, and that will only increase you \n    in dearness to me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible for your wife to cut off her \n    relationship with your mother by shunning her and boycotting her, because it \n    is not permissible for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than three \n    days, as is well known. It is narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cWhoever forsakes his brother for a year, it is as if he shed \n    his blood.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood, \n    4915;classed as saheeh by al-Albani.\u00a0\n\n    He also said: \u201cIt is not permissible for a Muslim to shun \n    another Muslim for more than three days, because they will be drifting away \n    from the path of truth so long as they are shunning one another. Whichever \n    of them is first to reach out to his brother, his doing so will be an \n    expiation for him. If he greets him and he (the other one) does not respond, \n    the angels will return his greeting and the shaytan will respond to the \n    other one. If they both die in that state, neither of them will ever enter \n    Paradise.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by Ahmad, 15824; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in\n    as-Saheehah, 1246\u00a0\n\n    But if mixing with one another will always lead to annoyance \n    for the wife, and insults to her family, then this is something that it is \n    not permissible for the mother to do, and it is not permissible for you to \n    keep quiet about it, because people\u2019s rights should be respected and if \n    anyone harms a Muslim with no justification, the score will be settled on \n    the Day of Resurrection.\u00a0\n\n    There is a well-known report about the bankrupt person who \n    will come on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting and zakah to his \n    credit, but he will come having insulted this one, reviled that one, \n    devoured the wealth of this one, shed the blood of that one and beaten \n    another one. So each of them will be given some of his hasanat, and if his \n    hasanat run out before what he owes has been paid off, some of their bad \n    deeds will be taken and added to his burden, then he will be thrown into the \n    Fire.\u00a0\n\n    So it is essential to alert your mother to this great danger \n    and to advise her concerning that, in a gentle manner, and remind her to \n    fear Allah.\u00a0\n\n    Based on that, if your mother persists in treating your wife \n    in this manner, then the right thing to do is not to enable her to do that, \n    by preventing your wife from going to see her, and there will be no blame on \n    your wife in that case if she does not mix with her, visit her or go to see \n    her. This is not obligatory upon her in the first place; rather what is \n    obligatory is not to shun a person without any shar\u2018i justification that \n    would make doing so permissible.\u00a0\n\n    If we assume that your wife overlooks and forgives her, and \n    gives up her own rights, then what about the rights of her family? What have \n    they done wrong to deserve this criticism and mistreatment without any error \n    or sin on their part?\u00a0\n\n    But if it so happens that your wife and your mother meet in \n    some place, then your wife has to greet her with salam if she meets her; \n    the better of the two will be the one who is first to greet the other. If \n    your mother speaks to her or greets her with salam, then she must return \n    her greeting.\u00a0\n\n    In that case it will not matter if your mother threatens to \n    pray against you and to be displeased with you, because Allah has forbidden \n    injustice to Himself and has made it haram among people, and He has stated \n    that He does not love those who are unjust or wrong others, as He, may He be \n    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cO you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah and be just \n    witnesses and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid \n    justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety\u201d\n\n    [al-Maidah 5:8].\u00a0\n\n    What is meant is: stand out firmly for Allah and be just in \n    word and deed, and be like that towards both relatives and strangers, \n    friends and enemies.\u00a0\n\n    Do not let the hatred of some people cause you to treat them \n    unfairly; rather, just as you would testify in favour of your friend, you \n    should also testify against him (if need be), and just as you would testify \n    against your enemy, you should also testify in his favour; even if he is a \n    disbeliever or innovator, it is obligatory to treat him fairly.\u00a0\n\n    See: Tafseer as-Sa\u2018di, p. 224\u00a0\n\n    Moreover, just as it is not permissible to let hatred of some \n    people make you fail to be fair, it is not permissible to let love of others \n    make you fail to be fair; rather you should be fair in all cases.\n\n    \u00a0There is no blame on you for any of this, if you have tried \n    to bring about reconciliation as much as you can, but were unable to achieve \n    that. If your mother threatens to pray against you and so on, Allah, may He \n    be exalted, will not answer the supplication of one who prays wrongfully or \n    on the basis of severing ties of kinship.\u00a0\n\n    But it is essential that you take care to treat her properly \n    and be patient in putting up with any unpleasantness on her part in all \n    situations.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah is the Guide to the straight path.\u00a0\n\n    Please see also question no. \n    82453\n\n    Note:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the words of the questioner: \u201cI still offer \n    supplication for her when I pray and I give in charity on her behalf\u201d, \n    offering supplication for her is a good deed and comes under the heading of \n    honouring her and treating her kindly. But giving charity on her behalf when \n    she is still alive is something that is not known from the early \n    generations; rather what is known is giving charity on behalf of one who has \n    passed away. Al-Bukhari (2760) and Muslim (1004) narrated from \u2018Aishah \n    (may Allah be pleased with her) that a man said to the Prophet (blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him): My mother died suddenly and did not leave a \n    will. I think that if she had been able to speak, she would have given \n    charity. Can I give charity on her behalf? He said: \u201cYes, give charity on \n    her behalf.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    An-Nawawi said:\u00a0\n\n    This hadeeth indicates that giving charity on behalf of the \n    deceased will benefit the deceased and the reward for it will reach him. \n    There is scholarly consensus on this point. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    So what is prescribed is to focus on serving her, and praying \n    for her in her absence, upholding ties with her by giving money and food, \n    and so on, without giving charity on her behalf, because there is no \n    evidence that doing so is prescribed (when she is still alive), as far as we \n    know.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Compulsive waswaas refers to thoughts and bad ideas that come \n    one after another to a person\u2019s mind even though he does not want them, in \n    such a way that he cannot rid himself of them, even though he knows and is \n    certain that they are foolish and unacceptable thoughts. They keep coming to \n    his mind compulsively, which causes him a great deal of anguish and \n    distress.\u00a0\n\n    The remedy for compulsive waswaas and other types of waswaas \n    is to remember Allah a great deal, obey Him, and turn to Him, beseeching \n    Him, and seeking refuge with Him; to overlook and ignore the waswaas, and \n    not let oneself get carried away with it. In some cases there is a need to \n    consult a doctor.\u00a0\n\n    See the answers to questions no.\n    39684 and\n    90819.\n\n    Allah will not punish a person or call him to account for \n    this waswaas, because it is beyond his control and overwhelms him; it does \n    not happen by his choice.

Many cases of waswaas are in fact cases of sickness that can be \n    treated by psychologists and the like.\n\n    3.They should offer a lot of \n    supplication and beseech Allah to remove this harm and heal him.\n\n    4.Ruqya as prescribed in Islam. \n    His son, wife or any other family member or other person may perform ruqya \n    for him as prescribed in Islam. Allah may heal types of chronic sickness by \n    His grace, by means of Islamically prescribed ruqya from the Qur\u2019an and \n    Sunnah.\n\n    See also the answer to question no.\n    3476\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    If this suitor is of good character and religiously \n    committed, then there is nothing wrong with marrying him, whether his father \n    is healthy or otherwise, and whether he is a Muslim or an apostate. None of \n    those factors are an impediment to marrying his son, so long as the son is \n    religiously committed and of good character.\u00a0\n\n    However we do not think that you should rush to accept such a \n    person; rather proceeding with caution in the case of such proposals that \n    may lead to complicated social problems is better, more sensible and wiser.\u00a0\n\n    You have to let your guardians know about the matter and they \n    should find out the facts for themselves, so that they can make the right \n    decision for their daughter.\u00a0\n\n    If you feel that this will have an impact on your life and \n    your social relationships, then you are still young, so if you wait for a \n    more suitable opportunity that is less likely to cause you problems, then \n    perhaps that is better and more appropriate.\u00a0\n\n    If you insist on accepting this suitor, and your guardians \n    agree to it, then you and your husband should have separate accommodation; \n    that is more likely to avoid problems and keep you away from troubles.\u00a0\n\n    Moreover, he will be the grandfather of your children and \n    also your father-in-law, the father of your husband, so you should strive \n    hard to treat him kindly as much as you can.\u00a0\n\n    See also the answer to question no.\n    130935.\n\n    For more information, please see the answer to question no.\n    146463\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "She is annoyed by the constant demands from her husband\u2019s father for financial support even though he is able to work and earn a living",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Undoubtedly obedience to parents, so long as it does not \n    involve disobedience towards Allah, is one of the greatest of righteous \n    deeds and acts of worship. This is a well-known basic principle in Islam.\u00a0\n\n    The father has the right to take whatever he wants from his \n    son\u2019s wealth, but that is subject to conditions, one of which is that taking \n    it should not cause harm to his son and that he should not take from him in \n    order to give to someone else.\u00a0\n\n    Moreover, he should not take from his son\u2019s wealth in order \n    to waste it on extravagances or buy things that he does not need. This is \n    more obviously forbidden; in fact it is not allowed even if it is one\u2019s own \n    wealth and earnings, so how about if it is his son\u2019s earnings? See the \n    answer to question no. 9594.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    Spending on the father\u2019s maintenance is only obligatory if \n    the father is in difficulty and unable to earn a living from a suitable job. \n    If he is not in difficulty or he is in difficulty but he is able to earn a \n    living from a suitable job, then his son is not obliged to spend on him, \n    according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions.\u00a0\n\n    It says in Minah al-Jaleel, 4/416: Spending on the \n    maintenance of parents who are in financial difficulty is obligatory, even \n    if they have a servant and a house that they need but are no more than is \n    necessary. It seems that this is the case even if the father is able to earn \n    a living. This is the view of al-Baaji and those who agreed with him. \n    However al-Lakhmi says that rather he should be compelled to work in his \n    profession, and this is the correct view and is the view of the author of \n    al-Jawaahir. This is what appears to be the correct view by analogy with \n    the son, because in order for it to be obligatory for the father to spend on \n    his son, it is stipulated that the son should be unable to earn a living \n    doing work that is not demeaning to him.\n\n    End quote. See: Haashiyat ad-Dasooqi, 2/523\u00a0\n\n    It says in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa\u2018, 5/481-482:\u00a0\n\n    We may sum up the conditions of it being obligatory to spend \n    on a relative in the following points: Firstly, that those on whom he is \n    spending should be poor, with no wealth or income to make them independent \n    of means so that they do not need someone else to spend on them. If those on \n    whom he is spending are well off and have sufficient wealth or income, there \n    is no obligation to spend on them, because the condition is not applicable \n    in this case. But if their wealth or income is not sufficient for them, then \n    he is obliged to top it up. Secondly, the one who is supposed to spend on \n    them should have sufficient wealth to do so that is surplus to what he needs \n    to spend on his own maintenance and that of his wife and family. Thirdly, \n    the one who spends should be an heir of the one on whom he spends, either \n    according to the shares allocated by sharee\u2018ah or because of blood ties \n    through the father.\n\n    End quote. \u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    The husband does not have the right to take from his wife\u2019s \n    wealth in order to give it to his father, mother or siblings without her \n    consent. It is not permissible for the husband to take anything of his \n    wife\u2019s wealth except what she gives willingly.\u00a0\n\n    See the answer to question no.\n    163541.\u00a0\n\n    What we think is that the son should give his father \n    something by way of upholding ties of kinship, in such a way that will not \n    adversely affect your needs and will not be unfair to you, and he and his \n    siblings should encourage their father to work.\u00a0\n\n    You could make your salary separate from your husband\u2019s \n    salary, and save all of your salary, and your husband can spend on you and \n    the children and shoulder the responsibility of living costs. This is his \n    basic duty in the first place. Then if there is anything left over, he can \n    use that to uphold ties with his father in a way that will not adversely \n    affect you or be unfair to his children. Then he can add whatever is left \n    over to what you have of wealth, and you can put that towards buying a house \n    or you can save it for your needs.\u00a0\n\n    But you have to be very careful not to let that choice lead \n    to trouble in your relationship with your husband. However, you are in a \n    position to evaluate the situation as you are living with him.\u00a0\n\n    If you are afraid that that may lead to some trouble, then \n    carry on as you have been doing, and try to advise him to think of what is \n    best for you and your children whilst avoiding cutting off ties with his \n    father or failing to uphold ties with him and treat him kindly, in ways that \n    will benefit him and not harm you.\u00a0\n\n    See also the answer to question no.\n    130599."

We have discussed in detail the rights of the spouses \n    over one another in the answer to question no.\n    10680\n\n    One of the rights \n    that the wife has over her husband is that he should keep her chaste by \n    means of intercourse with her. This is obligatory for the one who is able to \n    do it. This is the view of the majority of scholars.\u00a0\n\n    It says in \n    al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah (30/127):\u00a0\n\n    One of the rights \n    of the wife over her husband is that he should keep her chaste by having \n    intercourse with her. The majority of fuqaha\u2019 \u2013 Hanafis, Maalikis and \n    Hanbalis \u2013 are of the view that it is obligatory for the husband to have \n    intercourse with his wife. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    The scholars \n    differed with regard to the limits within which the husband must have \n    intercourse with his wife. The most correct opinion is that it should be in \n    accordance with her need and his ability.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam \n    Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who does \n    not have intercourse with his wife for one or two months; is there any sin \n    on him or not? Is the husband required to do that?\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\u00a0\n\n    The man should \n    have intercourse with his wife according to what is reasonable. It is the \n    most important right that she has over him and is more important than \n    providing her with food. It was said that obligatory intercourse is once \n    every four months, or whatever is in accordance with her need and his \n    ability, just as he should feed her according to her need and what he can \n    afford. This is the more correct of the two scholarly opinions.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2018 \n    al-Fataawa, \n    32/271\u00a0\n\n    Your husband may \n    be suffering from some mental or physical illness and this may be what is \n    causing him to refrain from intercourse or showing affection. You cannot be \n    certain that this is not happening in his case, especially since you say \n    that the shaykhs who have examined your situation think that he has been \n    affected by the evil eye. It is not far-fetched to say that that the evil \n    eye may be what has caused the change in his behaviour.\u00a0\n\n    Dr. \u2018Abdullah \n    as-Sadhaan \u2013 who is a specialist in matters of ruqyah and whose doctoral \n    thesis was entitled Diraasah Muqaarinah \u2018an ar-Ruqyah ash-Shar\u2018iyyah \n    (A Comparative Study of Ruqyah as prescribed in Islam) was asked:\u00a0\n\n    Can the evil eye \n    cause physical sickness or financial or social problems?\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\u00a0\n\n    Yes, the evil eye \n    can cause a lack of healing from many physical problems and may even make \n    them worse. It may also cause financial and marital problems, breakdown in \n    relationships and a lot of calamities. How can it be otherwise, when the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cDeath among my \n    ummah is mostly caused, after the will and decree of Allah, by the evil \n    eye.\u201d So whatever occurs of calamities that are less serious than death are \n    more likely to be caused by the evil eye.\u00a0\n\n    Majallat \n    ad-Da\u2018wah, \n    issue no. 2018, 15 Shawwaal 1426 AH/17 November 2005 CE\u00a0\n\n    One of the duties \n    of the righteous wife is to stand by her husband in such situations, because \n    he is in the greatest need of someone to support him and help him in \n    treating his disease until Allah decrees that he should be healed. If what \n    has befallen him is caused by his material circumstances and social \n    interactions, then you can win his heart by beautifying yourself for him, \n    and treating him in a loving and kind manner, for you are his source of \n    tranquillity. Allah has created between the spouses love and compassion that \n    will make it easy for you to reach his heart and reduce the pressure that he \n    is suffering because of his circumstances.\u00a0\n\n    You should \n    understand that the man is not like the woman; the woman\u00a0 can respond to her \n    husband\u2019s sexual needs in all circumstances unless she is sick, menstruating \n    or bleeding following childbirth. But a man cannot do that unless he has \n    energy and the desire for intercourse. Hence Islam does not oblige him to \n    treat his wives (in the case of plural marriage) equally in terms of \n    intercourse, because that depends on energy, desire and strength. For the \n    same reason also there is a warning against refusing to share the marital \n    bed on the part of the wife but not the husband.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to \n    your saying that you are afraid of falling into immoral actions, you should \n    be patient and forbearing, and help your husband until Allah heals him. If \n    you are not able to be patient then you have the right to ask for a \n    divorce.\u00a0\n\n    Your husband \n    should hasten to seek treatment for himself; he should not hesitate to do so \n    or be heedless or lazy about it. According to what you say, he is neglecting \n    the rights of his wife and the wife has the right to be kept chaste. If he \n    is able to do it then he should do so, otherwise he should divorce her and \n    let her go in a good manner, if she cannot be patient during her husband\u2019s \n    illness.\u00a0\n\n    In the answer to \n    question no. 11359 we have \n    described how to protect oneself against the evil eye and to remedy the \n    matter.\u00a0\n\n    We think that it \n    is best to refer your case to an Islamic judge (qaadi), because he will be \n    able to establish the facts of your husband\u2019s case and seek medical reports, \n    after which he will be able to issue a verdict on matters of divorce and \n    rights.\u00a0\n\n    We advise you to \n    be patient in putting up with the situation in which you find yourself and \n    to support your husband during his illness and do your part to seek a remedy \n    for it, whether that is with doctors or psychologists, or with trustworthy \n    shaykhs, so that you can find out the cause of his problem, as he may indeed \n    have been affected by the evil eye.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allah to \n    set your affairs straight.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that the one who commits suicide will be punished with something like that with which he killed himself.\u00a0\nSee the answer to question no. 70363\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThere are known signs of puberty for both males and females. The male reaches puberty when one of three things happens: emission of maniy (semen), growth of pubic hair or reaching the age of fifteen years according to the Hijri calendar, which is a few months before reaching the age of fifteen according to the Gregorian calendar.\u00a0\nIn females, puberty is reached when these three signs occur; in addition to that there is a fourth sign, namely menstruation.\u00a0\nIt is not stipulated that all of these signs should appear; rather when one of them appears that is sufficient to rule that the individual has reached puberty.\u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 70425 and 78591 \u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nAccountability is waived for the child who has not yet reached puberty, until he reaches that stage, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood (4403) and at-Tirmidhi (1423) from \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe Pen has been lifted from three: from the sleeper until he awakens, from the child until he reaches puberty and from the insane person until he comes to his senses.\u201d\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa\u2019 al-Ghaleel, 2/4, no. 297\u00a0\nIn al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah (8/196) it says:\u00a0\nA person becomes accountable for fulfilling obligatory duties and refraining from haraam actions when he or she reaches puberty; one who has not reached puberty is not accountable \u2026 and (one who has not reached puberty) is not subject to qisaas (retaliatory punishments) and hadd punishments, such as those for stealing and slander.

If she refuses to make herself \n\tavailable or her guardians prevent her from doing so, then she is not \n\tentitled to maintenance, even if they stay together for a while. The Prophet \n\t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) married \u2018Aa\u2019ishah and consummated \n\tthe marriage with her after two years, and he did not spend on her \n\tmaintenance until after he had consummated the marriage, and was not obliged \n\tto spend on her for the time that had passed, because maintenance becomes \n\tobligatory in return for the wife making herself available as is his right \n\taccording to the marriage contract; if this condition is met she is entitled \n\tto it and if it is not met then she is not entitled to anything.\u00a0\nIf she has \n\tmade herself available in an incomplete manner, by saying: I submit myself \n\tto you in my house and nowhere else, or in such and such a place and nowhere \n\telse, then she is not entitled to anything, unless she stipulated that in \n\tthe marriage contract, because she has not made herself fully available as \n\trequired by the marriage contract, so she is not entitled to maintenance. \n\tEnd quote.\u00a0\nThis right \n\tis confirmed in your case, because you told them about that and they \n\tagreed.\u00a0\nWhat the \n\twife is required to do is to obey her husband and travel with him, and \n\tsettle with him in the country where his livelihood is, so long as she can \n\tlive a decent life there.\u00a0\nShe has to \n\ttry hard to be patient and adjust to the new environment in which she is \n\tliving; she can make friends with Muslim sisters and join them in doing acts \n\tof worship and other good deeds, such as memorising Qur\u2019an, visiting one \n\tanother, and so on.\u00a0\nShe should \n\talways remember the great rights that her husband has over her and that she \n\tis obliged to obey him and do what he tells her to do, and she should love \n\tto accompany him and be content to live with him whatever the circumstances. \n\tIn this manner, Muslim households will be established on a foundation of \n\tlove and harmony, and the kind treatment that is expected in Islam, which \n\twill achieve the purposes of marriage.\u00a0\nIt should be \n\tnoted that these negative feelings are temporary and will disappear, if \n\tAllah wills, if she is patient, puts up with it and seeks the help of Allah, \n\tmay He be exalted, as has happened to many other women.\u00a0\nThe husband \n\thas to understand that this complaint is not something felt by his wife \n\tonly; rather many women make the same complaint because of feeling isolated \n\tand lonely. The husband has to deal with the matter in a wise and careful \n\tmanner, and do all that he can to help her to overcome this problem. He \n\tshould give her as much of his time as he can and not come back home late \n\tafter finishing work, or go out after finishing work, except for urgent \n\treasons. If he can take his wife with him he should do so, and he should \n\thelp her to find female friends who will help her cope with the pain of \n\tloneliness and feeling isolated. He should asked for help from wise people \n\tamong her family who can advise and guide her, and encourage her to live in \n\tSaudi so that she can do Hajj and \u2018Umrah and pray in the Haram and so on.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah \n\tto bring you together in a good way.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

When we see that love and compassion between the spouses in \n    particular, we are very happy about it, because that love and compassion \n    will have a good effect on the family members. One of the greatest signs of \n    Allah is that He created woman from man and it is a sign of His wisdom that \n    He created woman to be a course of comfort and tranquillity for the man. \n    Allah, may He be exalted, mentioned that with regard to Adam and Hawwa\u2019, and \n    all people in general, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cIt is He Who has created you from a single person (Adam), \n    and (then) He has created from him his wife (Hawwa (Eve)), in order that he \n    might enjoy the pleasure of living with her\u201d\n\n    [al-A\u2018raaf 7:189].\n\n    This has to do with Adam and Eve.

That is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \n\n    \u201cAnd among His Signs is this, that He created for you \n    wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has \n    put between you affection and mercy.\u201d\n\n    [ar-Room 30:21].\u00a0\n\n    Adwa\u2019 al-Bayaan, 2/304, 305\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    There is no love between any two souls greater than that that \n    exists between the spouses.\u00a0\n\n    Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/525\u00a0\n\n    But we do not mean that the love should be \u201cmad\u201d or \u201ccrazy\u201d \n    as people say. Rather it should be moderate and appropriate. Zayd ibn Aslam \n    narrated that his father said: \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab said to me: O Aslam, do \n    not let your love (for anyone) be obsessive and do not let your hatred (of \n    anyone) be destructive.\u00a0\n\n    I said: How is that?\u00a0\n\n    He said: When you love, do not go to a level of obsession as \n    a child does with the thing he loves, and when you hate, do not hate in such \n    a way that you want your opponent to be destroyed and doomed.\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by \u2018Abd ar-Razzaaq in al-Musannaf, 20269; its \n    isnaad is saheeh.\u00a0\n\n    The Rightly-Guided Caliph (\u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab) gave this \n    advice because obsessiveness in love (loving madly) has negative effects on \n    the one who loves and the one who is loved. Its effects on the one who loves \n    are:\u00a0\n\n    (a)His thoughts are focused on his \n    beloved, which causes him anxiety and tension, and this distraction causes \n    him to waste time and leads to mental and physical illness\n\n    (b)Another of the effects of \n    loving madly is that it makes the one who loves turn a blind eye to any \n    shortcomings in his beloved\u2019s performance of duties and to his committing \n    any haraam actions. And if his beloved asks him to join him in his actions, \n    then his insane love will lead him to do so.\n\n    (c)Another of the negative effects \n    of this love is that it dominates his heart in such a way that there is no \n    room for love of Allah and His Messenger, which is the means of his \n    salvation, let alone love for anyone else such as family and children\n\n    (d)Another of the negative effects \n    is that the one who is madly in love cannot cope with the absence or illness \n    of his beloved, let alone his death!\n\n    The negative effects of insane love on the one who is loved \n    include the following:\u00a0\n\n    (a)He may suffer tension because \n    of the lover\u2019s insistence on seeing him and sitting with him, which may lead \n    to his neglecting his work or falling short in tasks on which he should \n    focus his mind and heart, such as seeking beneficial knowledge and doing \n    righteous deeds.\n\n    (b)Another of the negative effects \n    it may have on him is that he will never find this lover offering him \n    sincere advice; rather he will turn a blind eye to his mistakes and \n    shortcomings. As it is said, your love of a thing makes you blind and deaf!\n\n    (c)Another of its negative effects \n    is that if he responds to the one who loves him, he will waste his time with \n    him, and if he does not, he will cause him anxiety, which may lead him to \n    hate him in the end. \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n    said:\u00a0\n\n    If a man\u2019s heart is attached to a woman, even if she is \n    permissible for him, he will remain captive to her and she will be able to \n    control him as she wishes. Outwardly he will appear to be her master because \n    he is her husband, but in reality he is her captive and slave, especially if \n    she realises his need for her and his love for her, and that he cannot find \n    any alternative to her. In that case she will have control over him like an \n    unjust, domineering master over his weak slave who cannot free himself from \n    him, or even worse! Because captivity of the heart is worse than physical \n    captivity and enslavement of the heart is worse than enslavement of the \n    body. The one whose body is enslaved will not care if his heart is free and \n    at peace; rather he may be able to find away to freedom. But if the heart \n    that is in control of the body is that is enslaved and infatuated with \n    something other than Allah, then this is true humiliation, the worst kind of \n    captivity and enslavement to that which enslaved the heart. \u2026 True freedom \n    is freedom of the heart and true enslavement is enslavement of the heart, \n    just as true richness is richness of the soul. The Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cRichness is not having a great deal of \n    accumulated wealth; rather richness is richness of the soul.\u201d This applies \n    if what has captured his heart is something permissible; as for the one \n    whose heart is enslaved by something haraam, such as a woman or boy, this is \n    pain and suffering from which there is no way out, and these are the people \n    whose suffering will be the worst and their reward will be the least, for if \n    a person\u2019s heart is devoted to something and remains attached and enslaved \n    to it, then this will cause him all kinds of evil and corruption that cannot \n    be enumerated except by the Lord of mankind, even if he manages to avoid \n    committing the greater act of immorality.\n\n    End quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa, 10/185-186\u00a0\n\n    We are very happy to hear of your honouring your husband and \n    of your love for him, but we would be even happier if you made your love for \n    him reasonable. You should understand that bothering your husband, always \n    calling him, or insisting that he stay at home or not undertake a particular \n    trip will all cause him stress and make it difficult for him to get on with \n    different tasks in life.\u00a0 We want there to be in your house a healthy \n    atmosphere of love that could help the family and future children, in sha \n    Allah, to achieve high goals and to strive to support His religion and be a \n    help to His righteous slaves.\u00a0\n\n    What we also advise you to do is:\u00a0\n\n    (a)Fulfil the religious duties \n    that are required of you and do naafil acts of worship too.\n\n    (b)Regularly recite the adhkaar of \n    the morning and the evening\n\n    (c)Seek knowledge by reading or \n    listening\n\n    (d)Call women among your \n    neighbours and relatives to Allah\n\n    (e)Try to have shar\u2018i love in your \n    heart towards Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) by following the commands, heeding the prohibitions, loving the \n    religion of Allah, defending it and spreading it among people, and having \n    natural love towards your parents and children.\n\n    All of that will give a meaning to your life that is more \n    sublime than devoting your life only to your husband and loving him only.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to help you to do that which \n    He loves and which pleases Him, and to make the love and compassion between \n    you lasting and to bless you with righteous offspring,\u00a0\n\n    And Allah is the source of strength."

        "question": "Dealing with the fitnah (temptation) of women",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah has created man in a world of trials and tests, and He has made Paradise the abode of His friends and beloved ones, who preferred His pleasure over their own and preferred obedience to Him over their physical comfort. And He has made Hell the abode of those among His slaves who disobey Him and preferred their own whims and desires to the pleasure of their Lord. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSuch is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our slaves who have been Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)\u201d\n[Maryam 19:63]\n\u201cBut as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts.\nVerily, Paradise will be his abode\u201d\n[al-Naaz\u2019i\u2019aat 79:40-41]\nAnd He says concerning the people of Hell (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salaat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell\u201d\n[Maryam 19:59]\n\u00a0And He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThat shall be their recompense, Hell; because they disbelieved and took My Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and My Messengers by way of jest and mockery\u201d\n[al-Kahf 18:106]\u00a0\n\u201cThen for him who transgressed all bounds, (in disbelief, oppression and evil deeds of disobedience to Allah).\nAnd preferred the life of this world (by following his evil desires and lusts),\nVerily, his abode will be Hell-fire\u201d\n[al-Naazi\u2019aat 79:37-39]\nSo the Muslim must strive to worship Allah and keep away from that which angers Allah, for Allah will not cause the reward the one who does good to be lost:\u00a0\n\u201cAs for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our paths (i.e. Allah\u2019s religion \u2014 Islamic Monotheism). And verily, Allah is with the Muhsinoon (good-doers)\u201d\n[al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:69 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\nOne of the fitnahs (temptations) with which we are tested is the fitnah of women, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI have not left behind me any fitnah (temptation) more harmful to men than women.\u201d There follow some of the methods by which we can avoid this temptation. We ask Allah to set the affairs of the Muslims straight.\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Faith in Allah.\nFaith in Allah and fear of Allah provide a safety valve and protect a person against committing haraam actions and following his own whims and desires.\u00a0\nIf the believer becomes aware that Allah is always watching and if he ponders the meanings of His names and attributes, such as the All-Knowing, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the Watchful, the Reckoner, the Preserver, the All-Encompassing, that will generate fear of Him in secret and in public, and will put a stop to disobedience towards Allah, and will reduce the strength of desire that leads many people to commit haraam actions. \u00a0\n2 \u2013 Lowering the gaze and avoiding looking at haraam things\nThe gaze can generate bad thoughts in the heart, which then lead to ideas and then to desires, then to will and resolve, and then inevitably to doing haraam things. Think about the meaning of this verse which makes a connection between the first steps towards haraam and the end result. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cTell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what they do\u201d\n[al-Noor 24:30]\nIbn Katheer said: \u201cThis is a command from Allah to His believing slaves, to lower their gaze and avoid looking at that which is forbidden to them so that they only look at that which they are permitted to look at.\u00a0 If it so happens that a person\u2019s gaze accidentally falls upon something haraam, he should turn his gaze away from it quickly.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Warding off evil thoughts\nBad thoughts pose a danger to the heart\u2026 If a person dwells on them and does not push them away, they will develop into an idea, then into will and resolve, then this will inevitably lead to haraam actions.\u00a0 Beware of dwelling on passing thoughts; rather what you must do is to ward them off and crowd them out with good thoughts.\u00a0\nThe treatment, then, is to ward off these passing thoughts and keep yourself busy with beneficial thoughts.\u00a0\n4 \u2013 Marriage\nIt was narrated that \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Mas\u2019ood said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cO young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, and whoever cannot, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5065.\u00a0\n5 \u2013 Fasting for those who cannot afford to get married\n\u2013 because of the hadeeth quoted above, in which it says, \u201c\u2026and whoever cannot, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5065.\u00a0\nAl-Qurtubi said:\u00a0\nThe less a person eats, the weaker his desire becomes, and the weaker his desire is, the less sins he commits.\u00a0\n6 \u2013 Keeping away from bad companions.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cA man will follow the way of his close friends, so let each one of you look at who he takes as a close friend.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood, 8433; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 4046.\u00a0\n7 \u2013 Keeping away from places of temptation.\nIt is obvious that we are living in a society that is filled with temptation \u2013 media of all types, magazines, flirting in the marketplaces, satellite TV, the internet, etc\u2026 So you have to flee from all of these in order to keep your religious commitment sound.\u00a0\n8 \u2013 Do not make your houses graves.\nMake your house a reminder of obedience, not of sin. If a room is connected to sin for example, that will make a person commit sin repeatedly, because every time he enters that room he will remember the sin and may be provoked to commit the sin again. So he should make his room and his house a reminder of obedience to Allah, so when he enters he sees the Mus-haf which he reads, and he remembers praying qiyaam al-layl for Allah, and the regular Sunnah prayers that he offers in this room. Doing a lot of acts of worship in your house will make a connection in your mind between the house and doing good deeds, so you will do more and will think less of sin, and the calls of desire will grow less.\u00a0\n9 \u2013 Trying to make the most of your time in worshipping and obeying Allah.\u00a0\nTime is one of the great blessings that Allah has bestowed upon His slaves, but there are many who are not making the most of it. It was narrated that Ibn \u2018Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cTwo blessings which many people do not make the most of: good health and spare time.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6412.\u00a0\nSee also question no. 3234.\u00a0\n10 \u2013 Remembering the blessings of the Hereafter.\u00a0\nParticularly appropriate in this context is remembering al-hoor al-\u2018iyn and their attributes, whom Allah has prepared for those who are patient and steadfast in avoiding sin. This can help the Muslim to look away from\u00a0these transient haraam pleasures which only lead to regret and loss.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to help us to avoid temptation, both obvious and hidden. Praise be to Allah the Lord of the Worlds."

        "question": "Should she tell her husband about her previous relationships?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Your friend made a mistake by telling the one who came to propose marriage to you about your previous relationship from which you have repented. What she did is not good and is not in accordance with sharee\u2019ah, nor is it wise.\u00a0 The Muslim is enjoined to conceal his brother\u2019s faults if he sees him committing sin in secret, so how about a sin from which the person has repented?!\u00a0\nWhat she did is not naseehah (sincerity or sincere advice) which is enjoined by sharee\u2019ah on the one who is asked about a person with a view to marriage because that has to do with what he knows of the characteristics that are present at the time of asking, and it is not permissible for anyone to mention a bad past from which the person has repented.\u00a0\nWhat we understand from your words is that your friend told your husband\u00a0 of your previous relationship before he proposed to you. This indicates that he has forgiven you for that because he knows that you have repented and become righteous.\u00a0\nHe did right by doing so, for there is no one who does not make some mistakes, but if he repents from them, he cannot be blamed or punished. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin at all.\u201d Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4250; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.\u00a0\nWhat you should do is avoid bringing this subject up with your husband, but if he brings it up you should tell him that it was a passing relationship and one of the tricks of the Shaytaan, but you regret it, and Allaah has guided you and enabled you to repent.\u00a0\nDo not worry about this past so long as you have indeed repented and become righteous. Ask Allaah for strength and guidance and to accept your repentance. \u00a0\n\u201cAnd verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)\u201d\n[Ta-Ha 20:82]\nThe Messenger of Allaah says: \u201cEvery son of Adam is prone to err, and the best of those who err are those who repent.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2499; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to bless you and bring you both together in goodness. \u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Source of Strength."

        "question": "She feels attracted to someone other than her husband",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Allaah has caused men to be attracted to women, and women to \n    be attracted to men, and this inclination sometimes results in haraam \n    relationships such as zina, and sometimes it results in permissible \n    relationships such as marriage. Allaah has made the wife a covering for her \n    husband and has made the husband a covering for his wife. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThey are Libaas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan \n    (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living \n    with them)] for you and you are the same for them\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:187]\n\n    One of the blessings that Allaah bestows upon some spouses is \n    that He creates love and compassion between them, and helps each of them to \n    do that which causes harmony to grow in the family and ward off disputes and \n    arguments. This is a very great blessing indeed, which is not appreciated by \n    anyone but those whose family relationships are disrupted and disputes and \n    arguments arise amongst them, which turn the marital relationship into an \n    unbearable hell. If that happens, each spouse starts to dream of a stable \n    family life, and the man wishes for a wife with whom he can live in peace, \n    and the wife wishes for a man with whom she can live in peace.\u00a0\n\n    From your question, it may be understood that Allaah has \n    bestowed all these blessings upon you, so what you should do is be grateful \n    to Allaah for this great blessing and strive to preserve it and the family \n    with which Allaah has blessed you, for millions of women wish that they \n    could be in the good situation in which you are, but you do not appreciate \n    its value.\u00a0\n\n    You should note that it is not permissible for a woman to \n    form a relationship with a non-mahram man. If she is married, then such a \n    relationship is even more haraam, because it is a transgression against the \n    husband\u2019s rights and honour.\u00a0\n\n    Based on this, it is not permissible for you and this evil \n    lover to pray istikhaarah, because istikhaarah is only prescribed in cases \n    where it is not clear if the matter is good or bad, and the Muslim does not \n    know where his interests lie, so he prays istikhaarah asking that Allaah \n    will help him to attain that which is good if it is good, or divert it from \n    him if it is bad. But if a Muslim prays istikhaarah with regard to \n    disobeying Allaah or going against His commands, this is a sin for which he \n    has to repent to Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    To explain further: if a Muslim woman prays istikhaarah about \n    marrying someone other than her husband when she is still married to her \n    husband, then in fact she is praying istikhaarah about wrecking her home and \n    family, and praying istikhaarah about hurting her children, and praying \n    istikhaarah about divorcing a husband who is treating her well and taking \n    good care of her. So she is praying istikhaarah about betraying him and \n    stabbing him in the back by tearing apart his family, so that his home and \n    hers will be destroyed at her hands. She is praying istikhaarah about \n    responding to great kindness and good treatment with a great wrong and \n    denying the rights of one who has treated her well.\u00a0\n\n    All of these factors and many others apply to the istikhaarah \n    prayer that you offered.\u00a0\n\n    As for the positive result that you say your friend got, \n    undoubtedly this is a case of the shaytaan making following one's whims and \n    desires appear attractive. The Muslim should not pray istikhaarah about \n    doing something that is haraam, so how can he pray istikhaarah and claim \n    that he got a positive result?!\u00a0\n\n    Moreover, after praying istikhaarah the Muslim should resolve \n    firmly either to do it or not to do it. Whatever Allaah makes easy for him \n    is what is good, but if he waits until he feels good about it or sees a \n    dream and the like, these are usually illusionary matters on which no shar\u2019i \n    ruling can be based.\u00a0\n\n    Based on the above, you should push away all whispers from \n    the shaytaan that have to do with this matter, and do not give evil any way \n    of reaching you or your family or children. You should realize that you have \n    fallen into a trap of the shaytaan, because he has made you attractive to \n    this young man and has made him attractive to you so that he may achieve \n    what is his greatest dream, namely the destruction of a stable, believing \n    Muslim family and the divorce of two spouses who love one another, and the \n    neglect of their children.\u00a0\n\n    Thwart the plans of the shaytaan by not letting this young \n    man destroy your life and your family. Cut off all means that may enable him \n    to continue to have any place in your life.\u00a0\n\n    One of the ways in which you can ward off these devilish \n    whispers is to ask yourself the following questions and answer them \n    honestly:\u00a0\n\n    1.If this young man is righteous, \n    then how can he accept to destroy the home of his Muslim brother and split \n    up his family? \n\n    2.If this person really loves \n    you, why is he striving to wreck your home and destroy your family? Does he \n    love you or does he love himself and is only looking out for his own \n    interests and desires?\n\n    3.If this young man were to get \n    what he wants and you were to get divorced from your husband \u2013 Allaah forbid \n    \u2013 what would be the fate of your children who are a trust about which Allaah \n    will question you on the Day of Resurrection?\n\n    4.What guarantee do you have that \n    this young man will treat you as nicely after marriage as he does now? It \n    should be noted that many marriages that are based on \u201clove\u201d are doomed to \n    failure after only a few months, because they are based on a weak \n    foundation, not on a foundation of pleasing Allaah and His Messenger  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\n\n    5.Do you expect that trust will \n    last between you after you get married? If he loves you although you are \n    married, then how can you be sure that he will not fall in love with someone \n    else who is also married or not married? How can he trust you if you \n    destroyed your home for his sake? This pattern may be repeated when you are \n    married to him. These doubts will persist and will be a cause of anxiety for \n    both of you. You have both accepted something haraam and you have not \n    refrained from establishing a haraam relationship even though there is a \n    legitimate marriage contract between you and your husband, so who can \n    guarantee that it will not happen again?\n\n    With regard to your request for a du\u2019aa\u2019, I ask Allaah, the Most High, the Almighty, by His grace and favour, to make goodness easy for you and to ward off all evil from you, and to continue to bless you and your family with stability and love, and to keep you and your husband and children safe, and to ward off from you the whispers of the shaytaan and his making falsehood attractive.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Is It Haram to Think Sexually?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is it haram to have sexual fantasies?\nSexual fantasies are among the thoughts that cross a person\u2019s mind because it is something that is stored in the subconscious which is affected by the environment in which he lives and the scenes that he sees. These are thoughts that occur to most people, especially the youth, but they vary from one person to another with regard to their type, strength and effect.\u00a0\nIslamic shari\u2019ah is the shari\u2019ah of the fitrah (natural state of man) and it is in harmony with human nature, and it takes into account the psychological fluctuation that Allah has made a part of the human make-up. So it does not go beyond human limitations or impose impossible burdens.\u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAllah burdens not a person beyond his scope.\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:286]\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\u00a0 \u201cAllah has forgiven my ummah for whatever crosses their mind so long as they do not speak of it or act upon it.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhari (2528) and Muslim (127)\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said commenting on this hadith:\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever crosses a person\u2019s mind, so long as he does not dwell on it or continue to think of it, he is forgiven for it, according to scholarly consensus, because it does not happen voluntarily and he has no way of avoiding it.\u201d (Al-Adhkar, p. 345)\u00a0\nPassing fancies come under the heading of that which crosses a person\u2019s mind, which is forgiven according to the hadith quoted above. So if a person imagines haram things that came to his mind unbidden, there is no blame or sin on him, rather he has to ward them off as much as he can.\n\u00a0How does Islam view haram sexual fantasies?\u00a0\nIf a person dwells on haram thoughts and calls them to mind, then the jurists differed as to how to view this situation \u2013 is it covered by that forgiveness or does it come under the heading of thinking and resolving to do something haram) for which a person may be called to account?\u00a0\nThis issue was discussed by the jurists in the following manner:\u00a0\nIf a man is having intercourse with his wife and is thinking of the charms of another woman, so that he imagines he is having intercourse with her, are those thoughts and fantasies haram? The jurists differed concerning that.\u00a0\n\nThe first view is that it is haram, and that the one who deliberately brings haram images to mind whilst having intercourse with his wife is sinning.\u00a0\n\nIbn \u2018Abidin al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cThe view that is closest to the spirit of our madhhab is that it is not permissible, because imagining that woman as if he is having intercourse with her is imagining oneself committing a sin with a woman who is not permissible for him.\u201d (Hashiyat Radd al-Muhtar, 6/272)\u00a0\nImam Muhammad al-\u2018Abdari, who is known Ibn al-Haj al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him), said:\u00a0\n\u201cA man should refrain from thinking such thoughts and tell others to avoid this behaviour too, i.e., this obnoxious characteristic that has unfortunately become very common, which is when a man sees a woman whom he likes, he goes to his wife and has intercourse with her, and starts to imagine that woman whom he has seen.\u00a0\nThis is a kind of zina (adultery) because of what our scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have said about the one who takes a tankard and drinks water from it, but he imagines that it is alcohol that he is drinking \u2013 so that water becomes haram for him.\u00a0\nWhat we have mentioned does not apply only to men, rather it also includes women, and it applies even more so to them, because what is common nowadays is that they go out or look out from windows, and if they see someone whom they like, they start thinking about him, then when they have intercourse with their husbands they bring that image that they have seen to mind, so each of them may be committing zina in some sense \u2013 we ask Allah to keep us safe from that.\u00a0\nHe should not only avoid that himself, he should also draw his family\u2019s and other people\u2019s attention to it, and tell them that this is haram and is not permitted.\u201d (Al-Madkhil (2/194, 195)\u00a0\nIbn Muflih al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\u201cIbn \u2018Aqil stated in al-Ri\u2019ayah al-Kubra that if a man imagines the image of another woman who is forbidden to him whilst having intercourse with his wife, he is sinning, but a passing thought that he cannot prevent does not constitute a sin.\u201d (Al-Adab al-Shar\u2019iyyah (1/98)\u00a0\nThe evidence for this opinion is the view favoured by a number of scholars, that if thoughts that cross the mind become entrenched and may turn into something that one resolves to do, then they come under the heading of things for which one is accountable, and that haram fantasies that a person deliberately calls to mind are not covered by forgiveness, because they have been thought of deliberately and the person will be called to account for that.\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cThe reason why passing thoughts are forgiven is what we have mentioned above, that they cannot be avoided. But it is possible to avoid dwelling on them. Hence dwelling on them is haram.\u201d (Al-Adhkar (345)\u00a0\n\nThe second view is that it is permissible, and that there is no sin on the one who does that. This is the view of a number of later Shafi'i scholars, such as al-Subki and al-Suyuti.\u00a0\n\nThey said: That is because there is no resolve or determination to sin in fantasies. He may imagine that he is having intercourse with that woman, but there is no resolve in his heart or any plan to do that, rather he may refuse if given the opportunity to do it.\u00a0\nIt says in Tuhfat al-Muhtaj fi Sharh al-Minhaj (7/205, 206) \u2013 which is a Shafi'i book:\u00a0\n\u201cBecause when he thinks of that or imagines it, it does not occur to him to actually commit zina or do any of the things that lead to it, let alone resolve to do it. All that is happening to him is that he imagines something reprehensible as something good.\u201d (See: al-Fatawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra, 4/87)\u00a0\nIt seems that the correct view is the view that such fantasies are makruh, even if we do not say that they are haram. That is for the following reasons:\u00a0\n\nMany psychologists regard sexual fantasies as a psychological disorder if they dominate a person\u2019s thinking to such an extent that he cannot enjoy any pleasure except through these fantasies, and that may lead to abnormal sexual fantasies.\nIslamic shari\u2019ah teaches the principle of sadd al-dharai\u2019 or blocking the means that may lead to haram things and closing every door that may lead to evil. It is to be expected that sexual fantasies may lead to a person committing haram deeds. A person who frequently imagines something and wishes for it will inevitably develop the motive to do it and will try to do it a great deal. So he starts by looking at haram images, and his eyes become accustomed to looking at haram things, then he will try to fulfil his fantasies.\nMost of these fantasies come to people\u2019s mind by haram means in people\u2019s minds, such as permissive satellite channels and by watching scenes of decadent societies from kafir lands all over the world, where there is no modesty and watching sex scenes is becoming a daily habit, as is obvious to anyone who lives or works in those countries.\nFinally, such fantasies may lead to spouses losing interest in one another, so the wife is no longer attractive to her husband, and vice versa, which leads to marital problems, and then sufferings and problems start.\n\nHow to avoid sexual fantasies\u00a0\nFor all of these reasons, our advice to everyone who is tested with such fantasies is to hasten to put a stop to them and rid himself of them. The following means may be of help:\u00a0\n\nCompletely avoiding everything that may provoke such fantasies, such as haram movies and TV shows which are shown on satellite TV, as well as avoiding reading stories that generate such fantasies. Al-Ghazali said in Ihya \u2018Ulum al-Din (1/162):\u00a0\n\nThe way to ward off distracting thoughts is to cut off their source, i.e. avoid the means that could create these thoughts; if the source of such thoughts is not stopped, it will keep generating them.\u201d\n\nRegularly reciting the adhkar that are prescribed in shari\u2019ah, especially that which is said before having intercourse: \u201cAllahumma jannibna al-shaytana wa jannib al-shaytana ma razaqtana (O Allah, keep the Shaytan away from us and keep the Shaytan away from that with which You bless us).\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari (141)and Muslim (1434).\u00a0\nFocusing on the present enjoyment instead of that which is absent. In both spouses there is that which will keep the other from thinking of haram things. If each spouse focuses on the attractions of the other, they will not be distracted by fantasies of other things.\u00a0\nImagine if your husband had fantasies like you do, would you accept that? Wouldn\u2019t that make you feel unhappy? How can you accept to make your husband feel like that? Try to use this thought to get rid of what you are feeling.\u00a0\nConsult psychologists. There is nothing wrong with going to a female psychologist or female doctor and asking her for advice; you may find something to help you in sha Allah.\u00a0\n\nI ask Allah to guide and bless you and your husband.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    A person may not know the real reason for which Allah tests \n    him in this world until the Day of Resurrection, when he will discover the \n    high status that Allah, may He be exalted, has prepared for him in Paradise \n    if he is patient and seeks reward. At that time he will realise that Allah, \n    may He be exalted, tried and tested him by His grace and in His wisdom.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated from Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) \n    that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cOn the Day of Resurrection, those who were hale and hearty will wish that \n    their skin had been cut with scissors, when they see the reward of those who \n    were put to trial.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by at-Tirmidhi, 2402; classed as hasan by al-Albaani \n    in as-Silsilah al-Hadeethah, 2206\u00a0\n\n    It seems that you have, praise be to Allah, overcome that \n    situation and its psychological effects; in fact I hope that you have \n    emerged psychologically stronger, with higher morale and a purer spirit, for \n    in every trial there is a blessing and after every calamity comes well \n    being. No one should regret what has passed and dwell on the past that will \n    never come back; rather he should learn a lesson from it for today and be \n    optimistic about his future.\u00a0\n\n    In your story there is a lesson for parents who are \n    responsible for their children before Allah, may He be exalted, that they \n    should not send them to places of danger on the grounds of thinking well of \n    relatives. The unfortunate reality compels us to say that many cases of \n    molestation come from relatives. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.\u00a0\n\n    This is not a call to sever ties of kinship and cause \n    division among people; rather it is a call to be always careful and take \n    precautions as dictated by the situation. Parents have to take proper \n    precautions without going to extremes or being negligent. Islam has given us \n    an important principle in this regard, which is the principle of blocking \n    the means (that may lead to evil). In fact Islam teaches us to take \n    precautions even among siblings in the same house. That was when the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to separate \n    children in their beds, as was narrated by Abu Dawood (495) and classed as \n    saheeh by al-Albaani.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Munaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: i.e., separate \n    your children in their beds in which they sleep when they reach the age of \n    ten years, so as to avoid temptations, even if they are his siblings.\n\n    End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer, 5/531]\u00a0\n\n    At-Teebi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Telling them to \n    pray and separating them in their beds are mentioned together in childhood \n    for the purpose of discipline and adhering to all the commands of Allah\u2026 And \n    for the purpose of teaching them good manners among people, and so that they \n    will not find themselves in suspicious circumstances, and so that they may \n    avoid all things that Allah has prohibited.\n\n    End quote from Sharh Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh, 2/155\u00a0\n\n    In your story there is also a lesson for parents that they \n    should check on their children\u2019s situations and make the children get used \n    to talking frankly about every issue they face, whether it is in school, in \n    the street or in the home. Many children encounter problems and suffer \n    mental illness as a result, and the parents are completely unaware of that, \n    when they could have relieved their children of what was affecting them. But \n    lack of frankness within the family leads to embarrassment in the children \n    that prevents them from complaining to their parents.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to what you mentioned about the young man who has \n    proposed marriage to you, and your speaking frankly to him and telling him \n    what happened to you when you were small, and his accepting it and not \n    objecting \u2013 that is a blessing from Allah to you. Allah has brought you \n    someone who will excuse you for what happened to you when you were small and \n    will conceal a matter in which you were mistreated, and he wants to marry \n    you you in the manner prescribed by Allah. May Allah reward him with good.\u00a0\n\n    But you made a mistake when you continued to talk to one \n    another before the shar\u2018i connection between you was made (i.e., marriage). \n    You could have done the Islamic marriage contract and delayed consummation \n    of the marriage until he graduates or finds work. But if the matter is \n    allowed to remain as it is now, that is undoubtedly haraam, because there is \n    no legitimate shar\u2018i relationship between you. Rather all it is at present \n    is wishes and promises of marriage.\u00a0\n\n    What you have to do is adhere to the Islamic ruling; it is \n    not permissible for you to continue talking to one another until the shar\u2018i \n    marriage contract has been done. If he is sincere in his promise to marry \n    you, then he will respond to the ruling of Allah and will hasten to do the \n    marriage contract, or he will cut off contact until he graduates. If he does \n    not respond to the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted, then be very careful \n    in that case, for his aim may be only to have fun and pass the time talking \n    to girls, in which case he is using the promise of marriage as a means to \n    get what he wants, especially if he knows the situation; this may be an \n    opportunity for the Shaytaan to whisper to him and cause trouble.\u00a0\n\n    You do not have to tell any suitor of what happened to you, \n    and it does not matter if the hymen has been broken, because the hymen may \n    be broken by jumping or by heavy menstrual bleeding.\u00a0\n\n    We have previously published on our website several answers \n    having to do with the ruling on talking and chatting between the sexes, such \n    as the answers to questions no. \n    7492, 13791,\n    26890,\n    45668,\n    66266,\n    82702\n\n    We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to protect you, guide you \n    and bless you with contentment and happiness.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "His wife is weak in religious commitment \u2013 what should he do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The problem that you describe is one that is faced by many young men who thought that their wives could learn and make da\u2019wah, and that they would strive hard in worship and help their husbands to be religiously-committed, no matter how much the husband fell short in that. But in fact the wife cannot be influenced by anybody as much as her husband. So if the husband does not set a good example, the wife\u2019s commitment will soon become weak. This is what usually happens. This does not mean that there are not good situations in which the woman is the example who leads her husband along the path of guidance.\u00a0\nThe fact that you have found out that your wife is an ordinary girl does not mean that you have failed, and it should not be a cause of regret. Rather that should be a motive for you to seek the reward for calling her to guidance.\u00a0\nWhat you have mentioned of her good qualities will help you to achieve that, in sha Allaah.\u00a0\nSo you should be the one who calls her, reminds her and advises her\u2026 fill her free time with beneficial things such as tapes, books and magazines.\u00a0 Do not give up on rebuking her if she gossips or watches TV, but do that in a gentle, compassionate and loving manner.\u00a0\nTry to make her join an organization for memorization of Qur\u2019aan, or get her to attend public lectures with you, or to form ties with some righteous families. These are the best ways in which you can help your wife to strengthen her faith.\u00a0\nPerhaps what you mention about her not worshipping much is related to your own shortcomings in that regard, or to your neglecting to get her to join in. Try to help her and remind her of the virtue of naafil prayers, the reward for praying qiyaam al-layl and fasting. Do as many of these acts of worship with her as you can.\u00a0\nBe the qawwaam (leader; protector and maintainer) of your wife, prevent her\u00a0 from doing haraam things or doubtful things. \u00a0\nAsk of Allaah, saying, \u201cOur Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqoon (the pious)\u201d [al-Furqaan 25:74 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]. \u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to set your affairs and the affairs of all the Muslims straight."

        "question": "His wife committed zina twice with a Christian man; should he divorce her? If she apostatises will there be any sin on him?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    If a woman persists an immoral action and does not repent \n    from it or give it up, even if the matter did not go as far as zina, such as \n    if she had a relationship with this Christian man or anyone else, then it is \n    not permissible for the husband to keep her, because that is a kind of \n    cuckoldry (diyaathah), and cuckoldry is a major sin, because of the report \n    narrated by al-Nasaa\u2019i (2562) from \u2018Abd-Allah ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be \n    pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \n    Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere are three at whom Allah, may He be glorified \n    and exalted, will not look on the Day of Resurrection: the one who is \n    defiant towards his parents, the woman who imitates men, and the cuckold.\u201d\n\n    Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa\u2019i.\u00a0\n\n    The cuckold is the one who approves of evil conduct in his \n    family.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) \n    was asked about the one who came into his house and found a stranger with \n    his wife, so he gave her her dues and divorced her by talaaq, then he went \n    back and reconciled with her and heard that she had been found with a \n    non-mahram man. \u00a0\n\n    He replied: In the hadeeth from the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) it says that when Allah, may He be glorified and \n    exalted, created Paradise, He said: \u201cBy My glory and majesty, no miser, liar \n    or cuckold will enter you.\u201d The cuckold is the one who has no protective \n    jealousy or pride. In al-Saheeh it is narrated that the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe believer has \n    protective jealousy (gheerah) and Allah has protective jealousy, and the \n    protective jealousy of Allah is that no slave should do that which is \n    forbidden to him.\u201d And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThe \n    adulterer \u2014 fornicator marries not but an adulteress \u2014 fornicatress or a \n    Mushrikah; and the adulteress \u2013fornicatress, none marries her except an \n    adulterer \u2014 fornicater or a Mushrik [and that means that the man who agrees \n    to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan \n    or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely, he is either an adulterer \u2014 \n    fornicator, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater). And the woman who \n    agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan \n    or idolater) or an adulterer \u2014 fornicator, then she is either a prostitute \n    or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress)]. Such a thing is \n    forbidden to the believers (of Isl\u00e2mic Monotheism)\u201d [al-Noor 24:3]. The \n    correct scholarly opinion is that it is not permissible to marry a zaaniyah \n    (a woman who commits fornication or adultery) until after she has repented. \n    The same applies if the wife commits zina: the husband has no right to keep \n    her in that case; rather he should leave her, otherwise he will be a cuckold \n    (duyooth). End quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa, 32/141\n\n    \u00a0Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    If the woman has repented, turned over a new leaf and is \n    living a righteous life, and she has cut off all ties to that non-mahram \n    man, then the husband may keep her, and perhaps Allah will reward him for \n    treating her kindly and concealing her sin.\u00a0\n\n    We have stated that it is not permissible for him to keep her \n    as his wife if she committed zina and has not repented from it sincerely, \n    and we stated that if she repents and turns over a new leaf, then he may \n    keep her and conceal her sin, if he has the patience to do that. What we \n    have said about it being permissible to keep her if she repents is not \n    obligatory for him, rather it is up to him. In all cases he may leave her, \n    because zina on the part of the wife is extremely abhorrent and most people \n    cannot forgive that. And if he divorces her, then he is not responsible for \n    what she commits of sin, and if she apostatises from Islam, she alone is \n    responsible for that, because she is accountable and of sound mind: if she \n    does good deeds that it is in her favour and if she does bad deeds then it \n    counts against her.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allah to protect the Muslims from all trials, evils \n    and turmoil.

        "question": "She advised him and he came to thank her, and they committed zina",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nPerhaps your letter will be a lesson to those who claim that a relationship between a man and a non-mahram woman can be \u201cinnocent\u201d, and to those who claim that such relationships are Islamically acceptable if they are for the purpose of giving advice, and to those who want to \u201cwater down\u201d the religion to allow relationships between men and women in the name of modernity, and claim that there is no reason why this should not be done, and that woman are able to control themselves\u2026 and other such foolish justifications.\u00a0\nIt is a lesson for all those who are heedless of the laws of Allaah and pay no attention to the warning of our Lord, may He blessed and exalted, against following in the footsteps of the shaytaan, and they continue to take these matters lightly until they find themselves in deep trouble. You were heedless with regard to this young man and you went ahead and spoke with him and advised him, then you agreed to receive him in your house, then you agreed to be alone with him, then the Shaytaan made attractive to you the idea that he was like your brother, then what? Then you committed zina in the same meeting and in your house, with one whom the shaytaan made you think was like your brother! Which was the first step of the shaytaan? It was speaking to this non-mahram man, then the other steps of the shaytaan came one after another until you committed this most abhorrent of sins. Hence we can see the wisdom in the words of Allaah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin), and an evil way (that leads one to hell unless Allaah Forgives him)\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:32]\nAllaah did not only forbid zina itself, rather He forbade coming near to it. The aim here is to forbid the things that lead to it. We ask Allaah to conceal your sin and to forgive you, and to help you to repent sincerely.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThere is no doubt that zina is a grave sin, and it is one of the major sins. Hence the punishment for it is one that points to the seriousness of this sin and the abhorrence with which it is regarded in sharee\u2019ah and by wisdom and common sense.\u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAllaah ordained punishment for zina that differs from the punishment for other crimes in three ways:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Execution in the most unpleasant form; when the punishment is reduced, it still combines the physical punishment of flogging with the emotional punishment of banishment.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 He forbade people when carrying out the punishment on the adulterers, to feel pity for them that would prevent them from carrying out the punishment. By His mercy towards them He prescribed this punishment, and He is more merciful to them than you, but His mercy did not prevent Him from ordaining this punishment, so your pity should not prevent you from carrying out His command\u2026\u00a0\n3 \u2013 He enjoined that their punishment be carried out in the presence of some of the believers; it should not be done in isolation where no one can see them. That is more effective in serving the purpose of the punishment, and serves as a deterrent.

Allaah warns the mushrikeen, murderers and adulterers of multiple punishments on the Day of Resurrection, and of eternal humiliation and torment, because of the seriousness and abhorrence of their crimes, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse \u2014 and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.\n69.\u00a0The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;\n70.\u00a0Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds\u201d\n[al-Furqaan 25:68-70]\nThe one who has fallen into such sin has to repent to Allaah sincerely, and follow that with sincere belief and righteous deeds. Repentance is sincere if the penitent gives up the sin, regrets what has happened in the past and resolves never to go back to it, out of fear of Allaah and awe of Him, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)\u201d\n[Ta-Ha 20:82]\nEvery Muslim man and Muslim woman must beware of this great evil and the things that lead to it, and hasten to repent from whatever is already past. Allaah will accept the repentance of those who are sincere and forgive them.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 9/442\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nIt is not permissible for two people who have committed zina to get married except after having repented sincerely, because Allaah has forbidden that to the believers:\u00a0\n\u201cThe adulterer \u2014 fornicator marries not but an adulteress \u2014 fornicatress or a Mushrikah; and the adulteress \u2013fornicatress, none marries her except an adulterer \u2014 fornicater or a Mushrik [and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely, he is either an adulterer \u2014 fornicator, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater). And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer \u2014 fornicator, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress)]. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism)\u201d\n[al-Noor 24:3]\nWe have already explained the ruling on this issue in the answer to questions no. 14381, 22448, 11195.\u00a0\nFifthly:\u00a0\nIf the soul has been breathed into the foetus, then aborting it would be another crime in addition to zina. We have explained the ruling on this issue in the answer to questions no. 13317, 11195 and 40269.\u00a0\nSixthly:\u00a0\nThe solution to your problem is to inform wise people among your family about your situation. The one who transgresses the laws of Allaah must inevitably face the consequences of his sin, in many cases. The family has to stand with their daughter sooner rather than later. Even if she aborts the foetus before the soul has been breathed into it, she is no longer regarded as a virgin, and this will also cause some problems at the time of marriage. Whatever the case, they have to solve their daughter\u2019s problem, for she has repented and regretted her sin, and \u201cthe one who repents from sin is like one who has not sinned at all\u201d \u2013 narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4250; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 3145. Even if she does not commit any sin after she repents, her sin has serious repercussions which must be dealt with before news of it becomes widespread and affects the family as a whole. The solution is not to marry her to that zaani before he repents, because marriage to a zaani is haraam, as stated above. But if they both repent, there is nothing wrong with them getting married in sha Allaah.\u00a0\nIt is not permissible for her to marry anyone else until her womb is emptied, which is when she gives birth. The evidence for that is the report narrated by Abu Sa\u2019eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: \u201cDo not have intercourse with a pregnant woman until she gives birth, or with one who is not pregnant until she has menstruated once.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2157. al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhees al-Habeer (1/171,172): Its isnaad is hasan.\u00a0\nIn order to understand the greatness of Allaah\u2019s bounty in accepting His slaves\u2019 repentance and to know that He accepts the repentance of the penitent no matter how great and how many their sins, please see the answers to the questions no. 624, 13990, 47834, 23485 and 20983\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "She has become flabby because of losing weight; can she have surgery to lift her breasts?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We have previously explained several times on our site that some kinds of cosmetic surgery are permissible, namely that which is done to treat a fault, remove a deformity and so on, and some kinds are haraam and are not allowed, namely that which is done solely for the purpose of beautification.\u00a0\nPlease see the answer to questions no. 47694 and 108860.\u00a0\nSo long as the surgery that you are going to do is to remove a fault that resulted from losing weight, there is nothing wrong with that if it will not result in harm that is greater than the harm occurring right now.\u00a0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:\nOne of my friends got married by the help of Allah. He came to me and said: e came to me and said that his wife wants to have cosmetic surgery on her face and breasts, because her nose is large and wide, and she wants to reduce it by means of the easy methods that modern science has developed. Is there any doubt about this surgery or is there any sin involved? Please note that not doing it may lead to psychological distress because this fault appears so prominently on her face.\u00a0\nThey replied: If the situation is as described, and there is the hope that the surgery will be successful and will not lead to a greater or equal harm, then it is permissible to do it in order to achieve the desired purpose, otherwise it is not permissible.\u00a0\nFataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah, 25/59-60\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\u00a0\nWhat is the Islamic ruling on having surgery to remove physical defects that may occur in people whether as a result of sickness or an accident, or that had been present since birth, such as removing extra digits and repairing the hand to make it look natural, or removing extra teeth and straightening the rest of the teeth so that the mouth will go back to normal, or correcting a harelip and making it look normal, or removing scars caused by burning, straightening a crooked nose or reducing its size in order to facilitate breathing, or completing a defective ear, or tightening drooping eyelids because they block one\u2019s vision, or tightening sagging skin on the face so that the face will look more natural, or breast reduction for women in cases where large breasts are causing spinal problems because of their weight, or tummy tucks in the case of a sagging belly and weak abdominal muscles which lead to hernias, straightening the urethra in males in cases where urine is contaminating the clothing, removing deformed spots from the face, and removal of fat in obese individuals which may cause many diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. Please note that these operations will not cause any deformity, in sha Allah.\u00a0\nHe replied:\u00a0\nThere is nothing wrong with treating the problems mentioned with remedies that are prescribed in sharee\u2018ah or with permissible remedies from specialist doctors who think it most likely that the treatment will be successful, because of the general meaning of the shar\u2018i evidence which says that it is permissible to treat diseases and illnesses with acceptable or permissible remedies.

        "question": "She is complaining about her husband\u2019s attachment to the Society for the Promotion of Virtue",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly we congratulate you on your good attitude of being pleased with what your husband does, which is the work of the Prophets themselves (peace be upon them), namely enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and calling people to Allah.\u00a0\nWe advise you to stand by your husband\u2019s side and encourage him in this work, and not to have any doubts about him or to feel fed up with what he does. \u00a0\nWith regard to what he tells you about women, it seems that he is telling you because he trusts you, and is not telling you in order to upset you, or to express his admiration for them. Rather he is telling you that in order to inform you of some of the evil actions that people do, so that you can beware of them, or so as to get it off his chest. When some people see evil actions, it affects them deeply, and they need someone to talk to about it so as to get it off their chests. So you should be aware of that and not let the Shaytaan get to you with regard to this matter.\u00a0\nThere is no reason why you should not advise him with regard to the things in which he is falling short towards you, so long as that is done in the way that is better and without casting aspersions on his decency and morals.\u00a0\nOur advice to the husband is to give his family their rights, and to treat them in a reasonable manner. He should respect their feelings and not describe women to his wife; just as a man would not like his wife to describe men to him, so too a woman does not like her husband to describe women to her.\u00a0\nHe should avoid speaking too much to women, and restrict it only to what is needed in order to change the evil or to draw attention to it, etc, because being too careless and lax about that may lead to bad consequences. And he should strive to lower his gaze, because looking is one of the arrows of Iblees.\u00a0\nMay Allah help you both to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

We will \n    never tell you to sever your ties with your sisters or with your wife. \n    Rather we tell you: bring them together and do not make the division worse.\u00a0\nLove comes \n    from Allaah. He has created causes of love and causes of hate. So you have \n    to look at your relationships and seek out the causes of hate and enmity so \n    that you can remove them. And you should try to bring in the causes of love \n    so as to encourage it. These causes include: greeting with salaam, giving \n    gifts, visiting people when they are sick, helping at times of need, and \n    many other things which Islam tells us strengthen bonds and generate love \n    among people.\u00a0\nIn order to \n    calm both sides down, you also have to remind each of them of Allaah and His \n    warning against gossiping, insulting, slandering and interfering in people\u2019s \n    private affairs.\u00a0\nAdhering to \n    the limits set by Allaah and giving each party their rights, and respecting \n    the rights of the other party and not belittling them or annoying them, will \n    also guarantee happiness and peace in the house and in your relationships.\u00a0\nYou have to \n    advise your wife and your siblings to treat one another well, and try to \n    remove the problems and disputes that exist between them. If your wife and \n    siblings are living in the same house, there is nothing wrong with you \n    giving your wife her own accommodation, if you cannot reconcile between \n    them. Indeed, this may be a means of removing the disputes between them.\u00a0\nOur advice \n    to your wife is that she should be friendly towards her husband\u2019s family and \n    treat them kindly as much as she can, without doing anything that is \n    forbidden according to sharee\u2019ah. Respecting her husband\u2019s family will make \n    the relationship between her and her husband remain as good as it can be.\u00a0\nMay Allaah help you all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.

        "question": "Her husband only gives her maintenance, and he lives far away from her. Can she ask for a divorce?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Allah has permitted a man to have several wives, and has \n    forbidden men to mistreat their wives. If a man wants to have more than one \n    wife, then he can keep the first wife on a decent and reasonable basis, or \n    he can let her go in a kindly manner. It is not permissible for him to keep \n    her married to him whilst forsaking her and not giving her her rights. It is \n    not permissible for him to be negligent with regard to his family and the \n    upbringing of his children. Plural marriage has not been prescribed in order \n    to destroy families, rather it is prescribed to build families and increase \n    their numbers.\u00a0\n\n    This forsaking of his wife and negligence is haram for him, \n    even if he had another wife according to sharee\u2019ah, so how about if he is \n    forsaking his wife and neglecting his family for an illegitimate reason such \n    as a haram relationship and corrupt desires?\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    The wife has the right to ask for a divorce from her husband \n    if she cannot bear his bad treatment. This does not mean that she does not \n    accept the decree of Allah. Indeed in some cases it may be haram for her \n    to stay with a husband who commits major sins and whose children are not \n    safe from his evil influence and bad treatment. As divorce is allowed in \n    Islam and it may even be obligatory to ask for a divorce in some cases, \n    there is no need to think that this may go against belief in the divine will \n    and decree, because Allah has decreed both marriage and divorce.\u00a0\n\n    The wife has the right to live with her husband and be \n    treated in a decent and reasonable manner, and to have a husband with whom \n    she can feel happy and who will be like a garment for her, so that there \n    will be love and compassion between them. This is the reason for which \n    marriage was prescribed, and if anything detracts from what we have \n    mentioned, then it is contrary to the reason for which marriage was \n    prescribed.\u00a0\n\n    Hence the husband should choose a woman who is \n    religiously-committed, and fathers and guardians should marry their \n    daughters and female relatives under their care to men who are \n    religiously-committed and of good character, because if the Muslim household \n    is established on the basis of the laws of Allah, no wrongdoing or cruelty \n    will be seen in it. If a wife dislikes her husband for a legitimate shar\u2019i \n    reason, then she can ask for divorce (talaq) or can divorce him by khul\u2019, \n    and if he dislikes her he can divorce her by talaq and give her her rights \n    in full. He should either retain her on reasonable terms or release her with \n    kindness. \u00a0\n\n    If divorce takes place, then Allah may decree that she finds \n    a good, righteous husband, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBut if they separate \n    (by divorce), Allah will provide abundance for everyone of them from His \n    Bounty\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa 4:130]\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    Some women stay and put up with their husbands because of the \n    possibility that Allah may reform them, or so that he will remain in \n    contact with his children and take care of them and spend on them. If a long \n    time goes by and he does not reform or he mistreats his wife and children \n    too much, and she has sufficient money to spend on herself and her children, \n    then there is no point in her staying with him. Rather the right thing to do \n    is to rid herself of him so that she can live a better and more decent life, \n    and raise her children to obey Allah and His Messenger  (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him).\u00a0\n\n    You should take stock of yourself and repent to Allah for \n    any sins or transgressions that you may have committed against the rights of \n    Allah or the rights of your husband, or anyone else. Perhaps what has \n    happened to you may be a punishment for a sin that you have committed, \n    because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of \n    what your hands have earned. And He pardons much\u201d\n\n    [al-Shoora 42:30]\u00a0\n\n    Think long and hard about your situation and how likely it is \n    that you may find a husband after him or live a peaceful life without him. \n    Consult people around you who are close to you and are sincere. I advise \n    you, if they agree with you, to divorce him if the situation is as you \n    describe in your question. So pray istikharah and ask Allah for guidance, \n    and if you feel at ease with the idea of divorce then go ahead, and ask \n    Allah to make you independent of means by His bounty. We ask Allah to set \n    your affairs straight and to relieve your distress and reconcile between you \n    if that is better for you both.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

We have stated \n    that in the answer to question number\n    20916.\u00a0\n\n    But we advise you not to ask for that from this imam, for two \n    reasons:\u00a0\n\n    1.So as to preserve the dignity \n    of this imam before the people and to preserve your dignity, because your \n    first husband has spread the rumour that he (the imam) is the reason for the \n    separation between him and you, and if you marry him that will reinforce \n    this rumour and confirm it, which would lead to bad consequences for both of \n    you.\n\n    2.The marriage could fail or be \n    faced with problems if news of your marriage reaches the authorities in your \n    country. The one who tells them could be your first husband, seeking revenge \n    against you. The Muslim should not be the cause of harm to himself or to \n    others.\n\n    Hence we advise you to avoid thinking of this imam as a \n    husband for you.

        "question": "He got married then he regretted it",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This is a problem that often happens. You are not alone in \n    your suffering. The root of the problem, in my view, is the fact that the \n    husband was not able to see his fianc\u00e9e fully in the manner prescribed in \n    sharee\u2019ah, by sitting with her \u2013 but not being alone with her, of course \u2013 \n    and looking closely at her and even asking to see her again at another time. \n    \u00a0\n\n    Yes, you made a great mistake when you felt put off by this \n    girl at the time of engagement but you went ahead with the marriage.\u00a0 It \n    would have been better for you not to take a risk in such matters, because \n    the one who wants to get married should feel completely at ease with his \n    choice and not hesitant, so what about one who feels discontent as in your \n    case?\u00a0\n\n    The real problem you face now is that this girl loves you and \n    respects you, and she is giving you all your rights and more. She has also \n    gotten pregnant from you.\u00a0 If that were not the case, we would not hesitate \n    to advise you to leave her. \u00a0\n\n    Even more unfortunate than that is the fact that her life has \n    been turned into an unbearable hell. She cannot help weeping when she thinks \n    of her situation and how her hopes of finding a husband with whom to share \n    love and happiness have been dashed.\u00a0\n\n    Yes, this is something decreed by Allaah and a real fact that \n    we have to acknowledge and live with, namely that sometimes spouses do not \n    get along and divorce takes place, and the life of one or both of them is \n    wrecked as a result. You cannot live with all this pain except by means of \n    patience and seeking reward from Allaah, first of all, and secondly by \n    understanding the causes of failure. Hence you have your share of blame and \n    you have to bear part of the consequences of this matter, even if only a \n    little. You have to face up to the following:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 Try to live with this girl and put up with her as much as \n    possible. At least wait until the child is born, and perhaps things will \n    change and your hatred will turn to love.\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 If your circumstances allow you to keep her whilst \n    looking for another wife who will make you happy and let you stay with your \n    first wife, and you can look after your children with her and spare them the \n    pain of separation and divorce, this is something that is worth thinking \n    about.\u00a0\n\n    3 \u2013 If the solutions suggested above will not work; if the \n    matter is beyind your control and your hatred for her increases and you are \n    no longer able to live with her, then divorce is allowed in sharee\u2019ah in \n    such cases.\u00a0\n\n    The bitterness of divorce will be easier for her than the \n    ongoing misery of living with you, and perhaps she will find a husband with \n    whom she can be happy. And perhaps you will also find a wife with whom you \n    can be happy.\u00a0\n\n    Divorce \u2013 even though it is disliked \u2013 is the solution when \n    husband and wife cannot live amicably together.\u00a0\n\n    Try to think about these solutions, and think long and hard \n    about them. Do not be hasty. You should also turn to Allaah and ask Him to \n    guide you with regard to this matter, for He is close to His sincere slaves. \n    May Allaah help you and give you strength.\u00a0\n\n    Dr Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa\u2019wi\u00a0\n\n    We remind you of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cand live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it \n    may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of \n    good\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:19]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cand it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for \n    you\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:216]\n\u00a0And the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cNo believing \n    man should hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her characteristics \n    he will be pleased with another.\u201d Narrated by Muslim, 1469.\u00a0\nWhat this means is that \n    it is not right for a believing man to hate a believing woman, because if he \n    notices a bad characteristic in her and dislikes her because of it, he will \n    find another, praiseworthy characteristic in her and will love her because \n    of it, such as if she is chaste or kind or obedient\u2026 etc.\u00a0\nThis applies if she has some characteristics that do not please him, so how about if she is carrying out her duties towards him in the most complete manner?."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    We ask Allaah to help you and give you strength, and to guide \n    your husband aright.\u00a0\n\n    Undoubtedly by taking care of your children and being keen to \n    guide your husband, you are doing good and will be rewarded in sha Allaah, \n    for Allaah does not cause the reward of those who do good to be lost.\u00a0\n\n    Our advice to you is to keep on being patient and making \n    du\u2019aa\u2019 for your husband, and striving to guide him, through his parents, his \n    brothers and those who have any influence on him. If a man neglects his duty \n    towards his family he exposes himself to the wrath and anger of Allaah, \n    because he is neglecting that which Allaah has entrusted to his care. The \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cEach of you \n    is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler is the \n    shepherd of his people and is responsible for his flock. A man is the \n    shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock\u2026.\u201d This hadeeth was \n    narrated by al-Bukhaari, 893; Muslim, 1826, from Ibn \u2018Umar. And the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said of his household: \n    \u201cAllaah will ask every shepherd about that which was entrusted to his care, \n    whether he took care of it or neglected it, and He will even ask a man about \n    his family.\u201d Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan, classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in \n    Ghaayat al-Maraam, no. 271\u00a0\n\n    And he said: \u201cIt is sufficient sin for a man to neglect those \n    who are under his care.\u201d Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood from the hadeeth \n    of \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn \u2018Amr; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh \n    al-Jaami\u2019, no. 827.\u00a0\nAnd he said: \u201cThere is no \n    man whom Allaah causes to be appointed to a position of responsibility and \n    he does not discharge his duties sincerely, but he will not even smell the \n    fragrance of Paradise.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6731.\u00a0\n\n    We do not think that your husband would like to have this \n    warning directed at him, or that he would want his wife to spend on him and \n    take care of him. This is something that men instinctively dislike.\u00a0\n\n    You said that he sleeps and misses the prayers because he \n    stays up at night and wastes his time. This means that he is in grave danger \n    from another angle. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThen, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given \n    up As\u2011Salah (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salah (prayers) to be lost, \n    either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not \n    offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they \n    will be thrown in Hell\u201d\n\n    [Maryam 19:59]\nIbn Mas\u2019ood said that \n    al-Ghayy (translated here as \u201cHell\u201d) is a valley in Hell that is very deep \n    and has an awful taste.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201c.\u00a0So woe unto those performers of Salaah (prayers),\n\n    5.\u00a0Those who delay their Salaah (prayer from their stated \n    fixed times)\u201d\n\n    [al-Maa\u2019oon 107:4-5]\n\n    This refers to those who delay their prayers from the proper \n    times. But if he does not pray at all, then this is kufr which puts him \n    beyond the pale of Islam, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cBetween a man and shirk and kufr there stands his \n    giving up prayer.\u201d Narrated by Muslim, 82.\u00a0\n\n    And he said: \u201cThe covenant that stands between us and them is \n    prayer. Whoever gives it up is a kaafir.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; \n    al-Nasaa\u2019i, 463; Ibn Maajah, 1079; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.\u00a0\n\n    In that case you have to advise him, and if he persists in \n    not praying, then you have to prevent him from being intimate with you until \n    he repents and starts to pray.\n\n    \u00a0We ask Allaah to set the affairs of all the Muslims traight.\n\n    \u00a0And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "He fears for the future",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.My dear brother, how often we fail to look at things with a balanced view. How often we find problems in our daily lives that stem from the extremes of either concern or negligence. The one who seeks happiness and success in this world has to have a balanced approach without letting the one outweigh the other. In this manner he can strengthen his heart with faith and find peace of mind in doing that which he is required to do. What you are complaining of does not stem from ignorance of the root of the matter, rather it stems from the fact that you are focusing more on fear and the causes of fear and you are forgetting about being optimistic and not paying any attention to it.\u00a0\nYou know that death is an inevitable reality that will come to every living thing, and no one will be spared that, no matter how noble his status before Allah. Allah said to His Prophet, the noblest of all creation (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) will die\u201d\n[al-Zumar 39:30]\nAnd Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone shall taste death. And only on the Day of Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full. And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception (a deceiving thing)\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:185]\nAnd the poet said:\u00a0\nEvery son of a female, no matter how long he lives,\nWill one day be carried on the bier.\u00a0\nThe positive kind of fear of death is that which make a person check himself and watch himself, and bring himself to task for bad deeds. This fear is that which makes a man keep away from sin and persist in praying for forgiveness and repenting. As for the kind of fear that makes a person panic, expect the worst and feel helpless, and discourages him from taking any action and prevents him from doing his duties, this is a negative and blameworthy kind of fear. The one who feels this has to strive hard to rid himself of it and put a stop to it. Perhaps this is what the questioner is feeling, and he thinks that this waswasah (whisper from the Shaytaan) is a warning of danger and a sign that the end is near. But this is not the case. All it is, is a whisper from the accursed Shaytaan, to cause distress to the believer and to make his life a misery, and there is nothing real behind it. This is why, when you went to the hospital for tests, they showed that you are in good health, which should make you feel better and give you peace of mind. Perhaps we can help you by telling you how to get rid of this waswasah (whisper from the Shaytaan), in the following ways:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Firmly implanting in your heart the belief that whatever Allah wills happens, and whatever He does not will does not happen. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you cannot will unless (it be) that Allah wills the Lord of the \u2018Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)\u201d\n[al-Takweer 81:29]\nDeath is nothing but the decree of Allah which the son of Adam has no way of warding off or avoiding. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSay (O Muhammad ): \u2018I have no power over any harm or profit to myself except what Allah may will. For every Ummah, there is a term appointed; when their term comes, neither can they delay it nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment)\u2019\u201d\n[Yoonus 10:49]\u00a0\n\u201cWheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 4:78]\u00a0\nAs this is the case, then fear of death will not delay it or bring it forward, all you will get from your fear of death is misery and worries. Your appointed time will never come until Allah wills it, at the time that is known to Him, and you can never bring it forward, whether you fear death or not, whether you think about how your end will be or not. This is contrary to the life of peace, stability and tranquility that Allah wants for the believers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cWhoever works righteousness \u2014 whether male or female \u2014 while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)\u201d\n[al-Nahl 16:97]\n2 \u2013 Remembering the kindness and mercy of Allah towards His believing slaves, for He is Loving, Compassionate and Forgiving, the One Whose mercy prevails over His wrath, Who blesses the sinner with abundant forgiveness. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cWhy should Allah punish you if you have thanked (Him) and have believed in Him. And Allah is Ever All\u2011Appreciative (of good), All\u2011Knowing\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 4:147]\nThe believer is promised Paradise when he dies. There is nothing standing between him and Paradise but death. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere is no person who bears witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, but Allah will forbid him to the Fire.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 47).\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Always putting your trust in Allah in all your affairs, and knowing that this trust (tawakkul) will ward off the whispers of the Shaytaan and put an end to them. Once you have resolved to do that, then do not look back. If you feel that these whispers are overwhelming you again, then turn to Allah and seek refuge in Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytaan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is All-Hearer, All-Knower\u201d\n[al-A\u2019raaf 7:200]\n4 \u2013 Lift your head high and look forward; start your daily life with steadfastness and certainty, and approach all your actions with energy and peace of mind. How many good things there are in this world that fill hearts with contentment and tranquility and fill the heart with hope and certain faith.\u00a0\nWith regard to your question, what is going to happen to you and your family in the future,\u00a0\nSubhaan-Allah (glory be to Allah)!\u00a0\nAre you the one who created them? Are you the one who grants them provision? Are you the one who is taking care of their needs?\u00a0\nNo, it is Allah Who does all that, Who is more merciful towards them than you are. Have complete trust that Allah will never cause them to be lost, may He be glorified and praised. This matter is not up to you at all. If all the people thought in this way no one would have any peace of mind. But praise be to Allah Who has guaranteed provision for everyone. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus or grave). All is in a Clear Book (Al\u2011Lawh Al\u2011Mahfooz \u2014 the Book of Decrees with Allah)\u201d\n[Hood 11:6]\nSo cast these thoughts away from your mind.\u00a0\n5 \u2013 You should make a lot of du\u2019aa\u2019 asking Allah to dispel this waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan) from you. Pray to Him with all humbleness, expressing your weakness and need of Him. And rest assured that He will certainly answer you. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:186]\nWith regard to those who die as a result of accidents, the fact that they die in this manner does not mean that they are bad at all. Rather people who are counted among the righteous may die in this manner. Think about this hadeeth which will help you to resolve this matter. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe martyrs are five: those who are stabbed, those who die of a stomach disease, those who drown, those who are crushed by falling walls, and those who die in battle for the sake of Allah.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 615).\u00a0\nLook at those who die by drowning, or by fire, or who are crushed by falling walls. Are these not frightening things? But that does not indicate that they are bad, rather the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called them martyrs (shuhada\u2019), which is the utmost honour. The way in which a person dies does not indicate that he is bad, but Allah in His wisdom decrees that some people should die in this manner. Perhaps that is in order to raise them in status in Paradise, or to expiate for some of their sins, or for some other reason that we do not know.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to guide you to good deeds and positive thinking."

With regard to your question, I offer the following comments:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 The problem you have is not with regard to marrying a second wife, or divorcing your wife.

So long as you are not able to marry another wife, then you should keep the wife with whom Allaah has blessed you.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 Whenever you are able and have the financial means, and praise be to Allaah that He has permitted plural marriage to you\u2026 In my opinion that is easier for a woman to bear than divorce, especially since you have children from her.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Try to look at the matter from a different angle. You may find many positive things in her, and beauty is not everything, believe me. How she behaves and treats you\u2026 and many things which are ultimately more important than appearance. For with time you will get used to her appearance, and how she behaves will be what matters\u2026 \u00a0\n4 \u2013 Imagine that you find a very beautiful woman and marry her\u2026 then she starts to treat you in an arrogant or impolite manner\u2026 or she treats you and your family badly\u2026 what would you do?!\u00a0\n5 \u2013 You should be objective and not burden yourself with more than you can bear.\u00a0 Look at the matter from different aspects. \u201cit may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good\u201d [al-Nisa\u2019 4:19 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning].

Allah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \n    \u201cVerily, As-Salah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.\u201d\n\n    \n    [al-Nisa 4:103]\u00a0\n\n    It was \n    narrated that \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Mas\u2019ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I \n    asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), \u201cWhich deed is \n    most beloved to Allah?\u201d He said, \u201cPrayer performed on time.\u201d He said, \u201cThen \n    what?\u201d He said, \u201cHonouring one\u2019s parents.\u201d He said, \u201cThen what?\u201d He said, \n    \u201cJihad (fighting) for the sake of Allah.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    \n    Narrated by al-Bukhari (504) and Muslim (85).\n\n    So it \n    is not permissible for the Muslim to delay his prayer beyond the time it is \n    due. Wudoo does not require a clean place. Even if we assume that it does, \n    the questioner could make sure that he has wudoo before coming to work and \n    keep his wudoo so that he can pray on time.\n\n    He has \n    to offer prayer on time. Looking for a clean place where he can perform the \n    prayer is not too difficult. Prayer is valid in any place on earth so long \n    as it is clean and pure. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cThe earth has been made for me a place of prayer and \n    purification, so whenever the time of prayer comes for any man of my ummah, \n    let him pray.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari, 335; Muslim, 521. Sharee\u2019ah (Islamic \n    law) only excludes from this specific places in which prayer is not valid, \n    which include graveyards and bathrooms. The Prophet (peace and blessings of \n    Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAll the earth is a place of prostration apart from \n    graveyards and bathrooms.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood, 492; classed as saheeh \n    (authentic) by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\n\n    So the \n    workplace may be a place of prayer if it is clean. If it is not easy then he \n    should look for somewhere else. Asking his bosses to allocate a corner where \n    he can pray is not something that is difficult.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:\n\n    If he \n    deliberately delays the prayer until the time is too short to meet all the \n    conditions and do all the essential parts of the prayer, such as if there is \n    some impure substance on him, or he is junub and delays the prayer so that \n    if he does ghusl the time for prayer will be over, then he has to purify \n    himself first, but he is a sinner because he is doing the prayer at the \n    wrong time. He should have purified himself before the time became too short \n    and prayed on time. When he delays it, then he has to do what is required in \n    the right sequence even though he is a sinner because of his delaying it.\n\n    Sharh \n    al-\u2018Umdah, \n    4/58.\n\n    If he \n    is unable to fulfil one of the conditions of prayer being valid \u2013 such as \n    taharah (purity) \u2013 then he should pray on time and he is exempted from this \n    condition. It is not permissible to delay the prayer until its time is over \n    in order to fulfil that condition.\n\n    Shaykh \n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:\n\n    \n    Because those who are obliged to pray when the time for prayer comes, but \n    are unable to fulfil one of its conditions or essential parts at that \n    moment, but will be able to do so after the time for prayer is over, it is \n    not permissible for them to delay the prayer until its time is over. If this \n    were permissible then the one who is unable to purify himself, cover \n    himself, bow or prostrate, or do any other condition or essential part of \n    the prayer would be allowed to delay the prayer until he is able to do this, \n    if he knows or thinks it most likely that he will be able to do it. This is \n    contrary to the Quran, Sunnah and scholarly consensus, because sharee\u2019ah\u2019s \n    concern that the prayer be performed on time is greater than its concern for \n    any other condition or essential part of prayer that cannot be done. Hence \n    it is not permissible to delay the prayer until its time is over because of \n    being unable to do some of the essential parts. When the time for the \n    obligatory prayer is too short and one cannot fulfil the conditions, then \n    doing the prayer on time takes precedence over the conditions. There is only \n    one time when fulfilling the conditions takes precedence over the act \n    itself, which is when the act becomes obligatory towards the end of its \n    time, such as when a sleeper wakes up at the end of the time, in which case \n    the prayer becomes obligatory when he wakes up, and he must fulfil the \n    conditions of prayer. This applies if someone wakes up after the time for \n    prayer is over.\n\n    Sharh \n    al-\u2018Umdah, \n    4/347, 348.\n\n    And \n    Allah knows best."

        "question": "He has taken on the responsibility and feels anxious and depressed",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The believer cannot do without his Lord. He is the only One Who can bring benefits or ward off harm. By turning to Allaah you did the right thing.\u00a0\nDeath is a reality, and Allaah has decreed it for every soul, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone shall taste death\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:185]\nNo matter how hard a person tries, he can never ward off that which Allaah has willed and decreed for him, namely death.\u00a0\nBut fear should not prevent a person from worshipping and obeying Allaah, rather it should do the opposite. Fear should motivate one to worship and obey Allaah. Fear \u2013 as Ibn Qudaamah said \u2013 is the whip of Allaah with which He drives His slaves to persist in seeking knowledge and acting upon it, so that they may attain the status of being close to Allaah.\u00a0\nFear may cause a person to become worried, anxious or ill, which may in turn cause him to despair of the mercy of Allaah; in this case his fear is not something good, it is bad.\u00a0\nIt should be noted that a lot of worry and psychological stress is caused by not being content (with the will and decree of Allaah). We may not get what we want, and even if we do get what we want that may not make us feel content as we had hoped; the idea that we had in our minds before getting it was better than the reality.\u00a0\nEven after getting what we want we may still suffer from anxiety and fear of losing that blessing. There is no remedy for this apart from accepting the decree of Allaah, thanking Him for His blessings and patiently bearing the difficulties and calamities that Allaah has decreed for us.\u00a0 \u00a0\nYour situation may require a doctor, but you should note that most people\u2019s diseases are not physical, rather they are psychosomatic.\u00a0\nDr al-Faarez says: It became clear that for four out of five patients their sickness had no physical basis at all, rather their sickness stemmed from fear, anxiety, resentment and selfishness, and a person\u2019s inability to create harmony between himself and life. \u00a0\nLook at how Ya\u2019qoob (peace be upon him) wept for his son Yoosuf (peace be upon him) and lost his sight. Look at how distress overwhelmed \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) when the people slandered her by telling lies about her, and she kept weeping so much that she said: \u201cI though that grief would tear me apart.\u201d Agreed upon.\u00a0\nDr Hassaan Shamsi Pasha said: \u00a0\nIn the event of anxiety, secretion of a substance called adrenaline increases in the blood, the blood pressure rises, the heart rate increases, and a person feels heart palpitations or may feel as if something is sinking to the bottom of his chest.\u00a0\nHe may become paranoid and rush from one doctor to another, wondering what is wrong with his heart, when there is nothing wrong in his body but he still suffers pain in his stomach and has indigestion, or bloating in his abdomen, or frequent urination or headaches.\u00a0\nYou have to have faith and fear Allaah; always recite dhikr and wirds that are prescribed in sharee\u2019ah, because this is one of the greatest remedies that will get rid of the thoughts that are going around in your mind and the things that hearts grieve over.\u00a0\nSome of the du\u2019aa\u2019s narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that deal with such matters include the following:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 It was narrated from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say: \u201cAllaahumma inni a\u2019oodhu bika min al-hammi wa\u2019l-hazani wa\u2019l\u2019ajzi wa\u2019l-kasali wa\u2019l-jubni wa\u2019l-bukhli wa dala\u2019 il-dayn wa ghalbat al-rijaal (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from worry, grief, incapacity, laziness, cowardice, miserliness, from being heavily indebt and from being overcome by men).\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6008.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 It was narrated that \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mas\u2019ood said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIf a person who is afflicted by anxiety or sorrow says: \u2018Allaahumma inni \u2018abduka wa ibnu \u2018abdika wa ibn ammatika naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya hukmuka \u2018adlun fiyya qadaa\u2019uka as\u2019aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw \u2018allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta\u2019tharta bihi fi \u2018ilm il-ghaybi \u2018indaka an taj\u2019al al-Qur\u2019aana rabee\u2019a qalbi wa nooar sadri wa jalaa\u2019a huzni wa dhahaaba hammi (O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your female slave, my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You with which You have named Yourself, or, or You have taught to any of Your creation, or You have revealed in Your Book, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Qur\u2019aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety)\u2019, then Allaah will take away his anxiety and sorrow, and will replace it with joy.\u201d \u00a0\nIt was said: \u201cO Messenger of Allaah, should we not learn it?\u201d He said: \u201cYes, whoever hears it should learn it.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by Ahmad, 3704; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 199.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 It was narrated that Sa\u2019d ibn Abi Waqqaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (S) said: \u201cThe prayer of Dhu\u2019l-Noon which he said when he was in the belly of the fish: \u2018Laa ilaaha illa Anta, subhaanaka inni kuntu min al-zaalimeen (none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allaah), Glorified (and Exalted) be You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers\u2019 [cf al-Anbiya\u2019 21:87]. No Muslim man calls upon Allaah with these words concerning any matter but Allaah will answer him.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3505; classed as saheeh by al_Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, 3383.\u00a0\nSee also questions no. 21677 .\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Improving Relationship With Husband",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.You should note that by His wisdom, Allah tests His slaves with good and evil, to show who among them will obey Him in all circumstances and who will only obey Him in some circumstances. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cWho has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving.\u201d [67:2]\n\u201c\u2026 and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned.\u201d\n[21:35]\nOne of the kinds of tests is that Allah may test one spouse with bad treatment on the part of the other, for whatever reason. Based on this, if what you have mentioned is correct and your husband has been bewitched or affected by strong hasad (envy) \u2013 for witchcraft and the evil eye do have an effect, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \u201cThe evil eye is real\u201d [al-Bukhaari, Muslim] \u2013 then you have to do the following:\n1 \u2013 Remember Allah a great deal (dhikr) and pray for forgiveness. Ask Allah to heal your husband and to make him be as he used to be. Nothing can alter the divine decree except du\u2019a.\n2 \u2013 Think about yourself and the way you treat your husband. It may be that you have changed in the way you treat him, without realizing. Be the best wife you can to him, and the best help, after Allah. Stand by his side during this trial and be his support, after Allah.\n3 \u2013 Do not go to this so-called man of religion, for he is asking for your picture in order to practice trickery. See question no.  21124.\n4 \u2013 There is nothing wrong with you going with your husband to a trustworthy shaykh, who treats people by means of the Quran and du\u2019as prescribed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). You could also recite the Quran over some water and you and your husband drink from it, and you could recite ruqyah (incantation) over him every day, and recite Surah al-Baqarah in the house. For more information on the ways of undoing the effects of witchcraft please see the following questions:  11290,  4010,  21124,  8291,  20954. For information on protection against witchcraft, please see questions no.  2662 and  22816. For information on various kinds of witchcraft please see questions no.  12578,  9432,  240.\u00a0\n5 \u2013 Assuming that what has happened to your husband is not witchcraft or hasad (envy), then sit with him and discuss things frankly. Tell him what you feel, and agree to go back to the way things were.\u00a0\n6 \u2013 You can ask some people \u2013 especially trustworthy relatives - to intervene and seek a solution to this problem, and to look into its causes and try to find a way of resolving it.\u00a0\nFinally, we advise you to weigh up your husband\u2019s good points and bad points, and do not forget his good qualities and his kind treatment of you, because this will motivate you to try to bring him back to the right path in his religion and in his relationship with his Lord, first of all, then in his relationship with you.\u00a0\nMay Allah make things easy for you, and make your husband happy with your obedience and make you happy with his good treatment.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "She became Muslim recently and feels anxious about the future",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nWe congratulate you for this great blessing that Allaah has bestowed upon you, which is the blessing of entering Islam and finding enjoyment praying and reading Qur\u2019aan.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nYou should try hard to offer the obligatory prayers at the right times as defined in sharee\u2019ah. There are five prayers each day and night. Prayer represents connection and conversation between a person and his Lord. It is the most important pillar and obligatory duty of Islam after the Shahaadatayn (twin testimony of faith), and it brings light to a person in this life and in his grave in the Hereafter.\u00a0\nYou should also strive to offer nafl (supererogatory) prayers after doing the obligatory prayers, for Allaah says in the hadeeth qudsi: \u201cMy slave does not draw near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My slave continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6502.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nThe anxiety and fear that you are feeling about the future are things that happen to some people when they first become committed in their adherence to Islam. Perhaps the reason for that is that the Shaytaan is annoyed by the person\u2019s beginning to follow true guidance and the path of Mercy, so he tried to divert him from that, and he whispers to him doubts about Allaah that are not appropriate, in order to cause him grief and worry. This \u2013 praise be to Allaah \u2013 will not harm the believer. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when some of his companions complained to him about the waswasah (whisperings from the Shaytaan) that they were encountering: \u201cAllaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great. Praise be to Allaah Who has reduced his (the Shaytaan\u2019s) plots to mere whispers.\u201d Narrated by Ahmad (2097) and Abu Dawood (4448); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. A similar hadeeth is to be found in al-Saheehayn.\u00a0\nYou should read Qur\u2019aan a great deal and remember Allaah (dhikr), for no one ever protects himself against the Shaytaan with anything like remembrance of Allaah, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, especially the dhikrs that are narrated for specific times and occasions, such as the dhikrs for morning and evening, for sleeping and waking, for going out of the house and coming in. You should also cleanse the house of anything that may prevent the angels coming in, such as dogs and images.\u00a0\nRemember that the future is in the hand of Allaah and that whatever Allaah has decreed will come to pass. Your fear and anxiety about it will not change it at all. So keep busy with things that will benefit you and think well of Allaah, for Allaah is as His slave thinks He is, as He says in the hadeeth qudsi: \u201cI am as My slave thinks I am. I am with him when he makes mention of Me. If he makes mention of Me to himself, I make mention of him to Myself; and if he makes mention of Me in an assembly, I make mention ofhim in an assembly better than it.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7066; Muslim, 2675). Ahmad (16059) narrated with a saheeh isnaad: \u201cI am as My slave thinks I am, so let him think of Me as he wishes.\u201d\u00a0\nSo think that Allaah will honour you, have mercy on you and give you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, because He loves His righteous slaves, and honours His pious slaves. You \u2013 praise be to Allaah \u2013 are new in Islam and have few sins to your record. So be assured of a life of tranquillity, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cWhoever works righteousness \u2014 whether male or female \u2014 while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)\u201d\n[al-Nahl 16:97]\nWe ask Allaah to guide you and give you strength, and to take away the fear and anxiety that you are experiencing.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "How should a person fill his spare time?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The blessing of time is one of the greatest blessings that Allaah can bestow upon His slaves. Allaah even swears by time in some cases, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cBy Al\u2011\u2018Asr (the time)\u201d\n[al-\u2018Asr 103:1]\n- because of the importance and blessing of time. \u00a0\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cMake the most of five things before five others: life before death, health before sickness, free time before becoming busy, youth before old age, and wealth before poverty.\u201d See Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, no. 1077.\u00a0\nBut most people are unaware of the importance of this blessing and are neglectful of their duties towards it, namely to fill it with acts of gratitude and obedience towards Allaah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThere are two blessings which many people do not make the most of and thus lose out: good health and free time.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6412.\u00a0\nAl-Teebi said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) likened the Muslim (who is accountable for his deeds) to a merchant who has capital and seeks to make a profit whilst also preserving his capital. The way to do that is to look for the right people to deal with and he himself will be honest and will try to be smart lest he be cheated. Good health and free time are our capital, and we should deal with Allaah with faith, striving against the evil inclinations of our nafs and the enemy of religion i.e., the Shaytaan, so that we may attain the best in this world and in the Hereafter. This is similar to what is mentioned in the passage where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cShall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful torment?\u201d\n[al-Saff 61:10]\nWe should avoid following the dictates of the nafs and keep away from the Shaytaan lest we lose both our capital and our profit.\u00a0\nFath al-Baari by Ibn Hajar.\u00a0\nIf time is so important, then the Muslim should not have any free time, for he should be going from one act of worship and obedience to another. If he cannot spend all his time going from one act of obedience and worship to another then, he may spend some of his time in permissible pursuits, in which he should ensure that his intention is correct, so that he may earn reward thereby, as Mu\u2019aadh (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \u201cI get up and I sleep, and I hope for the same when I sleep as I hope for when I get up.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6923; Muslim, 1854.\u00a0\nThe problem that the sister is suffering from is caused by several things:\u00a0\nFirstly: she does not understand the value of time. This is true of many people, as stated above. Even worse than that, by neglecting this great blessing, her spare time has become something destructive, and she regards it as an enemy that she wants to kill, but she does not realize that she is killing herself. \u00a0\nSecondly: she feels depressed. There is no doubt that wasting one's time and one's life causes deep depression in man, because he feels that he is like an animal that eats so it can sleep, and sleeps so it can eat. Hence we see many disbelievers ended their life by suicide, after being afflicted by depression and other incurable diseases \u2013 may Allaah keep us safe and sound from that with which He has tested them. One of the primary causes of depression is disobedience towards Allaah. Undoubtedly wasting time watching TV leads a person to commit sin, such as watching and listening to haraam things, wasting time, and other things caused by this evil machine. The benefits that the sister gains by joining a halaqah for memorizing Qur\u2019aan are largely cancelled out, if not erased entirely, by sitting in front of the TV. Just as good deeds erase bad deeds, bad deeds cause good deeds to be lost.\u00a0\n[You can refer to the Books section of this website; in  Dealing with Worries and Stress you will find more details about the causes of worry and how to overcome them. In  Dangers Facing the Home you will find mention of some of the harmful effects of TV.]\u00a0\nThirdly: \u00a0\nShe has given up with regard to time, and she has no determination to fill her time with beneficial things.\u00a0\nIn order to solve this problem, the sister must strive to achieve the following:\u00a0\n1-Doing acts of worship such as reciting dhikr and wird, praying, reading Qur\u2019aan, fasting and thinking about the signs and blessings of Allaah.\n2-She should pay special attention to the Qur\u2019aan, since she says that she memorizes what is required of her, then she has spare time that she kills by watching TV. Why doesn\u2019t she use that time to remember Allaah and read Qur\u2019aan, and memorize more so that she can memorize the whole Qur\u2019aan, before she becomes burdened with the responsibilities of life. For (reading) each letter is a hasanah, and each hasanah brings a tenfold reward. And each verse raises one in status and increases one\u2019s reward, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cRead and rise (in status), for as you used to recite in this world, your position (in the Hereafter) will be determined by the last verse you read.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1464; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Saheehah, 2240.\n3-Adopt a cause affecting Muslim women in the country where you live, such as helping to teach Muslim girls, undertaking charitable projects, and so on.\n4-Find good and righteous friends with whom you can meet and get together.\n5-Read Islamic books in particular and useful stories in general.\n6-Get involved in da\u2019wah, women\u2019s activities and children\u2019s sports in Islamic centres.\n7-Listen to tapes and lectures, and write summaries which you can distribute to those who will benefit from them.\n8-Learn some useful areas of worldly knowledge such as cooking, sewing, etc.\n9-Learn about computers and useful programs, for this is a vast area which will take up a lot of time and can be used to do a lot of good and useful things. This will take you away from sitting in front of the TV which does not help you in any way, and does more harm than good.\n10-You should read some books which speak of the importance of time and how to manage it; listen to some useful lectures on this topic too.\nMay Allaah help you and us to do all that is good.\u00a0\nFor more information please see also questions no. 3619, 26869, 36546."

        "question": "Is it a sin if one does not feel comfortable with a particular person?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What the Muslim should do is refrain from bearing any hatred or resentment in his heart towards his fellow Muslim. Allaah says of His believing slaves (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd those who came after them say: Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful\u201d\n[al-Hashr 59:10]\nAccording to a hadeeth narrated by Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cDo not hate one another, do not envy one another, do not turn your backs on one another, and be, O slaves of Allaah, brothers. It is not permissible for a Muslim to forsake his brother for more than three days.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5718; Muslim, 2559.\u00a0\nIbn \u2018Abd al-Barr said: His saying \u201cDo not hate one another\u201d is a prohibition which is aimed at encouraging them to discipline themselves to love one another. Al-Istidhkaar, 8/289.\u00a0\nBut a person may feel that he does not like a person enough for him to become a close friend, even though he fulfils his Islamic duty of returning his salaams, saying \u201cYarhamuk-Allaah (May Allaah have mercy on you)\u201d if he sneezes, helping him if he needs help, and so on. In this case what exists between them does not come under the heading of forsaking or shunning, and it is forgiven in sha Allaah. According to a hadeeth narrated by \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cSouls are troops collected together and those who got along with one other (in the realm where souls existed before entering physical bodies in this world) will have an affinity with one another (in this world) andthose amongst who did not get along with one another\u00a0 (in the realm where souls existed before entering physical bodies in this world) will also not get along (in this world).\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3158; Muslim, 2638.\u00a0\nAl-Khattaabi said: This may be understood as referring to similarlity between souls which are either good or bad, righteous or immoral, and that good people are attracted to those who are like them and evil people are likewise attracted to those who are like them, so people\u2019s souls recognize one another according to their nature, whether good or evil; if they are similar they will get along and if they are different they will not get along.\u00a0\nAl-Qurtubi said: Although souls have in common the fact that they are all souls, they differ in other ways. Souls of similar nature will get along because of their nature. Therefore we see people of a certain type get along, but they do not get along with people of a different nature, and we see that with people who are of a similar nature, some of them get along with one another and some do not, and that depends on the issues which form the basis of getting along or otherwise."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    It is permissible for a man to speak to a non-mahram woman if \n    there is a need to do so, and there is no soft speech on the part of the \n    woman or enjoyment on the part of the man, and the talk is of something that \n    is permissible.\u00a0\n\n    But they should limit it to what is necessary, so as to block \n    the means that may lead to evil, because getting carried away in talking \n    unnecessarily may lead to something haraam.\u00a0\n\n    Based on that, there is nothing wrong with a man talking to a \n    woman when buying, selling, asking a question, medical treatment, and so on, \n    if attention is paid to these guidelines.\u00a0\n\n    For more information, see the answer to question number\n    1121.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to your husband speaking to that woman and \n    advising her to keep away from his friend, in this case -- in addition to \n    the above -- he should weigh up the pros and cons. There may be some \n    interest to be served in his contacting her, or there may be some negative \n    outcome, and there may be no need to do that. He could instead send an \n    anonymous letter in which there is advice, reminders and warnings. This \n    varies according to the situation of your husband and the situation of the \n    woman mentioned.\u00a0\n\n    The safest approach is that he not contact her directly, \n    which may lead him to negative consequences, especially if the woman does \n    not care about forming relationships with men and nothing will deter her \n    from that.\u00a0\n\n    Your husband should advise his friend to keep away from that \n    woman and remind him to fear Allah, may He be exalted.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "There are some problems between his mother and his wife, and his mother wants him to live far away from her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThere is no doubt that the mother has the greatest rights of all people over her son, and that honouring her is one of the most important duties. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:23].\u00a0\nAllah has enjoined kind treatment of others too, whom the individual is enjoined to treat kindly, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cWorship Allaah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masaakeen (the poor), the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (slaves) whom your right hands possess. Verily, Allaah does not like such as are proud and boastful\u201d[al-Nisa\u2019 4:36] and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has enjoined giving everyone who has rights their due [See: Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 1968]. Hence the rights of the parents, especially the mother, take precedence over the rights of all people.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: Which of the people is most deserving of my good companionship? He said: \u201cYour mother.\u201d He said: Then who? He said: \u201cThen your mother.\u201d He said: Then who? He said: \u201cThen your mother.\u201d He said: Then who? He said: \u201cThen your father.\u201d\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (5971) and Muslim (2548).\u00a0\nBut this does not mean that a person should not give other people their rights; rather he has to give everyone who has rights his due, as stated above, and he has to strike a balance between these rights and fulfil his duties to the people around him as best he can and know how to run his home and his affairs well.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThese problems between the wife and the mother are a common and ancient problem. The wise man who is guided is the one who looks at his situation positively and reduces problems as much as he can and closes the door to them. For this reason one of the rights that the wife has over her husband is that he should provide her with separate accommodation.\u00a0\nIt says in al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah (25/109):\u00a0\nPutting the parents and the wife together in one home is not permissible (and the same applies to other relatives). Hence the wife has the right to refuse to live with either of them, because it is her right to have separate accommodation where she feels safe with regard to herself and her property. No one has the right to force her to do that.\u00a0\nThis is the view of the majority of Hanafi, Shaafa\u2018i and Hanbali fuqaha\u2019.\u00a0\nThe Maalikis are of the view that a distinction should be made between the wife of noble birth and the wife of lowly birth, and they say that it is not permissible to make the wife of noble birth and the parents live together in the same house, but doing that is permissible with a wife of lowly birth, unless making the wife of lowly birth and the parents live together will cause her some harm. End quote.\u00a0\nUndoubtedly the picture that you have painted of the relationship between your mother and your wife dictates that their living together in one house is not possible and that separating them is obligatory, especially since the mother is the one who has asked for that. So you must hasten to do that and it is not wise to think of the other solution, which is divorcing your wife. This is not a solution to the problem, especially if you have any children from her. Moreover the problem may arise again with any other wife whom you bring to live with your mother in the same house.\u00a0\nSo what you should do is hasten to do this as soon as you can, which is looking for a separate house for you and your wife. If you want to be close to your mother, so that you can be in constant touch with her and take care of her, then try to find your new house as close as possible to your mother's house, so that you can pop in to see her every time you come or go. In this way you can treat your mother kindly, relieve her of the burden of problems with your wife and keep in constant touch with her, whilst at the same time doing what you are obliged to do for your wife of treating her kindly and giving her accommodation that is suited for her.\u00a0\nSee the answer to question number 97810 .\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to guide you and set your affairs straight.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "She has hidden her Islam for several years, and her family want to get her married to a Christian! What should she do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    We praise Allah, may He be exalted, and thank Him for guiding \n    this girl to enter Islam, and we ask Him to make her steadfast in adhering \n    to truth and guidance, and to increase her in guidance and steadfastness.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    Marriage of a Muslim woman to a kaafir man is undoubtedly \n    haraam and it is an invalid contract, but it is not kufr if a Muslim woman \n    does that and marries a kaafir man, even though it is haraam for her. Allah \n    says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cthen if you ascertain that they \n    [Muslim women] are true believers send them not back to the disbelievers\u201d \n    [al-Mumtahanah 60:10].\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy upon him) said:\u00a0\n\n    This verse is the one that made it haraam for Muslim women to \n    marry mushrik men. It was permissible at the beginning of Islam for a \n    mushrik to marry a believing woman. Hence Abu\u2019l-\u2018Aas ibn al-Rabee\u2018 married \n    the daughter of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her), when she was a Muslim and he was a \n    follower of his people\u2019s religion.\u00a0\n\n    Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 8/93\u00a0\n\n    In al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah (7/133) it says:\u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a \n    non-Muslim man, even if he is a dhimmi or a kitaabi (one of the people of \n    the Book, i.e. a Jew or a Christian). This is according to the consensus of \n    the fuqaha\u2019, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd \n    give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al\u2011Mushrikoon till they believe (in \n    Allaah Alone)\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:221] and \u201csend them not back to the \n    disbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the \n    disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them\u201d [al-Mumtahanah 60:10].\u00a0\n\n    End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    If the family of this girl insist on marrying her to that \n    kaafir, we think that she should state openly that she is a Muslim and seek \n    help with one of the trustworthy Islamic centres or a trustworthy Muslim \n    family, until she finds a Muslim husband to marry her, then she can live \n    with him. The timing of showing her Islam openly and leaving her family, \n    whichever comes first, depends on her evaluation of her own circumstances. \n    If she is afraid that if her family find out about her being Muslim they \n    will detain her or prevent her from running away for the sake of her \n    religion, or they will force her to go back to kufr or to marry a kaafir, \n    then in this case we advise her to leave them first and go to another place \n    where she will be safe, either under the protection of the government in her \n    country if they offer protection in such cases, or under the care of one of \n    the Islamic centres in her country.\u00a0\n\n    Muslims are excused for staying among the kuffaar and not \n    practising their religion openly if they are weak and oppressed among them \n    and cannot leave and flee from them. But the one who finds a way out no \n    longer has this excuse, so it is not permissible for him to stay among the \n    kuffaar, not in their house or in their country. If he can find a safe \n    refuge in the same country, he should move there from his house, but if the \n    country itself is not safe, he should move from his house to another country \n    where his life will be safe and he will be able to practice his religion \n    openly.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to mere fear about the family's reputation, this \n    is not a valid excuse unless her religious commitment and her life are in \n    danger because of it.\u00a0\n\n    Who knows? Perhaps showing her religion openly will bring a \n    great deal of good to her and her family, and some of her family members may \n    become Muslim. This is what has happened with other sisters who showed their \n    Islam openly. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n    \u201cit may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through \n    it a great deal of good\u201d [al-Nisa\u2019 4:19].\u00a0\n\n    Whatever the case, we know that the situation is difficult \n    for this girl, but her religion requires her to do whatever she can in order \n    to adhere to it and practice it openly, and not fall into haraam.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allah to relieve her distress and take away the \n    calamity and to guide her family to Islam. And we ask Him, may He be \n    exalted, to bless her with a righteous husband and good offspring.\u00a0\n\n    See also the answers to questions no.\n    129423 and\n    69752.\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    We should point out a number of things:\u00a0\n\n    1.\n\n    If a Muslim man marries her, it is essential for her to have \n    a wali (guardian) who will do the marriage contract for her, because there \n    is no wilaayah (guardianship) for a kaafir - even if he is a kitaabi (Jew or \n    Christian) - over a Muslim woman. If there is a Muslim man among her family, \n    then he is her wali. If there is no Muslim man among her family, then the \n    Muslim qaadi (judge) or mufti or official in charge of Muslim affairs, or \n    the director of the Islamic centre to which she goes or gets married in, may \n    act as her wali.\u00a0\n\n    For more information on that please see the answers to \n    questions no.69752,\n    389 and\n    7989.\u00a0\n\n    2.\n\n    We should point out to you that it is not permissible for you \n    to have a relationship with this girl, as she is a stranger (non-mahram) to \n    you. If you want to help her - which is obligatory for you if you are able \n    to - then help her to find some Muslim sisters who can take care of her, or \n    a trustworthy Muslim family with whom she could live, or offer her your help \n    and advice through your wife, if you are married, or through your sister or \n    mother.\u00a0\n\n    Do not remain in a relationship with her, because you are a \n    stranger (non-mahram) to her, and Islam forbids such relationships.\u00a0\n\n    We have drawn attention to this matter in a number of \n    answers. See the answers to questions no.\n    78375,\n    34841,\n    23349,\n    20949,\n    26890 and\n    82702.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "Problem of forgetting appointments",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Perhaps your forgetfulness \u2013 or your weak memory \u2013 is a \n    result of giving birth, as your doctor said. This is not something to worry \n    about. Or this forgetfulness may be caused by sin, because sins result in \n    punishments that affect the heart and the body. Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned more than sixty punishments for sin in \n    his book al-Daa\u2019 wa\u2019l-Dawa\u2019.\u00a0\nSo if a person feels that \n    he is losing some blessing, he should hasten to repent to Allaah. Allaah \n    says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThat is so because Allaah will never change a grace which \n    He has bestowed on a people until they change what is in their ownselves\u201d\n\n    [al-Anfaal 8:53]\n\n    If a person makes a promise then forgets it unintentionally, \n    there is no sin on him, because Allaah has forgiven this ummah for what they \n    forget, as is indicated by the texts. For example, the last two verses of \n    Soorat al-Baqarah (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cOur Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:286]\n\n    And Allaah has said: \u201cI have done that.\u201d (Narrated by \n    Muslim)\u00a0\n\n    There are also means that will help you to remember \n    appointments, such as using a diary (in book or electronic form) to record \n    appointments by day and date. This is a means which is proven to work. How \n    many people forget their appointments, but they organize them by using these \n    reminders.\u00a0\n\n    Another means is using an electronic alarm clock or a mobile \n    phone to remind you of the time of an appointment\u2026 and other modern means \n    that are available.\u00a0\n\n    There are also audio reminders on which you can record \n    appointments and it will speak to remind you of the appointment.\u00a0\n\n    Each person must pay as much attention as possible to this \n    matter, because breaking promises is one of the signs of the hypocrites, as \n    it says in the hadeeth: \u201cThere are four characteristics, whoever has them is \n    a pure hypocrite, and whoever has one of them has one of the attributes of \n    hypocrisy until he gives it up: when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a \n    pledge he betrays it; when he makes a promise he breaks it; and when he \n    disputes he resorts to obscene speech.\u201d\n\n    \u00a0(Narrated by Muslim, 53)\n\n    \u00a0Keeping appointments is one of the signs of the people of \n    faith.\n\n    \u00a0Similarly those who miss appointments for a reason such as that mentioned in the question should explain their reasons to the other party involved, so that he will not be offended. We ask Allaah to protect us and you from all kinds of evil. And Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "Wife\u2019s family making the husband have doubts about his wife",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It is obvious that there has been a misunderstanding between this man and his wife\u2019s family, and that they want him to divorce her. It is essential to find out the wife\u2019s point of view. If she wants a divorce then he has to try to change her mind by tackling the cause of the problem. Otherwise he may divorce her, and perhaps Allaah will compensate each of them with someone who is better than the other. He should however, avoid discussing the issue of her betraying him. But if his wife does not want a divorce then he should treat his wife well and seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan, and he should not pay any attention to the doubts for which he has no proof. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said that there is gheerah (protective jealousy) that Allaah loves and there is gheerah which Allaah hates. The gheerah that Allaah loves is gheerah which is cause for doubt, and the gheerah that Allaah hates is gheerah when there is no cause for suspicion."

        "question": "She swore a false oath; how can she expiate that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nYou have made several mistakes and you opened the door to waswaas and suspicion when you had no need of any of that. We do not know in fact what made you, at such a young age, interpret what you found on your body in a bad way that caused you a great deal of anguish, and opened your eyes to different kinds of sin, so that you did that evil action a great deal. We ask Allah to guide us and you and keep us chaste.\u00a0\nYou made another mistake and wronged yourself, your household and your husband, when you opened the dark pages of the past and cast a shadow over your life with your husband; you told him about something that he did not know and did not ask you about, to torment him along with yourself with doubt and speculation, and anxiety and suspicion about you and your situation. May Allah set your affairs straight.\u00a0\nYou made a third mistake by swearing a false oath when you had no need to do so and we do not think that it benefitted you at all. You prayed against yourself that you would not be helped to be successful, when you knew that it was a false oath, and now you are saying that you are not successful in your life. Your story is very strange, and there was no need for all of that.\u00a0\nNow, the first thing that you must do is repent to Allah from all that you have done in transgressing the rights of your Lord, the rights of your own self and the rights of your husband and household. You have to strive, as much as you can, to set straight the things that have been spoiled by your bad conduct and failure to understand matters properly. Explain to your husband that what happened was no more than mistaken thinking and conjecture that was an illusion that turned out to be wrong, and you were the one who opened the doors to waswaas and speculation.\u00a0\nStrive to let him see that you are a truthful and righteous person and try to prove to him through your conduct that you have some dignity, so that his mind will be put at rest concerning you and he may be happy with you.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWith regard to the oath that you swore, saying that you do not know this person who did what he did, as you think, this is a false oath (al-yameen al-ghamoos). Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is called ghamoos because it immerses (taghmis) the one who does that in sin and then in Hell, because the one who knowingly swears a false oath concerning a matter that is in the past -- Allah forbid -- has combined two things: lying, which is one of the attributes of the hypocrites, and taking the matter of swearing an oath by Allah lightly, which is one of the attributes of the Jews, because the Jews are the ones who showed disrespect to their Lord, and ascribed shortcomings to Him, therefore it is an oath that immerses a person in the Fire.\"(Al-Sharh al-Mumti\u2019, 15/130)\nThere is no expiation for this oath according to the correct scholarly view; rather what is required is to repent to Allah, may He be exalted, and seek His forgiveness. You must also beware of taking the matter of oaths lightly if you are telling the truth, so how about if you are lying? \u00a0\nThe Standing Committee was asked:\u00a0\nI am a student in a Salafi Institute belonging to the Jamaa\u2019at Ansaar al-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah in Kasla [?], and there is an Eritrean Muslim students union. There are major differences between the union and the jamaa\u2019ah, hence doing activities with them is not allowed, but I participated with them. When the director of the institute found out, he asked me: Are you in the union? I said to him, No. He forced me to swear an oath so I did, but I was with them. Is this oath yameen ghamoos (a false oath) or do I have to offer expiation? Please note that if I had not been forced I would not have sworn an oath, but I regarded that as a case of necessity, because if I had told the truth he would have banned me from the Institute, and it is because of my keenness to seek knowledge that I did that.\u00a0\nThe Standing Committee replied:\u00a0\nThe oath that you mentioned was a yameen ghamoos, which is a major sin which cannot be expiated because of its seriousness. No expiation is prescribed for it according to the more correct of the two scholarly views; rather what is required is repentance and seeking forgiveness, so you have to repent and ask for forgiveness for it. End quote. Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah, 23/133.\u00a0\nShaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\u00a0\nI have a brother who got a passport and he wants to get another one, and during the application process the official said to him: Do you swear that you do not have a previously issued passport? He did not see any Mushaf in front of the official, then the official took it out. My brother got scared and swore that he had not taken out any other passport. Please advise us on the ruling concerning this matter and whether he has to offer a sacrifice or is some other expiation sufficient?\u00a0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\u00a0\nHe has to repent to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, just as any liar has to repent to Allah, and he has to be sincere in that and regret it, and not do it again.\u00a0\nThere is no expiation for a false oath according to the correct opinion. The expiation for vows has to do with those which refer to the future, for example if a person says \u201cBy Allah I will not do such and such\u201d or \u201cBy Allah I will not speak to So and so.\u201d As for the one who tells a lie, all he has to do is repent to Allah, regret what he has done and give up the sin, and he should sincerely resolve not to do that again, out of sincerity towards Allah and the desire for that which is with Him. Thus Allah will pardon him, because by means of sincere repentance Allah erases sin, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful\u201d [Al-Noor 24:31].\"(Majmoo\u2019 Fatawa Ibn Baz, 23/115)\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Du\u2019a for Insomnia and How to Treat It",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Facing difficulties with patience\nWe ask Allah to grant us and you well being, protection from all problems and healing from every disease.\u00a0\nWe advise you to be patient and seek reward with Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, for He loves those who are patient and rewards those who are grateful. Trials and tests are the divine decree for this world and that is a mercy for the believers and a punishment for the disbelievers. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cHow wonderful is the situation of the believer, for all his affairs are good. This does not apply to anyone but the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience , and that is good for him.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 2999)\nIt should also be noted that the matter requires some degree of effort and perseverance, as is the case with all psychological or social problems. It takes some gradual training to make oneself get used to something new or to keep away from something reprehensible. Each person knows his own self best and can devise the best approach to achieve the success and wellbeing he wants.\u00a0\nWhat is insomnia?\nSleeplessness is a psychological problem which causes difficulty in sleeping, or interrupted sleep or light sleep. It is a modern disease that affects many people for various reasons, including psychological reasons such as pressure, worry, anxiety, waswas (whispers from the Shaytan) and so on.\u00a0\nAnd some of its causes are physical because of problems in the function of some organs or the effects of some stimulant substances such as nicotine which is found in tobacco and caffeine which is found in coffee and tea, and other stimulants.\u00a0\nRemedies for insomnia\u00a0\nDepending on the reason that has led to this sickness, we can divide the types of remedies into three types:\u00a0\n\nShar\u2018i remedies\n\nWhat is meant here is attaining the peace of mind that wards off all worries, anxieties and waswas. The hearts and minds that are filled with love of Allah, hope for His reward, fear of His punishment and focusing on Him are more steadfast than those which are preoccupied with matters of this world and ignore the Hereafter.\u00a0\nAttaining this peace of mind is done by adhering to obligatory duties and avoiding sins which continue to eat away at the heart until a person finds himself lost in dark valleys, not knowing how he got there; then by showing kindness towards people by means of a good attitude and kind treatment; by being keen to read the Noble Quran and feel an attachment to the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, which He described in the following verse (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cO mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Quran, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your breasts, \u2014 a guidance and a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers\u201d [Yunus 10:57].\u00a0\nOther means include regularly reciting the adhkar (dhikr) and awrad (wird) narrated in shari\u2018ah, such as the adhkar for morning and evening , the adhkar to be recited when going to sleep and waking up and when eating and so on. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThose who believed (in the Oneness of Allaah \u2014 Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.\u201d [al-Ra \u2018d 13:28]\nMoreover, all of that must be accompanied with humility in the heart towards Allah and feeling a sense of His love and closeness, along with sincerity towards Him in public and in private, hoping to attain the state of true servitude towards Him (\u2018ubudiyyah) which is the basis of success on the Day of Resurrection.\u00a0\nOn our website you will find a number of answers which will help you \u2013 in sha Allah \u2013 to implement the shar\u2018i remedy. Please see these answers: 45847 ,\u00a020130 ,\u00a021515 ,\u00a021677 ,\u00a021843 ,\u00a022704 \u00a0and\u00a030901 .\u00a0\n\nPsychological remedies\n\nThis means trying to rid oneself of worries and anxiety. That can never be achieved except by believing sincerely in the transient and insignificant nature of this world, and that \u201cIf it were equal to a gnat\u2019s wing before Allah He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water in it.\u201d It is too insignificant for a Muslim to worry about what he has lost of it or to fear what may happen to him in it. That should also be accompanied by complete contentment with what Allah has decreed and acceptance of His will and decree. These are the means of the believer attaining honour and happiness. Taking these ideas on board requires some effort, repeatedly telling oneself of them, reading books that affirm them and studying and pondering the verses of the Noble Quran which mention them, until they take root in one's heart and become second nature.\u00a0\n\nBehavioural remedies\n\nThis is where one should seek advice from a doctor or psychologist, because some behavioural or physical causes may be unknown to people but are well known to skilled doctors with the knowledge that Allah has enabled them to acquire about the human psyche. You may find a remedy in some foods which help one to sleep properly. The doctor may also find out about some of your bad habits that lead to worry and sleeplessness. In some chronic and difficult cases of insomnia the doctor may also use some calming medicines which will reduce or ward off harm.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin says in Fatawa Nur \u2018ala al-Darb (Fatawa Mutafarraqat/al-Waswas wa\u2019l-Amrad al-Nafsiyyah):\u00a0\n\u201cThe case mentioned by the questioner may be faced by many young people because of mental or physical exhaustion. The remedy for that is for the person to allow himself to rest and recuperate; to remember Allah a great deal and read Quran; to always seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan; to always ask for forgiveness because seeking forgiveness is one of the means of attaining good and warding off evil; to strive to keep company with good people like him, because a good companion is like the carrier of musk - he will either give you some or sell you some or you will find a good smell from him. He should try to keep away from that which he should not think about, because thinking of something may make a person move from imagining it to actually doing it, but if he tries to ignore it and forget it, then by Allah\u2019s leave it will cease to trouble him.\u201d\u00a0\nAuthenticity of hadiths about du\u2019a for insomnia\nWe should not forget to point out here the weakness of the reports narrated by some scholars about adkhar to be recited just before going to sleep in order to free oneself from insomnia. Imam al-Nawawi included a chapter in his book al-Adhkar (p. 70) entitled:\u00a0\nBab ma yaqul idha qaliqa fi Firashihi fa lam yanam (What to say if one feels anxious in bed and cannot sleep):\u00a0\n\u201cWe narrated in the book of Ibn al-Sunni that Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\nI complained to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about insomnia that I was suffering from. He said: Say: O Allah, the stars have come out and eyes have closed, and You are the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists; neither slumber nor sleep overtakes You. O Ever-Living, O Sustainer, bring calm to my night and let my eyes sleep. O Allah, take away from me what I am suffering.\u00a0\nAnd we narrated from Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Habban from Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him) that he suffered from insomnia and he complained about that to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he told him, when going to sleep, to seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from His anger and from the evil of His slaves and from the whisperings of the devils, lest they come near. This hadith is mursal; Muhammad ibn Yahya is a Tabi\u2018i.\u00a0\nAnd we narrated in the book of al-Tirmidhi, in a da\u2018if report that was classed as such by al-Tirmidhi, that Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him) complained to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): O Messenger of Allah, I cannot sleep at night because of insomnia. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: When you go to your bed, say: O Allah, Lord of the seven heavens and what they shade, Lord of the seven earths and what they contain, Lord of the devils and what they misguide, be a protection for me from the evil of all Your creation, lest any of them wrong me or transgress against me. The one who is under Your protection is honoured; may You be glorified and praised, there is no god beside You, there is no god but You.\u201d\nThese hadiths are da\u2018if, as has been determined by the scholars such as Ibn Hajar in Nataij al-Afkar, 3/114 and al-Matalib al-\u2018Aliyah, 4/20; and by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Da\u2019ifah, 2403, and others.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "A 12-year-old Muslim girl whose father is an atheist and her mother is Christian; they revile her Lord and her Prophet -- what should she do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.1.\nWe were very happy to receive your letter with the good news that you have entered Islam. We believe that your joy in belonging to Islam is joy that will last a lifetime. The greatest blessing that Allah can bestow upon any of His slaves is to guide him and open his heart to Islam. We ask Allah to complete and perfect the blessing of faith and well-being for you and to make you steadfast in following it until the Day when you meet the Lord of the Worlds.\u00a0\n2.\nWe are very happy to learn that you love Islam and want to adhere to its laws. We think that this is a sign of blessing that Allah has bestowed upon you. We also feel that you have tasted the sweetness of faith at a time when many of those who belong to Islam in name only are deprived of it.\n3.\nWe are very sad to learn about your parents and their disbelief in Allah, may He be exalted, and we are even more sad to learn of their reviling Allah, may He be exalted and His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), even though Allah is their Lord, Creator and Provider and the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is the Seal of the Prophets, concerning whom Allah took a covenant from every Prophet \u2013 and, by implication, their followers -- that they would follow His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), if Muhammad was sent when they were still alive. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd (remember) when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: \u2018Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allaah), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.\u2019 Allaah said: \u2018Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?\u2019 They said: \u2018We agree.\u2019 He said: \u2018Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).\u2019\n82.\u00a0Then whoever turns away after this, they are the Faasiqoon (rebellious: those who turn away from Allaah\u2019s obedience).\n83.\u00a0Do they seek other than the religion of Allaah (the true Islamic Monotheism __ worshipping none but Allaah Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned.\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:81-83].\u00a0\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that whoever hears of him but does not follow him or believe in him, Allah will forbid Paradise to him:\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cBy the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no one among this nation, Jew or Christian, hears of me then dies not believing in that with which I was sent, but he will be one of the people of the Fire.\u201d\nNarrated by Muslim, 153.\u00a0\nImam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), \u201cno one among this nation... hears of me... \u201d mean: anyone who is alive during my lifetime and afterwards, until the Day of Resurrection; all of them are obliged to obey me. He only mentioned the Jews and Christians by way of example, but it includes all others, because the Jews and Christians have a Scripture; if this is the case with regard to them, even though they have a Scripture, then it applies even more so to those who did not have a Scripture. And Allah knows best. Sharh Muslim.\u00a0\n4.\nWe understand very well the difficulty of the circumstances in which you find yourself, and we ask Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to make things easy for you and to grant you relief and a way out from the situation that you are in. But even though your situation is difficult, it is not confusing or unclear. First and foremost, you are enjoined to obey Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in that which He has enjoined upon you. So do what He has enjoined upon you of acts of worship and avoid that which He has forbidden to you of haraam things. This alone is the way of guidance. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cSay: Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, but if you turn away, he (Messenger Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) is only responsible for the duty placed on him (i.e. to convey Allaah\u2019s Message) and you for that placed on you. If you obey him, you shall be on the right guidance. The Messenger\u2019s duty is only to convey (the message) in a clear way (i.e. to preach in a plain way)\u201d\n[al-Noor 24:54].\u00a0\nEven though you are enjoined to treat your parents kindly and keep good company with them, even if they are disbelievers, that does not mean that you should disobey your Lord in order to please them or that you should put obedience towards them before obedience towards Allah, may He be exalted; rather obedience towards Allah and obedience towards His Messenger takes precedence over all things and over obedience towards anyone. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do\u201d\n[al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:8].\u00a0\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nHere Allah, may He be exalted, is commanding His slaves to treat parents kindly, after urging them to adhere to Tawheed (belief in His Oneness), because the parents are the reason why a person exists and he is obliged to treat them with the utmost kindness. But despite this injunction to be kind, compassionate and good towards them in return for their previous kind treatment, He says \u201cbut if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not\u201d, meaning: If they try to make you follow them in their religion, if they are mushrikeen, then beware of doing so and do not obey them in that, for you will all return to Me on the Day of Resurrection, and I will reward you for your kindness towards them and your patience in adhering to your religion, and I will gather you with the righteous, not with the group of your parents, even if you were the closest of people to them in this world, because on the Day of Resurrection, each person will be gathered with those whom he loves, namely spiritual love. Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah and the other articles of Faith) and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall make them enter with (in the entrance of) the righteous (in Paradise)\u201d [al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:9]. End quote.\nTafseer Ibn Katheer, 6/264-265\u00a0\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere is no obedience if it involves disobedience towards Allaah; obedience is only in that which is right and proper.\u201d\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (7257) and Muslim (1840).\u00a0\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to Allah, may He glorified and exalted.\u201d\nNarrated by Ahmad (1089); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.\u00a0\nBased on that: if anything your parents tell you to do contradicts the command of Allah and His Messenger, then do not obey your parents; rather you should give precedence to obeying Allah and His Messenger. There is nothing wrong with that.\u00a0\nBut this does not mean that all the rights of your parents over you are waived; rather Allah, may He be exalted, enjoins treating them kindly and in a good manner despite that. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cBut if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do\u201d\n[Luqmaan 31:15].\u00a0\nWe believe that what we have explained to you of the Islamic view of this problem will be sufficient to offer you a solution, at least from a theoretical point of view.\u00a0\n5.\nBut there remains the practical aspect, which is the most difficult aspect of your problem, because of your particular circumstances and the fact that you are very young, which means that you cannot be independent and do what you think is correct. You should remember that Allah will not give you a burden that is greater than what you are able to bear. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAllaah burdens not a person beyond his scope\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:286]\n\u201cAllaah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him\u201d\n[al-Talaaq 65:7]\n\u201cSo keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can\u201d\n[al-Taghaabun 64:16]\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf I command you to do something, then do as much of it as you can.\u201d\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (6858) and Muslim (1337).\u00a0\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAllaah has forgiven my ummah for mistakes and forgetfulness, and what they are forced to do.\u201d\nNarrated by Ibn Maajah (2045) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh ibn Maajah.\u00a0\n6.\nAs that is the case, you have to strive to do everything you can of the Islamic obligations and avoid everything that you can of haraam things. You have to hasten to do that as much as you are able. If they tell you not to pray in front of them, then pray behind their backs. If they tell you not to wear complete hijab or you are not able to get any Islamic clothing, then make your clothing as close as possible to Islamic clothing, even if you learn how to make that for yourself or something close to it. If they ask you to go to church, then make any excuse not to go and avoid it as much as possible; make up excuses which will get you out of that. Not all Christians in the West, or in the East, go to church; rather it is very few among them who do that.\u00a0\nSimilarly, try to avoid parties in which there is dancing and singing, and to avoid anything they tell you to do which involves sin, by means of any excuse that you can make up. If they force you to attend parties, then avoid dancing, especially if that is with men or in the presence of men. Pretend to be sick or anything else that will get you out of it.\u00a0\nWhatever they force you to do of haraam things, then do the minimum of it. Make your clothes as covering as possible and on their special occasions do not stay at their parties until the end. And do the same with regard to all haraam things.\u00a0\nIn general, strive to do whatever you can of Islamic rituals and to avoid whatever you can avoid. If they force you to do anything of that nature, then do it outwardly only, and let your heart always be connected to Allah and remembrance of Him, until Allah grants you a way out of your situation. Be optimistic that a way out will come soon and that after hardship comes ease:\n\u201cAnd whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\n3.\u00a0And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things\u201d\n[al-Talaaq 65:2-3]\n7.\nWe advise you to keep in touch with Muslim sisters, whether in real life or through the Internet. We also advise you to contact Islamic websites that will help you with your religious commitment and from which you can learn to strengthen your faith and increase your knowledge. If you can get in touch with an Islamic centre that is close to you, that will be very good in sha Allah. Perhaps, because of their experience of the local region and familiarity with a lot of these problems, they will be able to offer more practical help and solutions than we are able to.\u00a0\n8.\nRemember that some of those who came to Islam before you went through difficult circumstances, as they were punished and beaten by their parents and deprived of their human rights, but they bore that hardship with patience for the sake of Allah until the help of Allah came to them and Allah saved them from that situation and they prevailed by the blessing and grace of Allah and became victorious. So do not despair because of what has happened to you and do not be upset by your situation, for Allah is taking care of you and He hears and sees all. Be steadfast in adhering to guidance and truth as those who came before you were patient. Remember that this is a test from Allah to show the sincerity of your faith and He will give you the best reward for it in this world and in the Hereafter. Perhaps Allah will send His help and support to you sooner rather than later.\u00a0\n9.\nYour parents need you to save them from the fire of Hell and the wrath of Allah, so we advise you to show them the best image of a true Muslim woman, by treating them kindly, honouring them, speaking gently to them, taking care of their food and drink and serving them. Perhaps they will think again and reduce the pressure on you or stop it altogether. We also advise you to pray sincerely and ask Allah to guide them to Islam and bless them with faith, for that is not difficult for Allah. Listen to this story:\u00a0\nMuslim (2491) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I used to call my mother to Islam when she was a mushrik. I called her one day and she said to me something about the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that I disliked. I came to the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) weeping, and said: O Messenger of Allaah, I have been calling my mother to Islam but she refuses. I called her today and she said to me something about you that I disliked. Pray to Allaah to guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah. The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cO Allaah, guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah.\u201d I went out, feeling optimistic because of the du\u2019aa\u2019 of the Prophet of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). When I came near the door, I found it closed. My mother heard my footsteps and said: Stay where you are, O Abu Hurayrah! I heard the sound of water. She did ghusl then she put on her chemise and quickly put on her head cover, then she opened the door and said: O Abu Hurayrah, I bear witness that there is no god but Allaah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. He said: I went back to the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and I came to him, weeping with joy. I said: O Messenger of Allaah, be of good cheer, for Allaah has answered your prayer and has guided the mother of Abu Hurayrah. He praised and glorified Allaah and said good things.\u00a0\n10.\nWe do not advise you to run away or leave home, because the bad consequences of that greater than the bad consequences of staying at home, and because anyone who offers you refuge may expose himself to the most severe punishment under the unjust law of your country. We can offer you no advice except to be patient and stop thinking about running away from home.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah, the Most High and All Powerful, to make you steadfast in following guidance and to grant you well being both spiritual and physical; we ask Him to guide your parents to Islam and to give you the joy of seeing them as righteous believers in this world and in the Hereafter.\u00a0\nWe hope that you will keep in touch with us, for we all your family and your brothers. Perhaps, as the result of the prayers of your brothers and sisters who read your story, Allah will benefit you thereby and grant you a way out of hardship by His blessing.\u00a0\nAnd Allah is the source of strength."

        "question": "Ruling on bringing a servant into the home",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    In the earliest days, the Muslims used to have slaves, female \n    and male, who used to serve them. Slavery was abolished [in Saudi Arabia] in \n    1386 AH, and there are no slaves any more. The people began to bring female \n    servants from some other countries such as the Philippines, Sri Lanka etc. \n    In this situation the people had no choice but to bring servants. It is \n    permissible for a woman to bring a servant, but she should make sure that \n    she is a Muslim and that she is trustworthy and there is no fear of her \n    causing harm, and that she adheres to the rulings of Islam, is modest and \n    observes hijaab; she should avoid meeting men, and if any man enters the \n    house she should wear hijaab as women do in front of non-mahram men. Bringing such a servant should be the matter of necessity, and when the wife is able to do without her, she should be sent back to her family. (If these conditions are met), then it is permissible to bring servants according to need."

        "question": "A young man wants to follow the Sunnah but his father is Shi\u2019i and wants to prevent him from following true guidance. What advice can you give?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Firstly, we praise Allah for having guided you to the \n      truth, and we ask Him to make you steadfast and help you to attain all \n      that is good. Remember that you have been greatly blessed, and if you \n      devote your entire life and wealth for that purpose, that will be little \n      in return for that blessing. Do you know how many millions of people of \n      your father\u2019s background worship rocks and human beings? Do you know that \n      all these people believe that the Qur'aan is distorted and they regard the \n      Sahaabah as kaafirs, apart from a few of them? Do you know that these \n      people have revived the shirk of Jaahiliyyah and added more forms of shirk \n      than were known in the past?\u00a0\n\n    We do not call people to anything except worship of Allah, \n    may He be exalted, and we also call people to venerate and respect the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and not to impugn his \n    honour or slander his Companions. As we love all of the Sahaabah and pray \n    that Allah be pleased with them, and we seek to draw closer to Allah by \n    loving them, we also love and respect the people of the Prophet's household \n    (Ahl al-Bayt), and we seek to draw closer to Allah by loving them.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to your dealings with your father, what we advise \n    you is:\u00a0\n\n    1.Be kind in your dealings with \n    him as much as possible.\n\n    2.Strive to serve him as much as \n    you are able, and do not spare any effort in doing so. Do not withhold any \n    help or kind treatment from him.\n\n    3.Focus on your studies and do \n    not let your neglect of them be a cause of you losing your religious \n    commitment. What we understand from your message is that your father wants \n    to take steps to prevent you from accessing our site and other beneficial \n    Islamic sites because of your studies. So do not give him that excuse; study \n    and progress in your studies; close the door to your father\u2019s shaytaan so \n    that he will not be able to make the issue of your studies a means of \n    preventing you from following true guidance.\n\n    4.Do not make an open show of \n    visiting useful Islamic websites in front of him, and do not make an open \n    show of your following the path of Ahl al-Sunnah in front of him. Even more \n    important is not arguing and debating with regard to good matters, because \n    doing that openly may motivate him to prevent you from following the path of \n    true guidance.\n\n    5.Pray for him and for all of \n    your family to be guided to the right path. Strive to make this du\u2019aa\u2019 when \n    you are prostrating and during the last third of the night.\n\n    6.Finally, we advise you to use \n    wisdom in dealing with your father. If he teaches you to pray in the Shi\u2019i \n    manner and you cannot reject it, then accept it from him and pretend to \n    agree with him, but pray in the manner established in the sound Sunnah. With \n    regard to the way the prayer is done, the matter is broad in scope in sha \n    Allah, and you come under the heading of one who is forced to do something. \n    You are at an age when you are not old enough to separate from him, so be \n    patient until the time comes when you can leave, then if Allah guides your \n    father before that, you can stay with them, or you can leave and live \n    independently, so as to protect your religious commitment.\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on asking for divorce because of depression",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe depression that people feel may be a sickness that needs to be treated and needs referral to specialists; or it may be feelings of distress that may be relieved by doing a lot of acts of worship, remembering Allah, keeping company with good and righteous friends, and keeping busy with beneficial actions. For more information on that please see the answer to questions number 22704, 21515 and 100774.\u00a0\nWhatever the case, Allah has not sent down any disease but He has sent down a cure for it, and there is a remedy for this depression no matter what type it is. The believer should adorn himself with patience and certainty of faith, and he should turn to Allah a great deal and ask of Him, because the keys to goodness are in His hand. How many believing men and women have patiently borne a sickness or calamity or imprisonment, without feeling the need to commit a haraam action. This is the action of people who are discontent with the divine decree and are not patient in accepting what Allah wills; they hasten to rid themselves of what has befallen them by any means, no matter what negative consequences it leads to in this world or the Hereafter. \u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nIt is not permissible for a woman to ask her husband for divorce except for a legitimate shar\u2019i reason which prevents her from continuing with him, such as his bad treatment or her being put off by him to the extent that she cannot give him his rights. That is because of the reports narrated by Abu Dawood (2226), al-Tirmidhi (1187) and Ibn Maajah (2055) from Thawbaan (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAny woman who asks her husband for a divorce when it is not absolutely necessary, the fragrance of Paradise will be forbidden to her.\u201d\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\nAnd it was narrated from \u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThose who ask for khula\u2019 are hypocrite women.\u201d Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer (17/339); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019. No/ 1934.\u00a0\nIf we assume that the wife in her state of anger, sickness or depression asked her husband for a divorce, when she calms down she will realize her mistake and ask Allah for forgiveness and apologize to her husband. \u00a0\nIf the depression and hardship stem from her relationship with her husband, because of his bad treatment or because she dislikes him, and this is proven by trustworthy people from her family, then they should try to bring about reconciliation and consult the husband with regard to that, so as to reach a solution which will bring the wife out of the state of depression in which she is living.\u00a0\nOur advice to the questioner -- who has mentioned that the reason for her depression is being far away from her family -- is that she should be patient and try to get over this crisis.\u00a0\nDepression -- in most cases -- happens to the person who has too much free time, who is not keeping himself busy with useful work, whether it has to do with matters of the Hereafter or with worldly matters.\u00a0\nKeep yourself busy by doing useful things; join a circle for memorizing the Holy Qur'aan; get to know trustworthy sisters who are religiously committed and of good character, and work with them in doing good deeds.\u00a0\nYou can make an agreement with your husband that you can visit your family from time to time, and we also encourage your family to visit you as well.\u00a0\nThe husband has to put up with what he may encounter from his wife, and try to support her and help her to get over this crisis. It is essential for the husband, the wife and her family to cooperate so that things may go back to normal.\u00a0\nAs for divorce, stop thinking about it and overcome the depression that you are faced with. Seek the help of Allah and call upon Him a great deal.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to set your affairs straight and to help you to do all that is good.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Advice and guidelines for someone who cannot mix with people and prefers to stay home alone",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe situation you are in does not only have to do with praying in the mosque, rather it has to do with other duties which require you to go out of the house, such as upholding ties of kinship, earning money so that you can live, seeking knowledge, enjoining what is good, forbidding what is evil, and so on.\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe fact of the matter is that mixing may sometimes be obligatory or mustahabb. An individual may be enjoined to mix with others sometimes and to remain alone sometimes. That depends on the purpose. If mixing with others is for the purpose of cooperating in righteousness and piety, then it is enjoined; but if it is for the purpose of cooperating in sin and transgression, then it is forbidden. Mixing with Muslims is a kind of worship, as in the case of the five daily prayers, Jumu\u2019ah, Eid, eclipse prayers, prayers for rain and so on. This is something that Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) have enjoined. The same applies to mixing with them on Hajj and when fighting the kuffaar and rebels, even if the leaders of that are evildoers and even if there are some evildoers among the people involved.\u00a0\nThe same applies to being involved in gatherings that increase a person's faith, either because he benefits from these gatherings or he can benefit others, and so on.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa, 10/425\u00a0\nThus you can see that the way you are is something that is not pleasing to the Lord of the Worlds, and you have to look again at the situation and realise that what you are doing is a trick from the shaytaan who is making your situation and your bad deed look good to you. Beware of him and his tricks, and get ready to fight him, and trust that your Lord will help you by granting victory against him.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nIf you feel distress when mixing with people, then we can be certain that you will never be better off on your own or in isolation. Rather the wolf eats the sheep that wanders off from the flock and the shaytaan overpowers those who are solitary and do not have helpers to help them obey their Lord or supporters who will support them against the shaytaan and his troops. Even if you find some annoyance in mixing with people, that mixing, if you bear it with patience, is still better than not mixing. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) praised the one who mixes with people and bears their annoyance with patience.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Ibn \u2018Umar said: The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe believer who mixes with people and bears their annoyance with patience will have a greater reward than the one who does not mix with people and does not put up with their annoyance.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (5207) and Ibn Maajah (4032).\u00a0\nMoreover, there is no reason for your isolation and you do not have -- as far as we can see -- any justification for which we would encourage you to remain like that. We feel that any isolation which results in you not praying jumu\u2019ah for prayers in congregation is not acceptable and we do not encourage it.\u00a0\nSome of the reasons for isolation include total corruption of people, lack of people to support you in adhering to the truth, each person admiring his own opinion, and lack of benefit in sincerely advising people. By Allah's grace, none of these are applicable in Muslim societies or even in kaafir societies. We have heard of thousands of kuffaar who are entering the religion of Allah all the time, and we hear of others like them, sinners who have begun to follow the path of guidance. Indeed we find that people are thirsting for those who will quench their thirst and they are hungry for those who will feed them, in spiritual terms of goodness and guidance.\u00a0\nAs for your justification for isolation, namely shar\u2019i knowledge, we do not think this is the case. You are preferring isolation to the kind of mixing that is obligatory, so if you are neglecting Islamic duties because of this isolation of yours, what kind of sha\u2019i knowledge do you have so that we could tell you to keep away from people and focus on obeying your Lord and preserving your religious commitment? Hence Abu Sulaymaan al-Khattaabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Isolation only benefits scholars and wise men, but it is the most harmful of things for the ignorant. And he narrated from Ibraaheem that he said to Mugheerah: Acquire deep understanding of Islam, then you can isolate yourself.\u00a0\nSee: al-\u2018Azlah by al-Khattaabi, p. 225\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nAs you have written to us -- and we appreciate that -- this means that you are still holding on to a thread and the beginning of the right way to bring you out of this fatal loneliness. You have entered the world of the Internet, which is millions of times greater than your small world that you have forsaken. In this vast world there is far more evil than in your forsaken world. So beware of that, for how much temptation it has caused to righteous people and how much evil it has caused to righteous and chaste women.\u00a0\nStrive to do the acts of worship which Allah has enjoined on you, first and foremost among which is praying in congregation in the mosque. In the answer to question number 8918 you will find the evidence for this duty. You also have to earn permissible income so as to protect your dignity and spare you from having to ask of people, and so that you can honour your parents and take care of them and help them to buy what they need or help them to get to the places they want to go, and uphold ties of kinship with your family and relatives.\u00a0\nYou should remember that this world will never be free of hardships, worries and distress. If you want a place where there is none of these things, with complete happiness and ease, a good life and the pleasure of Allah, then you will find that in the Paradise of Allah in the Hereafter. So strive for that Day and rid yourself of that which may cause you distress in this world by reducing your involvement in it; ask Allah to help you to attain that, and remember that isolating oneself is nothing more than being alone with the Shaytaan, and it will only bring you more worries and distress. Do you not see that the punishment of imprisonment is painful for the free man, and the worst form of it is solitary confinement? So how can you prefer for yourself that which prisoners would sacrifice that which is most dear to them in order to escape? \u00a0\nWe ask Allah to guide you to the truth and to help you to follow the path of the righteous among His slaves; were it not for the fact that Allah decreed that they should mix with people and establish acts of worship, we and you would not have known Islam or had the honour of belonging to it. So become one of the troops of Islam, wield your weapon in the face of your shaytaan and make up for what you have missed by striving hard and doing acts of worship on a solid basis.\u00a0\nAnd Allah is the source of strength."

        "question": "She married an American man who announced his Islam, then he stopped praying and denied that Allah created the heavens. What should she do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allah to make things easy for you and to give you a \n    way out of hardship and relief from distress.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to remain married to \n    a kaafir, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cO you who believe! When believing women come to you as \n    emigrants, examine them; Allaah knows best as to their Faith, then if you \n    ascertain that they are true believers send them not back to the \n    disbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the \n    disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them\u201d\n\n    [al-Mumtahanah 60:10].\u00a0\n\n    Although the scholars differed as to whether the one who does \n    not pray is a kaafir or not, they did not differ as to whether the one who \n    denies that Allah created the heavens and the earth is a kaafir.\u00a0\n\n    If a Muslim apostatises, his marriage to his Muslim wife is \n    rendered null and void. If he comes back to Islam, then their marriage is \n    reinstated, but if her \u2018iddah ends and he is still insisting on apostasy, \n    then she is now in charge of her own affairs and may marry someone else if \n    she wishes. Based on that, if your husband persists in his ways, then the \n    marriage between you is annulled according to sharee\u2019ah and you are no \n    longer his wife.\u00a0\n\n    You have to strive to get out of this marriage by whatever \n    means, either by talaaq or khula\u2019 or something else.\u00a0\n\n    Beware of making the children a barrier between you and \n    leaving this man.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Many women -- Allah forbid -- are prevented by the presence \n    of children from seeking annulment of marriage. This is a serious matter. It \n    should be said: Annul the marriage; it is not permissible you to stay with \n    this kaafir who does not pray. Your children will never leave you so long as \n    their father is like this. He has no guardianship over them, because the \n    kaafir can have guardianship over a believer. \u201cAnd never will Allaah \n    grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers\u201d [al-Nisa\u2019 \n    4:141]. So you and your children cannot be separated. As for this \n    husband, there is nothing good in him. You should forsake this kaafir \n    husband and it is haraam to let him be intimate with you; this is a great \n    evil. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Sharh al-Mumti\u2019 \u2018ala Zaad al-Mustaqni\u2019, \n    12/250\u00a0\n\n    We advise you to take your case to the Islamic centres in \n    your country and to the Muslims, and ask them for help. They know better \n    than us how to deal with this problem, as they are present in that country.\u00a0\n\n    We criticise your family's attitude towards you. We \n    understand from your question that you chose this husband and chose to live \n    with him without your family's approval. This was a great mistake on your \n    part, and you have paid the price for that, but that does not mean that your \n    family should abandon you. Keep getting in touch with them and ask good and \n    wise people among your relatives to mediate between you and them so that \n    they will help you and stand beside you during this difficult time.\u00a0\n\n    You should understand that what is happening to you now is \n    the result of previous mistakes, among the greatest of which were getting \n    married and travelling without your family's approval, then choosing to \n    reside in a kaafir state rather than living in a Muslim land.\u00a0\n\n    This is the price for living in that doomed land.\u00a0\n\n    You have to try to leave that country without delay, and go \n    back to your family and your country; take the children with you and bring \n    them up in Islam, teach them to memorise the Book of Allah, instead of them \n    seeing the bad example that prevents them from following the true path.\u00a0\n\n    Hence it is right that you should weep night and day for how \n    you have ended up. But weeping does not achieve any benefit. So hasten to do \n    something and strive to change this situation, by annulling the marriage \n    contract and not letting him be intimate with you, and by returning to your \n    family and your country.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allah to make things easy for you and to protect your \n    religious commitment and to make your children righteous.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "She has committed sin and wants to repent",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    We ask Allah to guide you and accept your repentance.\u00a0\n\n    We advise you not to tell your husband about this matter and \n    strive to repent from it and give it up.\u00a0\n\n    Always bear in mind that Allah is watching you and can see \n    what you are doing at all times. This is most likely to make you feel shy \n    before Him and venerate Him.\u00a0\n\n    You should always remember death and the Hereafter and the \n    Reckoning. If a person remembers death a great deal he will inevitably \n    prepare for it by doing righteous deeds and repenting from sin.\u00a0\n\n    Cut off all ties with this girl immediately. If you can move \n    from that job, that is essential. Continuing the relationship between you \n    means that there is no repentance and that the sin will continue.\u00a0\n\n    Rather we tell you: if you can move from that city \n    altogether, then do that and do not hesitate.\u00a0\n\n    There is no remedy for this disease except keeping away from \n    that girl altogether.\u00a0\n\n    As for your prayer being accepted, that is up to Allah, but \n    be wary of giving up prayer; rather you should strive to do a great deal of \n    it and to read Qur'aan, in the hope that this may be a means of Allah \n    accepting your repentance and guiding you.\u00a0\n\n    Listen to lectures and exhortations by well-known scholars \n    and daa\u2019iyahs who are known for their trustworthiness, religious commitment, \n    sincerity and knowledge. Think about how Allah is forbearing towards you. \n    How can He be forbearing when you are persisting in disobeying Him? If He so \n    willed, He could punish you for this sin and you would have a bad end. Think \n    about how Allah has concealed your sin. What would you do if your husband \n    and other people found out what you are doing; it would be a big scandal. \n    How would your life be after that? So hasten to repent before Allah hastens \n    your death or punishment, in which case regret would be to no avail.\u00a0\n\n    The gate of repentance is open and Allah accepts the \n    repentant slave and rejoices over him; He forgives him and accepts his \n    repentance no matter what his sin. The one who repent from sin is like one who did not sin at all.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allah to guide you."

        "question": "He married her without the knowledge of his first wife, then his secret was found out, and he is still not giving her her rights with regard to his staying overnight with her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    When a husband conceals his second marriage, in most cases \n    that leads to some kind of injustice for his new wife, as he will be \n    confused and uncertain and will be afraid that he may do something that \n    would lead to his first wife finding out that he has taken a second wife. \n    This may lead him into a series of mistakes.\u00a0\n\n    As you agreed to that at first, then you have to put up with \n    what happens to you in some ways and you have to try to set things straight \n    in other ways.\u00a0\n\n    If your husband had an excuse -- in your view -- before his \n    marriage to you was discovered, then he has no excuse now. What he has to do \n    is to teach you and his first wife fairly with regard to spending the night. \n    However many nights he spends there, he has to spend the same number of \n    nights with you, and you have the right to demand this right which Allaah \n    has obliged him to give and that Allaah has given to you. If he persists in \n    refusing, then you have the choice: either you can accept your life with him \n    and put up with it until Allaah grants you relief -- which is what we \n    recommend -- or you can choose to leave him.\u00a0\n\n    As the matter has been discovered, we advise you to appoint \n    as an intermediary someone who has knowledge and is of good character, who \n    can intervene between you to resolve your problem with him and make him do \n    that which Allaah has obliged him to do of treating you and his first wife \n    fairly, and registering your daughter officially.

        "question": "His wife behaves badly towards him and he has children from her. Should he divorce her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Many women do not understand the difference between jealousy, \n    doubt and suspicion, and they do not understand that this jealousy could \n    destroy the marriage and lead to break-up of the family. When will women \n    understand that?\u00a0\n\n    This jealousy on the part of the wife of the brother who is \n    asking this question is going to destroy trust between her and her husband, \n    and lead to her wrecking her home with her own hands. This way of treating \n    the husband will destroy his love for her and cause it to be replaced with \n    hatred; it will destroy his desire to continue the marriage and will bring \n    it to a hasty end.\u00a0\n\n    The wise wife is the one who weighs up matters carefully and \n    does not cause trouble to her husband or develop doubt and suspicion about \n    his normal activities. Rather she strives to generate trust between her and \n    him and to lay the foundations of love and happiness between her and him, so \n    that their married life will be harmonious, otherwise she will soon be \n    numbered among the divorcees.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    Our advice to the husband is to take it easy and not be \n    hasty. The nature of women is different from that of men, and there is no \n    one who is happy with his wife but there is some crookedness in her actions \n    and behaviour, which may be more or less according to her level of religious \n    commitment, common sense and good behaviour.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of \n    Allaah (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWoman is created \n    from a rib that will never become straight. So if you enjoy her, then enjoy \n    her with the crookedness that is in her, for if you try to straighten her \n    you will break her, and breaking her means divorcing her.\u201d Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari (3153) and Muslim (1468).\u00a0\n\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    This hadeeth indicates being kind towards women and treating \n    them gently, and putting up with crookedness in their nature and the \n    possibility of weakness in their intellect, and shows that it is not right \n    to divorce them for no reason, and that a man should not hope to straighten \n    her.\u00a0\n\n    Sharh Muslim (10/57).\u00a0\n\n    What we think you should do is put up with her attitude and \n    try to reconcile with her and increase her knowledge and faith, giving her \n    what is required for that of beneficial books and tapes and good companions. \n    And you should make your kind treatment of her another means of achieving \n    that, as well as offering a great deal of supplication.\u00a0\n\n    You should understand that divorce is a means of breaking up \n    and scattering families, and it affects the wife and children in most cases. \n    Many people put up with bad behaviour on the part of their wives for the \n    sake of their children and in the interests of the children, so that they \n    raise them in a good way so that they could help their mother to be obedient \n    and to mend her ways. This is something that is tried and tested, and this \n    is what we think you should do.\u00a0\n\n    But if you cannot put up with her behaviour and you would end \n    up mistreating her and denying her her rights, then divorce her. Perhaps she \n    will come to her senses after the first or second divorce (talaaq), but if \n    she persists in the way she is behaving and you cannot put up with her, then \n    there are many other women besides her and Allaah says (interpretation of \n    the meaning):\n\n    \u201cBut if they separate \n    (by divorce), Allaah will provide abundance for everyone of them from His \n    Bounty. And Allaah is Ever All\u2011Sufficient for His creatures\u2019 needs, All\u2011Wise\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:130].\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah is the source of strength."

        "question": "He said to his fianc\u00e9e: If you conceal anything from me, you will be haraam to me after marriage",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe fianc\u00e9 or husband has no right to ask about his wife's past. It is sufficient for him that she is righteous and is known for good at the time of marrying her, and there is nothing wrong with her religious commitment or chastity. As to whether she did anything haraam in the past, but then repented from it and became righteous, it is wrong to ask her about that and make her choose between telling lies or getting divorced, or make her tell her secrets and disclose that which Allaah had concealed for her, then if she tells him the truth, that opens the door to doubt and suspicion.\u00a0\nWhat some people call for, of each spouse being frank with the other and telling them of things in the past that Allaah has concealed, is wrong and ignorant. Rather they should be pleased that Allaah has concealed it and they should praise Allaah for it.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nA wife or fianc\u00e9e is not obliged to tell us what happened in the past that Allaah has concealed. Rather she must conceal herself, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAvoid this filth that Allaah has forbidden. Whoever does any such thing, then let him conceal it with the concealment of Allaah.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, no. 663).\u00a0\nAnd Muslim (2590) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAllaah does not conceal a person in this world but Allaah will conceal him on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d\u00a0\nIf her husband or fianc\u00e9 persists in asking, then she may use a double entendre, such as saying: Nothing happened between me and that man -- meaning that nothing happened today or yesterday, because she is enjoined to conceal it and there is no interest to be served in telling him. So it is prescribed for her to use a double entrendre, and in fact some scholars said that it is permissible to tell a lie in that case. For more details on that please see the answer to question number 83093.\u00a0\nBased on that, we hope that there will be no sin on you because of the lie that you told, although it would have been better to use a double entendre.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nIf a man says to his fianc\u00e9e: You will be haraam to me after the wedding if you concealed anything from me, then she conceals something from him, she will not be divorced and no zihaar will take place, because divorce and zihaar can only take place after marriage, and the fianc\u00e9 is saying this before the marriage contract has taken place. So no divorce or zihaar takes place.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It should be noted that divorce can only take place after marriage, because it is the dissolution of the marriage bond. So before marriage there is no divorce. Even if a man says to a woman: If I marry you, then you are divorced, then he marries her, she is not divorced. Or if a man's wife said to him: I heard that you want to take a second wife and I do not agree to that, and she put pressure on him, and he said to her: Will you be pleased if I say that if I marry a woman, she is divorced? And she said: I am pleased with that, then he said it and did not get married, and if he did get married she would not be divorced, because that took place before the marriage. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti\u2019 (13/7).\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to accept your repentance and to set your affairs straight.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

She should not be an obstacle in the way of the \n    happiness of her husband\u2019s family.\u00a0\nThe smart wife is wise in her dealings if she \n    sees some shortcomings in the way he treats his children and wife, and she is wise if she sees him exaggerating in his concern for his family at \n    the expense of his wife and children. So she makes him aware of his mistake by hinting, not by stating it bluntly, and she advises him without \n    hurting his feelings, and shows him the right way without making him feel that he is wrong, letting him feel that she loves his family and cares \n    for them.\u00a0\nA woman should not think that her husband\u2019s \n    care for his family will make him fall short in his duties towards her and his children. There is a difference between a husband falling short in \n    his duties towards his wife and children and his loving his family. What makes a man care for his family is his love for them, not his negligence \n    towards his wife and children.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nYour husband has rights and you have duties. \n    Each of you should do that which is enjoined upon him or her by sharee\u2019ah. Sharee\u2019ah cannot make a man stop loving his family because he has got \n    married, and we cannot ask him to suppress his feelings for the sake of his wife and children. They were his family before he got married and they \n    will remain his family after he gets married.\u00a0\nYou have to try hard to deal with your own \n    feelings, and advise your husband when he falls short in his duties towards you and his children. You do not have the right to denounce him for \n    his love for his sister or his family. There is the fear in such situations that the man will say, \u201cI can find a thousand wives but I cannot find \n    another brother or sister.\u201d So beware of making the matter reach that state.\u00a0\nAt the same time we advise the husband to be \n    pay attention to his wife\u2019s feelings and to take care of his wife and children. We also advise the sister to give her brother similar advice.\u00a0\nIslam enjoins doing that which is in the \n    interests of all concerned, so that they may share in building the family, not destroying it. All of us must do the duties that Allaah has \n    enjoined upon us, without exaggeration or neglect.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Guide to the straight path."

        "question": "She dreams of death and is afraid of it",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Fear of death is a feeling that affects most people. Allaah \n    has created man in such a way that he loves life and fears the unknown, and \n    He has made death part of the world of the unseen which cannot be fully \n    understood except by the one who enters it. When a person thinks of it, he \n    cannot help but feel feelings of loneliness and fear or anxiety about that \n    unknown future.\u00a0\n\n    This is the natural explanation for man's fear of death in \n    general.\u00a0\n\n    But the believer who submits to the will and decree of \n    Allaah, and in whose heart love of Allaah is instilled and who thinks \n    positively of Allaah realises that by his death he is returning to a \n    generous Lord and a merciful God, Who will reward him for good deeds with \n    good things and Who will pardon his bad deeds by His mercy and forgiveness. \n    That is only for the believer who puts his trust in Allaah and whose heart \n    is humble before Him, the Accepter of repentance. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    \u201cNo doubt! Verily, the Awliya\u2019 [close friends] of Allaah, \n    no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve. 63.\u00a0Those who \n    believed, and used to fear Allaah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and \n    sins and by doing righteous deeds). 64.\u00a0For them are glad tidings, in \n    the life of the present world, and in the Hereafter. No change can there be \n    in the Words of Allaah. This is indeed the supreme success\u201d\n\n    [Yoonus 10:62-64]\n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\n    \n\n    Here Allaah is telling us that His close friends are those \n    who believe and are pious, as their Lord describes them. So everyone who is \n    pious is a friend of Allaah. \u201cNo fear shall come upon them\u201d means \n    with regard to what they encounter of the terrors of the resurrection. \u201cNor \n    shall they grieve\u201d means for what they have left behind them in this \n    world.

Then death will become no more than moving to \n    be under the care of the Most Generous, Most Merciful, may He be glorified, \n    and liberation from the limitations and bonds of this world to the expanse \n    and pleasures of the Hereafter.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated from Abu Qataadah ibn Rib\u2019i that he used to \n    narrate that a funeral passed by the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and \n    peace of Allaah be upon him) and he said: \u201cOne who has found relief and one \n    from whom relief has been found.\u201d They said: O Messenger of Allaah, who are \n    the one who has found relief and the one from whom relief has been found? He \n    said: \u201cThe believing person has found relief from the troubles of this \n    world, and the people, the land, the trees and the animals have found relief \n    from the evil person.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6512) and Muslim (950).\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated from \u2018Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit that the Prophet \n    of Allaah said: \u201cWhoever loves to meet Allaah, Allaah loves to meet him, and \n    whoever hates to meet Allaah, Allaah hates to meet him.\u201d\n\n    \u2018Aa\u2019ishah or one of his wives said: We hate death. He said: \n    \u201cIt is not like that. When the believer is dying, he is given the glad \n    tidings of the pleasure and honour of Allaah, and nothing is dearer to him \n    than that which is ahead of him, and he loves to meet Allaah and Allaah \n    loves to meet him. But when the disbeliever is dying, he is given tidings of \n    the punishment and wrath of Allaah, and nothing is more hated to him than \n    what is ahead of him, and he hates to meet Allaah and Allaah hates to meet \n    him.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6507) and Muslim (2683).\u00a0\n\n    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\n\n    This dislike of death is a natural dislike which stems from a \n    feeling of aversion, which is difficult to bear. Undoubtedly it exists in \n    everyone, except the one who Allaah blesses with love for Him and he \n    realized the beauty of being close to Him. That person\u2019s love for Allaah \n    overwhelms him and he will say when it is his time to depart this world, \n    addressing death and its agonies, as Mu\u2019aadh (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: A beloved one has come at a time most needed, and the one who has \n    any regrets today will never prosper, so take my soul as You will, for by \n    You, my hearts loves You.\u00a0\n\n    al-Mufhim, 2/644\u00a0\n\n    If this meaning is established in your heart and soul, and \n    you have done righteous deeds in preparation for the day of departure from \n    this transient life, death will not harm you if Allaah wills, and your fear \n    of it will be no more than a reason to make you do good and turn to Allaah, \n    not a reason for doom, anxiety, panic or frustration.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked the \n    following question:\n\n    Should the believer not be afraid of death? If that happens, \n    does that mean that he does not want to meet Allaah?\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\n\n    Believing men and women must fear Allaah and put their hope \n    in Him, because Allaah says in His Holy Book (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cso fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true) \n    believers\u201d\n\n    [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:175]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cTherefore fear not men but fear Me\u201d\n\n    [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:44]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cand fear none but Me\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2: 40]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cVerily, those who have believed, and those who have \n    emigrated (for Allaah\u2019s religion) and have striven hard in the way of \n    Allaah, all these hope for Allaah\u2019s Mercy\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:218]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cSo whoever hopes for the Meetingwith \n    his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the \n    worship of his Lord\u201d\n\n    [al-Kahf 18:110]\n\n    There are many similar verses.\u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible for the believer, male or female, to \n    despair of the mercy of Allaah or feel secure against the plan of Allaah. \n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cSay: \u201cO \u2018Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against \n    themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of \n    Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most \n    Merciful\u201d\n\n    [al-Zumar 39:53]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cand never give up hope of Allaah\u2019s Mercy. Certainly no \n    one despairs of Allaah\u2019s Mercy, except the people who disbelieve\u201d\n\n    [Yoosuf 12:87]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cDid they then feel secure against the Plan of Allaah? \n    None feels secure from the Plan of Allaah except the people who are the \n    losers\u201d\n\n    [al-A\u2019raaf 7:99]\n\n    All the Muslims, both male and female, must prepare for death \n    and beware of being heedless, because of the verses quoted above and because \n    of what is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon \n    him) who said: \u201c Frequently remember the destroyer of pleasures \u2013 death.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    and because being heedless about it and not preparing for it \n    are among the causes of a bad end. It is proven that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allaah \n    be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of \n    Allaah upon him) said: \u201cWhoever loves to meet Allaah, Allaah loves to meet \n    him, and whoever hates to meet Allaah, Allaah hates to meet him.\u201d I said: O \n    Prophet of Allaah, do you mean hating death, for all of us hate death? He \n    said: \u201cIt is not like that, but the believer, when he is given glad tidings \n    of Allaah's mercy, pleasure and Paradise, loves to meet Allaah and Allaah \n    loves to meet him. But the disbeliever, when he is given tidings of Allaah\u2019s \n    punishment and wrath, hates to meet Allaah and Allaah hates to meet him.\u201d \n    Agreed upon.\u00a0\n\n    This hadeeth indicates that there is nothing wrong with \n    disliking or fearing death, and that does not indicate that a person does \n    not want to meet Allaah, because when the believer dislikes death or fears \n    its approach, he wants to do more acts of obedience to Allaah and do more to \n    prepare to meet Him. Similarly when the believing woman fears death and does \n    not want it to come to her, she is only doing that in the hope that she can \n    do more acts of obedience and prepare to meet her Lord.

        "question": "Is Suicide Due to Depression Haram?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is suicide haram?\nSuicide is a major sin , and the one who does that is faced with a warning of eternity in the Fire of Hell, where Allah will punish him with the means that he used to commit suicide.\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself will be throwing himself down in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will be sipping it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron will have that iron in his hand, thrusting it into his belly in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhari (5442) and Muslim (109)\nThabit ibn Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever kills himself with something will be punished with it on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhari (5700) and Muslim (110)\nJundub ibn \u2018Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cA man among those who came before you was wounded. He panicked and took a knife and cut his hand, and the bleeding did not stop until he died. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, said: \u2018My slave hastened his death; I have forbidden Paradise to him.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhari (3276) and Muslim (113)\nPatience in the face of calamities and hardship\nThe believer has to be patient and to seek the help of Allah, may He be exalted, and understand that no matter what hardship befalls him in this world -- no matter how severe it is -- the punishment of the Hereafter is worse than it. It is not acceptable according to anyone who is of right mind to run away from the heat of the desert and throw himself into the fire. How can he flee from temporary hardship and difficulty -- which inevitably will come to an end -- to an eternal punishment which has no end?\nThe Muslim should ponder and realise that he is not the only one in this world who is affected by calamity and hardship . Calamities befell the greatest of mankind, namely the prophets, messengers and the righteous. They also befell the worst of mankind, namely the disbelievers and atheists.\nCalamity is part of the natural order of things and hardly anyone is safe from it.\nIf the believer handles it well and is patient, and it becomes a means that makes him turn back to Allah and strive hard in worship and righteous deeds, then the calamity will have been good for him and will be expiation for his sins, and perhaps he will meet Allah with no burden of sin.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cNo pain, hardship, sickness or grief befalls a believer, not even worry that befalls him, but some of his bad deeds will be expiated.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhari (5642) and Muslim (2573)\nAl-Tirmidhi (2399) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cCalamities will continue to befall believing men and women in themselves, their children and their wealth, until they meet Allah with no burden of sin.\u201d (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in\u00a0Silsilat al-Ahadith al-Sahihah\u00a0(2280)\nCommitting suicide because of mental illness\nIf the suicide is due to mental illness that has had such a far-reaching impact on a person\u2019s reason that he is not aware of what he is saying or doing, if in such a case it so happens that he killed himself, then he will not be with the sinners who have committed the major sin of suicide; rather he will be excused. That is because this person was no longer accountable due to severe mental illness that led to loss of reason.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The evidence of the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah indicates that it is obligatory for women for cover their faces. This evidence includes the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way)\u201d\n[al-Ahzaab 33:59]\u00a0\nThe cloak (jilbaab) is a garment that the woman places over her head and lowers over her face.\u00a0\nSo you have to fear Allaah in this matter and respond to two commands: the command of Allaah and the command of your husband. Undoubtedly this will be very good for you. This matter will make your husband happy and bring happiness to your home. Feelings of difficulty will pass if you are patient and get used to it. These feelings of difficulty will turn to joy when you see the effect that your way of dressing has on him, so you will be responding to Islamic commands and the command of your husband which is in accordance with the laws of Allaah. You will be closing the door to the shaytaans of those who may look at you, and will also be protecting the gaze of chaste and good people from looking at something which they are not permitted to see. And there are other benefits which you will see and appreciate when you respond to this command.\u00a0\nSisters who wear niqaab often come to regret the years in which they used to uncover their faces, after Allaah honoured them with the niqaab. If one of them were to be given all the wealth in the world to uncover her face, she would not do it. We have even seen many chaste women who have left their husbands because they wanted them to take off the niqaab. So think about the great difference between your situation and theirs. Where now can we find a man who is keen to keep his family chaste and covered? There are very few of them. Should we disregard these few or should we appreciate their actions which spread good in society?\u00a0\nWe remind you to fear Allaah, and we remind you of the actions of the believing women when they responded to the command of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cand to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)\u201d\n[al-Noor 24:31]\nal-Bukhaari (4481) narrated that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: \u201cWhen this verse was revealed, the muhaajir women took their waist wrappers and tore them at the edges, and covered their faces with them.\u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 21134, which explains the obligation of women covering their faces.\u00a0\nYour husband should also read question no. 20343, which explains the husband\u2019s duty to offer sincere advice to his wife, and ways of doing that.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It seems that the series of \n    sufferings that you are facing with this woman will continue, and the list \n    of her bad deeds will grow longer. Her bad treatment of your little girl \n    will never know any limit; if your daughter was an animal it would not be \n    permissible for her to do what she has done to her.\u00a0\nWe are certain that if your \n    son from her were to suffer as your daughter is suffering because of not \n    being able to go to the bathroom by himself, you would not see him being \n    treated as badly as she is treating your daughter. This -- unfortunately -- \n    happens a lot with the wives of fathers, and many, both male and female, \n    suffer from this.\u00a0\nWhat we advise you to do \n    is:\u00a0\nYou must deal with the \n    matter seriously and quickly, try to instil a sense of love, mercy and \n    compassion in her heart, in the hope that she will stop what she is doing. \n    If you succeed in doing that, then you will have achieved what you want and \n    she will still be your wife.\u00a0\nIf you do not succeed, then \n    you have no choice but divorce. We do not advise you to be hardhearted and \n    harsh, because that will only make her more cruel towards your daughter, and \n    she will find more ways to harm her, whilst concealing the evidence of her \n    misdeeds. Hence if she does not respond to you and change her behaviour, and \n    mend her ways in response to kindness and persuasion, there is no solution \n    that will put an end to your suffering except divorce, sooner rather than \n    later. You are aware of your daughter\u2019s suffering, and you hear her cries, \n    and you see the injury to her face and the burns on her leg and stomach, yet \n    despite that you're still confused because you have a son from her. So how \n    would it be if there were more children then?! But we will not hide anything \n    from you, and we will tell you frankly that with a woman such as this, whom \n    you have divorced twice yet it has not stopped her wrongdoing and \n    aggression, there is no hope for much good in her, and it cannot be expected \n    that she will be kind to your daughter, because mercy cannot be instilled by \n    means of threats or warnings in the heart of one whom Allaah has deprived of \n    it.\u00a0\nIf you think of divorcing \n    her for a third time, or she sees signs of that in you, do not leave your \n    daughter with her, rather leave her with one of your relatives or with \n    trustworthy women among your neighbours or friends, because she might try to \n    take revenge on her because of your divorcing her. We do not know how you \n    are going to deal with the matter, because women vary, hence we are afraid \n    that she may do something to your daughter. With such women there is no \n    regret in separating from them.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to relieve your distress and worry, and to reward you for your calamity, and replace it with good from Him.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

What matters is what \n    people see of a man, not the papers he produces. \u00a0\n\n    Hence if the accusations of your wife\u2019s family are based on \n    things that they have seen you do or words that they have heard you speak, \n    then they may have a reason.

If they recant, \n    then all well and good, otherwise you should shun them, and not let them \n    visit you or let your wife visit them, lest they turn her against you.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to your intention of taking a second wife, what \n    we advise you is to wait and to examine the real motive for that, because \n    often in such cases the decision is based on the desire for revenge against \n    the first wife and her family because of the trouble they caused, and \n    usually when a man marries with this attitude it leads to trouble for the \n    second wife too, if the husband has not set things straight with his first \n    wife and her family.\u00a0\n\n    If you have not set things straight between you and your wife \n    and her family, we think that if you want to take a second wife, you should \n    let the first wife go and divorce her, or you can keep the first wife if you \n    intend to keep both wives if Allaah guides her (the first wife). We also \n    advise you to have a good intention and try to do the right thing, for \n    Allaah says concerning spouses between whom there are difficulties \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cif they both wish for peace, Allaah will cause their \n    reconciliation. Indeed Allaah is Ever All\u2011Knower, Well\u2011Acquainted with all \n    things\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:35]\nWe advise you to fear \n    Allaah with regard to every step you take and not to let this problem cause \n    you to treat her unjustly or to keep reminding her of mistakes that she made \n    but that she has apologized for.\n\n    \u00a0We ask Allaah to set your affairs straight and to make it easy for both of you to do the right thing. And Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "He does not allow his wife to appear in front of his brothers",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    A woman has to cover her entire body, including the face, \n    from men who are strangers to her (i.e., non-mahrams). She should observe \n    hijab even more strictly in front of her husband\u2019s male relatives who are \n    not mahrams for her than in front of strangers. This is the opposite of what \n    most careless people do nowadays. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said, when one of his companions wanted an exception to \n    allow the husband\u2019s relatives to enter upon his wife: \u201cThe in-law is death.\u201d \n    So we must be more cautious with regard to the husband\u2019s relatives \u2013 \n    including his brothers \u2013 because of the carelessness that exists with regard \n    to this matter.\n\n    \u00a0Your brother has done well by not allowing his wife to \n    appear in front of you, and she has done well by obeying the command of \n    Allaah and of her husband. This is not extremism at all; rather it is \n    obedience to the command of Allaah. There is no need for the husband\u2019s \n    brothers to see his wife, let alone sit with her and talk to her.\u00a0\n\n    Those scholars who said it is permissible for a woman to sit \n    with her husband\u2019s relatives only allowed it on condition that there is no \n    suspicion attached to that and that she does not sit alone with one of them, \n    or there is no listening to songs or watching haraam things on the part of \n    either of them. Unfortunately such things happen in most people\u2019s \n    gatherings. If the gathering is free of the above-mentioned evils and haraam \n    things and the woman observes full hijab, then it is permissible for her to \n    sit with them and speak to them, so long as she is not soft in speech. But \n    it is still better and more on the safe side for her not to do that, and \n    this is what your brother has done, so that hearts may remain pure and free \n    of the traps by which the Shaytaan ensnares people.\u00a0\n\n    What your brother has done should not have any effect on your \n    relationship with him or on the relationship of your wives with his wife. \n    They are doing something good and acting in accordance with Islam. You \n    should try to get close to them and learn from them in the way they deal \n    with people. You should note that your brothers\u2019 criticizing their brother \n    for concealing his wife from them and not letting her sit with them makes \n    one have suspicions about them. In sha Allaah they are not that type of \n    people, but the Shaytaan may make something appear attractive to a man so \n    that what is good becomes bad to him, and what is bad becomes good, so he \n    regards covering and modesty as extremism and laxity as trust and progress. \n    \u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to purify our hearts and bodies, and to bring \n    you together in a good way, and to reconcile between you, and to make you a \n    good example to other people.\u00a0\n\n    See also the answers to questions no. \n    21363 and \n    13261\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

See the answer to question no. \n    1200.\u00a0\nWhat you must do is repent \n    to Allaah from what has happened of that, and resolve not to do it again in \n    the future.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nIt is haraam for a woman to \n    strive for her Muslim sister to be divorced, because the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cno woman should ask for her \n    sister to be divorced so as to deprive her of what is rightfully hers and \n    take it for herself.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2140) and Muslim (1413). So \n    it is not permissible to encourage or tempt the husband to divorce his wife. \n    \u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nIf the wish to marry came \n    from the husband, and you did not try to separate him from his wife, it is \n    permissible for you to accept, but we do not advise you to do that for \n    several reasons:\u00a0\n\n    (i)There is no guarantee that this \n    man will not like someone else and choose her over you as he did with his \n    first wife.\n\n    (ii)Your agreeing to marry him will \n    stir up resentment, hatred and enmity in the heart of his wife, and you will \n    not be safe from her ill-will and harm.\n\n    (iii)What you have mentioned about \n    him working in the bank; he may leave it as he said he would, or he may not.\nThis is what we think. If, \n    after thinking long and hard about the matter, you decide to agree to marry \n    him, then pray istikhaarah and ask Allaah for guidance, and wait until he \n    finds another job that is permissible.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to help you \n    to do that in which there is goodness, success and guidance.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

End \n    quote from al-Fataawa al-Jaami\u2019ah (3/1055).\u00a0\n\n    Based on that, if you are afraid that your husband will \n    divorce you if the pregnancy continues, and he is serious about that, then \n    there is no sin on you if you abort the foetus within the first forty days \n    of the pregnancy.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said: From what we have seen above, it is seems that it is permissible to \n    abort the nutfah. The evidence and reasons for that are clear.\u00a0\n\n    As for the period in which it is permissible to abort the \n    nutfah, it is forty days.

        "question": "She repented from a haram relationship in which she lost her virginity. Should she marry who fornicated with her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Zina \n    (fornication or adultery) is a major sin. Allaah has forbidden doing the \n    things that lead to it and has prescribed the hadd punishment for the one \n    who does it, and He has warned adulterers of punishment in the Hereafter.\u00a0\n\n    Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd come \n    not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that \n    transgresses its limits: a great sin), and an evil way that leads one to \n    hell unless Allaah forgives him\u201d\n\n    [al-Isra\u2019 \n    17:32].\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Jareer \n    al-Tabari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd come \n    not near\u201d O people\u00a0\n\n    \u201cto \n    unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its \n    limits: a great sin)\u201d. Zina (translated here as \u201cunlawful sex\u201d) is a \n    great sin. \u00a0\n\n    \u201cand an \n    evil way\u201d i.e., the way of zina is an evil way, because it is the way of \n    the people who disobey Allaah and go against His command; what a bad way is \n    the way that leads a person to the fire of Hell.\u00a0\n\n    Tafseer \n    al-Tabari \n    (17/438).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \u2018Abd \n    al-Rahmaan al-Sa\u2019di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The \n    prohibition on approaching it is more eloquent than a simple prohibition on \n    doing it, because that includes the prohibition on all the things that lead \n    to it and promote it, because \u201cthe one who grazes his flock around a \n    protected areas will soon transgress upon it,\u201d especially in a matter of \n    this nature when the motive is very strong. Allaah describes zina as \n    abhorrent, as He says \u201cit is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses \n    its limits: a great sin)\u201d, i.e., it is a sin which is abhorrent \n    according to sharee\u2019ah, reason and common sense, because it is a \n    transgression against Allaah, and against the woman and her family or \n    husband, and it leads to immorality, confusion of lineages and other evil \n    consequences.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cand an \n    evil way\u201d means: what an evil way is the way of the one who dares to \n    commit this grave sin.\u00a0\n\n    Tafseer \n    al-Sa\u2019di \n    (p. 457).\u00a0\n\n    See also the \n    answers to questions no. 76060,\n    20983 and\n    95754.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to \n    the abortion, if the soul had been breathed into the foetus, then this is \n    another crime in addition to the crime of zina. If the soul had not yet been \n    breathed into the foetus then it is less serious.\u00a0\n\n    For a detailed \n    discussion on that, please see the answers to questions no.\n    11195,\n    13319,\n    13331 and\n    90054.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    We praise \n    Allaah for having enabled you to repent, and we hope that it is sincere \n    repentance. The conditions of sincere repentance include: regretting the \n    sins that you have committed, and immediately giving up that immoral action, \n    and everything that leads to it such as contact, correspondence and dates. \n    The conditions of repentance also include resolving not to return to this \n    deed.\u00a0\n\n    You also have \n    to do a lot of righteous deeds, such as prayer, reading Qur\u2019aan and fasting, \n    so as to strengthen your faith and piety. Good deeds erase bad deeds and \n    sincere repentance erases that which came before it, and turns bad deeds \n    into good deeds. Allaah says \u2013 after mentioning the sins of shirk \n    (associating others with Allaah), murder and zina \u2013 (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \u00a0\n\n    \u201cExcept \n    those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous \n    deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah \n    is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\u00a0 \n\n    [al-Furqaan \n    25:70].\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to \n    marrying that criminal, you should understand that in order for the marriage \n    of a man and woman who had committed zina to be valid, it is essential that \n    they repent sincerely. It seems to us from your questions that he has not \n    repented from what he did, rather he had added to the first calamity the \n    other bad things that he is doing, such as smoking hasheesh and drinking \n    intoxicants. What we think is that one who is like this also does not pray. \n    If this is indeed the case, then it is definitely not permissible to accept \n    him as a husband, because not praying is kufr that puts a person beyond the \n    pale of Islam, and it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a \n    kaafir.\u00a0\n\n    For a more \n    detailed discussion on the issue of marrying a zaani (one who commits \n    fornication or adultery), please see the answers to questions no.\n    85335,\n    87894 and\n    96460.\u00a0\n\n    Fifthly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to \n    having an operation to repair the hymen, this is haraam, because it is \n    deceiving the one who marries you.\u00a0\n\n    For a detailed \n    discussion of this matter, please see the answer to question no.\n    844.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to \n    telling your future husband that you lost your virginity in this haraam \n    relationship, that is not permissible, because it is exposing your faults, \n    and the Muslim is required to conceal his faults. You can use double \n    entendres in your speech. It is well known that the hymen may be broken by \n    means of something other than intercourse in some cases, so you can make the \n    most of that by using a double entendre.\u00a0\n\n    See the answer \n    to question no. 42992.\u00a0\n\n    But if it is \n    possible to encourage this person to repent sincerely and pray regularly, \n    and he shows sincerity and signs of repenting and praying regularly, then \n    there is nothing wrong with accepting him as a husband. Undoubtedly this \n    solution would be easier for you, and more concealing for you, but how could \n    one believe a person like that?!\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah \n    to accept your repentance and set your affairs straight, and to conceal our \n    faults and yours in this world and in the Hereafter.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah \n    knows best."

This version was narrated by al-Bukhaari.\u00a0\nThe guest has rights, as the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. There should be no doubt about this matter.

If they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian \n    of the one who has no guardian.\u201d\u00a0 Narrated by Ahmad (24417), Abu Dawood \n    (2083) and al-Tirmidhi (1102); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh \n    al-Jaami\u2019 no. 2709.\u00a0\n\n    The woman\u2019s guardian is her father; then her paternal \n    grandfathers, no matter how far the line of ascent reaches; then her son and \n    his sons, no matter how far the line of descent reaches (this applies if she \n    has a son); then her (full) brother through her father and mother; then her \n    (half) brother through her father only; then their sons, no matter how far \n    the line of descent reaches; then her paternal uncles; then their children, \n    no matter how far the line of descent reaches; then the father\u2019s paternal \n    uncles; then the ruler. (al-Mughni 9/355).\u00a0\n\n    But if the wali repeatedly refuses the proposal of a \n    compatible suitor, he is to be regarded as preventing the marriage of the \n    female relative under his care, and his guardianship is thus rendered null \n    and void, and that right is transferred to the next closest relative on the \n    father\u2019s side.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    The compatibility that counts here is compatibility in \n    religious commitment. There is no difference between an Arab and a non-Arab, \n    or between black and white, except in terms of taqwa (piety). Some of the \n    fuqaha\u2019 listed other conditions of compatibility, such as lineage and so on. \n    The fact that the suitor is a teacher and you are a (university) tutor does \n    not mean that he is not compatible with you, so long as he is of good \n    character and religiously committed, and he is comfortably off in material \n    terms, as you mentioned.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    What we think is that you should try to advise your father \n    again, and seek help in doing so from someone who will be acceptable to him \n    such as a relative or friend. If he agrees to give you in marriage to this \n    suitor, this is what you want; otherwise you should refer to the matter to \n    the guardian (wali) who comes after him, according to the order mentioned \n    above. If he refuses to arrange your marriage, or there is a conflict among \n    the guardians, then refer the matter to the qaadi and appoint him to arrange \n    your marriage.\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    What this guardian and others like him do is very strange, \n    when they turn their daughters into trade goods to be offered to the highest \n    bidder, or to the one who is better off than others. Even stranger than that \n    is when they claim that the daughter has no need to get married! What does \n    this poor man understand about need? Doesn\u2019t he know that people need \n    comfort, love and compassion, and that they have natural needs that Allaah \n    has created in them, by His wisdom, may He be glorified? The woman\u2019s wali \n    has to fear Allaah and understand that preventing his daughter or sister \n    from getting married to a compatible suitor who is pleased with her is \n    regarded as wrongdoing and transgression and implies that he is an evildoer \n    (faasiq) whose good character is sullied and whose testimony is to be \n    rejected.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\n    If the wali refused to let a woman marry a man whose \n    religious commitment and character are good, then guardianship passes to the \n    next closest male relative on the father\u2019s side, then the next closest and \n    so on. If they refuse to arrange her marriage, as usually happens, then \n    guardianship passes to the qaadi, and the qaadi should arrange the woman\u2019s \n    marriage. If the matter is referred to him and he knows that her guardians \n    have refused to arrange her marriage, then he should do that, because he is \n    the wali in cases where there is no specific wali. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n    The fuqaha\u2019 (may Allaah have mercy on them) stated that if \n    the wali repeatedly refuses marriage proposals from suitable men, then he is \n    a faasiq (evildoer) and is no longer regarded as being of good character or \n    as being a wali, rather according to the best known view of the madhhab of \n    Imam Ahmad, he also forfeits the right to lead prayers and it is not valid \n    to offer any congregational prayer behind him. This is a serious matter.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n    Some people, as we have referred to above, refuse offers of \n    marriage from compatible men, but the girl may feel too shy to come to the \n    qaadi to ask for her marriage to be arranged. This is something that does \n    happen. But she should weigh the pros and cons, and decide which has the \n    more damaging consequences, staying without a husband and letting her wali \n    control her life according to his mood or his whims and desires, and when \n    she grows old and no longer wants to get married, then he will arrange her \n    marriage, or going to the qaadi and asking him to arrange her marriage \n    because that is her right according to sharee\u2019ah.\u00a0\n\n    \u00a0Undoubtedly the second alternative is preferable, which is \n    that she should go to the qaadi and ask him to arrange her marriage, because \n    she has the right to that, and because her going to the qaadi and his \n    arranging her marriage serves the interests of others too, because others \n    will come just as she has, and her coming to the qaadi will serve as a \n    deterrent to those who wrong those whom Allaah has put under their care and \n    prevent them from marrying compatible men. In other words, this serves three \n    purposes:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n    1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The woman\u2019s own interests, so that she will not stay \n    without a husband.\n\n    2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The interests of others, because it will open the door \n    for women who are waiting for someone to set a precedent they can follow.\n\n    3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preventing those oppressive walis who make decisions \n    for their daughters or other women under their guardianship according to \n    their own moods or what they themselves want.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n    This also serves the purpose of establishing the command of \n    the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: \u201cIf \n    there comes to you (to propose marriage to your daughter) one with whose \n    religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your \n    daughter) to him, for if you do not do that, there will be fitnah \n    (tribulation) on earth and widespread corruption.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n    It also serves a specific interest, which is arranging \n    marriages for those who are suitable in terms of religious commitment and \n    character, thus protecting them from going astray and falling into haraam.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n    Quoted from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/148\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to help you to do that which in which is \n    goodness and success.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "She left her husband\u2019s home, and her lover asked her to marry him when she was still married!",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nYou have done a number of \n    things that are clearly and obviously contrary to sharee\u2019ah, hence we are \n    surprised at the end of your letter where you say \u201cI do not want to anger \n    Allaah or commit sins\u201d! Whatever the case, this is the bad consequences and \n    effect of sin, which is loss of reason and dimming of its light that would \n    lead to the straight path.\u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said, describing the effects of sin:\u00a0\n\u2026 Sin corrupts reason, for \n    reason is light, and sin inevitably extinguishes the light of reason. If its \n    light is extinguished it becomes weak and imperfect. One of the salaf said: \n    No one disobeys Allaah but his reason is lost. This is obvious, because if \n    his reason was present, it would have prevented him from committing sin when \n    he is under the full control of Allaah, may He be exalted, or how could he \n    commit sin openly when He is watching him, and he is enjoying His blessings \n    and His angels are bearing witness over him and watching him, and the \n    teachings of the Qur\u2019aan forbid that and the implication of faith and the \n    remembrance of death and the Fire should restrain him. The good of this \n    world and the Hereafter that he misses out on because of sin is many times \n    greater than the pleasure he may get from it. Can anyone who takes lightly \n    all that we have mentioned above still have sound reason? \u00a0\n\u2026 If sins accumulate, then \n    a seal is placed on the sinner\u2019s heart and he becomes one of the heedless, \n    as one of the salaf said concerning the words of Allaah (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \u201cNay! But on their hearts is the Raan (covering of sins and \n    evil deeds) which they used to earn\u201d [al-Mutaffifeen 83:14] \u2013 he said: \n    This is sin after sin. Al-Hasan said: It is sin upon sin, until the heart \n    becomes blind. And someone else said: When their sins and acts of \n    disobedience become many, they encircle their hearts.\u00a0\nThe basic principle \n    concerning that is that the heart is corroded (lit. rusts) by sin, so if sin \n    increases, the corrosion prevails until it becomes raan, then it prevails \n    until it becomes a seal, and the heart becomes covered and enveloped. If \n    that happens after he has been guided and had insight, then he will be \n    reversed and turned upside down. At that point his enemy takes over and \n    leads him wherever he wants.\u00a0\nAl-Jawaab al-Kaafi li \n    man sa\u2019ala \u2018an al-Dawa al-Shaafi (p. 39).\u00a0\nWe are sorry to tell you \n    that each of the sins that you have committed led to another; they affected \n    your reason and your heart, and extinguished their light.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThe things that you did \n    which go against sharee\u2019ah are:\u00a0\n1.\nThe haraam relationship \n    which you formed with your first husband, before you married him. This is \n    clear from your saying that it was a love marriage, and from your going \n    against your family who refused to give you in marriage to him, and now you \n    are doing the same thing with another man when you are still married to the \n    first husband!\u00a0\nWe have explained the \n    ruling on correspondence between the sexes in the answer to question no.\n    34841,\n    26890 and\n    23349.\u00a0\nWith regard to haraam \n    relationships, please see the answer to questions no.\n    1114,\n    9465,\n    21933 and\n    10532.\u00a0\n2.\nIt seems that your job \n    involves mixing with strange men. If what we think is correct, then it is a \n    sin. If it is not mixed, or it is not in a haraam field such as banking or \n    insurance \u2013 then there is no sin on you.\u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThere is no doubt that \n    enabling women to mix with men is the basis of all calamities and evils, and \n    it is one of the greatest causes of calamity that affects everybody, as well \n    as being one of the causes of corruption in public and private affairs. \n    Mixing of men with women is the cause of a great deal of immoral actions and \n    zina, and it is one of the causes of widespread death and ongoing plagues. \u00a0\nAl-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah \n    (p. 407).\u00a0\nSee also the answer to \n    question no. 1200.\u00a0\nFor information on women \n    working and the conditions of it being permissible, please see the answer to \n    question no. 22397. \u00a0\nIn the answer to question \n    no. 6666 there is important advice \n    to do with women working in a mixed environment.\u00a0\n3.\nYou left the marital home \n    without your husband\u2019s permission, and this was based on something that you \n    heard from his mother and his complaints to her. This does not make it \n    permissible for you to leave the marital home without your husband\u2019s \n    permission. You have the right to a separate home with your husband, but it \n    seems that you waived this right when you first married him and agreed to \n    stay with him in his mother\u2019s house. It would have been better for you to \n    work out the agreement with him when you agreed to help him to bear his \n    living expenses and pay off his debt, and to oblige him to do so via the \n    shar\u2019i court or good and knowledgeable people whom you appointed as \n    arbitrators between you. As for your actions and your leaving without his \n    permission, this is not permissible. Allaah forbade women who are revocably \n    divorced (first or second talaaq) to leave their houses after the divorce, \n    so how about married women? Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO Prophet (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \n    \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their \u2018Iddah \n    (prescribed periods) and count (accurately) their \u2018Iddah (periods). And fear \n    Allaah your Lord (O Muslims). And turn them not out of their (husband\u2019s) \n    homes nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of \n    some open illegal sexual intercourse. And those are the set limits of \n    Allaah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allaah, then indeed he \n    has wronged himself. You (the one who divorces his wife) know not it may be \n    that Allaah will afterward bring some new thing to pass (i.e. to return her \n    back to you if that was the first or second divorce)\u201d\n[al-Talaaq 65:1]\n4.\nThe worst and most \n    reprehensible of these actions that go against sharee\u2019ah is your sinful \n    relationship with that evildoer who pretended that he was saving you from \n    worldly problems and presented himself in the guise of a wise advisor, but \n    in fact he was a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u00a0\nHow could this evildoer \n    agree to meet you and talk with you, and sit with you and discuss with you, \n    and worst of all, he audaciously asked you to marry him when you were still \n    married to another man?! What is very strange is that you yourself say that \n    your husband himself was presenting himself falsely as a good man, and that \n    you were blind when you accepted him as a husband. Do you think that now you \n    are able to see? By Allaah, you are not able to see, and your blindness with \n    regard to your first husband was less serious than your blindness now. You \n    were not married when you formed a relationship with him, but now you are \n    married and you have formed a haraam relationship with that evildoer, who is \n    not content only to come between you and your husband, turn your heart \n    against him and make you hate the idea of going back to him, rather he has \n    added to that his request for you to marry him when you are still married to \n    another man.\u00a0\nWhat you have done is \n    haraam, beyond any shadow of a doubt. It is revolting and reprehensible even \n    to non-Muslims. No husband would want his wife to be in the situation you \n    are in. No wise person \u2013 let alone a Muslim who knows the rulings of \n    sharee\u2019ah \u2013 would approve of your marrying this evildoer who has shown his \n    true colours and evil attitude before marriage. That will save you from \n    going though another bitter experience with him. Do you think that he will \n    forget how you betrayed your husband with him? Do you think that he will \n    trust you not to repeat what you did with him? Do not hesitate to cut off \n    all ties with him, for it is a haraam relationship on the one hand, and on \n    the other hand he is not fit to be a trusted husband when he has done such \n    haraam, abhorrent actions.\u00a0\nFor information on the \n    qualities of a righteous husband, please see the answers to questions no.\n    5202 and\n    6942.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nWe hope that your regret \n    and taking stock of yourself are a good sign that you have come back to the \n    truth and that your conscience which criticizes you for abhorrent actions \n    and for falling short in acts of obedience to Allaah has come back to life. \n    \u00a0\nBeware of following the \n    footsteps of the shaytaan, for they lead to doom. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO you who believe! \n    Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the \n    footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al\u2011Fahsha\u2019 [i.e. to \n    commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al\u2011Munkar [disbelief and \n    polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is \n    forbidden in Islam)]. And had it not been for the Grace of Allaah and His \n    Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins\u201d\n[al-Noor 24:21].\nDo not ignore the \n    opportunity to regret and repent before there comes a Day when neither \n    dirhams nor dinars, neither close friends nor intercessors will benefit a \n    man, and he will bite at his hands in anguish, as Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd (remember) the Day \n    when the Zaalim (wrongdoer, oppressor, polytheist) will bite at his hands, \n    he will say: \u2018Oh! Would that I had taken a path with the Messenger (Muhammad\n    \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645).\n28.\u00a0\u2018Ah! Woe to me! \n    Would that I had never taken so\u2011and\u2011so as a Khal\u00eel (an intimate friend)!\n29.\u00a0\u2018He indeed led me \n    astray from the Reminder (this Qur\u2019aan) after it had come to me. And \n    Shaytaan (Satan) is to man ever a deserter in the hour of need\u2019\u201d\n[al-Furqaan 25:27-29].\nIn order to cleanse \n    yourself of sin and protect your religious commitment, faith and chastity, \n    strive to do the following:\u00a0\n1.\nPray regularly on time with \n    proper focus and humility before Allaah:\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu \n    Hurayrah that he heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) say: \u201cWhat do you think, if there was a river by the \n    door of one of you and he bathed in it five times a day, would any speck of \n    dirt be left on him?\u201d They said: Not a speck of dirt would be left on him. \n    He said: \u201cThat is the likeness of the five prayers, by means of which Allaah \n    erases sins.\u201d\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari \n    (505) and Muslim (667).\u00a0\n2.\nKeeping company with \n    righteous women who adhere to obedience to Allaah.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Abu \n    Moosa al-Ash\u2019ari (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe likeness \n    of a good companion and a bad companion is that of one who carries musk and \n    one who works the bellows. With the carrier of musk, either he will give you \n    some or you will buy some from him, or you will notice a good smell from \n    him; as for the one who works the bellows, either he will burn your clothes \n    or you will notice a bad smell from him.\u201d\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari \n    (1995) and Muslim (2628).\u00a0\nImam al-Nawawi (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: It points to the virtue of sitting with righteous, \n    good and honourable people, people of good attitude, awareness, knowledge \n    and manners, and indicates that it is not allowed to sit with evil people \n    and followers of innovation, those who backbite about people or who are \n    foul-mouthed and have nothing better to do, and other blameworthy things. \n    End quote.\u00a0\nSharh Muslim, \n    16/178\u00a0\u00a0\n3.\nNot listening to songs, \n    music and haraam entertainment.\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd of mankind is he \n    who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the \n    path of Allaah without knowledge, and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the \n    Verses of the Qur\u2019aan) by way of mockery. For such there will be a \n    humiliating torment (in the Hell\u2011fire).\n7.\u00a0And when Our Verses \n    (of the Qur\u2019aan) are recited to such a one, he turns away in pride, as if he \n    heard them not \u2014 as if there were deafness in his ear. So announce to him a \n    painful torment\u201d\n[Luqmaan 31:6-7]\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\nSingers and those who \n    listen to them have a share of blame commensurate with the degree to which \n    they are distracted by songs from the Qur\u2019aan. \u2026 This is made clear by the \n    fact that you will not find anyone who has an interest in songs and \n    listening to music but he will be somewhat misguided from the path of \n    guidance in terms of knowledge or action, and he is less eager to listen to \n    Qur\u2019aan rather than songs, such that if he has the opportunity to listen \n    either to songs or to the Qur\u2019aan, he will turn away from the latter to the \n    former, and listening to Qur\u2019aan will be burdensome for him, and he may go \n    so far as to tell the reciter to be quiet and tell the singer to carry on, \n    and never have his fill of listening to songs. \u00a0\nIghaathat al-Lahfaan \n    (1/240, 241).\u00a0\nFinally:\u00a0\nShaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan \n    (may Allaah preserve him) said:\u00a0\nThe Muslim must repent from \n    sin and hasten to do so, in obedience to the command of Allaah, so as to \n    save himself from the punishment and wrath of Allaah. It is not permissible \n    for him to continue in sin or to delay repentance in order to obey his nafs \n    (self) or the shaytaan, or to wait until people criticize him. Rather he \n    must fear Allaah and not fear people. Even if they are committing sin it is \n    not permissible for him to follow their example, and he must also oblige his \n    family to repent, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u201cO you who believe! Ward \n    off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and \n    stones\u201d\n[al-Tahreem 66:6].\nHe should not be kind to \n    them with regard to matters that anger Allaah.\u00a0\nAl-Muntaqa min Fataawa \n    al-Fawzaan (2/p. 293).\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

We ask Allah to forgive us and you.\u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 6308.\u00a0\nWith regard to the problem of your brother\u2019s doubts about your behaviour, this may be solved by asking Allah to guide him and to make him stop that. Then you should adhere to Allah\u2019s command of hijab, lowering the gaze, and avoiding non-mahram men. Do a lot of naafil prayers and fasts, and give in charity. Try to speak to him frankly and warn him against being suspicious of you.\u00a0\nUndoubtedly if your brother sees that you are righteous he will no longer doubt you, and that suspicion will disappear from his heart, in sha Allah.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "He bequeathed one-third of his wealth to his daughters as a punishment to his son for taking all the money",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It is unfortunate that there are many such cases among \n    siblings, and what makes the matter even more regrettable is that the reason \n    for this dispute is money. In fact I appreciate our sister\u2019s good nature and \n    wisdom, since she has preferred peace to entering into a dispute with her \n    brother, and she has tried to contain the problem and solve it within the \n    family. This in itself should be considered the beginning of a proper \n    solution. As for the answer to this question, it may be answered in the \n    following points:\u00a0\n\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    The money which your father had saved for you and gone to \n    great lengths for your benefit, is the due of everyone whom Allaah has \n    decreed has a share of inheritance. Each of you has a share allotted by \n    sharee\u2019ah after the death of your father; none of you have the right to keep \n    this money for himself and deny it to the rest of the heirs, because by \n    doing so he is transgressing upon the rights of others. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cbut transgress not the limits. Truly, Allaah likes not \n    the transgressors\u201d[al-Baqarah 2:190]\n\n    It was narrated by Abu Harrah al-Raqaashi that his paternal \n    uncle said: \u201cI was holding on to the reins of the she-camel of Messenger of \n    Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cA man\u2019s wealth is \n    not permissible except with his consent.\u201d (Narrated by Ahmad, 20172; classed \n    as saheeh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Irwaa\u2019, 1761).\u00a0\n\n    On this basis, what your brother did by taking this money is \n    considered to be a haraam action, especially since he took the money when \n    your father was still alive and he is not entitled to any of the money until \n    after his father died. Indeed, after his father\u2019s death he is not entitled \n    to anything more than the share which Allaah has allocated to him in the \n    laws of inheritance. So what your brother must do is to repent to Allaah and \n    restore the rights of people.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    The will which your father wrote was not acceptable according \n    to sharee\u2019ah, and it is not permissible for you to demand that it be \n    executed, because a person who is designated as an heir according to \n    sharee\u2019ah cannot be given something in the will (wasiyyah). The \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAllaah has \n    given each person his rights and no will can be made in favour of an heir.\u201d \n    (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2120; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh \n    al-Tirmidhi, 1722), So it is not permissible for you to demand it, even \n    if your brother has taken your money. But you may demand what Allaah has \n    granted you in the laws of inheritance.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    You should continue to advise and guide them and try to bring \n    them together as much as you can. Remember that you will be rewarded by \n    Allaah for that. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cThere is no good in most of their \n    secret talks save (in) him who orders Sadaqah (charity in Allaah\u2019s Cause), \n    or Ma\u2018roof (Islamic Monotheism and all the\n    good and righteous deeds which Allaah \n    has ordained), or conciliation between mankind; and he who does this, \n    seeking the good Pleasure of Allaah, We shall give him a great reward\u201d \n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:114]\n\n    Keep telling your sisters not to demand more than they are \n    entitled to, and that demanding one-third is something that is not \n    permitted. Try also to convince your brother, in a good way, to give your \n    sisters that which is rightfully theirs, and to show mercy to his sisters \n    after his father\u2019s death instead of being a torment to them. You will \n    undoubtedly face problems in doing that, but be patient. We ask Allaah to \n    make you steadfast.\n\n    \u00a0Fourthly:\n\n    \u00a0If you are doing the right thing, it will not matter if \n    people blame you or accuse you of being biased. Be steadfast in adhering to \n    the truth. Finally, we call on all of you to fear Allaah and to ward off \n    this scandalous dispute which does not make anyone happy apart from the \n    Shaytaan, those in whose hearts is a disease and everyone who enjoys the \n    troubles of others or is filled with malicious envy.\n\n    \u00a0I ask Allaah to put things right between you. May Allaah \n    bless our Prophet Muhammad."

        "question": "The meaning of \u201cBad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women)\u201d; and is it possible to find a wife who is righteous both outwardly and inwardly?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    The \n    mufassireen differed concerning the meaning of the verse (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \u00a0\n\n    \u201cBad \n    statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for \n    bad statements (or bad men for bad women)\u201d\n\n    [al-Noor \n    24:26]\n\n    Some of them \n    said that it refers to bad and good words, so the meaning of the verse is: \n    Evil words are for evil men, and evil people are for evil words, and good \n    words are for good people, and good people are for good words.\u00a0\n\n    Others said \n    that it refers to evil and good actions. So the meaning of the verse is: \n    Evil actions are for evil men, and evil people are for evil actions, and \n    good actions are for good people, and good people are for good actions.\u00a0\n\n    The third \n    opinion concerning this verse is that evil and good refer to people with \n    regard to marriage. So the meaning of the verse is: evil women are for evil \n    men, and evil men are for evil women, and good women are for good men, and \n    good men are for good women.\u00a0\n\n    There is no \n    reason why the verse cannot be understood in all these senses, although the \n    most obvious meaning is the first one mentioned, and this is the opinion of \n    the majority of mufassireen. The second view comes next.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \u2018Abd \n    al-Rahmaan al-Sa\u2019di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\n    \u201cBad \n    statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for \n    bad statements (or bad men for bad women)\u201d \n    means all evil men, women, words and actions that are fit for evil and in \n    accordance with it or accompanied by it and in harmony with it, and all good \n    men, women, words and actions that are fit for good and in accordance with \n    it or accompanied by it and in harmony with it. This explanation is general \n    in meaning and nothing is excluded from that. One of the greatest \n    application of this is that with regard to the Prophets \u2013 especially the \n    Messengers of strong will, and especially their leader, Muhammad  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who is the best among all the good of \n    creation \u2013 only the best of women are suitable for them. So the one who \n    slanders \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) in this manner is \n    slandering the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \n    which was the aim of the slander (al-ifk) fabricated by the \n    hypocrites. The mere fact that she was the wife of the Messenger  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) confirms that she was nothing but good \n    and pure and innocent of these reprehensible matters.\u00a0\n\n    So how about \n    when she is the siddeeqah of women, the best, most knowledgeable and purest \n    of them, the beloved of the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds? Revelation \n    did not come down to him when he was under the same cover as any of his \n    wives except her. Then the verse states clearly, so that there will be no \n    opportunity for any propagator of falsehood to say anything and no room for \n    any doubt whatsoever: \u00a0\n\n    \u201csuch (good \n    people) are innocent of (every) bad \n    statement which they say\u201d\n\n    [al-Noor \n    24:26]\n\n    The reference \n    is primarily to \u2018Aa\u2019ishah, and then to the believing chaste women.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cfor \n    them is forgiveness\u201d [al-Noor 24:26]\n\n    meaning, \n    forgiveness for all of their sins.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cand \n    Rizqun Kareem (generous provision, i.e. Paradise)\u201d \n    i.e., in Paradise, coming from the Generous Lord.\u00a0\n\n    Tafseer \n    al-Sa\u2019di \n    (p. 563).\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    What you have \n    quoted about the killing of a man who slandered \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allaah be \n    pleased with her) is true. This is what the Muslim rulers should do, which \n    is to execute everyone who slanders \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allaah be pleased with \n    her), because impugning the honour of \u2018Aa\u2019ishah is disbelief in the Qur\u2019aan, \n    and impugning the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). \n    Either of these actions implies kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of \n    Islam, and the one who does it deserves to be executed for apostasy.\u00a0\n\n    In \n    al-Mawsoo\u2019ah al-Fiqhiyyah (22/185) it says:\u00a0\n\n    The fuqaha\u2019 \n    are unanimously agreed that the one who slanders \u2018Aa'ishah (may Allaah be \n    pleased with her) has disbelieved the clear, unambiguous statement of the \n    Qur\u2019aan that was revealed concerning her, and hence he is a kaafir. Allaah \n    says \u2013 in the hadeeth of the slander (al-ifk), after Allaah declared that \n    she was innocent \u2013 \u201cAllaah forbids you from it and warns you not to \n    repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers\u201d [al-Noor 24:18]. So \n    the one who goes back to that is not a believer.\u00a0\n\n    Are all the \n    other wives of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    regarded as being like her?\u00a0\n\n    The Hanafis \n    and the Hanbalis, according to the correct opinion, which was favoured by \n    Ibn Taymiyah, say that they are all like her. They quoted as evidence the \n    verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBad \n    statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for \n    bad statements (or bad men for bad women). Good statements are for good \n    people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or \n    good men for good women): such (good people) are innocent of (every) bad \n    statement which they say; for them is forgiveness, and Rizqun Kareem \n    (generous provision, i.e. Paradise)\u201d\n\n    [ al-Noor \n    24:26]\n\n    Slandering \n    them implies slander of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) and impugning his honour, which is forbidden.\u00a0\n\n    The other \n    view, which is that of the Shaafa\u2019is and the other view of the Hanbalis, is \n    that they \u2013 apart from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah \u2013 are like the rest of the Sahaabah; the \n    one who reviles them is to be flogged, because he is a slanderer. End \n    quote.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \n    Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Slandering \n    \u2018Aa\u2019ishah with regard to that of which Allaah has declared her innocent is \n    kufr, because it is disbelieving the Qur\u2019aan. With regard to slandering \n    other wives of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    there are two scholarly opinions, the sounder of which is that it is kufr, \n    because it is a slander against the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him), because \u201cBad statements are for bad people (or bad \n    women for bad men).\u201d \u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 \n    Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen \n    (5/p.86)\u00a0\n\n    See also the \n    answer to question no. 954.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\n\n    It was \n    narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWomen may be married \n    for four things: their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their \n    religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your \n    hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, \n    5090; Muslim, 1466.\u00a0\n\n    It is not \n    impossible for a man to find a righteous wife who will help him to obey \n    Allaah, serve him, raise his children, and look after his wealth and house. \n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised men to \n    marry the woman who is religiously committed. If it were not possible or \n    within a man\u2019s capability to find that religiously committed woman, the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have \n    advised him to marry her. He is the one who said in the same hadeeth that \n    some men marry women for their beauty, and some marry them for their lineage \n    or their wealth. Men choose women according to their own desires and \n    traditions and customs, but his advice to all men is to look for the woman \n    who is religiously committed and marry them, because in marrying such a \n    woman there is a great deal of good which the man will see in himself, his \n    house and his children.\u00a0\n\n    You should not \n    give up hope of finding a woman who is religiously committed and of good \n    character. The Muslim ummah is still doing well and there are still Muslim \n    families which are raising women who are of good character and committed to \n    Islam, and are brought up in this manner.\u00a0\n\n    The failure of \n    one experience of marriage does not mean that the same will happen to all \n    subsequent marriages. What happened to you may have been a punishment to you \n    because of your shortcomings in asking and finding out about the woman whom \n    you married.\u00a0\n\n    People know \n    one another and mix with one another, so the state of a family and its \n    members will not be hidden from their relatives and neighbours. The members \n    of the family mix with people in the mosque and school and when visiting \n    people, so a righteous woman will be known and distinguished from the \n    opposite, and the religiously committed man will be known and distinguished \n    from his opposite, by their adhering to regular prayer, and adherence to \n    outward shar\u2019i laws, and their attitude in dealing with others. What one of \n    them hides inwardly is something that no one can know, and the one who is \n    deceived by outward righteousness when a person is inwardly corrupt is not \n    to be blamed, because our Lord does not require us to look at what is hidden \n    inside people.\u00a0\n\n    Moreover, what \n    is applicable to the women among whom you are looking for a life partner is \n    also applicable to you. How do people know who you really are, or what you \n    are like inwardly? Guardians have been advised to give their female \n    relatives in marriage to men who are religiously committed and of good \n    character, based on what they can see, as well as asking and finding out \n    from the relatives of the suitor. Whatever wrong impressions and deceit may \n    happen on the part of the woman may also happen \u2013 and more so \u2013 on the part \n    of the man. So you should not be anxious or worry because of your first \n    marriage. All you have to do now is look carefully, and ask good people \n    about good families who raise their daughters to obey Allaah and with good \n    morals and attitudes. Then you can focus your questions about the one whom \n    you want to marry from those families, by asking her friends and classmates \n    about her commitment and righteousness, and about her attitude and \n    interactions with others. Thus you will have followed the advice of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and we hope that \n    you will not be disappointed by her and that they will not be disappointed \n    by you.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah \n    to help you to make a good choice and to bless you with a righteous wife who \n    will keep you chaste and you will keep her chaste, and you will treat her \n    well and she will treat you well, and to bless you with good and righteous\u00a0 \n    children.\u00a0\n\n    For more \n    information on the qualities to be sought in the wife, please see the \n    answers to questions no. 26744 and\n    10376.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah is \n    the Source of strength."

        "question": "Spouses who argue a great deal and she hits him. Should he divorce her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We are amazed that you can be happy, despite what you mention about having a lot of arguments and even hitting sometimes. Whatever the case, we ask Allaah to increase your happiness.\u00a0\nThere can be no doubt that a woman\u2019s hitting her husband is a sign of a serious problem in this household and that it is not fit to raise children. How can the father raise his children when they see him being hit by their mother?!\u00a0\nWhatever the case, if you want to set things straight in your household and your want your wife to be set straight, then you must find out the reason why your wife has resorted to violence, and you must deal with it.\u00a0\nSpecialists have mentioned several reasons why a wife might become violent. These include:\u00a0\n1.Her violence is a reaction to her husband\u2019s violence. This is not the case \u2013 according to what you mention in your question \u2013 in your situation, because you say that you do not hit her.\n2.Your wife\u2019s violence may be because of having had a bad childhood, and what she may have been exposed to of violence from her parents or one of them, or from one of her siblings.\n3.The wife\u2019s violence may be due to her husband\u2019s weak character. Her husband may not be working, and she may be the one who is working and taking responsibility for the household, and her dominant personality may lead her to aggression against his weak character.\n4.The woman\u2019s violence may be due to the effect of what she reads, watches or ingests. She may be influenced by dominant women or read stories about them, or the devils among women may be whispering to her that this is the right way to check the husband, or she may be under the influence of drugs and intoxicants.\nIf you know the reason ,then you must deal with it wisely and gently, and remind her of the greatness of the rights that you have over her, and her duties towards you. Remind her of the punishment for transgressing against you in word and deed, and alert her to the fact that her actions will play a part in your failure to raise your children properly, and that her character may be reflected in some of her daughters.\u00a0\nWhat the couple must do is treat one another kindly, and not wrong one another or deny one another\u2019s rights. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:228].\u00a0\nIf some differences arise between them, then these differences should be dealt with in an atmosphere of love, understanding, respect and tolerance, so that their married life will be as Allaah wants it to be: \u201cand He has put between you affection and mercy\u201d [al-Room 30:21].\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to reconcile between you.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "He studies in a mixed school in a foreign country and is asking about attending \u201csex education\u201d classes",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Western societies have become the worst disgrace in human \n    history, with perverted and deviant behaviour and corruption of human \n    nature. \u201cSexual madness\u201d has become the preoccupation of all classes of \n    society, and not even their children in their homes or schools are safe from \n    them. Conferences are being held and resolutions are being passed about the \n    \u201cnecessity\u201d of spreading \u201csex education\u201d in the schools of those deviant \n    societies. They are not content only to corrupt themselves, but they are \n    also hastening to spread it to the Arab and Muslim countries so that they \n    will follow in their footsteps of temptation and perversion, so some of \n    those who were deceived by them followed them in that, and Allaah saves \n    whomever He wills by His guidance and help.\u00a0\n\n    The one who wants to save himself and his family should not \n    agree to be a part of those societies, or to live among them, and he should \n    refuse to take part in what they are doing of haraam things, evils and \n    perversions.\u00a0\n\n    Wise people in those societies have spoken of the necessity \n    of separating male and female students in schools. They have seen the many \n    evils that result from this mixing, and some of them attribute those evils \n    to moral corruption, and others to education. Whatever the case, mixing in \n    such places is forbidden in our sharee\u2019ah. Islam brings that which is in the \n    best interests of both individuals and societies, in both spiritual and \n    worldly matters.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    What you mention is something to which we have previously \n    drawn attention repeatedly, and it includes three issues:\u00a0\n\n    (i)Living in kaafir countries\n\n    (ii)Mixing in education\n\n    (iii)Studying \u201csex education\u201d\n\n    We will pause briefly here to say:\u00a0\n\n    Teaching about matters of sex and related issues to male and \n    female students at an early age leads to many evils, including the \n    following:\u00a0\n\n    1.\n\n    Premature sexual development among male and female students. \n    It has been proven that many students do not wait until they reach the stage \n    when this subject is taught, rather they hasten to borrow the books from \n    their friends before they reach that stage!\u00a0 You can imagine the extent of \n    the evil that can spread as a result, especially when older students take \n    advantage of younger ones to put what they have learned into practice, as \n    happens in those morally and religiously corrupt societies.\u00a0\n\n    2.\n\n    The spread of illegitimate pregnancy among female students at \n    the secondary and university stage. Numbers have reached remarkable levels, \n    and this situation has led to the involvement of some educationalists to put \n    a limit on this matter, but how could these wise people reform a sex-crazed \n    society?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n    The ratio of illegitimate children has risen to a dangerous \n    level. The government office of statistics in France states that the number \n    of illegitimate births rose to more than half of all births in France in \n    2006 (50.5 %), for the first time in the country\u2019s history. Similar \n    situations are developing in Britain and America.\u00a0\n\n    3.\n\n    There has been an increase in cases of rape among students. \n    There are many well known cases, and this matter is no secret to anyone, \n    rather the nightmare of rape haunts all female students and every female \n    student is waiting for the time when it will get her.\u00a0\n\n    4.\n\n    There are many cases of students killing one another, or \n    students killing their teachers, all due to competition in winning the love \n    of a female student.\u00a0\n\n    5.\n\n    There is no longer any shyness or modesty among male and \n    female students. You can see this in the way they are after these lessons, \n    and in their conversations with their families, and in their public \n    gatherings.\u00a0\n\n    6.\n\n    They hasten to put into practice the theories they learned in \n    those lessons, because it is well known that teaching these lessons is \n    something that provokes desire \u2013 as mentioned in the question \u2013 especially \n    if the teaching is accompanied by pictures or films. This is what makes the \n    students eager to try it out in real life, if only to discover that which \n    was unknown, then it quickly turns into a frenzy, and if a person cannot \n    practise it with the opposite sex he will practise it with the members of \n    his own sex, and thus perversion spreads. This is happening a great deal in \n    those societies, and they now have institutions and associations that defend \n    them and demand more rights and privileges for them.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    For all these reasons, we do not think that you or any Muslim \n    should live in those deviant societies, let alone study in their mixed \n    schools, or attend those provocative and evil \u201csex education\u201d lessons.\u00a0\n\n    If this is the knowledge that they are teaching, what bad \n    knowledge it is!\u00a0\n\n    Listen to the testimony of an American female doctor who \n    worked in an Arab country, and saw the state of her own country, and \n    realized what was wrong with the spread of \u201csex education\u201d among male and \n    female students in schools. She says:\u00a0\n\n    If your women in the east do not know some of the secrets of \n    sex that are known by American girls, I would say \u2013 with a clear conscience \n    \u2013 that it is better for you to remain ignorant than to enjoy this knowledge. \n    We have given our girls lessons so that they will know about sex in detail, \n    but soon one of them will leave the lecture hall, looking for the nearest \n    boy, to practise with him the sexual theories carelessly, as if she is \n    taking part in a play or playing a game. The natural result of that is an \n    increase in fooling about and promiscuity.\u00a0\n\n    See: Makaanaki Tuhmadi by Ahmad Muhammad Jamaal (p. \n    93, 94), quoted in Qadaaya al-Mar\u2019ah fi\u2019l-Mu\u2019tamaraat al-Duwaliyyah \n    by Dr. Fu\u2019aad ibn \u2018Abd al-Kareem.\u00a0\n\n    Based on this, it is not permissible for you to attend those \n    classes, and the least that you should do is move to other classes that do \n    not teach these subjects.\u00a0\n\n    This is the least that you should do, although the basic \n    principle is that living in kaafir countries and studying in mixed schools \n    is haraam and you should leave, especially since your morals may be \n    affected.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "The danger of admiration between members of the same sex, the remedy, and how the one who is admired should react",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe natural inclination is for a man to be attracted to a woman, and for a woman to be attracted to a man. As for a person being attracted to another member of his or her own sex, this is contrary to the sound human nature that Allaah has instilled in people, and it does not exist even among animals. In addition to being contrary to sound human nature, it is at a lower level than that of animals.\u00a0\nIslam has refined this natural inclination and has set out limits for it, namely marriage. The one who does not agree with these shar\u2019i limits would choose the immoral action of zina. As for deviant relationships in which a girl is attracted to another girl or a man to another man, this is a perversion and a deviation from correct, sound human nature. These sinful relationships lead to something that is even more abhorrent than zina, namely homosexuality between males, and improper relationships between women lead to lesbianism, which is another kind of deviance.\u00a0\nSinful relationships between members of both sexes begin with what is called admiration or infatuation. This is a serious disease which is widespread in all societies as the result of a spiritual vacuum and lack of knowledge and as the result of imitating kaafir societies which have gone against human nature. This infatuation leads to love, in which the girl cannot bear not to see the one whom she loves; if she is not able to do that, then she will listen to her voice or look at a picture of her. Then that sinful relationship leads to lesbianism, which is haraam. These deviant women do not see in a man what they see in the woman they admire of fulfilling desire and filling the heart with love. You can say the same thing about sinful relationships between males. The love between them leads to infatuation in the heart, as if there were no one else in the world but him, and if the beloved were to ask his lover to prostrate to him, he would do it! We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. This sinful relationship ultimately leads to the abhorrent immoral action of homosexuality, and among those perverts you see no attraction towards a woman, even if she were the most beautiful of women.\u00a0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:\u00a0\nWhat is the ruling on lesbianism and masturbation?\u00a0\nThey replied:\u00a0\nLesbianism among women is haraam, and is a major sin, because it is an action that is contrary to the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)\n6.\u00a0Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, __ for then, they are free from blame;\n7.\u00a0But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors\u201d\n[al-Mu\u2019minoon 23:5-7]\nSimilarly masturbation is haraam, because of these same verses, and because it causes a great deal of harm.\u00a0\nShaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh \u2018Abd al-Razzaaq \u2018Afeefi, Shaykh \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Qa\u2019ood.\u00a0\nFataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah (22/68).\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThe person who realizes that there is someone close to him who admires him or is infatuated with him should hasten to deal with the matter wisely. Wisdom does not mean being heedless with regard to looking, visiting and touching, because these are things that may make his sickness worse, and make the pain worse. Rather wisdom means offering a suitable remedy in a suitable manner, which includes the following:\u00a0\n1.\nStrengthening his faith, by encouraging him to do acts of worship and avoid evil deeds.\u00a0\n2.\nInstilling the love of Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his heart.\u00a0\n3.\nTeaching him the meaning of love for the sake of Allaah, the basis of which is that the person who is loved for the sake of Allaah is loved for his\u00a0 faith and acts of obedience, not for his appearance, image or status. \u00a0\n4.\nNot giving him the opportunity to make contact repeatedly or to visit frequently; explaining to him that if a legitimate relationship transgresses the limits it becomes haraam and must be stopped.\u00a0\n5.\nWhen meeting, not allowing him to look continuously, embrace or kiss.\u00a0\n6.\nGiving him academic or da\u2019wah-related tasks to do, such as collecting evidence on a certain issue, or summarizing a book, or listening to tapes, or doing da\u2019wah-related activities such as calling people to Islam, distributing pamphlets and tapes, and other things which will fill his time with beneficial acts of worship and permissible activities.\u00a0\nSecondly: \u00a0\nIf a Muslim feels that he is attracted to someone and fears that this may be one of the tricks of the shaytaan, then he should hasten to rid himself of it, and to treat himself, before it develops further and becomes haraam love . If he wants to rid himself of that, he should do several things, including the following:\u00a0\n1.\nHe should focus his heart on his Lord, for He is the Bestower of blessings and bounty Who has granted him immense blessings, so he should direct the love of his heart towards his Creator.\u00a0\n2.\nHe should cut off ties with everyone who he feels he is developing an (inappropriate) attachment towards, so he should not continue to listen to his voice or look at his image; he should try to avoid meeting him, even if the focus of his love is a teacher, educator or relative. This is the best remedy that he can give himself.\u00a0\n3.\nHe should continually read about the lives of righteous people, scholars and mujaahideen, so that he can learn from those who offered their time and their lives in the service of Islam and the Muslims whilst he is preoccupied with looking at the image of his beloved or enjoying listening to his voice, or reading his words. These are things that are it is not befitting for a Muslim to do even once, so how about if this is his whole life?!\u00a0\n4.\nHe should also ponder the grave and serious effects of these two destructive diseases, namely haraam infatuation and love. The harm that they cause includes the following:\n(i)Diverting a person from his Lord and Creator to focus on a weak creature who may harm him but cannot benefit him\n(ii)Creating worry, anxiety, grief, confusion and depression in this world, and torment in the Hereafter\n(iii)Imagining kinds of haraam actions with the object of his love and infatuation, such as looking, touching and kissing with desire. That may even lead a woman to lesbianism and a man to homosexuality to bring these images out of the realm of imagination and into the realm of reality.\n(iv)Contamination of sound human nature (fitnah) with a weakening of natural sexual desire, which will lead to spoiling of a woman\u2019s relationship with her husband and her desire for the haraam things that she has become used to; similar effects may also apply to men.\nFourthly:\u00a0\nRelationships between Muslims should be based on sharee\u2019ah and taqwa (piety). The one who comes together with another person on the basis of sin in this world will find their relationship turned into one of enmity on the Day of Resurrection.\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u201cFriends on that Day will be foes one to another except Al\u2011Muttaqoon (the pious\u201d\n[al-Zukhruf 43:67]\nImam Ibn Jareer al-Tabari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAllaah says: Those who were friends on the basis of disobedience towards Allaah in this world will be enemies of one another, disavowing one another, except for those who were friends on the basis of fearing and obeying Allaah.\u00a0\nTafseer al-Tabari (21/637).\u00a0\nIbn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\ni.e., every friendship that was not for the sake of Allaah, on the Day of Resurrection will be turned into enmity, except that which was for the sake of Allaah, for that will last because it is connected to the One Who is eternal. \u00a0\nTafseer Ibn Katheer (7/237).\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIf friendship and love are based on something other than the best interests of both parties, then the consequences will be enmity. It can only be in their best interests if it is for the sake of Allaah. \u00a0\nEven though each one of them may be helping the other to achieve what he wants on the basis of mutual consent, this mutual consent counts for nothing, rather it will become mutual hatred, enmity and curses, and each of them will say to the other: Were it not for you I would not have done that on my own, so my doom is because of me and you. \u00a0\nAnd the Lord will not prevent them from hating and cursing one another, but if one of them wronged the other, he will be prevented from doing that, and each of them will say to the other: It was for your own purposes that you caused me to fall into this; like two who committed zina will say to one another: It was for your own purposes that you did this with me; if you had refrained I would not have been involved in it. But each of them damaged the other equally.\u00a0 \u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (15/129)\u00a0\nThe gate of repentance is open to everyone who wants to seek His Countenance, and the blessings of faith and obedience are available to everyone who wants to join His friends. Allaah forgives sins and accepts repentance, and He turns bad deeds into good. He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cExcept those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\n[al-Furqaan 25:70]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)\u201d\n[Ta-Ha 20:82]\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 10050, which explains why Islam forbids lesbianism and homosexuality; 21058 which explains the punishment for lesbianism; 60351 and 36837, which have to do with the phenomenon of schoolgirls kissing one another every day and kissing on the lips; and 591 which explains the ruling on one woman loving another to the extent that they cannot bear to be apart.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "The mother\u2019s rights over her daughter are great but the husband\u2019s rights over his wife are greater",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    The mother\u2019s status in sharee\u2019ah cannot be denied. Allah has \n    enjoined that her children should honour her, and He has forbidden them to \n    disobey her; He has ruled that the mother is the most entitled of people to \n    one\u2019s good company, as it says in the well-known hadeeth, when a man said: O \n    Messenger of Allah, which of the people is most deserving of my good \n    companionship? He said: \u201cYour mother, then your mother, then your mother, \n    then your father, then the next closest and the next closest.\u201d Narrated by \n    Muslim (2548).\u00a0\n\n    This is the mother\u2019s right, and that is her status. It is not \n    permissible for her to consume her children\u2019s wealth unlawfully, rather she \n    must give each one his or her rights, and divide the estate in accordance \n    with the laws of Allah. It is also not permissible for the mother to incite \n    her daughter against her husband and spoil the good relationship between \n    them. These actions of this mother are evil deeds which are not acceptable \n    in Islam, and they bring the threat of sin and punishment.\u00a0\n\n    Perhaps the greatest way in which you can honour your mother \n    is by deterring her from consuming haram wealth and doing haram things, \n    and stopping her from wronging people unlawfully, and remind her of the sin \n    involved in spoiling the relationship between husband and wife, and the sin \n    of gheebah (backbiting), reviling and insulting others, and other haram \n    things that she is doing, such as tabarruj (wanton display) and travelling \n    without a mahram, if these are true in her case.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to your siblings who want your mother to live \n    with you and your husband, you are not obliged to do that according to \n    sharee\u2019ah, rather it is the duty of your mother, and in this case the right \n    belongs to your husband: if he agrees to that, all well and good, otherwise \n    you are not obliged to do this, rather we do not advise your husband to \n    accept this situation, because they are not neglected or in need of such a \n    thing, they are not poor and in need of someone to spend on them, and your \n    mother is not unable to take care of their affairs. Taking this \n    responsibility from her is helping her to do the things that she is doing \n    that go against Islam, and to neglect her duties, and pass on this burden to \n    your husband, and put pressure on you and your household with something that \n    is not required of you in the first place, let alone the unacceptable things \n    that may result from your sister living in the same house as a man who is \n    not her mahram (your husband). We do not advise you to accept this situation \n    under any circumstances.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    The status and rights of the mother do not supersede the \n    rights of the husband, rather the husband\u2019s rights are greater and take \n    precedence over your mother\u2019s rights. Your obedience to him takes precedence \n    over your obedience to her, and the wise wife strives to please her husband \n    by doing what he wants so long as it is not contrary to sharee\u2019ah, and she \n    strives to honour her mother in ways that do not go against her husband\u2019s \n    commands. If there is a conflict of interest, then she should put her \n    husband\u2019s commands and wishes first.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n    was asked about a woman who got married, and was no longer under her \n    parents\u2019 care. Which is better \u2013 honouring her parents or obeying her \n    husband?\u00a0\n\n    He replied: When a woman gets married, her husband has more \n    authority over her than her parents, and obeying her husband is more \n    obligatory for her. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n    \u201cTherefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their \n    husbands), and guard in the husband\u2019s absence what Allah orders them to \n    guard (e.g. their chastity and their husband\u2019s property)\u201d [al-Nisa 4:34]. \n    And in a hadeeth the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cThis world is temporary conveniences and the best of its \n    comforts is a believing wife, who when you look at her she pleases you and \n    if you tell her to do something she obeys you, and if you are away from her \n    she protects you with regard to\u00a0 herself and your wealth.\u201d. In Saheeh Abi \n    Hatim it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah \n     (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf a woman offers \n    her five (daily prayers) and fasts her month and guards her chastity and \n    obeys her husband, she will enter Paradise from whichever of its gates she \n    wants.\u201d In al-Tirmidhi it is narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allah be \n    pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah  (peace and blessings of \n    Allah be upon him) said: Any woman who dies when her husband is pleased \n    with her, will enter Paradise.\u201d This was narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who said \n    it is a hasan hadeeth. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf I were to order \n    anyone to prostrate to anyone, I would have ordered women to prostrate to \n    their husbands.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi who said it is a hasan hadeeth. It \n    was also narrated by Abu Dawood with the wording: \u201cI would have ordered \n    women to prostrate to their husbands because of the rights that Allah has \n    given them over them.\u201d In al-Musnad it is narrated from Anas that the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIt is not \n    acceptable for any human to prostrate to another, but if it were acceptable \n    for any human to prostrate to another, I would have ordered women to \n    prostrate to their husbands, because of the greatness of the rights they \n    have over them. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if there were sores \n    from his feet to the top of his head flowing with pus, then she licked them, \n    she would not have given him all his rights.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    And he quoted ahadeeth about the virtue of obeying the \n    husband.\u00a0\n\n    There are many ahadeeth on this topic from the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Zayd ibn Thabit said: The \n    husband is a sayyid (lord or master) in the Book of Allah. Then he quoted \n    the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThey both found her lord \n    (i.e. her husband) at the door\u201d [Yoosuf 12:25]. \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab \n    said: Marriage is slavery, so let one of you look to whom he is giving his \n    beloved daughter to be a slave to. In al-Tirmidhi and elsewhere it is \n    narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cI urge you to treat women well, for they are like prisoners with \n    you.\u201d \u00a0\n\n    So the woman is like a slave of her husband, or like a \n    prisoner; she should not go out of his house without his permission, whether \n    she is told to do so by her father, her mother or anyone else, according to \n    scholarly consensus.\u00a0\n\n    If a man wants to take her to another place, so long as he is \n    doing what is required of him, and observing the sacred limits of Allah \n    with regard to her, and her father tells her not to obey him in that, then \n    she must obey her husband and not her father, because in that case the \n    parents are wrongdoers, and they have no right to tell her not to obey \n    someone like this husband, and she does not have the right to obey her \n    mother if she tells her to leave him or to cause trouble to him so that he \n    will divorce her, such as demanding more maintenance and more clothing, and \n    demanding (the deferred portion of) her mahr so that he may divorce her.\u00a0 It \n    is not permissible for her to obey either of her parents by divorcing him if \n    he fears Allah with regard to her. \u00a0\n\n    In the four Sunans and Saheeh Ibn Abi Hatim it \n    is narrated that Thawban said: The Messenger of Allah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAny woman who asks her husband for a \n    divorce when there is nothing wrong, the fragrance of Paradise will be \n    forbidden to her.\u201d According to another hadeeth: \u201cThe women who ask for \n    khul\u2019 and the women who make a wanton display of themselves are indeed \n    hypocrites.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    But if both or one of her parents tells her to do something \n    that involves obedience to Allah, such as praying regularly, speaking the \n    truth and fulfilling trusts, and tells her not to squander or waste her \n    money, and other things that have been enjoined or forbidden by Allah and \n    His Messenger, then she must obey them in that, even if the command comes \n    from someone other than her parents, so how about if it comes from her \n    parents?\u00a0\n\n    If her husband tells her not to do something that is enjoined \n    by Allah, and he tells her to do something that Allah has forbidden, then \n    she should not obey him in that. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere is no obedience to any created being if it \n    involves disobedience toward the Creator.\u201d If a master orders his slave to \n    do something that involves disobedience toward Allah, it is not \n    permissible for him to obey him by disobeying Him, so how can a woman obey \n    her husband or one of her parents by committing sin? All goodness is in \n    obeying Allah and His Messenger, and all evil is in disobeying Allah and \n    His Messenger. End quote. Majmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (32/261-264).\u00a0\n\n    This is a strong answer based on knowledge, and it is \n    sufficient to explain what is meant, which is that it is not permissible for \n    your mother to spoil the relationship between you and your husband, and it \n    is not permissible for you to obey her in that, and your husband\u2019s right to \n    your obedience is greater than your mother\u2019s.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    Just as you are not obliged to take care of any of your \n    siblings because of your commitment of your husband and the requirement that \n    he should first agree to that, the same applies to your visiting your mother \n    with your children. This is not permissible except with the consent of your \n    husband, and you have done well to refuse your mother\u2019s request. We affirm \n    that this refusal is Islamically acceptable, especially since you have no \n    mahram to travel with you.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to limiting the number of your mother\u2019s visits to \n    you, this is something that is also up to your husband, and you can work it \n    out with him. The husband has the right to prevent anyone who he thinks is a \n    trouble-maker from entering his house, even if they are your family. As you \n    are in agreement and you have a good relationship, then the matter is \n    simple. All you have to do is agree on a specific number and time for her \n    visits, and stipulate that to her. Your husband has every right to do this; \n    indeed we think that if he stops her altogether he will be doing the right \n    thing, but there is the hope that if her visits are restricted to only a \n    few, and do not affect your family\u2019s happiness, then there is no reason why \n    they should be prevented, and there is nothing wrong with tolerating them. \n    Determining the limit is up to you and you should consult one another and \n    come to some agreement.\u00a0\n\n    Ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said: \u201cAnd not allow into your houses anyone whom you dislike\u201d \n    means, they (wives) should not allow anyone to enter the house if you (the \n    husband) do not want him or her to enter, even if it is her mother or her \n    father. It is not permissible for her to let her mother, father, sister, \n    brother, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, paternal aunt or maternal aunt into \n    her husband\u2019s house, if he objects to that. Attention is drawn to this \n    because some women \u2013 Allah forbid \u2013 are bad even to their daughters. If \n    they see that the daughters are settled and happy with their husbands, they \n    become jealous \u2013 Allah forbid \u2013 even though they are mothers, and they try \n    to spoil things between the daughter and her husband. So the husband has the \n    right to stop such a mother from entering his house, and he has the right to \n    say to his wife: She should not enter my house. He has the right to prevent \n    her according to sharee\u2019ah, and he has the right to prevent his wife from \n    going to see her, because she is a nammamah (one who spreads malicious gossip) \n    and a troublemaker.

        "question": "He is homosexual and is afraid to get married",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nHomosexuality is a severe illness and a grave calamity. If it is accompanied by actually committing immoral actions, then it is even worse, because of the sin and abhorrent nature of those immoral actions and their bad consequences in this world and in the Hereafter.\u00a0\nHence you should focus on how to treat this perversion and save yourself from this destructive evil, more than focusing on whether to conceal it from your fianc\u00e9e or disclose it to her.\u00a0\nYou should realize that there are causes for this calamity, and these causes may be due to what the person affected has done. The one who wants to save himself from this situation should examine these causes and rid himself of them, and do what we advise, otherwise he is approving of and accepting his condition and he does not want to change for the better. Among the causes which may be due to his own actions are the following:\u00a0\n1.\nWeakness of faith and remoteness of the heart from love of Allah, and a lack of fear of His punishment.\u00a0\n2.\nLooking freely at beardless youths, and enjoying their beauty and form.\u00a0\nThis is the first step towards sin for those who are affected by this disease. Allah has enjoined lowering the gaze and refraining from looking at haraam things, and the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has enjoined likewise. When he stopped following this command and began to do that which is forbidden, Iblees was able to shoot his poisoned arrow into his heart, and thus destroy him. \u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Looking is the origin of most of the problems that befall man, because looking generates thoughts, then thoughts generate ideas, and ideas generate desires, and desires generate will, which then becomes stronger and becomes firm resolve, in which case the deed will inevitably be done unless there is something to prevent it. Hence it was said that patience in lowering the gaze is easier than patience in bearing the pain that comes afterwards. End quote from al-Jawaab al-Kaafi (p. 106).\u00a0\nHence the scholars are unanimously agreed that it is haraam to look at beardless youths, and some of them regard that as more haraam than looking at women.\u00a0\nImam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Similarly the scholars forbade a man to look at the face of a beardless youth if he is handsome, whether with or without desire, and whether it is free of fitnah (temptation) or there is the fear thereof. This is the correct view which was favoured by the scholars. This was stated by al-Shaafa\u2019i and the prominent scholars of his madhhab (may Allah have mercy on them). The evidence for this is that a beardless youth is, in some ways, like a woman; he may be desired as a woman is desired, and his form may be beautiful like that of a woman, and many of them may be more beautiful than many women. The prohibition applies more to them for another reason, which is that in their case there may result from attachment to them types of evil that do not occur in the case of women. End quote.\nSharh Muslim (4/31).\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nLooking at the face of a beardless youth with desire is like looking as the face of a mahram or a non-mahram woman with desire, whether the desire is desire for intercourse or the desire to derive pleasure from looking. If he looks at his mother, sister or daughter with pleasure derived from looking like the pleasure derived from looking at a non-mahram woman, then it is known to everyone that this is haraam. The same applies to looking at the face of a beardless youth, according to scholarly consensus. End quote.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (15/413) and (21/245).\u00a0\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\u00a0\u00a0\nThe one who looks repeatedly at a beardless youth and the like, or persists in that, and says \u201cI am not looking with desire\u201d is lying, because if he has no need to look, then he is only looking because of the pleasure that he feels in his heart as a result. As for an accidental glance, it is forgiven, if he averts his gaze.\u00a0\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (15/419) and (21/251).\u00a0\u00a0\nThe kind of looking with which these sick people are afflicted includes what they watch on satellite channels and what they see in newspapers and magazines, and on websites, of pictures of children and beardless young men, and this is what provokes them to commit immoral actions.\u00a0\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Falling short with regard to obligatory and naafil acts of worship\u00a0\nIf the person who is afflicted with this problem prays on time, fulfilling the conditions and obligatory parts of prayer, that will be a deterrent that keeps him from falling into evil and immoral ways. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, As\u2011Salaah (the prayer) prevents from Al\u2011Fahsha\u2019 (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al\u2011Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed)\u201d\n[al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:45]\u00a0\nSo how about if he regularly performs sunnah and naafil prayers?\u00a0\u00a0\n4 \u2013 Forsaking the Qur\u2019aan and failing to read books about the lives of righteous men and the imams\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Book of Allah contains guidance, light and healing; it is the best protection for the Muslim against falling into sin and it is the best remedy for the one who does fall into sin.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf he reads books about the imams and biographies of the scholars, he can take them as an example and become familiar with their stories and rise above immorality and evil. \u00a0\u00a0\n5 \u2013 Falling short in seeking knowledge\u00a0\nKnowledge is light, through which one may know what is halaal and do it, and what is haraam and avoid it. Through it he may come to know his Lord, may He be exalted, and His names, attributes and deeds. That will generate in his heart a sense of shyness before his Lord and shyness before His angels, so that he will not want to commit evil and immoral actions. Through knowledge he will come to know the state of sinners and the punishment that Allah has prepared for them.\u00a0\n6 \u2013 A lot of spare time in the lives of those who have this problem\u00a0\u00a0\nIf they kept themselves busy with acts of worship, sport, permissible actions and seeking knowledge, they would not have time to spend in thinking of haraam things, let alone doing them.\u00a0\u00a0\n7 \u2013 Making friends and keeping company with bad people\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) likened the bad friend to one who works the bellows: he will either burn his companion\u2019s clothes or he will notice a bad smell coming from him.\u00a0\u00a0\n8 \u2013 Not getting married\u00a0\u00a0\nAllah has created natural desires in man, and He has made the outlet for that in women. The permissible way to do that is marriage. The one who goes against his natural state (fitrah) and diverts that desire towards other males like him, is even lower than the animals, for the animals that Allah has created are in front of us, and do we ever see any male mounting another male or looking at him with desire? Look at this and compare it with the one who looks at beardless youths of his own gender with desire, and the one who commits immoral actions with them, and that even makes him refrain from marrying women!\u00a0\nSee the answer to question no. 20068 for information on ways to escape and treat this disease.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, describing the remedy for haraam love and infatuation: The remedy for this fatal disease is to understand that what has befallen him of this disease that is contrary to Tawheed is due to his ignorance and the negligence of his heart towards Allah. He must acknowledge the Oneness of his Lord (Tawheed) and His laws and verses first of all, then he should do acts of worship, both inward and outward, which will distract his heart from always thinking of this thing, turn to Him a great deal and beseech Allah to take this away from him. He should focus his heart on Him.\u00a0There is no better remedy for it than sincerity towards Allah. This is the remedy that Allah mentioned in His Book when He said (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThus it was, that We might turn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse. Surely, he was one of Our chosen, (guided) slaves\u201d [Yoosuf 12:24].\nAllah tells us that He diverted the evil of infatuation and immoral actions away from him because of his sincerity, because if the heart is sincere and one\u2019s actions are sincerely for the sake of Allah alone, then the love of images cannot take hold of his heart; they can only take hold of an empty heart, as the poet said:\nHer love came into my heart before I had any idea of what love is,\nAnd it found my heart vacant, thus it too hold of it.\u00a0\nEnd quote from al-Jawaab al-Kaafi (p. 150, 151).\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nOne of the gravest mistakes is to think that there is no remedy for this disease, and that the homosexual can never become straight. If that were the case, then Allah would not have told the people of Loot to repent, and the Prophet of Allah Loot (peace be upon him) would not have called them to give up their perversion. Allah is the Creator of man, and He knows what can be changed in man and what cannot, so do not pay any attention to any claim that is contrary to that.\u00a0\nHow many homosexuals have turned to their Lord and repented, and their repentance has been accepted and they have changed their ways, and their haraam desires have disappeared. Loot (peace be upon him) called on his people to marry, because that is an effective remedy, in which the one who is affected by this thing can direct his desires in the permissible manner.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nFrom the above it is clear that what the homosexual falls into of being attached to images of beardless youths, or evil immoral actions, is the result of his deeds (and he is to blame). He is required to give it up, and he can rid himself of that. If we assume that he feels attracted to men, then he must resist that and avoid the causes that may lead to him falling into haraam, just as a normal man is naturally attracted to women, but he is required to lower his gaze and not be alone with a woman, and he must avoid all the means that lead to fitnah (temptation).\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nAs for your saying \u201cwhat should we do?\u201d, we have explained to you what you should do. You should fear Allah and respect Him so much that you do not want Him to see you in the bad situation which He dislikes for you, and for which He gives people a painful punishment.\u00a0\nBut what we are really shocked by is what you say after that: \u201cIs it our fault that we are like that? What is the wisdom behind a man being created like this?\u201d\u00a0\nYes, O slave of Allah, the blame and consequences, the threat and punishment, all befall the one who commits the sin; he deserves it because of the evil acts that he has done and what his hands have earned.\u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd among men is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge or guidance, or a Book giving light (from Allah),\n9.\u00a0Bending his neck in pride (far astray from the path of Allah), and leading (others) too (far) astray from the path of Allah. For him there is disgrace in this worldly life, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall make him taste the torment of burning (Fire).\n10.\u00a0That is because of what your hands have sent forth, and verily, Allah is not unjust to (His) slaves\u201d\n[al-Hajj 22:8-10]\nAllah also says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd those who dispute concerning Allah (His religion of Islamic Monotheism with which Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 has been sent), after it has been accepted (by the people), of no use is their dispute before their Lord and on them is wrath, and for them will be a severe torment\u201d\n[al-Shoora 42:16]\nShaykh al-Sa\u2019di said (may Allah have mercy on him): Here Allah tells us that \u201cthose who dispute concerning Allah\u201d, with false proofs and contradictory specious arguments, \u201cafter it has been accepted (by the people)\u201d i.e., after the people of insight and reason have responded to Allah, because of the definitive signs and clear proof that He has made clear to them, therefore these people who dispute the truth after it has been made clear to them, \u201cof no use is their dispute\u201d i.e., it is false and rejected \u201cbefore their Lord\u201d because it implies rejection of the truth, and everything that is contrary to the truth is false.\u00a0\n\u201cand on them is wrath\u201d because of their disobedience and their turning away from the proof of Allah and their rejecting it. \u201cand for them will be a severe torment\u201d which is the effect of Allah\u2019s wrath on them. This is the punishment of everyone who contests the truth with falsehood. End quote.\u00a0\nAllah says of His lying enemies (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd when they commit a Faahisha (evil deed, going round the Ka\u2018bah in naked state, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse), they say: \u2018We found our fathers doing it, and Allah has commanded it on us.\u2019 Say: \u2018Nay, Allah never commands Faahisha. Do you say of Allah what you know not?\u2019\n29.\u00a0Say (O Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645): My Lord has commanded justice and (said) that you should face Him only (i.e. worship none but Allah and face the Qiblah, i.e. the Ka\u2018bah at Makkah during prayers) in each and every place of worship, in prayers (and not to face other false deities and idols), and invoke Him only making your religion sincere to Him (by not joining in worship any partner with Him and with the intention that you are doing your deeds for Allah\u2019s sake only). As He brought you (into being) in the beginning, so shall you be brought into being [on the Day of Resurrection in two groups, one as a blessed one (believers), and the other as a wretched one (disbelievers)].\n30.\u00a0A group He has guided, and a group deserved to be in error; (because) surely, they took the Shayaateen (devils) as Awliyaa\u2019 (protectors and helpers) instead of Allah, and think that they are guided\u201d\n[al-A\u2019raaf 7:28-30].\nShaykh al-Sa\u2019di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Here Allah says, describing the evil state of the mushrikeen who commit sins, and claim that Allah commanded them to do them: \u201cAnd when they commit a Faahisha (evil deed)\u201d meaning everything that is regarded as abhorrent and repugnant, which includes their circumambulating the Ka\u2019bah naked. \u201cthey say: \u2018We found our fathers doing it\u201d they spoke the truth concerning that. \u201cand Allah has commanded it on us\u201d they were lying concerning that, hence Allah rejected this attribution of theirs and said: \u201cSay: \u2018Nay, Allah never commands Faahisha (evil deeds)\u2019\u201d i.e., it is not befitting to His perfection and wisdom to enjoin His slaves to commit evil deeds, whether it is what these mushrikeen were doing or anything else. \u201cDo you say of Allah what you know not?,\u201d and what fabrication can be greater than that? End quote. \u00a0\nWhat you have said is what the enemies of Allah, the mushrikeen and those who disbelieve His Messengers, say. They fall into sin, then they make excuses for it on the basis of qadar (the divine decree), saying that Allah created them like that, or that He commanded them to do it; exalted be Allah far above what the wrongdoers say.\u00a0\nHence let the adulterer, thief and murderer say: What is my fault? Allah created me like this. This false argument ultimately invalidates all the divine laws, and invalidates the commands and prohibitions, and gives people free rein, so that they fornicate like donkeys, and soon some of them may commit evil actions in the street, as will happen at the end of time, and as happens in some kaafir and sinful countries!\u00a0\nDo you know that you are the one who opened this door to yourself, but that Allah has proof against you, and you have no proof against Allah?\u00a0\nSo keep yourself busy with closing the door to evil and corruption, before you become unable to close it, instead of keeping yourself busy wondering about the one who made the door and how come he did not keep it closed, as it seems that you do not know the difference between the door and the wall!\u00a0\nIf you want it all to be a wall, with no door in it, and no lamp, then what is the point of accountability, and what is the value of commands and prohibitions, halaal and haraam, reward and punishment, Paradise and Hell?\u00a0\nTo sum up our advice to you, we advise you to hasten to get married, so that you can put your sperm into that which is pure and halaal, and protect yourself against haraam sex.\u00a0\nBut, so that you will not deceive the one who trusts you or betray that trust or transgress against one who has not wronged you, it is essential that you begin first with sincere repentance to Allah from the sin of homosexuality that you have fallen into, and strive to do all kinds of acts of obedience. Keep yourself busy with Allah and pleasing Him, then as soon as you feel that you have started to follow the path of guidance, and you feel that you are going in the right direction, then strengthen the motives of goodness and purity in your heart by marrying one who will keep you chaste. But before starting to treat the problem or feeling that you have repented sincerely, do not transgress against anyone else and do not betray the one who has trusted you.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to heal you, purify your heart, and keep you chaste.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "If there are ongoing arguments and disputes with the husband, is divorce required?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allaah has enjoined marriage, blessed man with it and made it one of His signs. He tells us that one of the greatest wisdoms behind marriage is to create tranquillity, love and compassion between the spouses. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy\u201d\n[al-Room 30:21].\u00a0\nThe purpose of marriage that Allaah intended cannot be achieved unless the spouses treat one another kindly, which means that each of them should do his or her duty towards the other.\u00a0\nThe wife should obey her husband on a reasonable basis, and allow him to do what Allaah has permitted of physical enjoyment, and stay in her house and not go out except with his permission. She has the right that her husband should clothe her, spend on her and provide accommodation for her on a reasonable basis, and she is entitled to kind treatment from him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cand live with them honourably\u201d [al-Nisa\u2019 4:19]. \u00a0\nOur advice to the husband, first of all, is to do his duty towards his wife. If he sees some shortcoming in her in some aspect, then there may be some other aspect in her that calls him to stay with her and not divorce her. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cIf you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good\u201d [al-Nisa\u2019 4:19]. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cNo believing man should hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her characteristics, he may be pleased with another.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (1469) from Abu Hurayrah.\u00a0\nWe think that the husband has done that, and that despite what he finds in his wife he should put up with her harm, and perhaps this is what the sister is surprised at, that the husband divorce her. Because the husband, by his wisdom and reason, can see that there is the possibility of correcting and changing his wife, and he is aware that the harm that would result from the break-up of the family and loss of his children through divorce is greater than the harm that results from arguments and her showing disrespect to him. \u00a0\nOur advice to the wife is to fear Allaah with regard to her husband and remember that he is her Paradise and her Hell. She may enter Paradise because of him or she may enter Hell. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cLook at how you are with him \u2013 the husband \u2013 because he is your Paradise and your Hell.\u201d Narrated by Ahmad (18524); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (220). Allaah has enjoined her to obey him on a reasonable basis, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told women of the great rights that the husband has over the wife, and that if he were to order anyone to prostrate to anyone, he would have ordered the wife to prostrate to the husband, as was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1159) from Abu Hurayrah and classed as saheeh.\u00a0\nThe wise woman does that which Allaah has enjoined upon her, and she does not transgress the limits set by Allaah. Transgression of the wife against the husband includes reviling him and arguing with him a great deal. If they have children, then it is more sinful, because her reviling him makes the children dare to disobey their father, and he loses respect in their eyes, and this has a negative impact on their upbringing.\u00a0\nIf you know that you can set right the mistakes that you have made, then you must hasten to do that, by seeking forgiveness, repenting, regretting it and resolving not to do such things again. You must also ask your husband for forgiveness and obey him and treat him kindly. Thus you will earn the pleasure of Allaah and the pleasure of your husband, and you will raise your children well. This is the domestic bliss that many people miss out on, which slips through their fingers, but they are careless or too arrogant to set things straight.\u00a0\nIf you think that you are not able to set things straight or have no intention of doing so, then we advice you to separate and ask your husband for khula\u2019, and you have to give him whatever you agree upon of the mahr, or more or less than that, so that he will divorce you. This is better for you than persisting in disobedience and increasing your burden of sin. \u00a0\nStrive \u2013 may Allaah bless you \u2013 to set things straight in your home, make your husband happy and bring your children up well. Strive to stay with him, adopt a good attitude and refrain from everything that will make him think badly of you and cause division between you and your husband. We can sense from your words that you feel sorry about things that you have done that are contrary to sharee\u2019ah. This is good but it needs to be strengthened. Strive to say du\u2019aa\u2019s at times when du\u2019aa\u2019s are answered, asking Allaah to purify your heart and actions, and to bless you with a good attitude. Do not hesitate to admit your mistakes to your husband and work out an agreement with him to set things straight between you. Refrain from arguing and reviling, and strive to be a good companion. We advise you to do \u2018Umrah together, and to have a program to strengthen your faith and increase the bonds between you, such as fasting, reading Qur\u2019aan and listening to useful tapes.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to guide you to that which is best in this world and the Hereafter.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "Her school is mixed and her father refuses to let her leave!",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In several previous answers \n    we have discussed the ruling on mixing at work and in places of study. \n    Please see the answer to question no. \n    1200 and 103044.\u00a0\nWith regard to your \n    problem, if you cannot leave school because of your social situation, then \n    you must look for another branch or faculty of the university where the \n    opportunities to deal with males and mix with them will be less, because the \n    basic principle of sharee\u2019ah is that if evil cannot be warded off entirely, \n    then it must be reduced as much as possible.\u00a0\nIf you cannot manage to \n    make this change that we have suggested, then you have to observe complete \n    hijab, lower your gaze and be chaste of speech in all circumstances, and \n    reduce the opportunities of mixing with males. If you need something, then \n    ask females for it, and try to work out something with your professor so \n    that your projects will be done with female classmates.\u00a0\nIf that is not possible, \n    then it will be your responsibility to careful and mix less with men; beware \n    of being alone with one of them, even if it is for the purpose of study, and \n    keep your dealings with males to a minimum. If you are able to refuse to mix \n    with them sometimes or for some work, then do that. Let your dealings be \n    serious and do not let them get to know you or let the conversation go \n    beyond the topic of study.\u00a0\nIf you feel that you are \n    becoming fond of someone or he is becoming fond of you, then leave this \n    group and join another, even if your grades fall or your level of academic \n    achievement is affected, within bearable limits.\u00a0\nAsk Allaah to protect you \n    and help you to avoid temptations both obvious and hidden, and seek help \n    with patience, prayer, fasting and remembrance of Allaah (dhikr).\u00a0\nSee also the answer to \n    question no. 72448."

        "question": "She adheres to the Sunnah and is being accused of being a fanatic, and she wants advice",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to relieve your distress and make things easy \n    for you, and to help you to obey Him and worship Him properly. Remember that \n    the alienation that you are feeling is a good sign for you, The Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIslam began as something \n    strange and will revert to being something strange, so glad tidings to the \n    strangers.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (145).\u00a0\n\n    The word tooba (translated here as \u201cglad tidings\u201d) has many \n    meanings, such as goodness and honour, a great tree in Paradise, joy and \n    happiness, and many other meanings, all of which may apply here.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Sindi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    \u201cStrange\u201d means because its followers are small in numbers. \n    The basic meaning of ghareeb (stranger) is one who is far from his home.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd will revert to being something strange\u201d means that few \n    will adhere to it and help others to do so, even if the Muslims are many. \u00a0\n\n    \u201cto the strangers\u201d means those who follow its commands.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cTooba\u201d is derived from the word tayyib (good), and it is \n    interpreted as referring to Paradise or to a great tree that grows there.\u00a0\n\n    This indicates that supporting Islam and obeying its commands \n    may require the one who does that to leave his homeland and be patient in \n    bearing the hardships of being away from his homeland, as was the case when \n    it first began.\u00a0\n\n    Sharh Sunan Ibn Majaah (hadeeth \n    no 3986.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    You have the best example in the Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He brought light to his people, \n    but they insisted on remaining in the darkness of kufr and ignorance. They \n    accused him of being a sorcerer, soothsayer or madman, but he was patient in \n    calling them, and he did not get fed up of repeating his call, using \n    different methods of calling individuals and groups, calling in secret and \n    in the open, until he attained great success. Similarly, daa\u2019iyahs who came \n    after him called the kuffaar to Islam, and called sinners to obedience, and \n    called innovators to the Sunnah. Many of them experienced hardship, distress \n    and difficulties, but that did not stop them from persisting in da\u2019wah. Were \n    it not for that, Islam would not have reached your country, the Maldives!\u00a0\n\n    Think about these examples, and do what they did, and be \n    patient as they were patient, so that you may attain the pleasure of Allaah. \n    What you hear of mockery and being called \u201cWahhabis\u201d was said by those who \n    came before them, and the fools still repeat it with regard to those who \n    promote the Sunnah, but that does not harm them or make them stop conveying \n    the religion of Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    In addition to being patient in calling people, we advise you \n    to select wise people among other women and your relatives to convey the \n    religion of Allaah to them and remind them of the truths of Islam, for if \n    people are happy to belong to Islam, that does not prevent them from \n    following the Sunnah, but there may be other obstacles that are preventing \n    them from coming to the path of truth, such as misguided scholars and \n    proponents of bid\u2019ah, or specious arguments and whims and desires, and so \n    on. It may also be due to the fact that we are failing to convey the truth \n    of Islam to them, or we do not have wise ways of conveying it.\u00a0\n\n    You have to be gentle and patient, and select the wisest \n    people, and address them politely. Use different means such as audio tapes, \n    video lectures and books, and you may see some good results.\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly: \u00a0\n\n    Strive to make your house the focal point of this da\u2019wah. \n    Start with your husband and children, so that this will become a house of \n    blessing for all people. Remember that our mother Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid \n    was the first one of this ummah to become Muslim, and she was the first one \n    to support the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in \n    conveying the message and calling her daughters to Islam. Her house was the \n    first house to become Muslim, and from it the call of goodness spread to all \n    corners of the earth, so be like her and follow her example.\u00a0\n\n    In the answer to question no.\n    9380 you will find more advice and \n    suggestions, which we hope you will read. There is no need to repeat them \n    here.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "A woman asking for a divorce from her husband who is addicted to drugs",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The basic principle is that it is not permissible for a woman \n    to ask for divorce unless there is a reason for that. The Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAny woman who \n    asks her husband for a divorce with no reason, the fragrance of Paradise \n    will be forbidden to her.\u201d Narrated by Ahmad (21874), Abu Dawood (2226) and \n    al-Tirmidhi (1187); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa\u2019 al-Ghaleel \n    (2035).\u00a0\n\n    And the words \u201cwith no reason\u201d mean without there being any \n    hardship that compels her to ask for a divorce.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in \n    Fath al-Baari:\u00a0\n\n    The reports which warn women against asking for divorce from \n    their husbands are to be understood as applying to cases where there is no \n    reason for that, because of the hadeeth of Thawbaan\u2026 then he mentioned the \n    hadeeth quoted above. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Undoubtedly addiction to drugs is a serious shortcoming, \n    which harms a woman in both religious and worldly terms, because there is no \n    guarantee that her husband will not enter upon her when he is intoxicated \n    and beat her or revile her, or ask her to do something at that time which it \n    is not permissible for her to do.\u00a0\n\n    Such a thing is regarded as an excuse which makes it \n    permissible for a woman to ask for divorce, but what the woman should do is \n    be patient with her husband, and try to set him straight as much as she can. \n    If she is not able to do that, and she finds that staying with him will \n    cause her harm, then there is nothing wrong with asking for divorce in that \n    case.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was asked:\u00a0\n\n    What is the ruling on a woman seeking divorce from her \n    husband who uses drugs? What is the ruling on her staying with him? Please \n    note that there is no one who will provide for her and her children except \n    him.\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\u00a0\n\n    It is permissible for a woman to ask for a divorce from her \n    husband who is addicted to drugs, because her husband\u2019s condition is not \n    acceptable. In this case, if she asks for a divorce from him, then the \n    children should stay with her, if they are younger than seven years, and the \n    father must spend on them. If she can stay with him to set him straight by \n    advising him, then that is better.

    {
        "question": "How should she get rid of those who are wasting her life",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Our advice to you will cover three things:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 We appreciate your keenness to make good use of your \n    time, and you are completely right, because a man\u2019s life is the days that \n    are passing and the hours that he spends. The wise man is the one who \n    protects his capital from loss and the loser is the one who squanders the \n    most precious thing that he possesses and does not appreciate its sanctity \n    or acknowledge its value.\u00a0\n\n    It says in Tafseer al-Raazi Mafaateeh al-Ghayb \n    (22/83):\u00a0\n\n    Allaah swears by al-\u2018asr \u2013 which is time \u2013 because of the \n    amazing things in it. In it both ease and hardship, good health and \n    sickness, wealth and poverty occur, and the value of time cannot be compared \n    to even the most precious and valuable of things. If you wasted one thousand \n    years on something that does not matter, then you made the most of the last \n    moment of your life to repent, you would abide in Paradise for eternity. \n    Therefore you should realize that the noblest thing in your life is the \n    moment you are in, and time is one of the foundations of blessings. Hence \n    Allaah swore by it, and He drew attention to the fact that night and day are \n    opportunities that man wastes, for time is nobler than place, so He swore by \n    it, because time is a pure blessing in which there is no defect, rather the \n    defective loser is man. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly: Then we advise you not to go to extremes in \n    refraining from talking to people and friends, and to allow a certain amount \n    of time to sit with them and speak kindly to them, especially relatives. It \n    was the practice of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) to visit his companions and enjoy their company and talk with them. \n    What is forbidden is to go to extremes in that so that long hours pass or it \n    leads to neglect of other obligatory duties that are waiting to be done, \n    such as worship, learning, work and so on. The best of things are those that \n    are moderate and the one who intends to do good, Allaah will enable him to \n    do it.\u00a0\n\n    When speaking to your friends and relatives, you should try \n    to discuss serious topics with them, and things that will benefit both your \n    religious and worldly interests, so that you will be rewarded for teaching \n    them and your sitting with them will count in your favour on the Day of \n    Resurrection, and not count against you.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said:\u00a0\n\n    \u201cNo people sit in a gathering in which they do not remember \n    Allaah or send blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him), but it will be a source of regret for them on the Day \n    of Resurrection, even if they enter Paradise as a reward.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by Ahmad (2/463) and classed as saheeh by the \n    commentators according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and \n    Muslim), and by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (no. \n    76).\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly: Make proper excuses to those who steal your time, \n    and think of means of achieving that. You know your situation. For example:\u00a0\n\n    You could apologize by saying that you are busy preparing for \n    a university or school exam, or a course of study, if you have anything to \n    do with these things, or say that you are busy preparing a certain project \n    for some organization. People usually accept these things, and they will \n    encourage you to make the most of your time for those purposes. If you \n    really do have to make some commitment to an academic body in order to \n    convince people, if you do not actually have any exam to prepare for or work \n    to do, then make that your intention when you speak of it, because \n    preparation\u00a0 always takes precedence, thus you will be telling the truth and \n    finding an excuse to give to them.\u00a0\n\n    You could use this excuse with the guests who are present, \n    and you can also use this excuse with friends who call you up, but getting \n    rid of people on the phone is easier, because the one who is calling you \n    cannot see what you are really doing at home. So you can apologize by saying \n    that you want to go and pray before the time for prayer ends, and your \n    intention may be to offer a naafil prayer if you have already offered the \n    obligatory prayer; or you could ask your mother to call you whilst you are \n    speaking on the phone and ask you to help her with something. If your friend \n    hears your mother calling, she will end her call. In these ways you can find \n    ways to rid yourself of the time-wasters whom many people have to deal \n    with.\u00a0\n\n    We will quote here the complaint of one of the scholars about \n    those who waste one\u2019s time, and how he dealt with this problem, and some \n    beautiful words about the importance of time, and the necessity of making \n    good use of it.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Jawzi said in Sayd al-Khaatir (p. 240-241):\u00a0\n\n    I seek refuge with Allaah from the company of idle folk! I \n    have seen many people who tried with me what is customary among many people \n    of visiting a great deal and they call these frequent visits a kind of \n    service; they want to sit with me and chat as people chat about what people \n    are talking about, and what does not concern anyone, and what may be gheebah \n    (backbiting).\u00a0\n\n    This is what many people do nowadays, and the one who is \n    visited may ask for that, or long for it, and feel lonely when no one visits \n    him, especially when there is a celebration or on Eid. So you see them going \n    to visit one another, and they don\u2019t limit it to offering greetings and \n    saying salaam, rather they add to that a great deal of what I call wasting \n    time. \u00a0\n\n    When I realized that time is the noblest thing, and that it \n    should be spent in doing good, I hated that, and I had two choices with \n    regard to them: if I tell them off, it will cause problems, and if I accept \n    it from them I will be wasting time! So I began to avoid meeting people as \n    much as I could, then if I did meet them I would try to keep the \n    conversation brief so that I could leave quickly.\u00a0\n\n    Then I prepared things that I could do to prevent talking to \n    them when they met me, lest time be wasted. Some of the preparations that I \n    made for meeting them were cutting paper for writing, sharpening pens and \n    putting papers together to make notebooks, because these things are \n    essential, but they do not need any thought or focus. So I kept them for the \n    times of their visits so that none of my time would be wasted.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to make us realize the preciousness of time and \n    help us to make the most of it. \u00a0\n\n    I have met many people who do not know the meaning of life. \n    Allaah has made some of them independent of means because they have a great \n    deal of wealth, so they sit in the marketplace for most of the day, watching \n    people, and they may see a great deal of evil deeds and objectionable \n    things. Some of them focus on playing chess and some waste their time in \n    talking about the rulers, or how expensive or cheap things are, and so on. I \n    realized that Allaah does not guide anyone to understanding the preciousness \n    of life and the value of time and health, except the one whom He inspires to \n    make the most of it. \u201cand none is granted it except the owner of the \n    great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e., Paradise and of a high \n    moral character)\u201d [Fussilat 41:35]. End quote.\n\n\n    We ask Allaah to guide us and you and grant happiness in this world and in \n    the Hereafter.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

Allaah knows but you do not know\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:216].\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Ibn \u2018Abbaas said: I was riding behind the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) one day and he said: \u201cO boy, I shall teach you some words. Be mindful Allaah and He will take care of you. Be mindful of Allaah and He will protect you. If you ask then ask of Allaah, and if you seek help then seek help from Allaah. Know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you in some way, they would not benefit you except in something that Allaah has decreed for you, and if they were to gather together to harm you in some way, they would not harm you except in something that Allaah has decreed for you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2516).\u00a0\nYou should note that what you have to do is to be content with your situation and realize that what Allaah has chosen for you is the best, and you missing out on something may be a good thing. \u00a0\nDo not let the whispers of the accursed shaytaan affect you and lead you every which way. Rather you should be as our Lord likes you to be, and accept His decree and thank Him for His blessings. Ponder the blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon you, and do not worry. Keep yourself busy with worship of Allaah and make a program for yourself so that you can wake up for Fajr prayer and then read Qur\u2019aan and adkhaar and du\u2019aas. Attend lectures and reminders and Islamic conferences. Through this program you will be able to relax and find peace of mind. Always comfort yourself with the words of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \u201cHow wonderful is the situation of the believer, for all his affairs are good. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him. This does not apply to anyone but the believer.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (2999).\u00a0\nBe kind to yourself, and remember that there are millions of women like you who are not married, but many of them may be happier than many of those who are married.\u00a0\nMay Allaah open your heart to contentment with His decree and give you peace of mind about your situation, and fill your heart with happiness. You are better off than many others!\u00a0\nDoes your sorrow at not being married increase when you see a woman and her husband and children going on a trip? Does this remind you that you are alone and without a husband and children? \u00a0\nDoes it make you feel that you have been wronged, or that you are unfortunate, or that you are deprived?\u00a0\nWait a minute, do not let these negative feelings and frustrations prevail over you and increase your\u00a0 sense of sadness and sorrow.\u00a0\nYou have seen only one aspect of this family\u2019s life, but there are many other aspects that you have not seen.\u00a0\nPerhaps if you saw the wife who has a hard-hearted husband who shows no compassion, and you heard her complaints about her continual suffering with him, you would praise Allaah for saving you from marriage.\u00a0\nIf you sit with a divorced woman who laments her fate and says that she regrets having married, and you listen to her as she complains about how much she put up with and how much she suffered until she got her divorce, and regained her sense of security, perhaps you will praise Allaah for not having got married and suffered what she has suffered.\u00a0\nIf you think about what thousands of wives are suffering and what may others whose marriages ended in divorce have had to put up with, this will reduce many of the feelings of regret that you have because of not being married.\u00a0\nThis way of thinking will dispel your feeling of having been hard done by, and will replace those feelings with a beautiful sense of contentment, which will earn you the pleasure of Allaah, as I told you in the previous message.\u00a0\nRemember your friend\u2019s complaints about her husband yelling and being angry all the time, and how you have been saved from that.\u00a0\nRemember your neighbour who left her home weeping after her husband beat her and hurt her.\u00a0\n\u201cI have reached my forties and am not married, and I praise Allaah for everything that He has decreed for me. At first I felt sad and upset whenever I was alone, and I regretted my misfortune every time one of my friends got married. I did not have any conditions or specific characteristics in the man I wanted to marry; I was prepared to accept any righteous man. But years went by without this man coming to me. I began to withdraw from people so that I would not see their looks of pity but I could not escape them completely, because I would see them in the eyes of my parents and siblings who would pray for me every time they saw me. One day at the end of Sha\u2019baan, as we were preparing for the blessed month of Ramadaan, Allaah guided me to keep a Mus-haf just for myself. I decided to read the whole Qur\u2019aan and I found it very difficult to read it because I had stopped reading for the last ten years. I also found it difficult to understand some verses, so I bought a book of Tafseer (commentary) and I started to read it so that I could understand the verses of Qur'aan that I was reading. Ramadaan ended but my attachment to the Book of Allaah did not stop; I carried on reading the verses of Allaah and reading the commentary thereon.\u00a0\n\u201cThen came the day when I read the verse in Soorat al-Kahf (interpretation of the meaning): Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But the good righteous deeds that last, are better with your Lord for rewards and better in respect of hope [al-Kahf 18:46].\u00a0 I wondered, what does the good righteous deeds that last\u2019 mean? I found in the Tafseer that it refers to all righteous deeds.\u00a0\n\u201cI fell in love with righteous deeds such as prayer, fasting, charity, tasbeeh, tahmeed, tahleel and takbeer. Happiness began to fill my heart and I became content. I praised Allaah greatly for guiding me to this path and teaching me these things.\u201d\u00a0\nSister Umm Yamaan adds: \u00a0\n\u201cBut this is not a call for monasticism, rather it is a call to accept the will and decree of Allaah.\u201d\u00a0\nGhayr Mutazawwajaat walakin Sa\u2019eedaat (Unmarried but Happy) 1/4-7 by Muhammad Rasheed al-\u2018Uwayd.\u00a0\nBut every girl should understand that the purpose of life is to be a true slave of Allaah in both the specific and general senses. If she has the opportunity to establish a Muslim household, then the girl will be worshipping Allaah by getting married and raising children, and raising for us the generation that we want.\u00a0\nBut if that does not happen, then the ways of worshipping Allaah in general are many, foremost among which is calling people to Allaah. So she should focus on women who have deviated from the path of Allaah and take them as her daughters and guide them to the straight path of Allaah. \u201cThe one who calls people to guidance will have a reward equal to theirs, without it detracting from their reward in the slightest.\u201d\u00a0\nSo regard the Muslim community as your home, and be like a beacon of guidance, truth, justice and knowledge, and let us advise one another to adhere to truth and patience. \u201cSurely, Allaah wastes not the reward of the Muhsinoon [those who do good]\u201d [al-Tawbah 9:120].\u00a0\nGhayr Mutazawwajaat walakin Sa\u2019eedaat (Unmarried but Happy) 1/12 by Muhammad Rasheed al-\u2018Uwayd.\u00a0\nSee also the answer to questions no. 21234 and 72257.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Undoubtedly the way in which many Muslim societies (including \n    Egyptian society) view plural marriage is as a betrayal of the first wife, \n    or as something for which the husband or second wife are to be blamed. \n    Undoubtedly this is a mistaken view that is contrary to the law of Allaah, \n    which permits a man to marry up to four wives. Allaah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201c\u2026then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, \n    or four \u2026\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa\u20194:3]\n\n    The Muslim cannot object to the rulings of Allaah, or think \n    that there is any injustice, transgression or error in the rulings of \n    Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    Hence we do not agree with you when you say: \u201cHow can I take \n    the husband from his wife and children?\u201d \u00a0\n\n    You are not taking this husband away; rather he has come and \n    proposed to you of his own free will.\u00a0\n\n    Moreover he is going to bear the burden of two families and \n    two households at the same time; he is not going to leave his first wife and \n    children for your sake, so how can that be taking him away?\u00a0\n\n    As for the opinion of the first wife, this is part of the \n    human nature which is inherent in most women (jealousy), and she wants to \n    keep her husband for herself and not share him with anyone. The Mothers of \n    the Believers (may Allaah be pleased with them) who were the best women of \n    this ummah, had some problems because of jealousy, but the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forgave them and did not hold it \n    against them.\u00a0\n\n    You can remedy that with a little wisdom and good attitude. \n    But it is also essential to put up with some of that which may come from her \n    because this is the nature of women.\u00a0\n\n    The husband must also be wise in his dealing with such \n    attitudes so that he will not make the disputes and conflicts worse.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to our advice to you, whether to accept this \n    husband or wait in the hope that Allaah might provide you with someone \n    else:\u00a0\n\n    The answer is that if you hope that there may come someone \n    who is better than him, then there is no reason why you should not refuse \n    him, but if you are afraid \u2013 as you are older \u2013 and because of your \n    situation that there will not be anyone else who is better than him, or even \n    like him, then we think \u2013 and Allaah knows best \u2013 that you should agree to \n    this marriage.\u00a0\n\n    For a woman to agree to be a second wife and to put up with \n    some problems from the first wife or the society around her, is much easier \n    than staying without a husband.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to make good easy for you wherever it is.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "He did a marriage contract with her and she changed \u2013 should he divorce her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The basic principle concerning divorce is that it is makrooh, \n    because it results in severing of in-law ties and the breaking up of the \n    family, and hardship for the children.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said:\u00a0\n\n    The basic principle concerning divorce is that it is not \n    allowed, rather it is only permitted as much as is necessary.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (33/81).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The basic principle concerning divorce is that it is makrooh, \n    and the evidence for that is the verse about those who \u201ctake an oath \n    (eela\u2019) not to have sexual relation with their wives\u201d [al-Baqarah \n    2:226], i.e., they swear not to have intercourse with them for four months. \n    \u201cthen if they return (change their idea in this period), verily, Allaah \n    is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And if they decide upon divorce, then \n    Allaah is All-Hearer, All-Knower\u201d. This implies a kind of threat, but if \n    they return, i.e., go back to their wives, He says: \u201cverily, Allaah is \n    Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\u201d This indicates that divorce is not liked \n    by Allaah, and that the basic principle concerning it is that it is makrooh, \n    and that is indeed the case.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Sharh al-Mumti\u2019 (10/428)\u00a0\n\n    But because people\u2019s nature, character and religious \n    commitment vary from one person to another, it is essential that divorce be \n    included in the laws prescribed by Allaah. A woman may be harmed by staying \n    with her husband if he is lacking in religious commitment or he has a bad \n    attitude or harsh nature, and a man may be harmed by staying with his wife \n    if she is not fit to raise his children or she does not give him his rights \n    on a reasonable basis. Hence prescribing divorce is wise and is suited to \n    human nature.\u00a0\n\n    Both spouses may be better off after divorce, as Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cBut \n    if they separate (by divorce), Allaah will provide abundance for everyone of \n    them from His Bounty. And Allaah is Ever All\u2011Sufficient for His creatures\u2019 \n    needs, All\u2011Wise\u201d al-Nisa\u2019 4:130]. Hence divorce is not the end of \n    the world, and divorce may be the best way for a couple who are incompatible \n    in their natures, behaviours, attitude and actions. \u00a0\n\n    Based on this, what we advise you to do is to bring in wise \n    people from your family and hers to intervene and convince her of the \n    necessity of mending her ways and changing the way she deals with you, and \n    to promise to follow the straight path in your married life without any \n    deviation, and tell her that this is the only way you can continue the \n    marriage with her. If she responds and accepts this, then praise be to \n    Allaah, and perhaps Allaah will bring you together. \u00a0\n\n    We advise you to wait for a while before completing the \n    marriage, so that you can see how keen she is to settle down to living with \n    you, and how able she in fact is to do that, because what you have told us \n    about her makes us doubt strongly that she is keen to agree to that or is \n    able to do it.\u00a0\n\n    If she does not agree, then what we think is that you should \n    divorce her; divorcing her now is better for you and for her than divorcing \n    her after consummating the marriage or having children.\u00a0\n\n    If you do that and divorce takes place, there is no sin on \n    you, because divorce in this case is obligatory or mustahabb, especially if \n    she insists on working in a mixed environment, which is something that is \n    haraam and you should not compromise about it, rather you should make her \n    give it up. If she insists, then this is sufficient reason to divorce her, \n    so how about if the other things about her are added to that?!\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows \n    best."

    {
        "question": "She lives with her mother-in-law and there are a lot of problems between them",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.You should understand that differences are human nature; human beings are not all the same in terms of attitude, religious commitment, reasoning and behaviour. You should also pay attention to the fact that when a person grows older, their reasoning diminishes and they become childlike in many ways. You should also remember that you are dealing with your husband\u2019s mother, and usually mothers-in-law feel as jealous of their sons\u2019 wives as they would of a co-wife.\u00a0\nIf you pay attention to all of the above, then your problems will begin to seem insignificant and your worry will be dispelled. What you are suffering from is something that many women suffer from, and it needs two important things: patience and wisdom.\u00a0\nSo bear with patience whatever you see and hear from your husband\u2019s family, and be wise in your dealings with them, especially with your husband\u2019s mother, for by means of your wisdom you will be able to avoid many problems and you will earn their approval or at least put a stop to their ill will towards you; and you will also win your husband\u2019s heart and please him.\u00a0\nWisdom in your dealings with your husband\u2019s mother means that you must speak nicely to her, praise her, pray for her, respond to her requests and be more concerned about her than she is herself, if she takes medicine, for example, or she has an appointment to visit a doctor. Gifts also play a major role in softening her heart and changing the way she deals with you.\u00a0\nBut it should also be noted that you are not obliged to serve her or take care of her in the sense of it being an Islamic obligation. What you are doing is something that is mustahabb and is liked in Islam, and it is also kindness towards your husband. Perhaps if she realizes that you are doing something that is not obligatory upon you in sharee\u2019ah, and your husband realizes that also, this will elevate your status in their eyes.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThis does not mean that you should go along with her in gheebah or backbiting when she does that; rather you should advise her to stop eating the flesh of people by backbiting them. If she stops, that will be better for her, and you will have the reward for that, but if she continues and does not pay attention, then it is not permissible for you to sit with her when she is backbiting about others. Rather you must leave her company and your doing this may play a role in her stopping backbiting. It is not sufficient for you to denounce it in your heart in this case, because you do not come under the heading of being forced to do it. It is essential for her and her son to understand this ruling, and you should understand that if you stay with her when she is doing that, then you are a partner with her in the sin of backbiting, so how about if you join in with them by speaking?\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nYou have every right to have a separate house in which you live with your husband and children, and you have the right to privacy, if your husband wants you to live with his family, and he will not be disobeying his mother if he allows you that. The wise and intelligent man weighs things against the standards of sharee\u2019ah, and gives each person who is entitled to rights his or her due, and he does not take away from one in order to give to another.\u00a0 \u00a0\nBut despite that we know how difficult it is to live separately in many cases, especially in current circumstances when finding suitable accommodation, especially in the big cities, is very difficult to achieve. In this case the man must look at his circumstances in general with an open mind, so that he will not make things difficult for himself or for the people around him. Allah has decreed proficiency in all things.\u00a0\nYour husband has to understand the reality of your situation with his mother, because this is causing you to be edgy, which is affecting your children. It may also be affecting your husband. Hence he should hasten to solve the problems in his household, and he should accept frank discussion with you in all matters. He has to bear the responsibility that Islam has enjoined on him, and he has to honour his family, which also includes advising them and reminding them if they do something that is contrary to sharee\u2019ah. He is also responsible for treating his wife kindly and he is responsible for raising his children. He is in great need of someone who can discuss these matters frankly with him and help him, and you are the main support who can help him in all these matters. \u00a0\nWe ask Allah to guide you and set your affairs straight, and to reconcile between you, and to make you a happy family in this world and in the Hereafter.\u00a0 \u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Who has more right to her son \u2013 her or her husband whom she suspects of witchcraft? What are the signs of the practitioner of witchcraft?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \u00a0\nIslam enjoins parents to \n    take care of their children and raise them well. Children will grow up on \n    what they hear, read and see in their home, on the streets and in school, \n    and whatever faults happen in their upbringing are because of faults in one \n    or\u00a0 all of these aspects.\u00a0\nWhat has happened with your \n    son, of his bad attitude towards you, may because of what he has seen and \n    heard at home of the problems between you and your husband, which led to \n    divorce, or it may be because of the influence of what he has seen and read \n    on the computer, or it may be the result of witchcraft done against him by \n    his father in order to take him from you. Any of these things is possible, \n    or it may be all of these reasons combined that has lead to this bad \n    behaviour of your son towards you.\u00a0\nWhatever the case, you have \n    to set things straight by looking for the causes that have led to these \n    problems, so that you can deal with the matter by dealing with the cause. If \n    it is because of your problems with his father, then you must make him \n    understand the reality of the situation and what happened [?} between you, \n    in a way that is appropriate to his age and level of understanding. If the \n    cause is what he hears, watches and sees on the computer then you must keep \n    an eye on whatever he is looking at, and it is essential to teach him to \n    make good use of the computer. If he does not respond, then you can forbid \n    him to use it altogether. If the cause is his father doing witchcraft on \n    him, then you can start to remedy it by using shar\u2019i ruqyahs from the \n    Qur\u2019aan and saheeh dhikrs of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him). There is no reason why you shouldn\u2019t take him to someone whose \n    religious commitment you trust, to treat him in the shar\u2019i manner for such \n    cases.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nYou can find out whether \n    his father is really doing sihr (witchcraft) by finding out how he treats \n    others or what he really says to those who visit him and consult him.\u00a0\nSome of the scholars have \n    mentioned the signs of the saahir (practitioner of witchcraft) by means of \n    which anyone can discern the saahir from those who are good and righteous. \n    These signs are:\u00a0\n\n    1.He asks the sick person for his \n    mother\u2019s name, and some personal possession of the one for whom treatment is \n    sought, such as his hair or clothing.\n\n    2.He mumbles words that have no \n    meaning and that the listener cannot understand. The muttering may be calls \n    to the jinn or devils to come and serve him.\n\n    3.Another sign is that the saahir \n    does not attend Jumu\u2019ah prayer or the five daily prayers in the mosque.\n\n    4.He is dishevelled and smells \n    bad, and he likes being in the dark and on his own.\n\n    5.He gives the sick person an \n    amulet (\u201chijab\u201d) containing some mumbo-jumbo, squares or numbers.\nTo find out the truth, he \n    should have all or some of the characteristics. Thus you will know the truth \n    about him. It should be noted that you may be exaggerating in suspecting him \n    of witchcraft. You have to be fair in judging him, and fear Allaah before \n    making accusations and claims of which he is innocent.\u00a0\nBut so long as you have \n    separated from him, we do not think that you should concern yourself too \n    much with your ex-husband and whether he is a saahir or not; rather what you \n    should do is focus on how to protect yourself and your son, and how to \n    fulfil your duty of raising this boy.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nWith regard to custody of \n    the child, it is known that the purpose of custody is to protect and take \n    care of the child. Hence a person\u2019s right to custody is waived if he is \n    immoral or corrupt, or if he neglects him, or if he travels a great deal, \n    which would harm the child\u2019s interests.\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn \n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him):\u00a0\nIt should be noted that \n    there is no text which gives precedence to either parent in general terms, \n    or chooses one of the parents in all cases. The scholars are unanimously \n    agreed that neither of them is specified in all cases, rather when there is \n    transgression of the limits or neglect, precedence is not to be given to the \n    one who will be like that (i.e., the parent who will transgress the limits \n    or be neglectful) over the one who is just and good and will do what is \n    required.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa \n    (34/132).\u00a0\nIt should be noted that the \n    period of custody extends until the child reaches the age of discernment and \n    independence, i.e., custody lasts until the child is able to discern and is \n    independent of his guardian, in the sense that he can eat and drink by \n    himself, and clean himself after going to the toilet by himself, and so on.\u00a0\nAs he has reached the age \n    of 11, he should be given the choice of living with his father or with you, \n    so long as the choice is made by him freely, without any pressure or \n    compulsion, and so long as the reason for his choice is not that he will \n    never be told to pray or obey Allaah, or to do anything that is in his \n    religious or worldly interests, because his choice in this case would be \n    harmful to him. Many children care only about choosing the one who will \n    spoil them the most or give them the toys and games that they want, so in \n    that case he should not be allowed to have what he wants.\u00a0\nIf it is proven that his \n    father is engaging in witchcraft, then it is not permissible for him to take \n    his son, rather he should be withheld from him until he repents sincerely to \n    Allaah.\u00a0\nIf it is not proven that \n    the father is engaging in witchcraft, then the parents should cooperate in \n    raising their son, and pay attention to what is in his best interests, so \n    that their conflict will not be a cause of the children failing and being \n    lost.\u00a0\nSee also the answers to \n    questions no. 8189 and \n    20705 and \n    21516.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to set all \n    your affairs straight and to guide your son to that which our Lord loves and \n    is pleased with, and to set his father straight and protect his religious \n    commitment.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "His wife became Muslim but he hurts her and mistreats her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    We praise Allaah for having guided this sister to Islam and \n    we ask Him to make her steadfast in adhering to the truth, and to guide her \n    to the right words and deeds.\u00a0\n\n    What the sister has mentioned is an example of how Islam is \n    suffering at the hands of its people \u2013 if we may put it this way \u2013 people \n    who claim to be Muslim, then they go against the rulings and etiquette of \n    Islam. Moreover, if this transgression happened in a Muslim country, where \n    Islam is prevalent and those who are committed to the faith are known, then \n    no one would be blamed for someone else\u2019s mistakes, and no one would condemn \n    Islam because of the bad deeds of an evildoer. In that case the matter \n    wouldn\u2019t be so bad. But the problem becomes worse when one of these \n    evildoers lives in the west, among the kuffaar, and they regard him as a \n    representative of Islam and of its morals, etiquette and rulings, then he \n    lives his life like the Jews and Christians around him, not paying any \n    attention to what is halaal and haraam.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Awzaa\u2019i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It was said \n    that there is no Muslim who is not standing guard on the borders of Islam, \n    so whoever can prevent Islam from being undermined or attacked, let him do \n    so.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Hasan ibn Hayy (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With \n    regard to Islam, the Muslims are like a fortress. If a Muslim does a bad \n    deed, Islam is breached from his direction; if all the Muslims do bad deeds, \n    you should persevere in adhering to that which, if all the people were \n    united on it, the religion of Islam would prevail, that which Allaah wants \n    for all people, and do not let Islam be breached from your direction.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Sunnah by Muhammad ibn Nasr \n    al-Marwazi (no. 29, 30).\u00a0\n\n    It hurts every Muslim to hear that Muslim sisters who have \n    entered Islam recently are exposed to verbal and physical harm by those who \n    are supposed to be a good example of Islam and of the Muslim family which \n    should be distinguished by stability, love and compassion among its members. \n    It is regrettable that among those who claim to belong to Islam there should \n    be someone like this husband who sets a bad example and puts people off \n    Islam, and who causes the image of Islam to be distorted, which leads people \n    to criticize it.\u00a0\n\n    If one of the things that this husband does is to neglect the \n    prayer, then the sister should realize that it is not permissible for her to \n    stay with him, because not praying is regarded in sharee\u2019ah as kufr which \n    puts one beyond the pale of Islam, hence the marriage contract is rendered \n    invalid. A person like this husband is not fit to be the head of a family in \n    which he is entrusted with his wife and children, rather there is the fear \n    that he may harm them by his bad actions. If he does not spend on them as \n    enjoined by Allaah, then he has combined all kinds of evil in his actions \n    and attitude, and staying with him is a heavy burden that the wife is \n    shouldering for no reason; if she rids herself of him by means of divorce or \n    separation, that will be better for her and perhaps her life will change for \n    the better, either on her own with her children or with another husband who \n    understands the value of family and fulfils the duty that Allaah has \n    enjoined upon him.\u00a0\n\n    If this sister hopes that her husband will be guided and set \n    straight, then she should strive to achieve that through his friends or \n    relatives who may be able to have some effect on him and guide him. She can \n    also make use of audio and video tapes which contain exhortations and \n    warnings against committing sin, and remind one of death, the grave and the \n    reckoning. Perhaps that will influence him and bring him back to his Lord, \n    may He be glorified and exalted.\u00a0\n\n    If that does not do any good, then she should not hesitate to \n    refer her case to a Muslim judge or mufti, or the imam of a mosque whose \n    knowledge and religion commitment she trusts, to help her to get rid of him. \n    If she cannot do that, then she should refer the matter to judicial or state \n    institutions that take care of family matters. If he does not pray, then her \n    marriage is null and void, and if he commits those sins although he also \n    prays, then she should pursue shar\u2019i means of freeing herself from him \n    through a scholar or seeker of knowledge or an Islamic centre, to oblige him \n    to spend on his family and give up sins and evil actions. If he refuses then \n    they should divorce her from him in accordance with sharee\u2019ah, and after \n    that she should divorce him officially so that he will no longer be regarded \n    as her husband.\u00a0\n\n    This sister should strive to move to a\u00a0 Muslim country \n    because that \u2013 even though there may be things there that go against \n    sharee\u2019ah \u2013 is better than the land of kufr and permissiveness, where the \n    Muslim cannot find safety for himself and his children. \n\n    We ask Allaah to increase her reward and to guide her and her \n    children, and help them to do that which pleases Him.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "His mother makes false accusations against his wife",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Your problem is one of the issues that arise in married life, and it is an ancient and complex problem, so much so that among the Arabs it has become the proverbial example of people who have to deal with one another and cannot do without one another, and between whom there is ongoing enmity; they say \u201cThe mother-in-law is too concerned about the daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law is too suspicious of the mother-in-law.\u201d Al-hamaah (usually translated as \u201cmother-in-law\u201d) is the husband\u2019s sister or mother, and the \u201cdaughter-in-law\u201d is the man\u2019s wife. What this means is that if the daughter-in-law hears anything, she will say, \u201cThis is what my mother-in-law is doing to me!\u201d [See: al-Mustaqsa fi\u2019l-Amthaal by al-Zamakhshari (1/77)]. So in fact each of the two parties is watching out and taking a defensive stance.\u00a0\nIn relationships such as these, many factors and influences are interwoven, each of which must be paid attention to and understood, then we should try to find a way to deal with them so that we can get the best results.\u00a0\nPerhaps you understand that jealousy \u2013 which Allah has created in man \u2013 is one of these main factors, especially between your mother and your wife, because your mother, who has been with you for many years, looking after you and taking care of you, is going to feel that you no longer belong only to her; indeed she will feel that her share of you is no longer enough to fulfil her rights over you, and that the division of your attention between her and your wife is not fair. Your wife gets love, compassion and care, and all the mother gets is your showing patience, with difficulty, for her troubles, and your giving her what she needs with reluctance and resentment. This applies if the son gives her her rights, so how about if he is disobedient and denies her her rights? In that case there will be problems.\u00a0\nJealousy makes a person blind and deaf, and it soon destroys any happiness and tranquillity that the family might have. It is at its strongest when we do not handle it properly and do not try to tame it.\u00a0\nI have started by highlighting these fasts so that you may understand two important things:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 So that you may understand the real reason why your mother is treating your wife in this manner, and so that you may appreciate her excuse for doing so, which is that she may not have any control over her feelings, because women are very weak in the face of such feelings, and they cannot hide them despite their best efforts to show contentment and acceptance. If you understand your mother\u2019s excuse, this will put your mind at rest and soothe your\u00a0 feelings towards her, and you will become certain that honouring, obeying and loving her are obligatory for you, and you should not doubt that for a single moment, no matter how bad the problem that is caused by jealousy gets.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 You should realize that it is only with love that you change the situation between your mother and your wife The mother needs more reassurance that her son loves her and that his love, respect and kind treatment of her have not changed. Indeed, you have to try to increase these feelings by repeatedly visiting her, giving her gifts and trying to make her happy with kind words and fulfilling her wishes. Then she will begin to calm down and her jealousy will diminish, and gradually the problems that she has caused will begin to ease off.\u00a0\nIf your mother is quick to accuse your wife and the mother of your children unfairly, as seems to us to be the case, then we will address the situation by addressing you and your wife first, because this in fact is the easier of the two sides to deal with.\u00a0\nWe say to your wife: Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThe good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allah orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend\u201d\u00a0[Fussilat 41:34].\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cCharity does not decrease wealth. No one forgives, but Allah increases him in honour, and no one humbles himself before Allah but Allah raises him in status.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (2588)\nAccording to another hadeeth: \u201cNo one is wronged and bears it with patience but Allah will increase him in honour.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2325) and classed as saheeh by al-Albani.\u00a0\nHow many problems can be solved if the wife trains herself to adopt this attitude, seeking to attain Allah\u2019s pleasure and to avoid problems for her husband and to give him peace of mind at home?\u00a0\nShe should try to regard her mother-in-law as being like her own mother, and put up with her anger and forgive her bad treatment, especially if they live separately. This will reduce problems and confrontation, to a large extent.\u00a0\nHow many problems will be reduced, and even ended, by Allah\u2019s leave, if the wife can seek suitable opportunities to give nice gifts to your mother, even if there are some hard feelings between them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cGive gifts to one another, you will love one another.\u201d Narrated by Abu Ya\u2019la and classed as hasan by al-Albani.\u00a0\nWith regard to yourself, you have to open your heart to honouring and loving your mother a great deal, whilst also loving your wife and being happy with her. If you succeed, that is the beginning of the solution, but if you fail, the suffering will continue and increase. This matter needs you to be patient and to learn, for man is able to learn how to show feelings of friendship and love just as he is able to learn any other skill in this life.\u00a0\nIn all of that, it is essential that you adhere to the guidelines that have been set out by Islam. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour\u201d[al-Isra\u2019 17:23]\u00a0\n\u201cBut if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do\u201d\u00a0[Luqmaan 31:15]\nThink about how the shirk and kufr of the parents \u2013 which are the worst of sins \u2013 should not prevent the son from behaving kindly with them, so how about if there are some problems with your wife?\u00a0\nThe most important of these guidelines that Islam has set out is protecting your wife\u2019s rights and respecting her feelings and wishes, and not being unfair to her or wronging her in order to fulfil your mother\u2019s rights. You should not obey your mother if she tells you to leave your wife, and it is not permissible for you to believe what she accuses your wife of falsely, especially if your wife is of good character and religiously committed. She is a trust (amaanah) that has been given to you, so you have to protect this trust.\u00a0\nIf we had the opportunity to speak to your mother, we would say to her:\u00a0\nDear mother, you have carried and borne your son, you have raised him with a great deal of selflessness and effort on your part, so do not spoil your kindness to your son by making his life difficult. Treat this wife whom your son has chosen for himself and through whom Allah has given him children, like your own daughter. Think about how you would like your daughter to be treated by her husband and family, and treat her in that way. Strive to be kind as our Lord has commanded us (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cand do good. Truly, Allah loves Al-Muhsinoon(the good-doers)\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:195].\u00a0\nIf you are unable to be kind, then at least be fair. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cand be equitable. Verily, Allah loves those who are the equitable\u201d\u00a0[al-Hujuraat 49:9].\u00a0\nBeware of wrongdoing. It was narrated from \u2018Abd-Allah ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWrongdoing will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d Agreed upon.\u00a0\nSome of the rulings on this topic have been discussed in detail in the answer to question no. 7653 and 44923 and 47040.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to set your affairs straight and to reconcile between you, and to bless us and you with a good life in this world and in the Hereafter.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "He has been guided recently, and his family and friends mock him. What should he do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Congratulations on your repentance, O slave of Allaah. \n    Congratulations on turning back to your Lord. Praise be to Allaah Who has \n    saved you from the path of misguidance and temptation, and has brought you \n    back to the path of repentance and guidance. May Allaah increase you in \n    guidance, righteousness and piety, and make you steadfast in following the \n    straight path, until you meet Him in a state of goodness that He loves and \n    is pleased with.\u00a0\n\n    You should realize that the shaytaan will never give up \n    easily after you have repented, and he will never leave you alone, because \n    you were one of his troops and you have left him without his permission or \n    approval! Now you have become one of the troops of the Most merciful. You \n    were one of his gang, but now you have gone over to his enemies. Allaah has \n    blessed you with guidance and you have annoyed him. So obviously he will \n    try, by all means possible, to take you back to the way you were before. So \n    you have to be patient and steadfast, and keep company with righteous people \n    who will help you to follow the truth.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to accept from you your protective jealousy \n    concerning the deen, and your enjoining what is good and forbidding what is \n    evil, and your love for people to be guided.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    You should look at your situation from two viewpoints:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 That you have recently been guided\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 That you are calling people to Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 With regard to the first issue:\u00a0\n\n    Our advice to you is to be patient in putting up with \n    offensive and foolish attitudes, but you may use harsh measures if \n    necessary. That applies if it has to do with making fun of the deen, and you \n    are able to prevent it or stop it.\u00a0\n\n    The shaytaan has troops whom he sends to trick and plot and \n    keep people from following the deen. These troops are not all from among the \n    jinn; he also has human troops. They are the ones who fulfil his mission of \n    preventing people from obeying Allaah and pushing them to commit sins. \n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies \u2014 \n    Shayaateen (devils) among mankind and jinn, inspiring one another with \n    adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception). If your Lord had so \n    willed, they would not have done it; so leave them alone with their \n    fabrications\u201d\n\n    [al-An\u2019aam 6:112]\n\n    But your Lord offers you peace of mind, a great reward of \n    steadfastness on the Day of Resurrection if you bear the insults of these \n    foolish people with patience in this world. The reward is a rise in status \n    on the Day of Resurrection, and our Lord warns them of a severe punishment \n    if they die in their folly and mocking the believers.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBeautified is the life of this world for those who \n    disbelieve, and they mock at those who believe. But those who obey Allaah\u2019s \n    Orders and keep away from what He has forbidden, will be above them on the \n    Day of Resurrection. And Allaah gives (of His Bounty, Blessings, Favours, \n    and Honours on the Day of Resurrection) to whom He wills without limit\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:212]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cVerily, (during the worldly life) those who committed \n    crimes used to laugh at those who believed.\n\n    30.\u00a0And, whenever they passed by them, used to wink one to \n    another (in mockery).\n\n    31.\u00a0And when they returned to their own people, they would \n    return jesting;\n\n    32.\u00a0And when they saw them, they said: \u2018Verily, these have \n    indeed gone astray!\u2019\n\n    33.\u00a0But they (disbelievers, sinners) had not been sent as \n    watchers over them (the believers).\n\n    34.\u00a0But this Day (the Day of Resurrection) those who \n    believe will laugh at the disbelievers\n\n    35.\u00a0On (high) thrones, looking (at all things).\n\n    36.\u00a0Are not the disbelievers paid (fully) for what they \n    used to do?\u201d\n\n    [al-Mutaffiffeen 83:29-36]\n\n    Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\n    Here Allaah tells us that those who committed crimes used to \n    laugh at the believers in this world, i.e., they used to make fun of them \n    and scorn them, and when they passed by the believers they would wink at one \n    another (in mockery), i.e., mocking them.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd when they returned to their own people, they would \n    return jesting\u201d i.e., when these people who committed crimes went back \n    to their homes, they would return jesting, i.e., whatever they looked for \n    they would find, but despite that they did not appreciate the blessing that \n    Allaah had bestowed on them, rather they were preoccupied with scorning and \n    envying the believers.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd when they saw them, they said: \u2018Verily, these have \n    indeed gone astray!\u2019\u201d i.e., because they were following a religion other \n    than theirs.\u00a0\n\n    Allaah says \u201cBut they (disbelievers, sinners) had not been \n    sent as watchers over them (the believers)\u201d i.e., these evildoers were \n    not sent as watchers over these believers to see what they did and said, and \n    they were not put in charge of them, so why should they spend their time \n    watching them and keeping an eye on them, as Allaah says (interpretation of \n    the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cHe (Allaah) will say: \u2018Remain you in it with ignominy! \n    And speak you not to Me!\u2019\n\n    109.\u00a0Verily, there was a party of My slaves, who used to \n    say: \u2018Our Lord! We believe, so forgive us, and have mercy on us, for You are \n    the Best of all who show mercy!\u2019\n\n    110.\u00a0But you took them for a laughing stock, so much so \n    that they made you forget My remembrance while you used to laugh at them!\n\n    111.\u00a0Verily, I have rewarded them this Day for their \n    patience; they are indeed the ones that are successful\u201d\n\n    [al-Mu\u2019minoon 23:108-111]\n\n    Hence He says to them here [al-Mutaffiffeen 83:34]: \u201cthis \n    Day\u201d i.e., the Day of Resurrection.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBut this Day (the Day of Resurrection) those who believe \n    will laugh at the disbelievers\u201d i.e., in return for their laughing at \n    them.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cOn (high) thrones, looking\u201d i.e., looking at Allaah, \n    may He be glorified and exalted, in return for the claim that they were \n    misguided. But they were not misguided, rather they were among the friends \n    of Allaah who are close to Him, looking at their Lord in a place of honour.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAre not the disbelievers paid (fully) for what they used \n    to do?\u201d i.e., have the kuffaar been requited for what they used to do of \n    mocking and belittling the believers, or not? i.e., they have been amply \n    requited, in full.\u00a0\n\n    Tafseer Ibn Katheer (8/353, \n    354)\u00a0\n\n    So be patient and seek reward with Allaah for putting up with \n    the folly of these people. Persist in reminding them of the ruling on their \n    actions, and that if they subject the deen to mockery they have gone beyond \n    the pale of Islam and joined their brethren among the kuffaar and evildoers, \n    whose state is mentioned in the verses quoted above.\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 With regard to the second issue:\u00a0\n\n    Our advice is to follow the appropriate means of dealing with \n    these sick people, because now you are not only a man who found the truth \n    and followed it, rather you are a caller who is calling people to Allaah, \n    and you want to take these people across a sea of darkness and bring them to \n    a land of safety. So our advice to you is to acquire more Islamic knowledge \n    and to do more acts of worship that will bring you closer to your Creator, \n    may He be glorified and exalted, and to be wise in conveying the message of \n    the Lord of the Worlds to these sick people. Wisdom means putting things in \n    the right place. So the basic principle in dealing with them is to be kind \n    and gentle, but that does not mean that you should not take harsh measures \n    with some of them if you think that it will deter them.\u00a0\n\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd by the Mercy of Allaah, you dealt with them gently. \n    And had you been severe and harsh\u2011hearted, they would have broken away from \n    about you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allaah\u2019s) forgiveness for \n    them\u201d\n\n    [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:159]\n\n    Shaykh \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa\u2019di (may Allaah have mercy on \n    him) said:\u00a0\n\n    A good attitude on the part of a religious leader attracts \n    people to the religion of Allaah in addition to the praise and special \n    reward they bring to the one who has that attitude. A bad attitude on the \n    part of a religious leader puts people off the religion and makes them hate \n    it, in addition to the condemnation and special punishment they bring to the \n    one who has that attitude. Allaah said this to His Messenger who is \n    infallible, so how about others?\u00a0\n\n    Is it not of the utmost importance and necessity to follow \n    his good example and deal with people as he dealt with them, with kindness, \n    a good attitude and friendliness, in obedience to the command of Allaah and \n    so as to attract the slaves of Allaah to the religion of Allaah?\u00a0\n\n    Then Allaah commanded him to forgive them for their \n    shortcomings towards him, and to pray for forgiveness for them with regard \n    to their shortcomings towards Allaah, and to combine forgiveness and \n    kindness.\u00a0\n\n    Tafseer al-Sa\u2019di (p. 154). See \n    also Tafseer al-Tabari (7/341).\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated from \u2018Urwah ibn al-Zubayr that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may \n    Allaah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A group of Jews entered upon the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and \n    they said: Al-saam \u2018alaykum (death be upon you). \u2018Aa\u2019ishah said: I \n    understood it and said: Rather may death be upon you, and curses. The \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cO \u2018Aa\u2019ishah, Allaah has enjoined kindness in all things.\u201d She said: Did you \n    not hear what they said? He said: \u201cI said: And also upon you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5678) and Muslim (2165).\u00a0\n\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    This reflects the greatness of his character and his \n    forbearance. It encourages us to be kind, patient and forbearing, to be \n    gentle with people, so long as there is no need for harshness.\u00a0\n\n    Sharh al-Nawawi \u2018ala Muslim \n    (14/145).\u00a0\n\n    Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    This hadeeth shows that it is mustahabb for the people of \n    virtue to ignore the folly of the wrongdoers, so long as that will not lead \n    to spread of corruption.\u00a0\n\n    Nayl al-Awtaar (8/146).\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to your family:\u00a0\n\n    You have to be patient and put up with their annoyance, and \n    keep on advising and reminding them, and do not give up. Strive hard to \n    guide them, using various means, and be kind to them. Do not give free rein \n    to your wife if her sitting with her family involves any sins or evils, \n    unless she is able to change them. Her shyness towards them should not make \n    her incur the wrath of her Lord by listening to or watching haraam things. \n    She also has the great responsibility to stand beside her husband and \n    support him, and help him to remain steadfast in adhering to guidance and \n    obedience to Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    We are sorry to hear that your mother said such awful things, \n    and we do not know how she could say it. Perhaps she does not know what some \n    of those who take drugs have done to their mothers and sisters and she does \n    not know how they have ruined families and societies, or how much money, \n    time and effort the families have spent until Allaah guided their sons who \n    used to take drugs and intoxicants, because of the evil that they saw in \n    him.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to your work:\u00a0\n\n    We think that you have done well to ask to be transferred to \n    another place that is better, especially since you have only recently been \n    guided and repented, and you need good companions who can show you the way \n    to goodness, and encourage you to do good and warn you against evil and \n    encourage you to refrain from it.\u00a0\n\n    We reiterate that the basic principle in dealing with others \n    is to be kind and gentle with your family, work colleagues and others, but \n    there is nothing wrong with being harsh with those who deserve it, if you \n    think that this will serve the interest of stopping him from mocking the \n    deen and making fun of it.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "He is hesitant to marry this girl because of her lack of religious commitment",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    There is a grave error that is committed by many of those who \n    want to get married and who are looking for life partners, both men and \n    women, which often leads their plans to failure, because both parties fall \n    victim to stress and grief, and society bears a new burden as the result of \n    divorce and its consequences.\u00a0\n\n    The reason for this mistake is fanstasy, whereby one of the \n    couple wishes that his or her partner would change in the future to become \n    their dream partner which they always imagined when they were younger, and \n    that every shortcoming is going to be replaced with perfection.\u00a0\n\n    These people try to ignore the present and look to an unknown \n    future, shunning reality and hoping to avoid confronting it. They forget \n    that what is required of everyone who gets married \u2013 if they want it to \n    succeed \u2013 is to be realistic in their conditions and choices, and realistic \n    in accepting or rejecting; they should not base it on illusions or \n    fantasies. Rather they should see the present as it is and base their \n    decisions on that foundation, so that they may bear direct responsibility \n    after that.\u00a0\n\n    The reality of this girl indicates that she is not \n    religiously committed, and she is not suited to you. Your Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised you to marry the one who \n    is religiously committed, and this is what you should do. Your claim that \n    her family have accepted you will not benefit you, because you are going to \n    live with the girl, not her family, and all they can do for you is to ask \n    you to be patient with her, regardless of how she treats you. \n\n    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\n    \u201cWomen may be married for \n    four things: their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious \n    commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be \n    rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5090; \n    Muslim, 1466.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\n    What this means is that a man who is religiously \n    committed and of noble character should make religion his focus in all \n    things, especially with regard to long-term matters. So the Prophet (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined finding a wife who is \n    religiously committed, which is the ultimate goal.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n    Fath al-Baari (9/135)\u00a0\n\n    Al-San\u2019aani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\n    This hadeeth indicates that keeping company with \n    religiously-committed people in all things should be the priority, because \n    by keeping company with them one may benefit from their good attitude, \n    blessing and ways, especially one's wife, because she is the first one whose \n    religious commitment should be considered, because she is to be his close \n    companion, the mother of his children, the one with whom he trusts his house \n    and his wealth and herself.\u00a0\n\n    Subul al-Salaam (1/146).\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    We advise you to seek the help of your Creator, may He be \n    exalted, to get married. Do not think that marrying this girl will never \n    cost you a great deal, because it seems that she would make many demands \n    even if that leads to your being poor. Do not worry if you forget about \n    marrying her and marry someone else, because Allaah has promised to help the \n    one who wants to get married in order to preserve his chastity.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cThere are three who are all entitled to Allaah\u2019s help: the \n    one who fights for the sake of Allaah; the mukaatab who wants to pay (the \n    price of his freedom); and the one who gets married seeking chastity.\u201d \n    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1655), al-Nasaa\u2019i (3218) and Ibn Majaah (2518); \n    classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Mubaarakfoori (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\n    \u201cthe one who gets married seeking chastity\u201d means chastity \n    from zina. Al-Teebi said: The reason why he said that was because these are \n    difficult matters that may weigh heavily upon a person and break his back, \n    and unless Allaah helps him he will not be able to do them. The most \n    difficult of them is remaining chaste, because that means suppressing the \n    desire that is created in him and because it is an animalistic desire that \n    may pull be down to the lowest level, but if he remains chaste by the help \n    of Allaah, he will attain the status of the angels and the highest part of \n    \u2018Illiyeen.\u00a0\n\n    Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (5/242).\u00a0\n\n    To sum up:\u00a0\n\n    As this girl is now, she is not suitable for you to marry \n    her. If she resolves to change for the better and tries hard to achieve \n    that, then marry her, but if she insists on carrying on as she is, and is \n    not sincere about changing, then leave her and look for someone else. We ask \n    Allaah to help you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Undoubtedly what you are suffering from is painful, and \n    mistreatment from a relative is worse than the same kind of mistreatment \n    from a stranger, but the Muslim who adheres to the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah \n    wa\u2019l-Jamaa\u2019ah knows that \u201cwhatever befalls him could not have missed him, \n    and whatever misses him could not have befallen him,\u201d so he implements the \n    means of attaining happiness and does what Allaah has enjoined upon him \n    without falling short, and if Allaah does not decree good for him, then \n    whatever befalls him is a test by means of which Allaah expiates his bad \n    deeds and raises him in status.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    The mistreatment that you have experienced at the hands of \n    your father, his wife and your brother is something that is very hurtful \n    when it happens, and it is something which indicates that the shaytaan has \n    prevailed over the hearts and minds of those who respond to the command to \n    do evil, and who are reluctant to do good.\u00a0\n\n    What you have done of seeking to uphold ties with them even \n    though they cut you off is what you should have continued to do. You erred \n    by cutting off ties with them. The Muslim seeks reward with Allaah for \n    whatever befalls him of wrongdoing, and hopes to be rewarded for his \n    patience by his Lord, may He be blessed and exalted. If this mistreatment \n    comes from his parents or relatives, he does not cut off ties with them \n    unless being close to them will affect his religious commitment. You should \n    remember that Allaah will support you and help you if you uphold ties with \n    them even though they cut you off.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) that a man said: O Messenger of Allaah, I have relatives with whom I \n    try to keep in touch, but they cut me off. I treat them well, but they abuse \n    me. I am patient and kind towards them, but they insult me. He said: \u201cIf you \n    are as you say, then it is as if you are putting hot ashes in their mouths. \n    Allaah will continue to support you as long as you continue to do that.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by Muslim (2558).\u00a0\n\n    Allaah has made this the etiquette that is required of the \n    Muslim with all people: he should be forbearing with the ignorant and treat \n    kindly those who mistreat him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThe good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel \n    (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allaah orders the faithful \n    believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat \n    them badly) then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will \n    become) as though he was a close friend.\n\n    35.\u00a0But none is granted it (the above quality) except \n    those who are patient \u2014 and none is granted it except the owner of the great \n    portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e., Paradise and of a high moral \n    character) in this world.\n\n    36.\u00a0And if an evil whisper from Shaytaan (Satan) tries to \n    turn you away (O Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) \n    (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allaah. Verily, He is the All\u2011Hearer, \n    the All\u2011Knower\u201d\n\n    [Fussilat 41:34-36]\n\n    Shaykh Ibn Sa\u2019di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his\n    Tafseer (p. 558):\u00a0\n\n    i.e., good deeds and acts of obedience that are done for the \n    sake of Allaah, and evil deeds and acts of disobedience that anger Him and \n    do not please him, are not equal. Kindness towards people and mistreatment \n    of others are not equal, whether in and of themselves or in their qualities \n    or in their consequences. \u201cIs there any reward for good other than good?\u201d \n    [al-Rahmaan 55:60].\u00a0\n\n    Then He enjoined a specific type of kindness, which is of a \n    high status, namely kindness towards the one who mistreats you, and He said: \n    \u201cRepel (the evil) with one which is better\u201d i.e., if someone \n    mistreats you, especially if he has great rights over you, such as a \n    relative or friend and the like, who mistreats you in word or in deed, then \n    respond by treating him kindly, so if he cuts you off, uphold ties with him, \n    if he wrongs you, then forgive him, if he talks about you, in your absence \n    or in your presence, do not respond to him, rather forgive him and speak \n    gently to him. If he forsakes you and does not speak to you, then speak well \n    to him, and say salaam to him. If you respond to his mistreatment with \n    kindness, that will do a great deal of good: \u201cthen verily he, between \n    whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close \n    friend.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBut none is granted it\u201d means, no one is enabled to \n    attain this praiseworthy quality, \u201cexcept those who are patient\u201d in \n    putting up with things that they dislike, and force themselves to do that \n    which Allaah loves. For people are inclined to respond to mistreatment in \n    like manner, and not to forgive it, so how about responding in a kind \n    manner? If a person makes himself be patient and obeys the command of his \n    Lord, and realizes the great reward that will bring, and understands that \n    responding to bad treatment in like manner will not serve any purpose and \n    will only make the enmity worse, and that good treatment will not lower his \n    status, rather the one who shows humility for the sake of Allaah will be \n    raised in status, then the matter will become easy for him, and he will do \n    that with joy and pleasure. \u00a0\n\n    \u201cand none is granted it except the owner of the great \n    portion\u201d is because it is the characteristic of the best of people, by \n    means of which a person can attain a high status in this world and in the \n    Hereafter, and it is one of the greatest qualities of good character and \n    good manners. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Hibbaan al-Basti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \n    What the wise person must do is train himself to adhere to the quality of \n    forgiveness towards all people, and try to forget about waiting for an \n    opportunity to retaliate for bad treatment, because nothing can cancel out \n    the bad effects of bad treatment apart from good treatment, and nothing can \n    make bad treatment worse and increase its bad effects but responding in like \n    manner. \u00a0\n\n    Rawdat al-\u2018Uqala\u2019 wa Nuzhat al-Fudala\u2019 \n    (p. 166)\u00a0\n\n    This does not mean that if you uphold ties with them you \n    should not criticize their actions or highlight their mistakes. Rather you \n    are obliged to do that, because this comes under the heading of naseehah \n    (offering sincere advice) that Allaah has enjoined upon you, so that they \n    will see the error of their ways and set their affairs straight. If you see \n    that they are changing for the better, then it is a great favour that you \n    have done to them, and if they do not respond to your advice, then you \n    should keep on trying, and seek help by praying to Allaah to set their \n    affairs straight. Do not cut off ties with them altogether, rather try to \n    stay in touch even if that is kept to a minimum.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    As for what has befallen you of depression and a lack of self \n    confidence, this is the result of what you have suffered of anxiety and \n    distress, but you should not give in to it. You should realize that this \n    depression will cause you mental and physical illnesses if you continue to \n    give in to it. You have to start treating yourself and face reality, and \n    realize that people are of different natures and you will find both good and \n    bad with them, and that there are others who are suffering far worse than \n    you are suffering. You have no option but to follow the prescribed means of \n    seeking tranquillity so that you can start to enjoy a life of peace and \n    contentment with no worry or distress.\u00a0\n\n    We can sum up what we want you to do as follows:\u00a0\n\n    1-\n\n    Accept the decree of Allaah, may He be exalted, and try to \n    advise your father, his wife and your brother in the way that is best.\u00a0\n\n    2-\n\n    Always remember Allaah, which includes reciting the du\u2019aa\u2019s \n    which are aimed at dealing with such matters.\u00a0\n\n    (a)\n\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThose who believed (in the Oneness of Allaah \u2014 Islamic \n    Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allaah verily, \n    in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find rest\u201d\n\n    [al-Ra\u2019d 13:28]\n\n    (b)\n\n    It was narrated that \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mas\u2019ood said: The \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cThere is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: \u2018Allaahumma \n    inni \u2018abduka ibn \u2018abdika ibn amatija naasyati bi yadika, maada fiyya \n    hukmuka, \u2018adlun fiyya qadaa\u2019uka.

        "question": "Does his wife become haraam for him if he commits zina with her sister?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allaah has forbidden a man \n    to be married to two sisters at the same time. Allaah says, listing the \n    women who are forbidden for marriage (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026and two sisters in \n    wedlock at the same time, \u2026\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 4:23]\nThe scholars differed \n    concerning one who commits zina with his wife\u2019s sister \u2013 is zina like \n    marriage to her or not?\u00a0\nIbn Qudaamah said in \n    al-Mughni: If he commits zina with his wife\u2019s sister, Ahmad said: He \n    should refrain from having intercourse with his wife until three menstrual \n    cycles have passed.\u00a0\nIt may be that her sister \n    does not become haraam as the result of that, and neither do the other four, \n    because this is not a marriage, and simply having intercourse does not \n    prevent marriage (to her relatives), on the basis that intercourse with a \n    slave woman does not prevent marriage to any the four. End quote.\u00a0\nThose who regarded it as \n    meaning that he cannot have intercourse with his wife until the woman with \n    whom he committed zina has completed her \u2018iddah quoted two hadeeths as \n    evidence:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 The report that the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever \n    believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him not deposit his sperm in the \n    wombs of two sisters at the same time.\u201d\u00a0\n2 \u2013 The report that the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cCursed is \n    the one who deposits his sperm in the wombs of two sisters at the same \n    time.\u201d\u00a0\nBut there is no basis for \n    these two hadeeths, so they are fabricated.\u00a0\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThere is no basis for \n    either version.\u00a0\nIbn al-Jawzi mentioned the \n    second version, but he did not attribute it to any of the books of hadeeth. \n    Ibn \u2018Abd al-Haadi said: I did not find any isnaad for it after searching for \n    it in many books. End quote.\u00a0\nAl-Talkhees al-Habeer \n    (3/343).\u00a0\nThe correct view is that \n    his zina does not make his wife haraam for him, but the 'iddah is obligatory \n    if she (the other woman) wants to get married after she repents. Her \u2018iddah \n    does not have anything to do with his having intercourse with his wife.\u00a0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih \n    al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIt says in al-Rawd \n    al-Murbi\u2019 by Shaykh Mansoor al-Bahooti al-Hanbali: The one who has \n    intercourse with his wife\u2019s sister on the basis of a dubious marriage \n    contract or blatant zina, his wife become haraam for him, until the woman \n    with whom he had intercourse completes her \u2018iddah.\u00a0\nThis means: if a man has \n    intercourse with his wife\u2019s sister \u2013 Allaah forbid \u2013 we say to him: Your \n    wife is haraam for you until the woman with whom you had intercourse \n    completes the \u2018iddah that is required of a woman who commits zina. And if it \n    so happens that the woman with whom he had intercourse becomes pregnant as a \n    result, his wife is not permissible for him until the one with whom he had \n    intercourse gives birth, even if the pregnancy lasts for four years! But we \n    prefer the first view, which is that zina does not have any effect, because \n    adultery cannot be regarded in the same terms as a valid marriage.

That is better for him and is more appropriate \n    than focusing on other people and what they say and do.

It is nameemah (gossip), transmitting what \n    people say.\u201d [Muslim]. \u00a0\n\n    Gossip is one of the things that incur the \n    punishment in the grave, because of the report narrated by Ibn \u2018Abbas (may \n    Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace \n    and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by two graves and said: \u201cThey are \n    being punished, but they are not being punished for anything that was \n    difficult to avoid.\u201d Then he said, \u201cNo. One of them used not to protect \n    himself from his urine, and the other used to walk around spreading \n    malicious gossip.\u201d [Agreed upon].\u00a0\n\n    Rather backbiting and gossip are forbidden \n    because they involve attempts to cause trouble among people and create \n    splits and chaos, and fan the flames of enmity, rancour, destructive envy \n    and hypocrisy, and to take away love and friendship, by causing rifts and \n    disputes and resentment among brethren. It also involves lying, deceit, \n    betrayal and trickery, and making accusations against those who are \n    innocent, and giving in to slander and reviling and mentioning bad deeds and \n    qualities, and because they are a sign of cowardice, meanness and weakness; \n    moreover those who indulge in them commit sins which incur the wrath of \n    Allah and a painful punishment.\u00a0Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz.\n\n    It was said that al-\u2018adhu (translated \n    above a falsehood) means witchcraft in the language of Quraysh, and it was \n    said that it means lies and fabrications.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez ibn Jibreen (may \n    Allah preserve him) was asked:\u00a0\n\n    My husband tells his family what I say, \n    then he tells me what they say, and that leads to many problems. I have \n    often asked him not to do that but he does not pay any heed. What should I \n    do?\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\u00a0\n\n    This is called nameemah (malicious \n    gossip), which means transmitting what people say by way of stirring up \n    trouble. As for the warning, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c\u00a0A \n    slanderer, going about with calumnies\u201d [68:10,11]. This is a description of \n    some of the people of Hell. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n    \u201cWoe to every slanderer and backbiter\u201d [104:1]. This refers to the \n    gossipmonger. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cNo gossipmonger will enter Paradise.\u201d And according to a report: A \n    gossipmonger could cause more damage in an hour than a practitioner of \n    witchcraft could do in a year. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah \n    be upon him) stated that \u201cThe gossipmonger will be punished in his grave.\u201d \n    Undoubtedly the prohibition is more emphatic if the gossip is among a man \n    and his wife and relatives. He has to fear Allah and remember that He is \n    always watching him, and he should keep away from things that will incur \n    punishment in this world or the next. He has to avoid lying, backbiting, \n    gossip, slander and stirring up trouble among people. He should be honest, \n    protect people\u2019s honour, fear Allah and remember that He is always watching, \n    and that He is stern in punishment.

By agreeing to transmit what people say, one is \n    persisting in sin and listening to it, but by refusing one is refraining \n    from it and putting a stop to it.\u00a0\n\n    If the wife is afraid that it will lead to \n    troubles between her and her husband, there is no sin on her, if her husband \n    insists that she should tell him what her family says, if she tells him that \n    they praised him and said good things about him, and other such words that \n    will spread love and friendly feelings, and will extinguish the flames of \n    fitnah (tribulation) and disputes between her husband and her family.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allah to guide your husband and \n    bring you together in a good manner.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "Do not panic if du`as are not answered",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe ask Allah to accept your repentance and forgive your sin, and to help you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nUndoubtedly there is some error in your understanding of the issue of du\u2019aa\u2019 and response and calamity. What you are suffering from is something natural, if you do not have a proper understanding of these and similar matters. We empathize with you and feel your pain, and we hope that you will pay attention to what we are going to explain to you, and follow it. We see from your letter that you are prepared to accept what we want to tell you, and this had encouraged us to write back to you and tell you what will be good for you in this world and in the Hereafter.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nMany people think that all they have to do is to declare their repentance to their Lord, then they will immediately have it easy and be relieved of trouble, and wealth will come to them, and they will live a life of luxury! But none of that is necessarily the case. Rather there is a test and trial of this person\u2019s repentance: is it sincere or not? Is it for the sake of Allah or not? All of that means he will face a new test. Indeed the purpose and wisdom behind this life is that it is a test and trial. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, We have created man from Nutfah (drops) of mixed semen (sexual discharge of man and woman), in order to try him, so We made him hearer and seer\u201d\n[al-Insaan 76:2]\nIf he understands this fact, then he should surrender in his heart to his Lord and accept it, but if he does not understand that, then he will not be able to surrender in his heart to his Lord, even if he seems to have surrendered outwardly. Hence it was narrated that some of the salaf said: \u201cIf the kings and sons of kings knew what joy we experience, they would fight us for it with their swords.\u201d What joy could be referred to here? It is the joy of the heart that has certain faith in its Lord, may He be exalted, and the joy of obeying Him and the happiness of drawing closer to Him, even if they were going through hardships. This is the measure of a good life, as Allah says in His Holy Book, where He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cWhoever works righteousness \u2014 whether male or female \u2014 while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)\u201d\n[al-Nahl 16:97]\nShaykh \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa\u2019di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe one who combines faith and good deeds, \u201cto him We will give a good life\u201d by giving him tranquillity in his heart and peace of mind, and by causing him not to pay any attention to that which could disturb his heart. Allah will grant him a goodly provision from sources he could not imagine, and \u201cWe shall pay them certainly\u201d in the Hereafter \u201ca reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do\u201d, all kinds of delight such as no eye has seen, no ear has heard and it has not crossed the mind of any man. So Allah will give him good in this world and good in the Hereafter. Tafseer al-Sa\u2019di (p. 448).\u00a0\nWith regard to others, such as the kuffaar and sinners, listen to what Allah says about them (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u201cBut whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Qur\u2019aan nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection\u201d\n[Ta-Ha 20:124]\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\u201cBut whosoever turns away from My Reminder\u201d means: goes against My command and that which I have revealed to My Messenger, and turns away from it and ignores it, and follows something other than its guidance, \u201cverily, for him is a life of hardship\u201d i.e., in this world, so he will have no tranquillity or peace of mind, rather he will be in a state of anxiety because of his misguidance, even if he appears outwardly to be living a life of luxury, wearing what he wants, eating what he wants, living where he wants, but so long as his heart has no certain faith and is not guided, then he will be in a state of anxiety and confusion and doubt, and he will remain doubtful and hesitant. This is part of the life of hardship.\u00a0\nTafseer Ibn Katheer (5/322, 323)\u00a0\nIs it in any way wise or reasonable to give up that which Allah has given you of different kinds of worship, and has honoured you with belief in it, because you are deceived by the ease and ample provision enjoyed by the kuffaar in this world? \u00a0\n\u201cDo they think that in wealth and children with which We enlarge them\n56.\u00a0We hasten unto them with good things. Nay, [it is a Fitnah (trial) in this worldly life so that they will have no share of good things in the Hereafter] but they perceive not\u201d\n[al-Mu\u2019minoon 23:55]\nMoreover you are ignoring the clear evidence in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger about du\u2019aa\u2019 and its great importance, and the causes of it being answered, and you are focussing on things such as the phrase \u201cBy My Might and Majesty, if he had asked Me to save him I would have saved him\u201d which is more akin to the words of story tellers and reports from the Children of Israel. \u00a0\nEven if we assume it is sound, is simply getting what one wants in this world of good living and ample provision a sign that he is accepted by his Lord?\u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAs for man, when his Lord tries him by giving him honour and bounties, then he says (in exultation): \u201cMy Lord has honoured me.\u201d\n16.\u00a0But when He tries him by straitening his means of life, he says: \u201cMy Lord has humiliated me!\u201d\n17.\u00a0Nay! But you treat not the orphans with kindness and generosity (i.e. you neither treat them well, nor give them their exact right of inheritance)!\n18.\u00a0And urge not one another on the feeding of Al\u2011Miskeen (the poor)!\n19.\u00a0And you devour the inheritance \u2014 all with greed.\n20.\u00a0And you love wealth with much love.\n21.\u00a0Nay! When the earth is ground to powder.\n22.\u00a0And your Lord comes with the angels in rows.\n23.\u00a0And Hell will be brought near that Day. On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance (then) avail him?\n24.\u00a0He will say: \u201cAlas! Would that I had sent forth (good deeds) for (this) my life!\u201d\n25.\u00a0So on that Day none will punish as He will punish.\n26.\u00a0And none will bind (the wicked, disbelievers and polytheists) as He will bind\u201d\n[al-Fajr 89:15-26]\nEven if we assume that this provision came to him after a great deal of du\u2019aa\u2019, does this indicate that this person is acceptable and pleasing to his Lord?\u00a0\n\u201cHe it is Who enables you to travel through land and sea, till when you are in the ships, and they sail with them with a favourable wind, and they are glad therein, then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think that they are encircled therein. Then they invoke Allah, making their Faith pure for Him Alone, (saying): \u201cIf You (Allah) deliver us from this, we shall truly, be of the grateful.\u201d\n23.\u00a0But when He delivers them, behold! They rebel (disobey Allah) in the earth wrongfully. O mankind! Your rebellion (disobedience to Allah) is only against your ownselves, \u2014 a brief enjoyment of this worldly life, then (in the end) unto Us is your return, and We shall inform you of that which you used to do\u201d\n[Yoonus 10:22-23]\nShaykh Ibn al-Sa\u2019di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThey understood that they were doomed, so they ended their dependence on created beings and they realized that no one could save them from this hardship except Allah alone, so they called upon Him, making their Faith pure for Him Alone and promising that they would adhere to that, and they said: \u201cIf You (Allah) deliver us from this, we shall truly, be of the grateful\u201d but \u201cwhen He delivers them, behold! They rebel (disobey Allah) in the earth wrongfully\u201d i.e., they forget that hardship and that du\u2019aa\u2019, and what they committed themselves to, and they associate others with Allah whom they acknowledge cannot save them from hardships or protect them from difficulty. Why are they not sincere towards Allah in worship in times of ease as they are at times of hardship?\u00a0\nBut they will face the consequences of their rebellion, hence Allah says: \u201cYour rebellion (disobedience to Allah) is only against your ownselves, \u2014 a brief enjoyment of this worldly life\u201d i.e., everything that you hope when you rebel and turn away from Allah, is to make some worldly gains, which will soon come to an end, then you will leave them behind: \u201cthen (in the end) unto Us is your return\u201d on the Day of Resurrection, \u201cand We shall inform you of that which you used to do\u201d. This is the ultimate warning to them against persisting in what they are doing. End quote. Tafseer al-Sa\u2019di (361).\u00a0\nThink about the meaning of the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cWhoever desires the quick\u2011passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell; he will burn therein disgraced and rejected __ far away from Allah\u2019s Mercy).\n19.\u00a0And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it, with the necessary effort due for it (i.e. does righteous deeds of Allah\u2019s obedience) while he is a believer (in the Oneness of Allah __ Isl\u00e2mic Monotheism) \u2014 then such are the ones whose striving shall be appreciated, (thanked and rewarded by Allah).\n20.\u00a0On each __ these as well as those __We bestow from the Bounties of your Lord. And the Bounties of your Lord can never be forbidden.\n21.\u00a0See how We prefer one above another (in this world), and verily, the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:18-21]\nYou should understand that the matter is not as you think, that the one who gets his share or has his du\u2019aa\u2019 answered is better, and that the one who does not get anything is of lesser status. No, it is not like that.\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nMany people are mistaken about the issue of du\u2019aa\u2019 in many ways. With regard to your question we want to point out two mistakes:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 You think that du\u2019aa\u2019 is answered just because you say du\u2019aa\u2019. This is wrong, because there are conditions for du`as to be answered and there are impediments which prevent it from being answered.\u00a0\nFor a detailed discussion concerning this matter, please see the answer to question no. 5113.\u00a0\nIn that discussion you will see that one of the impediments to du\u2019aa\u2019 being answered in your case is your being impatient and getting frustrated.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cA person will still be answered so long as his du\u2019aa\u2019 does not involve sin or severing ties of kinship, and so long as he does not become impatient.\u201d It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what does being impatient mean? He said: \u201cSaying, I said du\u2019aa\u2019, and I said du\u2019aa\u2019, and I did not receive any response, then he becomes frustrated and stops saying du\u2019aa\u2019.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (2735). \u00a0\n2 \u2013 You think that the response can only be of one kind, which is getting what you asked for in du\u2019aa\u2019 such as wealth, children, a job and so on. This is wrong, because the response may be of three types: it may be by getting what one asked for in du\u2019aa\u2019, or it may be that evil commensurate with one\u2019s du\u2019aa\u2019 is warded off, or that may be stored up for one as reward for the Day of Resurrection.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Sa\u2019eed that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere is no Muslim who does not offer any du\u2019aa\u2019 in which there is no sin or severing of family ties but Allah will give him one of three things in return: either He will answer his du\u2019aa\u2019 sooner, or he will store it up for him in the Hereafter, or He will divert an equivalent evil away from him because of it.\u201d They said: \u201cWe will say a lot of du\u2019aa\u2019.\u201d He said: \u201cAllah is more generous.\u201d Narrated by Ahmad (10749), classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa\u2019l-Tarheeb (1633).\u00a0\nFifthly:\u00a0\nIf a Muslim is falling short in his worship and obedience, that should make him feel that he is not worthy of having his du\u2019aa\u2019 answered, and perhaps that will motivate him to do more acts of worship and obedience that will bring him closer to Allah. If the caller believes that he has done that which Allah loves and is pleased with, and that he deserves an answer, that will make him think badly of his Lord, may He be exalted, and will make him feel let down and begin to despair, until he wishes that he could escape from life by committing suicide. All of that, unfortunately, we can see in your words.\u00a0\nThis is unlike the one who is aware of his shortcomings before his Lord. This will make him think badly of himself, not of his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and that will motivate him to keep away from forbidden things and do obligatory things, and to follow the path of piety, and to avoid overindulging in permissible things which may distract him from obeying his Lord.\u00a0\nIbn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated that \u2018Umar Ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: By avoiding that which Allah has forbidden, Allah will accept du\u2019aa\u2019 and tasbeeh. And it was narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u201cThe amount of du\u2019aa\u2019 with righteousness that is sufficient is like the amount of salt that is sufficient with food.\u201d And Muhammad ibn Waasi\u2019 said: A little du\u2019aa\u2019 is sufficient with piety. \u00a0\nOne of the salaf said: Do not expect a response when you have blocked the way with sins. One of the poets also commented on this by saying:\u00a0\nWe call upon Allah for every hardship, then we forget Him when the hardship is relieved.\nHow can we hope for an answer to our du`as, when we have blocked its way with sins?\u00a0\nJaami\u2019 al-\u2018Uloom wa\u2019l-Hukam (1/107, 108).\u00a0\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIt was said to Ibraaheem ibn Adham: Why is it that we supplicate and receive no response?\u00a0\nHe said because you know Allah but you do not obey Him, and you know the Messenger but you do not follow his Sunnah, and you know the Qur\u2019aan but you do not act in accordance with it, and you eat from the blessings of Allah but you do not give thanks for them, and you know Paradise but you do not seek it, and you know Hell but you do not flee from it, and you know the shaytaan but you do not fight him rather you agree with him, and you know death but you do not prepare\u00a0 for it, and you have buried the dead but you do not learn a lesson from that, and you ignore your own faults and are preoccupied with other people\u2019s faults.\u00a0\nTafseer al-Qurtubi (2/312).\u00a0\nStudy this brilliant passage from the writings of Ibn al-Jawzi concerning this matter. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\nI think part of the test is when a believer supplicates and receives no response, and he repeats the du\u2019aa\u2019 for a long time and sees no sign of a response. He should realize that this is a test and needs patience.\u00a0\nWhat a person experiences of waswaas when the response is delayed is a sickness which needs medicine, I have experienced this myself. A calamity befell me and I supplicated and did not see any response, and Iblees started to lay his traps. Sometimes he said : The generosity (of Allah) is abundant and He is not miserly, so why is there a delay?\u00a0\nI said to him: Be gone, O cursed one, for I have no need of anyone to argue my case and I do not want you as a supporter!\u00a0\nThen I told myself: Beware of going along with his whispers, for if there was no other reason for the delay except that Allah is testing you to see whether you will fight the enemy, that is sufficient wisdom.\u00a0\nMy soul (nafs) said: How could you explain the delay in the response of Allah to your prayers for relief from this calamity?\u00a0\nI said: It is proven with evidence that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Sovereign, and the Sovereign may withhold or give, so there is no point in objecting to Him.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 The wisdom behind that is proven in definitive evidence. I may think that something is good, but wisdom does not dictate it, but the reason for that may be hidden, just as a doctor may do things that appear outwardly to be harmful, intending some good purpose thereby. Perhaps this is something of that nature.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 There may be an interest to be served by delay, and haste may be harmful. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cA person will be fine so long as he does not become impatient and says, \u2018I prayed but I did not receive any answer.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n4 \u2013 The response may be withheld because of some fault in you. Perhaps there was something dubious in what you ate or your heart was heedless at the time when you said the du\u2019aa\u2019, or your punishment is being increased by means of your need being withheld, because of some sin from which you have not repented sincerely.\u00a0\nSo look for some of these reasons, so that you might achieve your aim.\u00a0\n5 \u2013 You should examine the intention behind this request, because attaining it may lead to more sin, or prevent you from doing some good, so withholding it is better.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that one of the salaf used to ask Allah to help him to go out on campaign, but a voice called out to him: If you go out on campaign you will be taken prisoner, and if you are taken prisoner you will become a Christian!\u00a0\n6 \u2013 Perhaps losing what you have missed out on will cause you to turn to Allah and getting it will distract you from Him. This is obvious, based on the fact that were it not for this calamity you would not have turned to Him, because the real calamity is what distracts you from Him, but what makes you stand before Him is good for you and is in your best interests.\u00a0\nIf you ponder these things you will focus on what is more beneficial for you, such as correcting a mistake or seeking forgiveness or standing before Allah and beseeching Him, and forget about what you have missed out on .

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe Shaza channel is not one of the al-Majd channels, rather al-Majd markets itself through it.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nNasheed means words with a tune, and the ruling thereon is known if the words of the nasheed are known, and how it is performed, and whether it is accompanied by musical instruments or not.\u00a0\nBy studying the words of the scholars and trustworthy Shaykhs, we can compile a list of the guidelines and conditions which must be fulfilled in order for the nasheed to be permissible. These include the following:\u00a0\n1-The words should be free of haraam and worthless content.\n2-The nasheed should not be accompanied by musical instruments. No musical instruments are permissible except the daff for women on specific occasions.\n3-It should be free of vocal effects that imitate the sound of musical instruments.\n4-The nasheed should not be a habit for the listener, or waste his time, or affect his obligatory duties or mustahabb actions, such as affecting his reading of Qur\u2019aan and calling people to Allaah.\n5-The performer should not be a woman in front of men, or a man in front of women.\n6-One should avoid listening to people with soft voices or who move rhythmically when performing, because all of that is fitnah and an imitation of immoral people.\n7-One should avoid the images that are put on their cassette cases, and more importantly one should avoid showing them in video clips of their nasheeds, especially images of provocative movements and imitations of immoral singers.\n8-The focus of the nasheed should be the words, not the tune.\nThese guidelines and scholarly comments on them have been explained in the answer to question no. 91142.\u00a0\nUnfortunately we have to say that the Shaza channel does not pay attention to most of these conditions and guidelines, and its broadcasts are filled with all kinds and types of nasheed, even if it contains something that goes against sharee\u2019ah. They showed a male nasheed group who were wearing a uniform and performing a dabkeh dance, whilst using vocal effects that sounded like musical instruments, and some of the nasheeds depicted wedding parties, and among the audience could be seen people who were smoking openly in front of people, and this was broadcast as though it was an Islamic nasheed.\u00a0\nThey also broadcast some of these nasheeds from festivals and celebrations in which could be heard clapping and whistling to encourage the singer and applaud him. As for some of them shaving their beards or cutting them too short, or letting their garments hang below their ankles, this happens a great deal.\u00a0\nThere is another serious issue related to these anaasheed, which is that women are attracted to these male singers. So you see them coming out wearing the finest clothes, or even wearing makeup! And the singers have started to put their pictures and cell phone numbers on the covers of their cassettes, like immoral singers. The fact that some women are attracted to these nasheed singers is something that cannot be denied, so heads of households who are responsible for their flocks should pay attention to this serious matter.\u00a0\nSome of those who are in charge of this channel have tried to market it from a shar\u2019i angle by giving prominence to Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez al-Fawzaan\u2019s praise of them, but when the Shaykh found out what they are really like, and that it is not one of the al-Majd channels, and that it is only for nasheed \u2013 when he had been told that it belonged to al-Majd and was a youth channel \u2013 he recanted his praise for them and warned them not to publish it.\u00a0\nWarnings against this channel have also been issued by the General Mufti of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez Aal al-Shaykh (may\u00a0 Allaah preserve him).\u00a0\nIn a meeting with the Shaykh at \u2018Asr on Thursday 13/9/1427 AH on the al-Majd channel, on its program called Ma\u2019a Samaahat al-Mufti, he was asked about the Shaza nasheed channel and he replied:\u00a0\nWith regard to the Shaza channel which is for nasheed, I hope that the people in charge of al-Majd will close down this channel, because in fact they are nasheed which may include Sufi nasheeds, and they may contain melodious voices that could distract people from that which is better than that. Sufi styles and Sufi nasheeds and so on are things that were denounced by the scholars who said: This prevents the people from remembering Allaah, and it is singing, but they made it appear good by saying that it is Islamic nasheeds and prayer to Allaah and so on. \u00a0\nWhat one should do is not introduce this channel. I do not watch it and I advise people to avoid it. I hope that those who founded it will fear Allaah and keep away from this channel and avoid supporting it or spending on it, and will not be tempted by it or by those who promote it or who try to find a justification for it, because it is no more than nasheed that distract people from that which is better for them. End quote.\u00a0\nThe veracity of what Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez Aal al-Shaykh (may Allaah preserve him) said is supported by the fact that it may include Sufi nasheeds:\u00a0\n(a)The presence of prominent Sufis who take part in it, who are regarded as geniuses of nasheed by them\n(b)A lot of songs about Madeenah, its inhabitants and the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\n(c)Many Sufi expressions in a lot of their nasheeds, such as Mawlaya (my master), ya sanadi (my support), umarrigh al-khadd bi\u2019l-i\u2019taab (I rub my cheek on the threshold of your door), aghithni minka bi\u2019l-madad (help me by your aid), and so on.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked:\u00a0\nI hope that you can explain in detail the issue of nasheeds, and the ruling on selling them.\u00a0\nShaykh: What nasheeds?\u00a0\nQuestioner: The Islamic nasheeds that are sold on recordings.\u00a0\nHe replied: I cannot give a ruling on them, because they vary, but I can give you a general guideline.\u00a0\n1-If the nasheeds are accompanied by the daff, then they are haraam, because the daff is only permissible in a specific situation, not all the time. It is more forbidden if it is accompanied by music or tabl (drums other than the daff).\n2-If it is free of those things, then we examine it further. Is it performed in the manner of immoral songs? This is also not permissible because\u00a0 one soon finds that one gets used to this immoral manner of performance and enjoys it, and that may lead one to start listening to haraam kinds of songs.\n3-If these nasheed are sung by young men with attractive voices, i.e., they could provoke desire, or a person may enjoy listening to the sound regardless of the content of the nasheed, then this is also not permissible.\nBut if the nasheeds speak of Islamic zeal and not as described above, then there is nothing wrong with them, but it is better to listen to Qur\u2019aan rather than that, or to listen to a useful lecture, or to listen to a lesson by a scholar. This is better, as it will serve a religious purpose and also make it easy for a person, because a person may be travelling from Makkah to Madeenah, for example, and he needs something to keep him awake.\u00a0\nQuestioner: But what is the ruling on selling them?\u00a0\nShaykh: I will give you a guideline. Everything that it is haraam to use, it is also haraam to sell, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhen Allaah forbids a people to eat something, He also forbids its price to them.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood, and it is saheeh.\u00a0\nLiqaa\u2019aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (111/question 7).\u00a0\nShaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him).\u00a0\nWe do not deny that it is permissible to listen to nasheed that is free from haraam elements and to record it. But what we object to is the following:\u00a0\n1.We object to calling it Islamic nasheeds\n2.We object to listening to it so much that it leaves no room for things that are more beneficial\n3.We object to putting it in religious programs, or doing it in unison, or in enchanting voices.\n4.We object to recording it and offering it for sale, because this is a means of distracting people, and a means of introducing Sufi bid\u2019ahs to the Muslims via these nasheeds, or a means of propagating nationalistic and partisan slogans also.

        "question": "Her husband no longer treats her well because she had a relationship with another man",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Desire continues to grow in the heart of the son of Adam \n    until it destroys him, and no one is deprived of contentment but he will \n    find himself lost in the valleys of confusion and depression, turning right \n    and left in the hope of finding that which he wishes and longs for to give \n    him satisfaction, but nothing will fill the heart of the son of Adam but \n    dust, and Allaah accepts the repentance of those who repent.\u00a0\n\n    The worst of desire is that which leads to transgression \n    against the sanctity and honour of others, such as desire for the wives of \n    other Muslims which leads to transgression against their honour, or when \n    women desire young Muslim men and a woman is not content with the husband \n    with whom Allaah has blessed her. The Muslims all know that pleasure cannot \n    be attained by disobeying Allaah, may He be exalted, and that happiness can \n    only be attained by obeying and heeding the sacred limits of Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    Sin was the cause that led to the downfall of previous \n    nations. Do you think that it can be the cause of a person\u2019s happiness? Sin \n    is also the path that leads to punishment, so do you want it to being \n    blessings?\u00a0\n\n    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of \n    what your hands have earned. And He pardons much\u201d\n\n    [al-Shoora 42:30]\n\n    It may be easy to fall into error, because the nafs is \n    inclined towards sin in pursuit of pleasure and whims and desires. But it is \n    difficult to bear the consequences and effects of those mistakes.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Patience in resisting desires is easier than patience in \n    dealing with the consequences that result from going along with desires, \n    because it either leads to pain and punishment or it prevents a more \n    complete pleasure, or it wastes time and leads to loss and regret, or it is \n    a violation of honour which one is better off not violating, or it is a loss \n    of wealth, keeping which is better than losing it, or it leads to a loss of \n    status and position, keeping which is better than losing it, or it deprives \n    one of a blessing, having which is more pleasurable and better than \n    fulfilling desires, or it gives an ignoble person cause to insult you when \n    he did not have this opportunity before, or it brings distress, sadness and \n    fear that cannot be matched by the pleasure of desire, or causes one to \n    forget knowledge, remembering which is better than fulfilling desires, or it \n    makes an enemy rejoice and makes a friend sad, or it cuts off an oncoming \n    blessing, or it has a negative impact on one\u2019s character that will remain, \n    because deeds have a great impact on one\u2019s character and behaviour. End \n    quote. \u00a0\n\n    Al-Fawaa\u2019id (p. 139)\u00a0\n\n    And now the problem that you are facing today is no more than \n    the result of your accumulated mistakes and the sins that you took lightly, \n    then you did not repent properly from them.\u00a0\n\n    As for your talking to that young man, it is one of the worst \n    things that could be done by a woman whom Allaah has blessed with a husband, \n    home and children. It is sufficient for her to look at the misery endured by \n    many others who are deprived of happy homes and a life of ease.\u00a0\n\n    Your husband has taken care of rebuking and blaming you. He \n    tells you every day words that would make mountains tremble \u2013 as you \n    describe it. The point here is that you should understand in the depths of \n    your heart the seriousness of the error you have made.\u00a0\n\n    As for what you say about your not fulfilling his desires and \n    needs before that, this is another sin which has had a big impact in \n    changing the situation of your family and bringing about this pain and \n    suffering.\u00a0\n\n    Did you not know that obedience to the husband is obligatory \n    and that serving him and responding to his call and fulfilling his needs is \n    one of the best things that a wife can do, both before Allaah and before \n    other people?\u00a0 It was narrated that Abu Sa\u2019eed al-Khudri (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said: A man came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, this daughter of mine \n    refuses to get married. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said to her: \u201cObey your father.\u201d She said: By the One Who sent you \n    with the truth, I will not get married until you tell me what the husband\u2019s \n    rights over his wife are. He said: \u201cThe husband\u2019s rights over his wife are \n    such that if he had an ulcer and she licked it, she would not have fulfilled \n    his rights.\u201d Narrated by al-Nasaa\u2019i in al-Sunan al-Kubra (2/283). \n    Al-Mundhiri said in al-Targheeb wa\u2019l-Tarheeb (3/98): Its isnaad is \n    jayyid. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019 \n    (3148).\u00a0\n\n    We will tell you frankly: The remedy begins with this idea:\u00a0\n\n    It starts with obeying and pleasing Allaah, may He be \n    glorified, because calamities start with disobedience towards Him. Allaah \n    has promised the penitent that He will turn his bad deeds into good ones, \n    and He has promised to bestow grace and reward.\u00a0\n\n    Repentance starts by resolving to give up the sin that one \n    has committed, and to cut off all haraam ties. In your case it starts with \n    cancelling the mobile phone altogether, and not going back to it until your \n    husband agrees to buy you a new number. If you do this then you will have \n    proven to your husband and to yourself that you are sincere in your \n    repentance and your desire to mend your ways.\u00a0\n\n    How can you want your husband to overlook the past when you \n    yourself have not overlooked it and are going back to it?!\u00a0\n\n    Your husband has done you a great favour by giving you \n    another chance to live with him. Perhaps the real reason for that is that he \n    loves you, otherwise the logical sequence of events would have been for this \n    story to lead to scandal, separation and divorce. But Allaah has blessed you \n    and been kind to you, by concealing you and giving you a house and a family, \n    so you must show kindness to your husband in return, and observe the limits \n    of Allaah concerning him, and cut off all ties and all means of getting back \n    in touch with this man who has transgressed against you. But what you did \n    was to repeat the mistake and persist in sin and take the matter of \n    repentance lightly.\u00a0\n\n    Do you expect that after that you will helped to change for \n    the better?\u00a0\n\n    How can you allow yourself to listen again to the voice of \n    that young man and receive messages from him again? How can you go back to \n    burdening your husband with the stress of waswaas that affects every man who \n    sees something suspicious on his wife\u2019s part? How can you expect him to \n    trust you again when you have not shown yourself to be trustworthy? We \n    affirm to you that continuing in this manner will lead to a greater loss \n    than that which you are facing now. Think about your situation if your \n    husband tells your family about what you are doing. Undoubtedly the stress \n    you will face will be worse than what you are facing now.\u00a0 We urge you to \n    mend your ways as it is essential. You have already made a good start, but \n    you have a long way to go. We advise you to fear Allaah and be keen to take \n    care of your house, husband and family. Do not pay attention to anything but \n    seeking the pleasure of Allaah; let that be your concern. Be steadfast and \n    do not despair. Keep trying and do not stop treating your husband kindly and \n    obeying him in that which is good and proper. Do not be put off by your \n    husband\u2019s bad treatment. If you are sincere towards Allaah in adhering to \n    His laws, He will set things straight for you with your husband, even if it \n    is after a while; He will restore the happiness you seek and will ward off \n    all temptation and misery from you. What does anyone want in life but a \n    quiet life in good health as a true slave of Allaah? If Allaah blessed a \n    person with any of that, let him strive to protect the blessing by giving \n    thanks for it and fearing Allaah with regard to it. Contentment is a \n    treasure that never fades away.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah for guidance, help and happiness.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

It is the dwellers of \n    Paradise that will be successful\u201d\n[al-Hashr 59:18-20].\nThe Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) told men to choose a wife who is \n    religiously-committed, and he told women and their guardians to choose a man \n    who is also religiously-committed. \u00a0\nIt was narrated that Abu \n    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIf there comes to you one whose \n    religious commitment and attitude pleases you, then marry [your female \n    relative who is under your care] to him, for if you do not do that, there \n    will be tribulation on earth and much corruption.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi \n    and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah \n    (1022).\u00a0\nThe man who prevents his \n    wife from wearing hijab is not a man of good character or religiously \n    committed who deserves to be married. Rather it is most likely that the one \n    who prevents his wife from wearing hijab will also be negligent about other \n    major sins and actions that doom one to Hell. How can he protect his wife \n    and household, or how can he raise his children to obey Allaah when he is \n    disobeying Him and telling others to do likewise?\u00a0\nIt says in al-Mawsoo\u2019ah \n    al-Fiqhiyyah (24/62):\u00a0\nThe wali (guardian) should \n    not give the female relative in his care in marriage to anyone but a man who \n    is pious and righteous.

Such \n    heedlessness has become widespread nowadays, with regard to this important \n    matter. People give their daughters and female relatives in marriage to men \n    who do not fear Allaah and the Last Day, and they end up complaining about \n    the husbands and they are confused about how to deal with them. If they had \n    looked for a righteous man before marriage, Allaah would have made it easy \n    for them (to find such a man). But in most cases this stems from negligence \n    and a failure to seek righteous husbands, and a bad man can never be \n    suitable. It is not permissible to take this matter lightly, because (such a \n    man) will mistreat the woman and he may lead her away from her religion or \n    influence her children.

If they are good then he should give her \n    to him in marriage, and if they are not good then he should not do so, and \n    Allaah will bring to his female relatives one who is religiously committed \n    and of good character, for when Allaah knows that the reason why the \n    guardian did not give her to that suitor was so that a man of good character \n    and religious commitment could propose to her, then He will help him to find \n    such a man.

        "question": "Tips on How to Remain Steadfast in Your Faith",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Be thankful to Allah\nYou should appreciate the blessing that Allah has bestowed upon you by enabling you to repent and adhere to your Religion, before death comes suddenly. So you should thank Him greatly for this blessing , which should make you strive harder to obey Him. \u00a0\nAl-Bukhari (4836) and Muslim (2819) narrated that al-Mughirah ibn Shu\u2019bah said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood (in prayer) until his feet became swollen. It was said to him: Allah has forgiven your past and future sins. He said: \u201cShould I not be a thankful slave?\u201d\u00a0\nSeek refuge with Allah from a bad situation after a good situation\nSo how can you accept to respond to goodness with something bad, and to go back to square one after you had gone so far in the way of righteousness? Rather we hope that you will go back to the way you were when you started to follow the straight path, for you have deviated and gone astray from the path after Allah blessed you with righteousness.\u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah from such a thing. In Sahih Muslim (1343) it is narrated that \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Sarjis said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) travelled, he would seek refuge with Allah from the hardships of travel, from bad consequences, from a bad situation after a good situation, from the prayer of one who has been wronged, and from an ill-fated outcome with regard to family and wealth.\u00a0\nIn His Noble Book, Allah strikes a similitude for the one who goes back to bad ways and destroys what he has built up, and turns away from the path of guidance, which explains the bad situation he is in and what he has chosen for himself, and He warns His slaves against doing this foolish deed:\u00a0\n\u201cAnd fulfil the Covenant of Allah (Bai\u2018ah: pledge for Islam) when you have covenanted, and break not the oaths after you have confirmed them \u2014 and indeed you have appointed Allah your surety. Verily, Allah knows what you do. And be not like her who undoes the thread which she has spun, after it has become strong, by taking your oaths as a means of deception among yourselves, lest a nation should be more numerous than another nation. Allah only tests you by this (i.e. who obeys Allah and fulfils Allah\u2019s Covenant and who disobeys Allah and breaks Allah\u2019s Covenant). And on the Day of Resurrection, He will certainly make clear to you that wherein you used to differ (i.e. a believer confesses and believes in the Oneness of Allah and in the Prophethood of Prophet Muhammad which the disbeliever denies and that is their difference amongst them in the life of this world).\u201d [al-Nahl 16:91-92]\nShaykh Ibn al-Sa\u2019di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cThis includes everything that a person has covenanted to Allah, such as acts of worship, vows and faith, because fulfilling that is righteousness. It also includes that which he and others have covenanted, such as covenants between people. \u00a0\n\u201cAnd be not\u201d in breaking the covenants in the worst and most foolish manner, \u201clike her\u201d who spins a strong thread, then when she has nearly finished it, she breaks it and it comes undone, so she exhausted herself spinning the thread and then undoing it, and she did not gain anything but frustration, exhaustion and foolishness. The same applies to the one who breaks the covenant; he is a wrongdoer, ignorant, foolish, lacking in religious commitment and manliness.\u201d (p. 447)\u00a0\nGiving up prayer is a grave sin\u00a0\nSo hasten to repent from this, for giving up prayer is one of the gravest of sins by which Allah is disobeyed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described not praying as kufr, and he said: \u201cThe covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives it up is a kafir.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2545) and by Ahmad and others; classed as sahih by al-Albani.\u00a0\nIt is strange how the brother can say: I have tried not to fall into sin,\u201d then he says that he missed a lot of prayer. What is his concept of sin in that case?!\u00a0\nGiving up prayer is the greatest and most serious sin. You have tried to prevent yourself from doing every sin except associating others with Allah (shirk).\u00a0\nSo hasten to repent and regret what you have done, before there comes a moment when man regrets at the time when regret is to no avail.\u00a0\nDo not help your enemy (Satan) against yourself\nAs for you saying that you have a \u201ccomplex about prayer\u201d and you feel that you will never recover from this complex, this is a trick of the shaytan who makes this idea seem attractive. You are the one who has helped your enemy against yourself, and you let him fill your mind with the idea of this complex which stems from illusions and laziness, and lack of resolve to do good. So hasten to solve this problem by obeying Allah, may He be exalted, and keeping your wudu, and hastening to pray when the time for prayer begins.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe Shaytan ties three knots at the back of the head of any one of you when he goes to sleep, striking each knot and saying: \u201cYou have a long night ahead, so sleep.\u201d If he wakes up and remembers Allah, one knot is undone. If he does wudu, two knots are undone. If he prays, all the knots are undone, and he starts the day energetic and in a good mood. Otherwise, he starts his day in a bad mood and feeling lazy.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhari (3269) and Muslim (776)\u00a0\nIbn \u2018Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cThis hadith indicates that the shaytan causes a person to sleep and makes him feel heavy and lazy through his efforts and waswas, and his ability to tempt, mislead and make falsehood seem attractive, except the sincere slaves of Allah.\u00a0\nThis hadith indicates that the shaytan may be expelled by means of remembrance of Allah (dhikr), as well as wudu and prayer.\u201d (Al-Tamhid (19/45)\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cUndoubtedly prayer itself offers good health to the body, and helps the body to rid itself of impurities and keep that which is the most beneficial thing for it, as well as offering protection to one\u2019s faith and happiness in this world and the Hereafter.\u00a0\nSimilarly, qiyam al-layl is one of the most beneficial means of protecting one\u2019s well-being and preventing many chronic diseases, and it is one of the most energizing things for the body, soul and heart, as it says in al-Sahihayn\u2026 and he quoted the hadith.\u201d (Zad al-Ma'ad, 4/225)\nSeek the help of Allah and do not feel helpless\nDo not feel weak before your enemy, and do not let him gain any power over you. Seek the help of Allah and do not feel helpless \u2013 as your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has enjoined you. Remember that \u201cever feeble indeed is the plot of Shaytan (Satan)\u201d [al-Nisa 4:76]. Remember that the obligatory prayers are easy and the Muslim will not find it burdensome to perform them regularly.\u00a0\nKeep good company\nWith regard to what you mention about losing interest, the reason for that may be the kind of people with whom you are keeping company. Try as much as you can to attend gatherings of dhikr and knowledge, and to sit with good companions, for acts of worship are easy when a person sees others whom he can take as examples and who can help him with it.\u00a0\nA person will inevitably be exposed to situations which make him feel stronger and more keen to do good, and other situations where that keenness will be less. But it is not permissible to let that lead you to giving up obligatory duties or committing haram actions.\u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cEvery deed has a period of enthusiasm, and every period of enthusiasm is followed by a slackening off. If a person\u2019s enthusiasm is for my Sunnah, then he has succeeded, but whoever chooses something else when he slackens off is doomed.\u201d (Narrated by Ahmad (6725) and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami\u2019 (no. 2151)\u00a0\nSet a regular program for yourself\nHence our advice to you is to set a regular program for yourself which you should not neglect, including the obligatory and confirmed nafl prayers. If you do more than that occasionally that will be good upon good, and if you fall short then do not fall short in doing the obligatory prayers.\u00a0\nHow to make up missed prayers\nWith regard to the prayers that you have missed in the past , whatever you missed because of sleep, there is no sin on you for that but you have to make them up . As for those that you missed with no excuse, i.e., you were too lazy to do them before the time for them ended, then you have to repent, and in that case making them up will not avail you anything. What you have to do is offer a lot of nawafil prayers and pray for forgiveness, so that Allah may forgive you.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Many calamities have befallen her and she has given up on life, and she is asking for the solution",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    From your words and your description of the problem that you \n    are facing, some important points are clear to us, to which we should pay \n    special attention. These include the following:\u00a0\n\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    You have some good things that are priceless, chief among \n    which is Islam. This is a great blessing that Allaah has bestowed upon every \n    Muslim; no matter what calamities, worries, stress and depression befall \n    him, he must remember that he is a Muslim and that Allaah loves for His \n    slaves to be Muslim even though He has no need of them and it does not harm \n    Him if they disbelieve. Even if a person does some bad deeds, his staying \n    within the circle of Islam is one of the greatest blessings that Allaah \n    bestows upon him.\u00a0\n\n    Imagine that you had the best that this world has to offer: \n    wealth, status, a husband, children, a peaceful and stable home, education, \n    a life filled with happiness, and everything that you could wish for, but at \n    the same time you followed Judaism or Christianity or Buddhism, or you \n    regarded a cow as holy, as millions of people do, or you worshipped a mouse, \n    or the sun, or some other created thing, or that you were confused? Would \n    that be better, or having the problems and worries that you have, but you \n    are still Muslim?\u00a0\n\n    Secondly: \u00a0\n\n    You follow the Sunnah. Imagine if you claimed to be a Muslim \n    but you were following a wrong path. Imagine if you were a Raafidi Shi\u2019ah, \n    believing that the Qur\u2019aan is distorted and lacking something, and \n    venerating \u2018Ali and reviling the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them \n    all), regarding most of them as kaafirs and worshipping Allaah by cursing \n    Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them), and accusing the \n    Mother of the Believers \u2018Aa\u2019ishah of zina \u2013 as millions of those who claim \n    to follow Islam do, but Islam has nothing to do with them.\u00a0\n\n    Or imagine that you were one of those who claim to follow \n    Islam but they believe that the awliya\u2019 (\u201csaints\u201d) in their graves can being \n    benefit and cause harm, so they call upon them and seek their help, and \n    offer sacrifices to them and make offerings to them. Undoubtedly this is \n    blatant kufr.\u00a0\n\n    This is a reference to just two of the seventy-two sects that \n    claim to belong to Islam, but they will all be in Hell except for one, as \n    was stated by the one who did not speak on the basis of whims and desires \u2013 \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\u00a0\n\n    Which is dearer to you \u2013 having this world and all its \n    delights beneath your feet whilst being so misguided and deviant, or being a \n    Sunni Muslim, in accordance with sound human nature and affirming the \n    Oneness of Allaah (Tawheed), even though you have many worries and \n    problems?\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    Praise Allaah for having been guided to pray and enabled to \n    do good deeds, for many people regard themselves as Sunni Muslims, but they \n    do not pray. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cThe covenant that distinguishes between us and them is prayer; \n    whoever does not pray is a kaafir.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2621), \n    al-Nasaa\u2019i (463) and Ibn Majaah (1079); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in\n    Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\n\n    Part of being enabled to do good deeds is loving Allaah and \n    His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the \n    Sahaabah, as you mention in your letter. It is proven that our Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThere are three \n    characteristics, whoever attains them has found the sweetness of faith: when \n    Allaah and His Messenger are dearer to him than all else, when he loves a \n    man and does not love him except for the sake of Allaah, and when he would \n    hate to return to kufr after Allaah has saved him from it as he would hate \n    to be thrown into the fire.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (16) and Muslim (43).\u00a0\n\n    By the same token, love of the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions is one of the greatest \n    means of drawing closer to Allaah, of which most of mankind is deprived. It \n    is narrated in a saheeh report that he  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) said: \u201cA man will be with those whom he loves.\u201d Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari (6169) and Muslim (2640) from \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mas\u2019ood; also \n    narrated by Muslim (2639) from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him).\u00a0\n\n    These are great blessings, just one of which cannot be traded \n    for this world and its pleasures and delights, but in fact you are not aware \n    of their true value, because you have not experienced being without them, \n    even for a single day, and you did not see their fruits in the world except \n    on a very small scale.\u00a0\n\n    We do not underestimate the severity of the problem from \n    which you are suffering, but exaggerating about things may make a single \n    problem into several problems. In fact you have several problems, so how \n    about if you were to exaggerate about each one of them until they became \n    like many problems?\u00a0\n\n    Looking at a problem from only one angle generates worry, \n    distress and depression, and if it is minor it will increase in one\u2019s eyes \n    until one thinks that all the problems of the world are on one\u2019s shoulders, \n    and there is no problem that a Muslim could have that is one hundred percent \n    pure evil? In most cases the good that exists in the calamity is many times \n    greater than the bad.\u00a0\n\n    Firstly: Do you know that Allaah tests the believing woman \n    because He loves her and wants what is good for her? In al-Saheeh it \n    is narrated that our Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cWhen Allaah wills good for a person, He tests him.\u201d Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari (5321).\u00a0\n\n    What great grace it is that Allaah cleanses His slave whom He \n    loves of sin straight away, with trials and calamities, so that he will meet \n    Him on the (Day of Resurrection) with no sin on him, and his joy on that Day \n    will be great, and he will realize then that the calamities that befell him \n    were among the greatest blessings that Allaah bestowed on him.\u00a0\n\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cOn the Day of Resurrection, when people who had suffered affliction \n    are given their reward, those who were healthy will wish their skins had \n    been cut to pieces with scissors when they were in the world.\u201d Narrated by \n    al-Tirmidhi, 2402. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\n\n    Look again at the life that you are living, and at the \n    calamities that you are suffering, and think positively of your Lord, for He \n    is the wisest of the wise, may He be glorified.\u00a0\n\n    Try as much as you can to look at the positive side of every \n    problem that you are suffering, whether it is psychological or material. For \n    example:\u00a0\n\n    Delay in marriage:\u00a0\n\n    How many girls find that marriage for them is delayed, then \n    it turns out to be good for them.\u00a0\n\n    There was a woman who reached the age of forty; her sisters \n    and brothers all got married, and her parents died, and she stayed in the \n    house alone. She was religiously committed and righteous. A woman said to \n    her: May Allaah help you to cope with this loneliness; you have stayed alone \n    after all your family has gone. And she started to encourage her to be \n    patient. But she gave an amazing response that not even great and prominent \n    people could come up with, and those who heard this answer were stunned by \n    it. She said: Who told you that I am living alone? Not at all. I have not \n    lived a single day without the one I love. He is with me night and day, and \n    He does not leave me for a moment, and I talk to Him at moments when He is \n    closest to me. He is my Lord. \u00a0\n\n    Another example is the problem of not having children.\u00a0\n\n    One of our sisters got married but did not have children for \n    many years, then she found out from medical tests that she was the one who \n    could not have children. She gave her husband the choice of divorcing her or \n    taking a second wife to live with her like two sisters in one house. He \n    loved her for her religious commitment and righteousness, so he chose to \n    take another wife and to keep her with him as a co-wife with all the rights \n    of marriage. That was done, and she now had some free time. She joined a \n    group of women to memorize Qur\u2019aan, until she had memorized it all, and she \n    earned a certificate in learning and memorizing Qur\u2019aan. Then she began to \n    study and she took a course in fiqh and another in \u2018aqeedah. Now she is a \n    teacher of women in a women\u2019s centre, and she has had the honour of \n    introducing the Sunnah to many areas that were dominated by innovations and \n    myths. She has played a major role in eradicating ignorance for many women \n    who used to worship Allaah in ignorance. She bore her inability to have \n    children with patience, and her Lord honoured her, and her use of her free \n    time had a great impact on her and others with regard to knowledge and \n    education.\u00a0\n\n    A third example:\u00a0\n\n    This has to do with one of the greatest problems from which \n    you are suffering, which is sihr (magic or witchcraft), and the influence of \n    the jinn and practitioners of witchcraft among mankind. This example will \n    give answers to most of the questions that have to do with this topic.\u00a0\n\n    There was a girl from a good and religiously committed \n    family. The family was faced the problem that the wife of one of their sons \n    practised witchcraft. She had an argument with her husband\u2019s sister and put \n    a spell on her so that suitors would be put off and to make her appear ugly \n    when first seen, so that the suitor would not return. That happened many \n    times despite the fact that she was notably beautiful, and that went on for \n    a long time. Then she was treated with shar\u2019i ruqyah to combat witchcraft \n    and the effects of witchcraft became apparent on her.\u00a0 She was treated for a \n    while, to no avail. Every time she thought that the problem had been solved, \n    she would suddenly find that she was suffering from the same spell, and she \n    suffered the same as you are suffering now, worry, stress and depression.\u00a0\n\n    She started to wonder, could people hate another for no \n    reason to such an extent that they would cause harm to one another, and the \n    witchcraft and the jinn started causing her to panic by night and day.\u00a0\n\n    Then she referred her problem to a specialist who told her: \n    There are ten things that you must adhere to, and by Allaah\u2019s leave this \n    problem will not last for long if you are patient and put up with it for a \n    little while. You do not need to go to a man to treat you with ruqyah, \n    rather you can treat yourself by yourself. She said: I will be patient and I \n    will do my best, if Allaah wills. So he wrote down the ten points for her \n    and she adhered to them and stuck firmly to them. Here are the ten points; \n    we will write them for you and we ask Allaah to enable you to adhere to them \n    as part of the remedy for several problems that you have, of which sihr is \n    one. These are the ten points:\u00a0\n\n    1.Read whatever you can of \n    Qur\u2019aan every day.\n\n      Make du\u2019aa\u2019 during the last third of the night, beseeching \n      Allaah to grant you relief.\n\n      Seek out the times when du\u2019aa\u2019s are answered, and say \n      du\u2019aa\u2019 at those times, such as when prostrating, between the adhaan and \n      iqaamah, and before saying the tasleem at the end of the prayer.\n\n      Always recite the adhkaar for morning and evening, even \n      during your menses.\n\n      Pay attention to specific du\u2019aa\u2019s, such as dhikr when \n      entering the house, when entering the toilet, when exiting, when going to \n      sleep, when waking up, and on various occasions. These are explained in a \n      small book that is of great benefit, namely Husn al-Muslim by \n      Shaykh Sa\u2019eed ibn Wahb al-Qahtaani. (Available in English as Fortress \n      of the Muslim).\n\n      Keep away from sin, avoid negligence and shun the \n      situations which may cause you to forget remembrance of Allaah, because \n      they are places where the devils gather and take advantage of the heedless \n      and overwhelm them with desires.\n\n      Try to help those who are in distress and relieve their \n      distress, in the hope that Allaah may relieve your distress thereby. If a \n      person helps his brother, Allaah will help him, and if he relieves his \n      brother\u2019s distress, Allaah will relieve his distress.\n\n      Pray for those who are in distress, asking Allaah to \n      relieve them, because that will lead to the angels praying for you as you \n      prayed for others.\n\n      Ask a great deal for forgiveness.\n\n      Recite the du\u2019aa\u2019 of distress at various times: \u201cLa \n      ilaaha ill-Allaah al-\u2018Azeem ul-Haleem, Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah Rabb il-\u2018arsh \n      il-\u2018azeem, Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah Rabb is-samawaati wa Rabb il-ard wa Rabb \n      il-\u2018arsh il-kareem (there is no god except Allaah, the All-Mighty, the \n      Forbearing; there is no god except Allaah, the Lord of the Mighty Throne; \n      there is no god except Allaah, Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth and \n      Lord of the noble Throne).\u201d\n\n    \u00a0After nearly a month of adhering to these things, Allaah \n    took away her distress and decreed that she should be healed and made well. \n    It was only a few days later that a suitor came to her and she got married. \n    And now she has three sons and lives a calm and stable life filled with \n    spiritual and worldly delights.\u00a0\n\n    The last example, which I pray Allaah will cause to be a \n    lesson and example for you:\u00a0\n\n    There was a girl from a family that was not religiously \n    committed. She married an uneducated young man who was somewhat religiously \n    committed but was a little careless with regard to some matters of \n    sharee\u2019ah. She got pregnant a few months after marriage and the pregnancy \n    lasted for a while, then she had a miscarriage. She and her husband grieved \n    deeply, but a few months later she got pregnant again. The pregnancy lasted \n    for a few months, but ended in miscarriage like the first one. The grief the \n    second time was greater. They started going to doctors to find out the \n    causes, and the problem was diagnosed. In the third pregnancy she took the \n    medicines that were needed to make the pregnancy stable, but one month later \n    she had a miscarriage despite taking all the necessary precautions. The \n    grief this time was far greater than the first two times. They lost trust in \n    that doctor and looked for another who was more skilled, but it happened \n    again and she had another miscarriage. Each of them started looking for a \n    remedy and asking, and they were sent to a Shaykh who treated people by \n    means of ruqyah. He told her: You are under a powerful spell, and this is \n    what is causing the miscarriages, and needs several sessions. That was done \n    but to no avail. Then she went to a second Shaykh, and a third and a fourth. \n    Every time she was partially cured, then the effects of the spell came back \n    again.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n    The couple began to despair and they almost gave up. There \n    was no joy in their lives, and they asked many of the same questions that \n    you mention in your letter. Why did Allaah create the jinn? Why are they \n    able to harm us without us being able to do anything? Why? Why? She became \n    depressed and that almost destroyed their marriage.\u00a0\n\n    Then Allaah caused her husband to meet a seeker of knowledge \n    and he said: Shall I not tell you that which is best for your religious and \n    worldly interests? The husband said: That is what I have been looking for. \n    He wrote down for him something similar to the ten points that we have \n    mentioned, and he and his wife followed that, and Allaah made things easier \n    for them, and relieved their distress, and blessed them with a beautiful \n    baby girl.\u00a0\n\n    This woman went through a great test, and her children died \n    because of the effects of witchcraft and she spent a lot of money on medical \n    treatment. In the end the calamity turned into a blessing, or many \n    blessings. She used to delay prayer until the time for it was over, but then \n    she started to pray regularly on time. She used to listen to music and watch \n    soap operas and movies, and attend mixed wedding parties with the evils \n    involved in them, but now she and her husband refuse to do that until now. \n    She used not to pray qiyaam or read Qur\u2019aan or memorize it, or see knowledge \n    or observe naafil fasts, but now she does all of those things. Although the \n    problem that she was suffering ended a year ago, she began to taste the \n    sweetness of obedience, worship and conversing with her Lord, so she decided \n    to follow that for the rest of her life. Yes, she suffered a problem and a \n    calamity, but her problem became the cause of her rising in worldly and \n    religious terms. We ask Allaah to make us, her and you steadfast in adhering \n    to Islam.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "He is attracted to beardless youths; how can he rid himself of this sickness?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Remember that this is one of the most serious of problems, \n    and that it may lead a person to doom. It may affect his mind and make him \n    go insane, or it may affect his physical health and make him ill, or it may \n    affect his religious commitment and cause him to be doomed, and lead him to \n    a bad end. So beware of continuing with this and strive hard, seeking the \n    help of your Lord, to rid yourself of this evil inclination, and look at \n    those who have been affected by this so that you may learn a lesson from \n    them.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    It is narrated that a man fell in love with someone and \n    became totally infatuated with him, and that love became deeply rooted in \n    his heart until he fell ill, and took to his bed because of it, and that \n    person tried to keep away from him and felt great resentment towards him. \n    Intermediaries kept going between them until he promised to visit him. The \n    sick man was told of that and he rejoiced greatly and his anxiety was \n    dispelled, and he began to look forward to the appointment that had been \n    set. Whilst he was like that, the intermediary came and said: He came part \n    way with me then he went back, but I encouraged him and spoke to him, and he \n    said: He remembered me, and rejoiced about me, but I will not enter because \n    I will not expose myself to accusations. I tried to change his mind but he \n    insisted, and left. When the sick man heard that, he was filled with despair \n    and became worse than he had been before, and appeared to be in the throes \n    of death, and he started saying:\u00a0\n\n    Your pleasure is dearer to my heart than the mercy of the \n    Almighty, the Creator\u00a0\n\n    I said: O So and so, fear Allaah. He said: This is how I \n    feel. \u00a0\n\n    I got up and left, and I had barely passed through the door \n    when I heard the cry of death.\u00a0\n\n    Allaah forbid that we should meet with a bad end.\u00a0\n\n    End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Jawaab al-Kaafi (p. \n    117)\u00a0\n\n    What do you think? Would a wise Muslim want to die as that \n    sick lover died, who gave precedence to the pleasure of his beloved over the \n    pleasure of His Creator Who created him and formed him and granted him \n    provision and guided him to Islam, and bestowed upon him blessings both \n    apparent and invisible? If you say that you would not want that \u2013 which is \n    what we think you would say \u2013 then you should know that you are travelling \n    the same path as him and that there may befall you what befell him, if you \n    do not check yourself.\u00a0\n\n    Remember that this is the path that was first travelled by \n    the people of Loot, namely the love of beardless youths, then Allaah \n    punished them in a way that no nation has been punished before or since. \n    Allaah turned their houses upside down and caused the earth to swallow them \n    up, and He pelted them with stones and took away their sight.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, explaining \n    different types of love:\u00a0\n\n    A kind of love that is incurs the wrath of Allaah and leads \n    to one being remote from His mercy and is the most harmful to a person\u2019s \n    spiritual and worldly interests, is love of beardless youths. No one is \n    afflicted with this but one who become worthless in the sight of Allaah and \n    has been expelled from His door and whose heart is far away from Him. It is \n    one of the worst obstacles that keep a person away from Allaah, as one of \n    the salaf said: If a person becomes worthless in the sight of Allaah, He \n    afflicts him with the love of beardless youths. This is the love that \n    brought the punishment upon the people of Loot, and the only reason for this \n    punishment was this type of love. Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \u201cVerily, by your life (O Muhammad \n    \u0635\u0644\u0649\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645), in their wild intoxication, they were wandering \n    blindly\u201d [al-Hijr 15:72]. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Jawaab al-Kaafi (p. 173, \n    174)\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    Remember that there are causes for this calamity, and these \n    causes are things that the afflicted person has brought upon himself. The \n    one who wants to be saved from his predicament must look at these causes and \n    rid himself of them, otherwise he will be content with his situation and \n    unwilling to change it for something that is better. These causes may \n    include the following:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 Weakness of faith and lack of love for Allaah in one\u2019s \n    heart, and a lack of fear of His punishment.\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 Looking freely at beardless youths, and enjoying their \n    beauty and appearance.\u00a0\n\n    This is the first route that the affected person takes to \n    sin. His Lord has commanded him to lower his gaze and avoid looking at \n    haraam things, and his Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) has enjoined him likewise. If he ignores the command and does that \n    which is forbidden, then Iblees has shot his poisoned arrow into his heart, \n    and finished him off.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Looking is the origin of most of \n    the problems that befall man, because looking generates thoughts, then \n    thoughts generate ideas, and ideas generate desires, and desires generate \n    will, which then becomes stronger and becomes firm resolve, in which case \n    the deed will inevitably be done unless there is something to prevent it. \n    Hence it was said that patience in lowering the gaze is easier than patience \n    in bearing the pain that comes afterwards.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Jawaab al-Kaafi, \n    p. 106\u00a0\n\n    Hence the scholars forbade looking at beardless youths, and \n    some of them regarded it as more haraam than looking at women.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Similarly the scholars forbade a man to look at the face of a \n    beardless youth if he is handsome, whether with or without desire, and \n    whether it is free of fitnah (temptation) or there is the fear thereof. This \n    is the correct view which was favoured by the scholars. This was stated by \n    al-Shaafa\u2019i and the prominent scholars of his madhhab (may Allaah have mercy \n    on them). The evidence for this is that a beardless youth is, in some ways, \n    like a woman; he may be desired as a woman is desired, and his form may be \n    beautiful like that of a woman, and many of them may be more beautiful than \n    many women. The prohibition applies more to them for another reason, which \n    is that in their case there may result from attachment to them types of evil \n    that do not occur in the case of women. End quote. \u00a0\n\n    Sharh Muslim (4/31).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said: \n\n    Looking at the face of a beardless youth with desire is like \n    looking as the face of a mahram or a non-mahram woman with desire, whether \n    the desire is desire for intercourse or the desire to derive pleasure from \n    looking. If he looks at his mother, sister or daughter with pleasure derived \n    from looking like the pleasure derived from looking at a non-mahram woman, \n    then it is known to everyone that this is haraam. The same applies to \n    looking at the face of a beardless youth, according to scholarly consensus. \n    End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (15/413) and \n    (21/245).\u00a0\n\n    And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) also said:\u00a0\n\n    The one who looks repeatedly at a beardless youth and the \n    like, or persists in that, and says \u201cI am not looking with desire\u201d is lying, \n    because if he has no need to look, then he is only looking because of the \n    pleasure that he feels in his heart as a result. As for an accidental \n    glance, it is forgiven, if he averts his gaze.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (15/419) and \n    (21/251).\u00a0\n\n    The kind of looking with which these sick people are \n    afflicted includes what they watch on satellite channels and what they see \n    in newspapers and magazines, and on websites, of pictures of children and \n    beardless young men, and this is what provokes them to commit immoral \n    actions.\u00a0\n\n    3 \u2013 Falling short with regard to obligatory and naafil acts \n    of worship\u00a0\n\n    If the person who is afflicted with this problem prays on \n    time, fulfilling the conditions and obligatory parts of prayer, that will be \n    a deterrent that keeps him from falling into evil and immoral ways. Allaah \n    says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cVerily, As\u2011Salaah (the prayer) prevents from Al\u2011Fahsha\u2019 \n    (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al\u2011Munkar \n    (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed)\u201d\n\n    [al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:45]\n\n    So how about if he regularly performs sunnah and naafil \n    prayers?\u00a0\n\n    4 \u2013 Forsaking the Qur\u2019aan and failing to read books about the \n    lives of righteous men and the imams\u00a0\n\n    The Book of Allaah contains guidance, light and healing; it \n    is the best protection for the Muslim against falling into sin and it is the \n    best remedy for the one who does fall into sin.\u00a0\n\n    If he reads books about the imams and biographies of the \n    scholars, he can take them as an example and become familiar with their \n    stories and rise above immorality and evil. \u00a0\n\n    5 \u2013 Falling short in seeking knowledge\u00a0\n\n    Knowledge is light, through which one may know what is halaal \n    and do it, and what is haraam and avoid it. Through it he may come to know \n    his Lord, may He be exalted, and His names, attributes and deeds. That will \n    generate in his heart a sense of shyness before his Lord and shyness before \n    His angels, so that he will not want to commit evil and immoral actions. \n    Through knowledge he will come to know the state of sinners and the \n    punishment that Allaah has prepared for them.\u00a0\n\n    6 \u2013 A lot of spare time in the lives of those who have this \n    problem\u00a0\n\n    If they kept themselves busy with acts of worship, sport, \n    permissible actions and seeking knowledge, they would not have time to spend \n    in thinking of haraam things, let alone doing them.\u00a0\n\n    7 \u2013 Making friends and keeping company with bad people\u00a0\n\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    likened the bad friend to one who works the bellows: he will either burn his \n    companion\u2019s clothes or he will notice a bad smell coming from him.\u00a0\n\n    8 \u2013 Not getting married\u00a0\n\n    Allaah has created natural desires in man, and He has made \n    the outlet for that in women. The permissible way to do that is marriage. \n    The one who goes against his natural state (fitrah) and diverts that desire \n    towards other males like him, is even lower than the animals, for the \n    animals that Allaah has created are in front of us, and do we ever see any \n    male mounting another male? \u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    The one who wants to deal with his problem and rid himself of \n    it should look for the reasons why he has fallen into the haraam actions of \n    looking, mixing and keeping company with beardless youths, and rid himself \n    of them by giving them up. Trying to treat the problem without addressing \n    the causes of sickness is a remedy that is doomed to failure and will never \n    succeed. There follow some treatment methods for the one who wants to rid \n    himself of this problem and try to free himself from the trap of the \n    shaytaan, and seek the pleasure of Allaah. These include:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 Strengthening one\u2019s faith by means of acts of worship, \n    including fasting, filling one\u2019s heart with love of Allaah, and fearing His \n    punishment.\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 Preventing oneself from looking at beardless youths with \n    or without desire, and not keeping company with them or sitting with them at \n    all, and not being alone with them, even for teaching Qur\u2019aan.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The favoured view is that being alone with a handsome, \n    non-mahram beardless youth is like being alone with a woman, and it is \n    haraam to be alone with him just as it is haraam to be alone with a woman, \n    unless one is with a group of men ofgood character. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Sharh al-Nawawi (9/109).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said:\u00a0\n\n    As for keeping company with beardless youths, especially with \n    one of them, as they do, which may lead to being alone with a handsome \n    beardless youth or letting him stay overnight with a man, and so on, these \n    are among the worst of evils, according to the Muslims, and according to the \n    Jews and Christians, and others. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (11/542).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said: It is not permissible to be alone with a beardless youth even if that \n    is with the intention of teaching him, because the shaytaan flows through \n    the son of Adam like blood. How many people have becomes infatuated with \n    these beardless youths and fell into the trap of the shaytaan and whims and \n    desires. This is a matter which must be warned against.

But if in spite of all that \n    he still feels that he prefers to persist in his misguidance, then he should \n    realize that there is no hope for him.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Jawaab al-Kaafi (p. 174).\u00a0\n\n    For more information please see the answer to question no.\n    27176.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

Even if its effects are \n    not seen straight away, the effects of going against his wishes will \n    inevitably make themselves felt soon, especially if the conflict and \n    arguments accumulate. \u00a0\nYou can work out this \n    matter with your husband in a calm manner, such as if you stay with his \n    family for half of the time and with your family for the other half, or you \n    go to them for a certain number of days.\u00a0\nWhat the husband should do \n    is be kind to his family and not put pressure on them and not be harsh, \n    because the wife is one of the people who are most deserving of kind and \n    gentle treatment. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cThe best of you is the one who is best to his family, and I am \n    the best of you to my family.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3895); classed as \n    saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to guide you \n    aright.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

This is a right that is guaranteed to them \n    by Islam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd your Lord has \n    decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your \n    parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not \n    to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of \n    honour\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:23]\u00a0\n\u201cBut if they (both) \n    strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you \n    have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world \n    kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in \n    obedience.

Allaah \n    says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd seek help in \n    patience and As-Salaah (the prayer) and truly, it is extremely heavy and \n    hard except for Al-Khaashi\u2018oon [i.e. the true believers in Allaah \u2014 those \n    who obey Allaah with full submission, fear much from His punishment, and \n    believe in His Promise (Paradise) and in His Warnings (Hell)]\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:45].\u00a0\n2 \u2013 Honour them and treat \n    them kindly, and show kindness to them by giving them gifts, taking care of \n    them, and speaking nicely to them. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cGive one \n    another gifts, so that you will love one another.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari \n    in al-Adab al-Mufrad (594); classed as hasan by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar \n    in al-Talkhees al-Habeer (3/70) and by al-Albaani in Irwa\u2019 \n    al-Ghaleel (1601).\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Advise them and urge \n    them to adhere to the rulings of sharee\u2019ah and good manners, with wisdom and \n    beautiful preaching.\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cInvite (mankind, O \n    Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) to the way \n    of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and \n    the Qur\u2019aan) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is \n    better. Truly, your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His path, and \n    He is the Best Aware of those who are guided\u201d\n[al-Nahl 16:125]\n4 \u2013 Use a variety of da\u2019wah \n    methods, and do not stick to just one method. Audio and video tapes and \n    booklets may have an effect in changing their behaviour.\u00a0\n5 \u2013 Seek the help of \n    knowledgeable people and seeker of knowledge who are held in high esteem by \n    them, and ask them to visit you and speak to them and advise them.\u00a0\n6 \u2013 Strive to seek a halaal \n    income, which will enable you to get married. You can look for another job, \n    or travel to a Muslim country to work there.\u00a0\n7 \u2013 Always pray that they \n    will be guided.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to enable you \n    to do that which He loves and which pleases Him, and to make things easy for \n    you, and to guide your family to righteousness and wisdom.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the source of \n    strength."

        "question": "She is refusing those who propose marriage \u2013 could it be sihr (witchcraft)?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nOne of two scenarios must apply with regard to the suitor whom you are rejecting:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 He actually does have bad characteristics.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 That is an illusion on your part, and is not actually the case.\u00a0\nIf the former is true, then you have done well to reject him and not accept him as a husband. No husband is fit for a woman except one who is religiously committed and of good character; he is the one who can guide her to do good and help her to obey her Lord, and raise her children in the best manner.\u00a0\nBut we must draw attention to something that is very important, which is that it is not up to people to judge what is inside people\u2019s hearts, and no one is enjoined to do that. Even the Messenger of Allah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI have not been commanded to check people\u2019s hearts or split open their bellies (meaning checking what is in their hidden thoughts).\u201d\u00a0 Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4351) and Muslim (1064). \u00a0\nAs we are not enjoined to do that, how people appear outwardly to be is sufficient for us. If someone appears to us to be good, we trust him, and we judge him as he appears to be, and his case is up to Allah.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that \u2018Abd-Allah ibn \u2018Utbah said: I heard \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) say: \u201cPeople used to be judged by the wahy (revelation) at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but now the wahy has ceased. Now we will judge you according to what we see of your outward deeds. Whoever appears good to us, we will trust him and draw close to him, and what is in his heart has nothing to do with us. Allah will call him to account for what is in his heart. And whoever appears bad to us, we will not trust him and we will not believe him, even if he says that inwardly he is good.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2641.\u00a0\nSoon, if you examine people and try to find out how they are inside, no one will be good enough for you. Look at yourself first: are you free of the things that you look for in others?\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Mu\u2019aawiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: \u201cIf you seek out people\u2019s faults you will soon corrupt them or almost corrupt them.\u201d \u00a0\nAbu\u2019l-Darda\u2019 said: A word that Mu\u2019aawiyah heard from the Messenger of Allah by which Allah benefited him.\u00a0\nNarrated by Abu Dawood (4888) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.\u00a0\nAl-Manaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Because people indulge in gossip and may accuse others of something that has no basis.\u00a0\nSeeking out suspected faults may lead to the very faults that he wants to remove.\u00a0\nTo sum up: The Lawgiver seeks to conceal wherever possible.\u00a0\nFayd al-Qadeer (1/559).\u00a0\nSo our advice to you, and to all our sisters who are looking for a suitable husband, is that the woman should not be so strict in the conditions that should be met by the husband with regard to character and religious\u00a0 commitment, for two reasons:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 She may not herself have the level of religious commitment and beauty that would make men who are of good character and religious commitment seek her out and propose to her. In that case there is no justification for her refusal, because it may be impossible or very difficult for the one who she imagines to come and seek her as a wife. She should pay attention to this matter because it is important.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 People vary in their character and level of religious commitment. If there comes to her one who is of good character and religiously committed, she should realize that there are some who are better then him and others to whom he is superior. Hence she should accept one who is good enough to be her husband and help her to keep chaste and direct her to that which is good.\u00a0\nIf the latter is the case, then it is more likely that it is caused by destructive envy (hasad) or witchcraft. This kind of witchcraft is called sihr al-ta\u2019teel. You can find out if this is the case if the one who proposed marriage is of good character and religiously committed, and has no faults, and you accept him and he accepts you, but then nothing happens, or you reject him for no apparent reason.\u00a0\nShaykh \u2018Abd-Allah ibn \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan al-Jibreen (may Allah preserve him) said: \u00a0\nAs for witchcraft that prevents marriage: women often complain of sihr al-ta\u2019teel, as marriage does not happen even though the conditions are met and there are no impediments. Suitors may come and be accepted, but then they go away without anything being achieved. Undoubtedly this is due to a reason caused by some enviers to prevent the marriage from being completed, to the extent that some girls remain without marriage and if the marriage does go ahead in some cases, there happens something to prevent the couple from getting along and having a happy life. \u00a0\nAl-Sawaa\u2019iq al-Mursalah fi Tasaddi li\u2019l-Musha\u2019widheena wa\u2019l-Sahrah (p. 175).\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThe solution in both cases is easy, in sha Allah. If it is the matter of you being too strict about the qualities that you want in a husband, then you should realize that the solution to this problem is to accept a husband who has the qualities of manliness, love of good and religious commitment that prevent him from doing haraam things. People vary in this, so accept the one who is commended to you by a sincere and trustworthy advisor who is a good and religiously committed person, and knows your situation and that of the suitor. Perhaps Allah will cause him to be good for you.\u00a0\nIf you have been afflicted with the evil eye or a spell has been worked against you, the solution lies in dealing with it in the ways prescribed in sharee\u2019ah, which we have explained in the answers to question no. 11290 and 12918.\u00a0\nThere is no need to look for people to undo the spell; reciting Qur\u2019aan and ruqyahs is something that you can do by yourself. If you are not able to do that, then look for a sister whose religious commitment you trust to do that for you, and try to keep away from men.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to help you to do all that is good, and we ask Him to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion, and to bless you with a righteous husband.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "How should he deal with his wife who is mentally ill?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your confidence in us, and we \n    ask Allaah to guide us all to the right path.\u00a0\nI have read your letter more than once and I \n    feel that it is difficult for me to understand the issues properly, because it seems to be somewhat complicated, so I cannot blame one of you. But \n    I feel that both of you have some share of blame for the problem. \u00a0\nBut I can offer the following advice and \n    suggest that you do these things, and I ask Allaah to make this a help for you in solving your problem.\u00a0\nFirstly: \nEach of you must come back to Allaah because \n    sin has an effect on people\u2019s family lives and on all their relationships. Hence one of the salaf said: when I commit sin, I see its effect on my \n    family and my riding-beast. This confirms what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, according to the hadeeth \n    narrated by Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhen Allaah loves a person He \n    calls Jibreel and says, \u2018I love So and so, so love him.\u2019 Then Jibreel loves him, then he calls out in the heavens saying, \u2018Allaah loves him, so \n    love him.\u2019 Then the inhabitants of heaven love him, and he also finds acceptance on earth. But if Allaah hates a person, He calls Jibreel and \n    says, \u2018I hate So and so, so hate him.\u2019 Then Jibreel hates him, then he calls out in the heavens saying, \u2018Allaah hates So and so, so hate him.\u2019 So \n    they hate him, and he is also hated on earth.\u201d\u00a0\nSecondly: \nEach person must turn towards his Lord and \n    call upon him. Allaah Says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cIs not He (better than your gods) Who \n    responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil\u201d\n[al-Naml 27:62]\nSo he must persist in du\u2019aa\u2019, and seek out the times when du\u2019aa\u2019 \n    is more likely to be accepted, such as the last third of the night, when our Lord descends and calls out, \u201cWho will call upon Me, that I may \n    answer him; who will seek My forgiveness, that I may forgive him; who will ask of Me, that I may give to him; who will repent to Me, that I may \n    accept his repentance?\u201d So you should call upon your Lord and have certain faith that He will respond, but do not try to hasten the response, for \n    Allaah will respond to His slave so long as he does not try to hasten the response and does not say \u201cI made du\u2019aa\u2019 but I received no answer.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAllaah has not sent down any malady but He has also sent down the remedy; those who know it, know it, and those who do \n    not know it, do not know it.\u201d (Narrated by Ahmad, 3397; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1650). So you must \n    recite the du\u2019aa\u2019s that are prescribed in sharee\u2019ah, such as ruqyah, reciting Qur\u2019aan, etc. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd We send down of the Qur\u2019aan that which \n    is a healing and a mercy to those who believe\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:82]\nIf she refuses to be checked out by a \n    psychiatrist, then there is nothing wrong with your trying to mediate between them.\u00a0\nFourthly:\nWhat your wife needs most from you is that \n    you should be warm and loving towards her. For example, take her for a drive in the car to a place that is calming and soothing to the nerves, or \n    take her on a trip to another city. Insist kindly on taking her out if she refuses and choose activities that she is accustomed to and that she \n    likes, such as going to a place that she likes or letting her do some of her hobbies.\u00a0\nFifthly:\nDo not be forceful if she refuses to \n    cooperate, because for the one who is depressed\u00a0 you can draw attention to things but you cannot demand him to do things, because that will \n    increase his feelings of failure.\u00a0\nSixthly:\nI advise you to be kind and gentle, for there \n    is no kindness in a thing but it adorns it .\u00a0\nFinally, you should note that the person who \n    is suffering from depression is lethargic and is not interested in improving his situation, such as trying to recover from depression by himself. \n    Remember that most cases of depression can be dealt with but it may need a long time and goodly patience. Remember that you may be one of the \n    causes of her illness, so do not rush to end the relationship.\u00a0 You have to help her to get out of the situation she is in, and remember that no \n    matter how difficult it is to be patient, the results will be good,\nAnd Allaah knows best. May Allaah send \n    blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions."

        "question": "Minimum Number of Sheets for Shrouding",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.How to shroud a dead Muslim\nIt is best for the deceased to be shrouded in three pieces of cloth if it is a man and five if it is a woman .\u00a0\nMinimum shrouding of men and women in Islam\u00a0\nThe minimum number of sheets in which the deceased may be shrouded, which fulfills the obligatory duty, is a single piece of cloth that covers the entire body. This is the view of Abu Hanifah and Ahmad, and is one of the two views held by the Malikis.\u00a0(See: Hashiyat Ibn `Abidin, 3/98; Al-Mughni, 3/386; Mawahib Al-Jalil, 2/266)\u00a0\nThey quoted as evidence for that the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (4047) and Muslim (940) from Khabbab ibn Al-Aratt (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: When Mus`ab ibn `Umayr was killed on the day of Uhud, he left nothing but one sheet. If we covered his head with it, his feet became exposed and if we covered his feet with it his head became exposed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to us: \u201cCover his head with it and put Idhkhir (a kind of grass) over his feet.\u201d\u00a0\nAl-Zayla`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cThis indicates that covering the `Awrah alone is not sufficient.\u201d (Hashiyat Ibn `Abidin, 3/98)\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cIf the deceased is shrouded in a single sheet, that is permissible, whether it is a man or a woman. The matter is broad in scope.\" (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 13/127 )\nAl-Bassam (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tawdih Al-Ahkam (2/39): \u201cWhat is required for the deceased in all cases, whether young or old, male or female, is a single sheet that will cover the entire body of the deceased.\u201d\nThe view of Al-Shafi`i\u00a0 (may Allah have mercy on him) is that the minimum shroud is that which covers the `Awrah, and for a woman a sheet that will cover all of her body except the face and hands. This is the other view held by the Malikis.\u00a0(See: Al-Majmu`, 5/162; Mawahib Al-Jalil, 2/266).\u00a0They also quoted the hadith of Mus`ab as evidence.\u00a0\nAn-Nawawi\u00a0 (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cIf covering the body was obligatory, they would have bought a shroud with what he left behind (his weapons etc), and if he did not have any wealth, the shroud would have had to be completed from the Bayt Al-mal, and if there was none such, then the Muslims would have had to pay for it.\" (Al-Majmu`, 5/150-151)\nThe response to this is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions did not have anything with which to shroud the martyrs of Uhud , and they even shrouded two men in one cloth, as was narrated by Al-Bukhari from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put two men from among those slain at Uhud in a single cloth, then he would say: \u201cWhich of them had memorized more Quran?\u201d and if one of them was pointed out to him, he would put him in the Lahd first.\u00a0\nWhere would they buy the shrouds if they did not have anything with which to shroud the martyrs of Uhud?\u00a0\nIf no proper shroud is available, and there is not enough to cover the entire body, then his head and part of his body should be covered and whatever is left exposed should be covered with Idhkhir or some other kind of plant. That is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, in the story of Mus`ab ibn `Umayr\u00a0 (may Allah be pleased with him) : \u201cCover his head with it and put Idhkhir (a kind of grass) over his feet.\u201d (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymeen\u00a0 (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Sharh Al-Mumti` (5/225): \u201cThe evidence that this (i.e., covering the entire body of the deceased with the shroud) is obligatory is the fact that when the Companions did not have sufficient shrouds, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered them to put the shroud over the head and to cover the feet with Idhkhir which is a kind of plant.\u00a0\nIf there is nothing available, such as if his garments have been burned and there is nothing with which to shroud him, then he should be shrouded with grass and the like, which should be placed on his body and then wrapped. If nothing at all is available then he should be buried as he is, because of the general meaning of the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSo keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.\u201d\u00a0[At-Taghabun 64:16]\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 154750 , 201085 , 48959 , and 39201 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Should he marry a woman who got divorced for his sake?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nIt is very strange to see \n    people who insist on following the path that leads to doom and destruction. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    \nIt is very strange to see \n    people who will sink to any depths for the sake of a fleeting moment of \n    physical pleasure or illusionary happiness.\u00a0\nA person whom Allaah has \n    blessed with a family and children, then he or she is not content with that, \n    and rather tries to break up other people\u2019s families and destroy their \n    happiness.\u00a0\nThat makes me wonder, what \n    type of happiness is that person seeking, and what sort of whims and desires \n    is he or she following?\u00a0\nAnd here you are \u2026you can \n    no longer see anything in your wife and the mother of your children, except \n    that she has gotten very fat and dos not look after herself!\u00a0\nHow strange it is that the \n    shaytaan can make attractive to people that which Allaah has forbidden, and \n    divert them by all means from that which Allaah has permitted to them. \u00a0\nFor whom should your wife \n    look after herself, when you have forsaken her bed for such a long time and \n    you did not stop there, rather you decided to go and live in one city when \n    your wife and children are living in another.\u00a0\nIs this how families should \n    be? Is this how you take care of your family whom Allaah has entrusted to \n    your care?\u00a0\nIf it so happens that a man \n    is not satisfied with one wife, or she falls short in her duties towards \n    him, then Allaah has made it easier for us Muslims and has permitted us to \n    take four wives, one of whom may make up for the shortcomings of another, in \n    return for the husband looking after them and their children, and treating \n    them all fairly.\u00a0\nMeeting one\u2019s needs is not \n    done by looking at that with which Allaah has blessed other people, or in \n    which He has favoured them over us, whether that is in terms of a wife, \n    children or wealth.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd wish not for the \n    things in which Allaah has made some of you to excel others. For men there \n    is reward for what they have earned, (and likewise) for women there is \n    reward for what they have earned, and ask Allaah of His Bounty. Surely, \n    Allaah is Ever All\u2011Knower of everything\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 4:32]\nAs Allaah has blessed us \n    with enough of that which is permissible, then what need do we have of \n    immoral ways for the purpose of gratification, unless all a man cares about \n    is pursuing his rrational desires?\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu \n    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cHe is not one of us who \n    turns a woman against her husband or a slave against his master.\u201d Narrated \n    by Abu Dawood (2175); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi \n    Dawood.\u00a0\nAbu Dawood (5170) also \n    narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever corrupts a man\u2019s wife or \n    slave is not one of us.\u201d Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi \n    Dawood.\u00a0\nShaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeem \n    Abaadi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cturns a woman against her \n    husband\u201d means by mentioning the husband\u2019s bad qualities in to his wife, or \n    mentioning the good qualities of a stranger (non-mahram man) to her.\u00a0\n\u2018Awn al-Ma\u2019bood \n    (6/159).\u00a0\nAnd he said: \u201cThe one who \n    corrupts a man\u2019s wife\u201d means he turns her (against her husband) or makes the \n    idea of divorce attractive to her so that he can marry her or arrange her \n    marriage to someone else, and so on.\u00a0\n\u2018Awn al-Ma\u2019bood \n    (14/52).\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn \n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about an imam (leading \n    people in prayer) who turns a woman against her husband so that she will \n    leave him and he can be alone with her \u2013 can people pray behind him? What is \n    the ruling on him?\u00a0\nHe replied:\u00a0\nIn al-Musnad it is \n    narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said:\u00a0 \u201cHe is not one of us who turns a woman against her husband or a slave \n    against his master\u201d. So the man\u2019s attempt to separate a woman from her \n    husband is one of the gravest of sins; this is what the practitioners of \n    witchcraft try to do all the time, which is one of the worst deeds of the \n    devils, especially if he turns her against her husband in order to marry \n    her, as well as persisting in being alone with her, and especially if \n    circumstantial evidence shows that. Such a man should not be appointed as \n    imam of a mosque unless he repents, and if he repents, Allaah will accept \n    his repentance. If it is possible to pray someone else who is of good \n    character then people should pray behind him and not pray behind the one who \n    commits immoral actions openly for no need. And Allaah knows best.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa \n    (23/363).\u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\nThe Messenger of Allaah \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who does \n    that, and disavowed him, and it is a major sin. If the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade a man to propose marriage to a \n    woman to whom his brother has already proposed, or to outbid him, then how \n    about one who tries to separate a man and his wife or slave woman in order \n    to get be with them. Lovers of physical outward beauty and the pimps who \n    help them do not see that as a sin, because the lover\u2019s seeking to be with \n    the one whom he loves and to share her with her husband or master is a kind \n    of sin and transgression against the rights of others, and that is no less \n    serious than committing the immoral action itself, if not worse. But the \n    rights of others are not waived by repenting from immoral actions; although \n    the rights of Allaah are waived when one repents, the rights of other people \n    remain in effect and they will have the right to demand them on the Day of \n    Resurrection. If the husband has been wronged by the corruption of his \n    beloved (wife) and she has been led to betray him, that is a greater wrong \n    than taking all of his wealth. Hence this is more upsetting for him than if \n    his wealth was taken and there is no pain greater than that except shedding \n    his blood. What a grave sin that is greater than committing the immoral \n    action itself. If this transgression is done to someone who is out on \n    campaign (for the sake of Allaah), then the sinner will be made to stand on \n    the Day of Resurrection, and it will be said to him (the victom): Take from \n    his hasanaat whatever you wish, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) told us, then he said: What do you think? i.e., what do \n    you think will be left of his hasanaat? If in addition to that the one who \n    was wronged was a neighbour, or a blood relative, then the wrongdoing is \n    compounded, and the wrongdoing includes severing ties of kinship and harming \n    a neighbour, and no one who severs ties of kinship will enter Paradise, and \n    neither will one from whose harm his neighbour was not safe.\u00a0\nAl-Jawaab al-Kaafi \n    (p. 14).\u00a0\nTurning a wife against her \n    husband does not only mean pushing her to demand a divorce; rather trying to \n    play with her emotions and causing her to fall in love with you is one of \n    the worst kinds of corruption and wrongdoing. \u00a0\nYes, you did something \n    serious when you got to know this woman and kept in touch with her until you \n    destroyed her family, and she also did something serious when she fell in \n    love with someone other than her husband, and asked him for a divorce, so \n    she destroyed her family herself, and asked for something that was not \n    permissible for her.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from \n    Thawbaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAny woman who asks her husband for a \n    divorce for no reason, the fragrance of Paradise will be forbidden to her.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Tirmidhi \n    (1187), Abu Dawood (2226) and Ibn Majaah (2055); classed as saheeh by \n    al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\nWe hope that by means of \n    this stern rebuke Allaah will stir the conscience of everyone who reads this \n    answer and so that they will think about the evil consequences of \n    transgressing the set limits and taking lightly the matter of contacting the \n    opposite sex and speaking to them. We have quoted several times the view of \n    the scholars that this is haraam.\u00a0\nSee: \n    26890, \n    52768, \n    66266 \n    and 59907.\u00a0\nWe also hope that this will \n    prompt both of you to repent sincerely to Allaah and ask Him for forgiveness \n    for what has happened, and finally to restore people\u2019s rights. \u00a0\nYou should note that Allaah \n    accepts repentance from His slaves if it is sincere, and that the door of \n    His mercy is open and will not be shut until the sun rises from the west. In \n    many cases a person is better after sinning and repenting from it than he \n    was before.\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u201cSay: \u201cO \u2018Ibaadi (My \n    slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds \n    and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all \n    sins. Truly, He is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful.\n54.\u00a0\u201cAnd turn in \n    repentance and in obedience with true Faith (Islamic Monotheism) to your \n    Lord and submit to Him (in Islam) before the torment comes upon you, (and) \n    then you will not be helped\u201d\n[al-Zumar 39:53-54]\u00a0\n\u201cTruly, Allaah loves \n    those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:222]\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThe conditions of sincere \n    repentance include restoring people\u2019s rights to them, for the accountability \n    is not waived until the rights are restored and the person who was wronged \n    takes what is rightfully his in this world, before the Hereafter.\u00a0\nWhat this woman must do is \n    go back, and try to apologize to her former husband through some of the \n    people who are close to him. If the matter has to be referred to a qaadi \n    (judge) he would not allow any marriage contract with this woman, until she \n    repents and goes back to her husband. \u00a0\nIt says in al-Mawsoo\u2019ah \n    al-Fiqhiyyah (5/251):\u00a0\nThe fuqaha\u2019 stated clearly \n    that pressure should be put on him and he should be rebuked. The Maalikis \n    confirmed that the woman who was turned against her husband is permanently \n    haraam for the one who turned her against her husband, so as to give him the \n    opposite of what he was trying to achieve and to serve as a deterrent, lest \n    people take that as a means to corrupt wives.\u00a0\nA marriage that begins with \n    disobedience towards Allaah will usually never be successful, and it will \n    become a punishment and a burden for the one who did that. \u00a0\nIf the husband forgives \n    her, then praise be to Allaah, but if he refuses and does not agree to take \n    his wife back, then there is nothing wrong with you two getting married in \n    that case, as long as you feel regret and ask Allaah for pardon and \n    forgiveness.\u00a0\nThe majority of scholars \n    say that the marriage of a man who turned a woman against her husband so \n    that he would divorce her and then marries her himself is valid, despite the \n    sin of turning a woman against her husband \u2013 which is the correct view, \n    although some Maaliki and Hanbali scholars disagreed and regarded such \n    marriages as invalid.\u00a0\nIn al-Iqnaa\u2019 \n    (3/181), which is a Hanbali book, it says:\u00a0\nHe said concerning a man \n    who turns a wife against her husband: he should be punished severely, and \n    his marriage is invalid according to one of the two scholarly opinions in \n    the madhhabs of Maalik, Ahmad and others, and they must be separated. End \n    quote.\u00a0\nIt says in al-Mawsoo\u2019ah \n    al-Fiqhiyyah (11/19, 20):\u00a0\nThe Maalikis are the only \n    ones who mentioned the ruling on this issue, which is when a man corrupts \n    the wife of another man in such a way that it leads to her being divorced \n    from him, then the one who corrupted her marries her.\u00a0\nThey stated that the \n    marriage should be nullified, whether consummation has taken place or not, \n    and there is no difference of opinion concerning that; the only thing \n    concerning which they differed is whether or not the woman is permanently \n    forbidden for marriage to the one who corrupted her. They mentioned two \n    opinions concerning that:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 The well known view, \n    which is that the prohibition is not permanent. If she goes back to her \n    first husband and he divorces her or he dies, then it permissible for the \n    one who corrupted her to marry her.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 That the prohibition is \n    permanent. This view was mentioned by Yoosuf ibn \u2018Umar, as it says in \n    Sharh al-Zarqaani, and more than one of the later scholars in Fez issued \n    fatwas on this basis.\u00a0\nHowever, fuqaha\u2019 who are \n    non-Maaliki did not issue any clear ruling on this issue, but the ruling on \n    it, which is that it is forbidden, may be known from what has been stated \n    above. End quote.\u00a0\nIn Kutub A\u2019immah \n    al-Da\u2019wah al-Najdiyyah (7/89) it says:\u00a0\nShaykh \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn \n    al-Shaykh Muhammad (may Allaah have mercy on them both) was asked about a \n    man who turned a woman against her husband and married her.\u00a0\nHe replied:\u00a0\nThe marriage of the second \n    man, who turned her against her husband, is invalid and he must leave her, \n    because he disobeyed Allaah by doing that. End quote.\u00a0\nWe hope that if you repent \n    properly and are sincere towards Allaah, then you will be able to marry this \n    woman, if she first tries to set right what was corrupted in her marriage \n    with her first husband.\u00a0\nAs for worrying about the \n    fact that she had another husband, and they did together what a man and wife \n    do, this is an idea that is worthless. What is off-putting for a man with \n    dignity is if a woman soiled herself by having haraam intimate relations. As \n    for that which Allaah has prescribed and permitted for His slaves, there is \n    no reason it should be regarded as off-putting!\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cIt may be if he \n    divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better \n    than you ___Muslims (who submit to Allaah), believers, obedient (to Allaah), turning to \n    Allaah in repentance, worshipping Allaah sincerely, given to fasting or \n    emigrants (for Allaah\u2019s sake), previously married and virgins\u201d\n[al-Tahreem 66:5]\nAllaah says that there is \n    blessing in marriage to a previously married woman as much as in marriage to \n    a virgin.\u00a0\nWith regard to what you \n    fear of your children suffering, it is something that may happen when you \n    marry another wife after your first marriage. What we hope is that if you \n    marry this woman or any other, that you will not build a new home on the \n    ruins of your first family, including your first wife and children. Rather \n    the one who wants to indulge in this experience must have wisdom and \n    smartness to organize his household affairs and deal with those under his \n    care; he must treat his wives fairly and give everyone their rights, so that \n    no one could hold him accountable for any wrongdoing before his Lord.\u00a0\nAn Arab man who had several \n    wives was asked how he was able to keep them together. He said: When we were \n    youthful, that helped by making them patient with me, then I accumulated \n    wealth that made them continue to be patient, then what is left is kindness \n    and good treatment. That is what is left and is keeping us together.\u00a0\n\u2018Uyoon al-Akhbaar \n    (1/396)\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to forgive \n    and guide us and you two.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Reasons why the mother interferes in her married daughter\u2019s life and how to deal with it",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The mother\u2019s rights over \n    her children are great, and Islam has enjoined the children to fulfil these \n    rights, and it regards disobedience to parents as a major sin.\u00a0\nThe details of the mother\u2019s \n    rights and her duties are explained in the answer to question no.\n    5053.\u00a0\nThe mother whose daughter \n    has got married should realize that it is not permissible for her daughter \n    to give precedence to obeying her mother over obeying her husband, and she \n    (the mother) should understand that it is not permissible for her to \n    interfere in her daughter\u2019s life after marriage, unless she is asked to \n    intervene in order to bring about a reconciliation or to offer advice and \n    guidance.\u00a0\nThe mother\u2019s interference \n    in her married daughter\u2019s life has both negative and positive effects. The \n    positive effects include what the wise mother does of guiding her daughter \n    to things that will improve her life, whether that guidance comes before her \n    daughter gets married or after.\u00a0\nUndoubtedly the mother\u2019s \n    experience of life and her compassion towards her daughter will motivate her \n    to offer advice to her daughter who does not have the same experience and \n    wisdom in dealing with a husband.\u00a0\nBut the mother\u2019s \n    interference in her married daughter\u2019s life may also have negative effects, \n    the most serious of which is a case in which her interference leads to her \n    daughter being divorced, when the husband sees that his wife is not obeying \n    him and he has no position of control over her, and that his wife\u2019s mother \n    is the one who tells his wife what to do and what not to do, which leads to \n    the destruction of her daughter\u2019s marriage.\u00a0\nIt is not permissible for \n    the daughter to go along with her mother when she asks her for private \n    information, even if that will make her angry with her, for obedience to \n    Allaah comes before obedience to anyone else, and it is not permissible to \n    give precedence to the wrath of anyone else over the wrath of Allaah, may He \n    be exalted.\u00a0\nUndoubtedly there are \n    reasons for this interference on the part of the wife\u2019s mother. These \n    reasons include the following:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 The mother\u2019s strong \n    personality, and her husband\u2019s weak character, so that she is the one who \n    makes decisions in the home, and she wants to transfer this to her \n    daughter\u2019s home too.\u00a0\n2 \u2013Weak character of both \n    her daughter\u2019s husband and her daughter, which gives the mother the \n    opportunity to play a major role in directing the affairs of her daughter\u2019s \n    household. The mother thinks that running the household needs a strong hand \n    and that the couple are unable to run their home, so she takes charge.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Impassioned feelings \n    towards her daughter, which makes her ask about her food, drink, medicine \n    and sicknesses, and how her husband is treating her; it may even make her \n    overstep the mark and ask about intimate details of married life, including \n    love and sex!\u00a0\n4 \u2013 Husband\u2019s mistreatment \n    of his wife, which leads the mother to intervene in matters great and small, \n    so as to make the husband behave himself and ensure that the wife is given \n    her rights.\u00a0 \u00a0\n5 \u2013 Frequent visits on the \n    daughter\u2019s part to her mother, and being in touch with her a great deal. In \n    most of these visits etc the mother cannot find anything to talk about \n    except finding out what is going on in her daughter\u2019s house.\nIn order to solve the \n    problem of the mother interfering in her married daughter\u2019s life in ways \n    that may spoil her life, she and her husband should pay attention to a \n    number of things, including the following:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Direct advice from the \n    daughter or her husband to the mother not to interfere in their lives, \n    telling her that this is not permissible for her, and that this interference \n    may lead to the couple splitting up.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 Telling the father (the \n    mother\u2019s husband) that he must stop his wife from interfering in the life of \n    her daughter and her husband.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Hinting to the mother, \n    or even warning her, that if she continues to interfere in their lives, then \n    the husband will stop her from visiting her daughter or getting in touch \n    with her, and he will also stop his wife and children from visiting her \n    mother. This will clearly demonstrate the strength of character of the \n    husband and wife, and it will prevent the mother from interfering in a \n    negative way in their lives.\u00a0\n4 \u2013 It is essential that \n    the couple work out together how to deal with this problem and that neither \n    of them tries to solve it on his or her own without the other. This problem \n    concerns both parties, so it needs a common strategy to deal with it. \u00a0\n5 \u2013 They should consult the \n    mother with regard to some matters, and ask for her advice, so that the \n    relationship between them will remain within shar\u2019i limits, and so that she \n    will know that her involvement is not rejected completely, and that they may \n    need her in some cases. This will give her confidence and maintain contact, \n    whilst preventing negative interference.\u00a0\n6 \u2013 Reducing the number of \n    visits and contact with the mother, and when the visit does take place, \n    there should be a focus on talking about useful things, advice and reminders \n    to do acts of obedience, and avoid sins and bad deeds. \u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to set your \n    affairs straight and to guide you all to that which pleases Him.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Source of \n    strength."

        "question": "How will those who entered Hell then were brought forth from it enjoy Paradise?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Ahl al-Sunnah wa\u2019l-Jamaa\u2019ah believe that some of the Muslims will enter Paradise without being brought to account or being punished, and some of them will enter Paradise after being brought to account, and some will enter Paradise after being punished in Hell as Allah wills, then He will bring them forth from it.\u00a0\nThe fact that these people are brought forth from Hell then admitted to Paradise will not cause them any sorrow or distress in Paradise, because Paradise is the abode of delight, and they will have whatever the other people of Paradise will have, as mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah.\u00a0\nThere is nothing in the evidence to suggest that these people will feel any kind of regret after entering Paradise due to the punishment that they experienced in Hell.\u00a0\nBut the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us about how these people will be after they are brought forth from Hell. That includes the following:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 They will be thrown into the River of Life, and will grow anew.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Sa\u2019eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhen the people of Paradise enter Paradise and the people of Hell enter Hell, Allah will say: \u2018Whoever had a mustard-seed\u2019s weight of faith in his heart, bring him out.\u2019 So they will bring him out, and they will come out like burned skeletons, and they will turn into charcoal. They will be thrown into the River of Life, then they will grow like seeds growing in the silt left by a flood.\u201d \u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cDo you not see how they emerge yellow and curved?\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (6192) and Muslim (184).\u00a0\n2 \u2013 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that they will change after they are brought forth from the Fire.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said of the Jahannamiyyoon (those who had been in Hell) that they \u201cwould be brought forth from the Fire after having been in it. They will come out as if they are branches of sesame. Then they will go into one of the rivers of Paradise, where they will wash themselves, then they will emerge like sheets of paper.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by Muslim (191).\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The word sesame refers to the well-known sesame from which sesame oil is extracted. Imam Abu\u2019l-Sa\u2019aadaat al-Mubaarak ibn Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Kareem al-Jazari, who is known as Ibn al-Atheer (may Allah have mercy on him), said: What it means \u2013 and Allah knows best \u2013 is that if the branches of sesame are gathered and left in the sun so that their seeds may be collected, they turn thin and black as if they have been burned, so these people are likened to them.\u00a0\n\u201cthen they will emerge like sheets of paper\u201d They are likened to sheets of paper because they will be so white after they wash themselves and all the blackness that was on them is removed.\u00a0\nSharh Muslim (3/52).\u00a0\nAccording to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari (6190):\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThey will emerge from the Fire through intercession as if they are small cucumbers.\u201d \u00a0\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nWith regard to small cucumbers \u2026 What is meant is something that is white and small.\u00a0\nNote:\u00a0\nThis likeness refers to how they will be after they grow. But when they first emerge from Hell they will be like charcoal as we shall see in the hadeeth below.\u00a0\nFath al-Baari (11/429).\u00a0\n3 \u2013 They will become like pearls, and Allah will bestow His good pleasure upon them, and He will never be angry with them.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Sa\u2019eed al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAllah will say: \u2018The angels have interceded, the Prophets have interceded and there is no one left but the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.\u2019 Then He will take a handful from Hell, and will bring out people who never did any good and who will have turned into charcoal. He will throw them into a river on the outskirts of Paradise that is called the River of Life, and they will emerge like seeds in the silt carried by a flood. \u2026 They will emerge like pearls with jewels around their necks, and the people of Paradise will recognize them. These are the ones ransomed by Allah, whom Allah admitted to Paradise with no good deed that they did or sent on ahead. Then He will say: \u2018Enter Paradise, and whatever you see is yours.\u2019 They will say: \u2018Our Lord, You have given us what You have never given to anyone else in creation.\u2019 He will say: \u2018You will have something better than that with Me.\u2019 They will say, \u2018O Lord, what could be better than this?\u2019 He will say, \u2018My good pleasure, for I will never be angry with you again.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (7002) and Muslim (183).\u00a0\nThis is an important hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) points out the great status of those who are brought forth from Hell, and the honours that their Lord will bestow upon them by His grace and bounty, which include:\u00a0\n(a)Being thrown in the River of Life, and growing anew.\n(b)Emerging from the river like pearls with jewels around their necks\n(c)Being given everything that they see in Paradise.\n(d)Their thinking, because of the blessings and the ultimate joy they experience, that Allah has honoured them with something that He has not bestowed upon anyone else.\n(e)He will bestow His pleasure upon them and never be angry with them again.\nThe honour that Allah will bestow upon these people who enter Paradise is confirmed in the following hadeeth:\u00a0\nIt was narrated from \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Mas\u2019ood that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI know the last of the people of Hell to be brought forth, and the last of the people of Paradise to enter therein. It will be a man who will emerge crawling from Hell, and Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to him: \u2018Go and enter Paradise.\u2019 He will come to it and it will appear to him to be full. He will go back and say, \u2018O Lord, I found it full.\u2019\u00a0 Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to him: \u2018Go and enter Paradise.\u2019 He will go to it and it will appear to him to be full. He will go back and say, \u2018O Lord, I found it full.\u2019 Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to him: \u2018Go and enter Paradise, and you will have the equivalent of the whole world and ten times as much.\u2019 He will say, \u2018Are You mocking me \u2013 or laughing at me \u2013 when You are the Sovereign?\u2019\u201d He said: And I saw the Messenger of Allah (S) smile so broadly that his molars appeared. And he said: \u201cThat will be the lowest of the people of Paradise in status.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (6202) and Muslim (186).\u00a0\n4 \u2013 They will be known as al-Jahannamiyyoon (the hellish ones) or \u201c \u2018utaqa\u2019 al-Jabbaar\u201d (those ransomed by the Compeller, i.e., Allah), then this name will be lifted from them.\u00a0\nThe name al-Jahannamiyyoon is the plural of jahannami, i.e., hellish (of or pertaining to Hell), What is meant is that Allah has ransomed them from Hell.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cSome people will be brought forth from the Fire after its flames touch them (and change their colour), then they will be admitted to Paradise, and the people of Paradise will call them al-Jahannamiyyoon.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (6191).\u00a0\nAhmad (12060) narrated from Anas: \u201c\u2026 they will enter Paradise and the people of Paradise will say: These are al-Jahannamiyyoon.\u201d But al-Jabbaar (the Compeller \u2013 Allah) will say: \u2018No, rather they are the ones ransomed by al-Jabbaar, may He be glorified and exalted.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\nClassed as saheeh by Ibn Mandah in al-Eemaan (2/847); Ibn Khuzaymah (2/710) and al-Albaani in Hukm Taarik al-Salaah (p. 33).\u00a0\nIbn Hibbaan narrated from Abu Sa\u2019eed al-Khudri: \u201c\u2026 In Paradise they will be called al-Jahannamiyyoon, because of the blackness on their faces, and they will say: \u2018Our Lord, take this name away from us.\u2019 So He will command them to wash themselves in a river in Paradise and will take that away from them.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated and classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan (16/457). It was also classed as saheeh by Shu\u2019ayb al-Arna\u2019oot.\u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that one dip in Paradise will cause the Muslim to forget all hardship that he faced in this world, so how about if Paradise is to be his eternal abode? It is not farfetched to assume that this also includes the hardship that the Muslim faced when he was in Hell.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe most affluent of the people in this world, of those who will go to Hell, will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and dipped once in the Fire. Then it will be said: O son of Adam, did you ever see anything good? Did you ever have any pleasure? He will say: No, by Allah, O Lord. Then the most destitute of the people in this world, of those who will enter Paradise, will be brought and dipped once in Paradise, and it will be said to him: O son of Adam, did you ever see anything bad? Did you ever experience any hardship? He will say: No, by Allah, O Lord. I never saw anything bad and I never experienced any hardship.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by Muslim (2807)\u00a0\nAnother indication that one dip in the bliss of Paradise will take away all hardship that came before it, even the hardship of being punished in Hell, in addition to what we have mentioned of their forms being changed after they are thrown into the River of Life, is the report narrated by Muslim (2836) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: \u201cWhoever enters Paradise will enjoy bliss and will not be miserable, his clothes will not wear out and his youth will not fade.\u201d\u00a0\nThis blessing confirms that misery will be erased for the one who enters Paradise, and it is general in meaning and includes everyone who enters it, whether they entered Hell beforehand or not.\u00a0\nAl-Qaadi said: What this means is that Paradise is the abode of stability and blessing which will not change or be disturbed by any hardship or corruption. Quoted in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (7/194).\u00a0\nFor all of these reasons, Allah tells us about the condition of the people of Paradise when they enter it:\u00a0\n\u201cAnd they will say: \u2018All the praises and thanks be to Allah Who has removed from us (all) grief. Verily, our Lord is indeed Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (good deeds and to recompense).\n35.\u00a0Who, out of His Grace, has lodged us in a home that will last forever, where toil will touch us not nor weariness will touch us\u2019\u201d\n[Faatir 35:34-35]\nShaykh al-Sa\u2019di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: i.e., the home of eternal abode, the home where one will want to stay forever, because of the many good things therein, and because of the ongoing delight and because there is nothing to disturb this pleasure.\u00a0\nThat is \u201cout of His Grace\u201d towards us and His Bounty, not because of our deeds. Were it not for His Grace, we would not have reached the point we have reached.\u00a0\n\u201cwhere toil will touch us not nor weariness will touch us\u201d i.e., there will be no tiredness in body, heart or strength, or because of an abundance of pleasures. This indicates that Allah will make their bodies physically perfect and will create all means of making their abode there one of continuous delight and pleasure, so that they will not be touched by toil or weariness, or by worry or sorrow.\u00a0\nTafseer al-Sa\u2019di (689).\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Shar\u2019i implications of husband\u2019s zina with his wife\u2019s mother before and after marriage",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible for anyone to claim that someone else \n    has committed zina unless that is proven in the way dictated by sharee\u2019ah, \n    such as a confession of the zaani, or the testimony of four men of good \n    character who witnessed the act of zina. The one who claims that someone \n    committed zina with no proof has committed slander, which is a major sin for \n    which a person deserves eighty lashes; this is the hadd punishment for \n    slander.\u00a0\n\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cAnd those who accuse chaste women, \n    and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject \n    their testimony forever. They indeed are the Faasiqoon (liars, rebellious, \n    disobedient to Allaah).\n\n    5.\u00a0Except those who repent thereafter and do righteous \n    deeds; (for such) verily, Allaah is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\n\n    [al-Noor 24:4-5]\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    If the questioner has proof of what is mentioned in the \n    question, that the husband committed the sin of zina with his wife\u2019s mother, \n    then it should be noted that they both deserve the punishment and wrath of \n    Allaah, and they deserve to be punished in this world. As the woman is \n    married, she deserves to be stoned to death. If he was married then he \n    deserves the same, and if he committed zina before he was married, then the \n    punishment is one hundred lashes.\u00a0\n\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThe fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them \n    with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a \n    punishment prescribed by Allaah, if you believe in Allaah and the Last Day. \n    And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.\u201d\n\n    [al-Noor 24:2]\n\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: A Muslim man came to \n    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    when he was in the mosque and called out to him, saying: O Messenger of \n    Allaah, I have committed zina. He turned away from him, so he came around to \n    face him and said to him: O Messenger of Allaah, I have committed zina. He \n    turned away from him, until he had repeated that four times. When he had \n    testified against himself four times, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called him and said: \u201cAre you insane?\u201d \n    He said: No. He said: \u201cAre you married?\u201d He said: Yes. The Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cTake him and \n    stone him.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6439) and Muslim (1691).\u00a0\n\n    \u201cMarried\u201d refers to one who has previously been married and \n    consummated the marriage, even if divorce took place after that or the \n    husband or wife died.\u00a0\n\n    Imam Ahmad said \u2013 according to one report narrated from him \u2013 \n    concerning the one who does that: He is to be executed whatever the case, \n    i.e., the one who commits zina with one of his mahrams is to be executed, \n    whether he was married or not, and whether the mahram was a mahram through \n    blood ties, marriage or breastfeeding.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Qudaamah said: This is also the view of Jaabir ibn Zayd, \n    Ishaaq, Abu Ayyoob and Ibn Abi Khaythamah. End quote. Al-Mughni \n    (12/341).\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If the \n    evil deed was done with a mahram, this is the worst of evil deeds, and the \n    one who did that is to be executed in all cases, according to Imam Ahmad and \n    others.\u00a0\n\n    Rawdat al-Muhibbeen p. 374.\u00a0\n\n    Does the fact that he committed zina with her mother mean \n    that it is haraam for him to marry her daughter, or that the marriage should \n    be annulled? There is a difference of opinion among the scholars concerning \n    that. The most correct view is that it does not make the marriage haraam and \n    the marriage should not be annulled.\u00a0\n\n    The ruling on this matter has been stated and explained in \n    detail in the answer to question no. \n    78597.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    What the wife must do now is:\u00a0\n\n    1.Not act or make any decision \n    about this matter unless she has definitive proof.\n\n    2.Advise her mother \u2013 if the \n    accusation of zina is proven \u2013 that it is essential to repent sincerely.\n\n    3.Advise her husband to repent \n    sincerely if he committed zina with her mother after she got married. It is \n    essential to keep him away from her mother in living arrangements and \n    meetings so that this deed will not be repeated. If he does not repent from \n    this action then she should hasten to get divorced, and it is not \n    permissible for her to stay with him, because Allaah has forbidden marriage \n    of a zaani to a chaste believing woman.\n\n    We understand what a severe calamity has befallen this \n    sister. How great is a woman\u2019s grief, and difficult it is for her to bear it \n    if her husband commits zina, and it is a thousand and one times more \n    difficult to bear it when her mother commits zina, so how about if it is her \n    husband who is committing zina with her mother? This is indeed a calamity!\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to relieve her distress and take away her \n    sorrow, and to bless her with patience and wisdom.\u00a0\n\n    But before making any major decision, we advise her to think \n    long and hard about the consequences.\u00a0\n\n    If she decides to leave her husband, then in that case can \n    she live in the same house as her mother, who is the one who did that and \n    wrecked her marriage?\u00a0\n\n    We think, if she has no suitable place to go and no mahram \n    who can take care of her, that staying with her husband and advising him to \n    repent and mend his ways is easier for her than getting divorced and living \n    in her mother\u2019s house.\u00a0\n\n    This sister should weigh up the consequences of her decision. \n    Some evils are easier to bear than others.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "His wife reviles him and insults him. What should he do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If the wife insults and reviles her husband, then he must advise her and warn her, and explain to her that her bad talk incurs sin, especially since the husband is the most deserving of people of her respect and good treatment, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone, I would have told women to prostrate to their husbands, because of the rights that Allah has given them over them.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood (2140) and al-Tirmidhi (1159); classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\nYou should follow with her the method that Allah has mentioned in His Book, of admonishing, forsaking in bed and hitting in a way that does not cause injury. If none of that is successful, then you should seek help in advising her from a righteous person in her family, so as to preserve the family and take care of the rights of the children, if there are any.\u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cMen are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband\u2019s absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity and their husband\u2019s property). As to those women on whose part you see ill\u2011conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful and in a manner that does not cause any physical pain or leave marks); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great\u201d\n[al-Nisa 4:34]\u00a0\nAmong the admonishment that you may use with her is telling her of the sin that she is committing by disobeying her husband, and the great reward that she will attain if she obeys him.\u00a0\nYou should also explain to her the harm that will be suffered by her, her husband and her daughter in the event of a divorce or if she continues to behave in this manner.\u00a0\nIf the wife responds and is affected by this admonition, and she gives up this bad behaviour, then this is what is wanted. If she persists in her evil ways and foolishness, then there is no blame on the husband if he divorces her.\u00a0\nThe scholars have stated that divorce may be permissible if it is needed because of the wife\u2019s bad attitude and bad conduct, and if he is harmed by that and the purpose of marriage is not being achieved. \u00a0\nAl-Mughni (10/324).\u00a0\nWhat you have mentioned about being afraid for your daughter if you separate is something that should be taken into account. If you are afraid that you will not be able to bring her up, or that the girl will be harmed because of this divorce, then you should weigh up the two evils, that of staying with a woman whose attitude is bad and who is mistreating you, and that of what might happen to your daughter after a divorce. One of the basic principles of sharee\u2019ah is doing the lesser of two evils in order to ward off the greater.\u00a0\nYou should pray istikharah, asking Allah for guidance, before making your decision, and you should strive for reconciliation if possible. If that is not possible then strive to protect your daughter and get custody of her, and do not leave her for this woman to raise her with her attitude.\u00a0\nWe advise you to pray to Allah and always fear Him, for Allah has promised provision and a way out to the pious who always fear Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\n3.\u00a0And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things\u201d\n[al-Talaq 65:2-3]\u00a0\nWe also advise you to repent to Allah from all sins, for the wife\u2019s bad attitude may be a punishment for sins that one has committed, as it was narrated that al-Fudayl ibn \u2018Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I disobey Allah then I see that in the attitude of my mount or my wife. \u00a0\nWe ask Allah to set our affairs and the affairs of the Muslims straight.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Not Praying Causes Distress and Anxiety",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is essential first of all to define the cause of the problem, then you can go ahead and deal with it. If you ask us to help you define it, we would say that the problem is in yourself and not in anything else. The help that others offer you will never be of benefit unless you take steps towards salvation. \u00a0\nThe feelings that you express in your question indicate that the elements of righteousness are present in your case, for the believer is the one who takes stock of himself and rebukes himself, and it seems that you are doing that.\u00a0\nThe believer is afraid of his shortcomings and sins, and sees them as a mountain that is about to fall on him. It seems that you feel this way too.\u00a0\nThe believer holds his Islam and faith in high esteem, and is proud to belong to this great religion, and he loves his Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) \u2013 and your letter shows this clearly.\u00a0\nSo how can all these qualities be present in one who falls short in the greatest religious duty, which is prayer?\u00a0\nWe do not have any explanation for that except poor self-management and a lack of self control. Otherwise, performing the prayer does not take up a great deal of effort or time. It is only a few minutes in which a person is alone with his Lord, asking Him to fulfil his needs and complaining to Him the heavy burden of his worldly concerns, and expressing to Him his longing for Him and His mercy.\u00a0\nIf we cannot put up with making the commitment of these few minutes, then we do not think that we could ever succeed in our lives. Self-discipline requires commitment and resolve, and our Lord has not burdened us Muslims with more than we can bear, rather He has not even burdened us with anything that is too difficult for us; He loves to accept our repentance and make things easier for us.\u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAllah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:185]\u00a0\n\u201cAllah wishes to make clear (what is lawful and what is unlawful) to you, and to show you the ways of those before you, and accept your repentance, and Allah is All\u2011Knower, All\u2011Wise.\nAllah wishes to accept your repentance, but those who follow their lusts, wish that you (believers) should deviate tremendously away (from the Right Path).\nAllah wishes to lighten (the burden) for you; and man was created weak\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 4:26-28]\nPrayer is a mercy that Allah has enjoined upon us by His bounty and kindness. The one who adheres to it and prays regularly and properly will see the bounty of Allah to us which He has decreed for us and will understand that the one who is truly deprived is the one who deprives himself of the joy of contact with Allah, may He be exalted.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cPrayer is the best of prescribed things, so the one who is able to do a lot of it, let him do a lot of it.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Tabaraani (1/84); classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb (390).\u00a0\nSee what Allah says after the verses in which He enjoined purification for prayer (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAllah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you, and to complete His Favour to you that you may be thankful\u201d\n[al-Maa'idah 5:6]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whom you love and whose Seerah (life) you love, says: \u201cMy delight has been made in prayer.\u201d Narrated by al-Nasaa\u2019i (3940); classed as hasan (sound) by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in al-Talkhees al-Habeer (3/116) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa\u2019i.\u00a0\nHow can the believer agree to miss out on this goodness and these blessings?\u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAlas! How can a person spend his time and live his life deprived of smelling this fragrance, and leave this world as he entered it without having tasted the best that it has to offer, and having lived in it like a dumb animal, departing from it like one who is bankrupt. He lived a life of helplessness, he died a death of sadness and his resurrection will be loss and regret. O Allah, to You be praise, to You we complain, You are the One Whose help we seek, You we ask for aid, in You we put our trust, and there is no power and no strength except with You. \u00a0\nTareeq al-Hijratayn (p. 327).\u00a0\nI am not saying this to you in order to increase the despair that you are feeling, but so that you will strive to rid yourself of it. It has only befallen you because of your failure to perform the easiest of duties, so you should know that you are more incapable of doing others.\u00a0\nYou should not leave any room in your life for despair with regard to\u00a0 Allah. You must understand that He hates those who despair (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd who despairs of the Mercy of his Lord except those who are astray?\u201d [al-Hijr 15:56] and He loves those of His slaves who are optimistic of His mercy and grace. By His vast kindness He forgives bad deeds and pardons mistakes, indeed He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cExcept those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful\nAnd whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allah with true repentance\u201d\n[al-Furqaan 25:68-70]\u201d\nA wise man said: \u201cNothing brings hope but good deeds.\u201d You will never escape the trap of despair into which the shaytaan has caused you to fall unless you start to strive and try to commit yourself to righteousness, even if you fall short at the beginning.\u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cand never give up hope of Allah\u2019s Mercy. Certainly no one despairs of Allah\u2019s Mercy, except the people who disbelieve\u201d\n[Yoosuf 12:87]\nHope means that a person must work and strive hard for whatever he hopes for, but despair means that he will be sluggish and slow. The best that people can hope for is the bounty, kindness, mercy and grace of Allah.\n\u00a0\u201cCertainly no one despairs of Allah\u2019s Mercy, except the people who disbelieve\u201d \u2013 because of their kufr (disbelief), they think that the mercy of Allah is unlikely, and His mercy is far from them. So do not be like the kaafirs (non-Muslims). This indicates that the more faith a person has, the more hope he will have of the mercy and grace of Allah. Tafseer Ibn Sa\u2019di.\u00a0\nThe first thing you must do is to become eager to offer prayers regularly and on time, as you would feel eager for other worldly matters such as food, drink, study, marriage and so on. Every action is preceded by concern and thought. One of the early generation strove hard to do many naafil (voluntary) prayers, until Thaabit al-Banaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I strove hard to do qiyaam al-layl (supererogatory prayers offered at night) for twenty years, and I enjoyed it for the next twenty years.\u00a0\nThis thinking and concern will not be sufficient unless you focus on means that will help you to pray regularly and think about ways to make yourself adhere to that which Allah has enjoined. Man possesses a great ability to choose the means that will help him to do what he wants.\u00a0\nStrive to get up straightaway, as soon as you hear the voice of the muezzin saying takbeer, and remember that Allah is greater than all of this world by which you are distracted. Then go to your prayer-place and pray what Allah has enjoined on you. Do not forget to say that du\u2019aa\u2019 that our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us: \u2018Allahumma a\u2019inni \u2018ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa husni \u2018ibaadatika (O Allah, help me to remember You, give thanks to You and worship You properly).\u201d\u00a0\nYou say that your family is eager to fast six days of Shawwaal, and this is a sign of goodness and righteousness that will help you to offer prayers on time, when you see your mother and siblings getting up at this time. Praise Allah for this; how many complaints come from children whose families smack them to stop them praying and hijab, but Allah has honoured you with a family who can help you to fear Allah.\u00a0\nKeep company with girls who pray and are righteous, and ask them to help you with prayer and to remind you of it and encourage you to do it. That may be the best help for you.\u00a0\nFinally, beware of sins, for they are the basis of all problems. One sin leads to another, and so on, until they accumulate and destroy a man, making it too hard for him to pray and depriving him of its light and blessing. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.\u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\nSins generate more sins, and one leads to another, until they overpower a man and he finds it difficult to repent from that. As one of the earlier generation said: One of the punishments of bad deeds is more bad deeds, and one of the rewards of good deeds is more good deeds.\u00a0\nAl-Jawaab al-Kaafi (p. 36).\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nAs for your question about fasting Ramadan and that you are uncertain about not fasting on some days, with no excuse, we say to you: Do not pay any attention to these doubts, if it seems most likely to you that you did this act of worship at the right time with your family. Thinking something most likely is sufficient to have discharged one\u2019s duty, and doubts count for nothing after that.\u00a0\nIn Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah (7/143) it says: \u00a0\nDoubts after having finished tawaaf circling the k\u2019abah), saa\u2019i (walking between Safa and Marwah) and prayer should be ignored, because what seems to be the case is that the act of worship is valid.\u00a0\nEnd quote.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIf the doubt comes after finishing the act of worship, then no attention should be paid to it, so long as there is no certainty about the matter.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 Fataawa al-Shaykh al-\u2018Uthaymeen (14/question no. 746).\u00a0\nMoreover, if a fast is not observed with no excuse, it does not have to be made up and no expiation is to be offered, rather one has to repent and seek forgiveness, as has previously been explained in he answer to question no. 50067.\u00a0\nI ask Allah to decree your reward for you and to make you steadfast in adhering to truth and Islam, and to protect you from the accursed shaytaan.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "She accepted him as a husband after praying istikhaarah but he divorced her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We understand your feelings about this matter, which has caused you hardship and pain, but it may be that it is very good for you, and you will come to understand that later on, in sha Allah.\u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cHow wonderful is the situation of the believer, for all his affairs are good. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (2999).\u00a0\nThe believing woman accepts the decree of Allah and knows that Allah is more merciful towards her than she is herself, and that calamities increase the believer in reward and status, if he is patient and seeks reward.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nIf the young man who proposed to you was working in a riba-based bank, then praise Allah for having diverted him from you, and that you did not become his wife, eating from his haraam wealth. This is the result of istikhaarah, praise be to Allah, because the result of istikhaarah may not be immediately apparent, and both parties may go ahead, then Allah diverts one or both of them from completing the matter. You may be completely certain that Allah has chosen the better of the two for you, and that what happened of making the marriage contract then divorce, is a test from Allah, and it is good and beneficial, even though it may cause you some sorrow and pain.\u00a0\nUndoubtedly you made a mistake when you accepted this young man, as the first thing you should look for is religious commitment and good character. The one who works with riba, either recording it or witnessing it or anything else, is lacking in good character and is exposing himself to the curse and being banished from the mercy of Allah, so how could a believing woman accept him as a husband and father of her children?\u00a0\nPraise Allah and give thanks to Him for this blessing, and learn a lesson from this experience, for if a person is saved one time, he may not be saved again.\u00a0\nIt is very strange for a person whom Allah diverts away from evil as a sign of mercy and kindness, to still be upset about his loss.\u00a0\nIbn Mas\u2019ood (may Allah have mercy on him) said: A person may think of some trade or position of leadership until it is made available to him, then Allah looks at him and says to the angels: Divert it away from him, for if it is made easy for him he will enter Hell. So Allah diverts it away from him, but he keeps saying, So and so beat me to it, So and so humiliated me, when it is nothing more than a bounty from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\u201d\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nWith regard to the frustration that has befallen you and your determination not to go through this again, it is better for you not to have this attitude. If a person fails once it does not mean that he will fail every time, rather you can learn from what has happened so that it will motivate you to make a good choice next time, on the basis of religious commitment and good character.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to increase you in faith and piety, and to bless you with a righteous husband and righteous offspring.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

There is also a warning against hastening to divorce or using \n    divorce as an oath. \u00a0\n\n    Your aunt should understand that it is not essential that she \n    know about her divorce being conditional upon her doing something, and it is \n    not essential that she hear her husband utter the divorce, but her husband \n    should have told her what he had done. Not telling her what he said about \n    her divorce being conditional upon her entering her sister\u2019s house shows \n    that he did not intend to stop her, rather he intended that the divorce \n    should take place.

        "question": "She hates her husband and fears that she may fall into zina if she stays with him",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nZina is a grave sin, \n    especially on the part of one whom Allaah has blessed with marriage and who \n    has responded to the blessing with ingratitude, betrayed her husband, \n    transgressed against his honour and contaminated his bed. Hence the \n    punishment for this married woman is to be stoned to death, as a punishment \n    from Allaah, and Allaah is Almighty and All-Wise.\u00a0\nBut by His mercy, He is \n    kind to His slave and gives him respite and allows him to repent, and He \n    accepts that from him and gives reward for that. How merciful, great and \n    kind He is, may He be glorified and exalted.\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with \n    Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, \n    nor commit illegal sexual intercourse __and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.\n\n    69.\u00a0The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of \n    Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;\n\n    70.\u00a0Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic \n    Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their \n    sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\n\n    [al-Furqaan 25:68-70]\nSo continue to repent and \n    beseech Allaah to accept it from you, and beware of your self that is \n    inclined towards evil, lest you take for granted Allaah\u2019s kindness towards \n    you and His covering of your sins, for He gives respite but does not forget, \n    and when He becomes angry He punishes.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nYou have to block all the \n    ways that lead to haraam, such as tabarruj (wanton display of adornment), \n    free mixing, correspondence and phone calls. This is part of your repentance \n    and mending your ways. You must beware of the traps of the shaytaan, for the \n    shaytaan has traps and tricks whereby he tempts his friends, as Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO you who believe! \n    Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the \n    footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al\u2011Fahsha\u2019 [i.e. to \n    commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al\u2011Munkar [disbelief and \n    polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is \n    forbidden in Islam)]. And had it not been for the Grace of Allaah and His \n    Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins. But Allaah \n    purifies (guides to Islam) whom He wills, and Allaah is All\u2011Hearer, \n    All\u2011Knower\u201d\n[al-Noor 24:21]\nThirdly:\u00a0\nIf you do not want to stay \n    with him and you cannot stand him, and you fear that if you do that you will \n    fall into zina, then there is nothing wrong with you asking for a divorce, \n    but you should think about the consequences of doing that and what your \n    situation will be after that. Pray to Allaah for guidance (istikhaarah) \n    before doing that. See question no.\n    11981 for information about \n    the istikhaarah prayer. \u00a0\nThe evidence that it is \n    permissible to seek a divorce if a woman hates her husband and cannot bear \n    to stay with him is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh \n    (4867), that the wife of Thaabit ibn Qays came to the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: \u201cO Messenger of Allaah, I do \n    not blame Thaabit ibn Qays for any defect in his character or his religious \n    commitment, but I would hate to commit an act of kufr when I am a Muslim.\u201d\u00a0 \n    [Ibn Majaah (2056 added): and I cannot stand him ] The Messenger of Allaah \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \u201cWill you give him back \n    his garden [which he had given as mahr]?\u201d She said, \u201cYes.\u201d The Messenger of \n    Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said (to Thaabit), \n    \u201cAccept the garden, and divorce her once.\u201d \u00a0\nWhat is meant by \u201cI would \n    hate to commit an act of kufr when I am Muslim\u201d is: I would hate to do a \n    deed that is contrary to Islam such as hating my husband or disobeying him \n    or not fulfilling his rights, and so on.\u00a0\nSee: Fath al-Baari \n    (9/400).\u00a0\nBut we advise you, before \n    you ask for a divorce, to try to set things straight first, for divorce is \n    something that Allaah hates and does not love. So try to appoint a wise man \n    from your family to speak to your husband and find out the reasons for the \n    problem, and try to reconcile between you. What you say about his being weak \n    can be worked out with your husband frankly, for Allaah is not too shy to \n    tell the truth. If it is the matter of sickness, there is nothing wrong with \n    him going to the doctor.\u00a0\nBut if it too difficult for \n    you and your attempts at reconciliation do not succeed, then in sha Allaah \n    there is nothing wrong with you asking for a divorce in that case.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to set our \n    affairs and those of all the Muslims straight.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

Hence you must advise:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 Your brother\u2019s wife, and tell her to stop doing things \n    that Allaah has forbidden such as uncovering any part of her body in front \n    of her husband\u2019s brothers, speaking softly to them and mistreating you.\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 Your brother himself, and tell him to stop his wife from \n    mixing with non-mahram men and to stop her from mistreating his sisters.

She should \n    understand that if her son\u2019s wife carries on in this manner, this will \n    destroy her son\u2019s family and the negative effects of that are obvious as \n    mentioned in the question. \u00a0\n\n    The wife\u2019s brothers should also fear Allaah with regard to \n    themselves and be content with the halaal things that Allaah has blessed \n    them with. They should advise their brother and guide him and his wife lest \n    their relationships with their own wives be spoiled. They should also lower \n    their gaze and avoid mixed gatherings.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to set the affairs of all the Muslims \n    straight.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Should she cut off ties with her family who are trying to lead her astray and are opposed to her becoming righteous?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Verily to Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return. By \n    Allaah, it fills the heart with sorrow to hear that there is such severe \n    suffering and pain in Muslim families for the one who wants to adhere to his \n    religion and straight path. We have often heard of Muslim men and women who \n    suffer because of their Christian or idol-worshipping families, but for a \n    Muslim woman to suffer because of her family who claim to be Muslims and to \n    flee from her so-called Muslim family for the sake of her religious \n    commitment is something that is very sad.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to make you and your husband steadfast in \n    adhering to Islam and true guidance, and to make you strong in adhering to \n    the truth, and to make you righteous and bless you with righteous \n    offspring.\u00a0\n\n    Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (145) that Abu Hurayrah \n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIslam began as something strange \n    and will revert to being something strange, so glad tidings to the \n    strangers.\u201d If the people regard you as strange because of your religious \n    commitment, then glad tidings to you. If the Muslim sees that he is a \n    stranger because of his Islam, even among his family, then this is glad \n    tidings for him that the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) conveyed to him: \u201cGlad tidings to the strangers.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    There can be no doubt that reviling the Lord and Islam, as \n    done by your mother and other family members, is major kufr that puts a \n    person beyond the pale of Islam and dooms them to Hell for eternity, if the \n    one who did that dies without coming back to Islam.\u00a0\n\n    Hence your duty towards those among your family who have \n    fallen into such sins is to call them to refrain from this kufr and tell \n    them that they must come back to Islam, and they should understand their \n    situation and the Islamic ruling on their case, which is that they are \n    apostates whose good deeds have been cancelled out.\u00a0\n\n    You should realize that the fact that your mother has fallen \n    into kufr does not mean that you should sever your relationship with her, \n    rather you should be more concerned about it lest she die in this state.\u00a0\n\n    You have to honour her and treat her kindly even if she is a \n    kaafir and, moreover, even if she calls you to kufr and strives hard to do \n    that, as our Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of \n    the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his \n    parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything \n    (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not\u201d\n\n    [al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:8]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBut if they (both) strive with you to make you join in \n    worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them \n    not; but behave with them in the world kindly\u201d\n\n    [Luqmaan 31:15].\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Asma\u2019 bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be \n    pleased with her) said: My mother came to me when she was a mushrik. I \n    consulted the Messenger of Allaah (S) and said: O Messenger of Allaah (S), \n    my mother has come to me and she is expecting (something), should I uphold \n    the ties of kinship with my mother? He said: \u201cYes, uphold the ties of \n    kinship with your mother.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2620) and Muslim \n    (1003).\u00a0\n\n    But this honouring and showing kindness does not mean that \n    you have to mix with them in their homes and get involved in their lives \n    where they commit sins and revile Allaah and His Messenger and His Religion, \n    unless your presence will put a stop to this kufr and these sins. But if \n    they will are ongoing and there is the possibility that you may be affected \n    by what you hear, then it is haraam for you to stay in that gathering with \n    them. If they repeat that every time you visit, then there is nothing wrong \n    with you not visiting them, and that is not being disobedient to them, \n    rather it is a shar\u2019i obligation. Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this \n    Qur\u2019aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, \n    then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if \n    you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:140]\n\n    Do not pay any attention to your family\u2019s forsaking you \n    because of your and your husband\u2019s commitment to the rulings of sharee\u2019ah on \n    clothing and other matters, because this is one of the tricks of the \n    shaytaan.\u00a0\n\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee said, concerning a \n    similar issue:\u00a0\n\n    Obeying one's parents is required in that which is good and \n    proper, but if they tell you to commit sin, then there is no obedience to \n    them, because it is proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cObedience is only in that which is good and \n    proper.\u201d So adhere to your hijab and try to convince them and explain the \n    rulings to them, and do not pay any attention to their threats. Seek the \n    help of Allaah, may He be glorified, in that, then seek the help of good \n    people among your relatives who can advise them, in the hope that Allaah may \n    benefit them thereby. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah li\u2019l-Buhooth al-\u2018Ilmiyyah \n    wa\u2019l-Ifta\u2019 (1/541)\u00a0\n\n    It is strange that your mother has fallen into kufr, evil and \n    sin, then we see her showing concern about your disobedience to her, and \n    accuses you thereof. This contradiction is indicative of ignorance of \n    sharee\u2019ah and a lack of concern about its rulings.\u00a0\n\n    To sum up: The Muslim woman is obliged to treat her family \n    and parents well, and to do her utmost to advise them with goodness, wisdom \n    and beautiful preaching. She should regard the period when she cuts off ties \n    with them \u2013 for the sake of her religious commitment \u2013 as a temporary \n    remedy, and if she feels that her family have made some change for the \n    better, she should hasten to resume ties with them and guide them towards \n    that which is good.\u00a0\n\n    Do not forget to pray for your mother and your family, asking \n    Allaah to guide them and bring them back to their true religion before it is \n    too late.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "He thinks his mother used witchcraft against him and they are on bad terms with one another",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It should be noted, first \n    of all, that Allaah has enjoined you to respect your parents and to treat \n    them kindly in word and in deed, and He has forbidden you to treat them \n    badly or say to them \u201cUff\u201d (a word of disrespect).\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd your Lord has \n    decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your \n    parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not \n    to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of \n    honour\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:23]\nIt was narrated that Abu \n    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: A man came to the Messenger \n    of Allaah (S) and said: Which of the people is most deserving of my good \n    companionship? He said: \u201cYour mother.\u201d He said: Then who? He said: \u201cThen \n    your mother.\u201d He said: Then who? He said: \u201cThen your mother.\u201d He said: Then \n    who? He said: \u201cThen your father.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5626) and Muslim \n    (2548).\u00a0\nHence you must stop your \n    mistreatment and saying that she is insane, because that is not appropriate, \n    and you should treat her in a kind and loving manner, and do not disobey her \n    commands so long as there is no sin involved. It is not permissible for you \n    to shun her and stop talking to her. If she does that then try hard to \n    reconcile with her by speaking kindly and doing kind deeds to her.\u00a0\nIt should be noted, \n    secondly, that it is not permissible for you to accuse a specific person of \n    having bewitched you, so how about if the person you accuse is your mother? \n    By doing that, you are accusing her of committing a major sin that may reach \n    the level of kufr. It is not permissible for you to do this even if the one \n    whom you accuse is a stranger to you, so how about if you are attributing \n    that reprehensible action to your mother with no proof or evidence? The \n    punishment for wronging others is severe, so how about one who wrongs his \n    own mother?\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd those who annoy \n    believing men and women undeservedly, they bear (on themselves) the crime of \n    slander and plain sin\u201d\n[al-Ahzaab 33:58]\nIbn Katheer (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\nThe words \u201cAnd those who \n    annoy believing men and women undeservedly\u201d mean: by attributing to them \n    things of which they are innocent, that they have not done.\u00a0\n\u201cthey bear (on \n    themselves) the crime of slander and plain sin\u201d means, this is an \n    obvious lie, to say or narrate of the believing men and women things that \n    they did not do, by way of criticizing them.\u00a0\nTafseer Ibn Katheer, \n    6/480.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Jaabir \n    ibn \u2018Abd-Allaah that the Messenger of Allaah (S) said:\u00a0 \u201cBeware of \n    injustice, for injustice will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d \n    Narrated by Muslim (2578).\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAl-Qaadi said: It was said \n    that this means what it appears to mean, and it will be darkness for a \n    person who will not be able to find a way on the Day of Resurrection when \n    the light of the believers appears before them and on their right. And it \n    may be that darkness here refers to hardship, which is how they interpreted \n    the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSay (O \n    Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645): Who \n    rescues you from the darkness of the land and the sea\u201d [al-An\u2019aam 6:63], \n    i.e. hardships.\u00a0 And it may be that it refers to punishment.\u00a0\nSharh Muslim \n    (16/134).\u00a0\nIt should be noted, \n    thirdly, that you may not have been bewitched, and it may all be illusions \n    and imagination. This happens to a lot of people, who believe that they have \n    been bewitched when that is not the case. So strive to obey your Lord by \n    performing obligatory and supererogatory duties, and strive to honour your \n    mother. Always read Qur\u2019aan and try to recite the adhkaar for morning and \n    evening. These things, in sha Allaah, will protect you from evil and help \n    you to recover from your mental and psychological illnesses.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the source of \n    strength."

        "question": "Her father is forcing her to attend gatherings in which there are innovations (bid\u2019ah). How should she behave with him?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nWhen reading this letter, \n    although we feel sad about what is mentioned in it, we feel happy when we \n    read of this sister\u2019s common sense, intelligence and good following of the \n    Sunnah, and that she is upset at the presence of bid\u2019ah and she is afraid of \n    falling into sin by disobeying her father who is telling her to go to the \n    place where these innovations are practised. She is also thinking of leaving \n    home but she is worried about her brother and sister and is afraid that she \n    will be going against sharee\u2019ah if she does not have a mahram with her. All \n    of this, and she is a new Muslim. We ask Allaah by His names and attributes \n    to make her and her siblings steadfast in adhering to the truth, and guide \n    her family to follow the Sunnah.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWe say to the sister who is \n    asking this question:\u00a0\n\n    1.Undoubtedly attending these \n    gatherings with their innovations and sins is regarded as something that is \n    contrary to sharee\u2019ah. Those innovators are not content with merely \n    mentioning the names of Allaah in song and dance, rather they had added \n    other sins, namely failing to offer the prayers on time. This indicates that \n    their claim that they are worshipping Allaah and drawing close to Him is \n    false. If they were sincere in their desire to draw close to Him, they would \n    worship in the ways that He has prescribed, and they would not miss the \n    prayer, which is the greatest practical pillar of Islam. The texts of the \n    Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah issue stern warnings to those who do not offer the prayer \n    on time and those who neglect the prayer.\n\n    2.It is well known in sharee\u2019ah \n    that attending such gatherings incurs a great deal of sin and leads to many \n    negative consequences, but there may be some interest to be served by \n    delaying one\u2019s refusal to go, because that delay may bring benefits and ward \n    off harms.\n\n    3.One of the interests served by \n    your continuing to go now is taking care of your brother and sister and \n    making sure that there is someone with them who can guide them and explain \n    to them what is wrong with these actions. Another interest that will be \n    served is making sure that your non-attendance will not lead to your father \n    throwing you out of the house, which is something that would lead to many \n    evils and bad consequences, the extent of which no one knows but Allaah, \n    especially in the country where you live and even in other countries. \n    \n\n    4.We think that you could \n    continue to go, but go as little as you can, and make up some excuses that \n    will be acceptable to your father for not going, as well as trying hard to \n    bring in wise people of Ahl al-Sunnah who can explain the truth to your \n    father.\n\n    5.A person such as you will not \n    be deceived, in sha Allaah, by what these ignorant innovators are doing. \n    Neverthless we advise you to protect your faith by doing acts of worship and \n    increasing your knowledge by reading and studying the books of Ahl \n    al-Sunnah. This will be beneficial for you. And ask trustworthy people of \n    Ahl al-Sunnah about everything that is not clear to you, and remember that \n    you have to keep advising and teaching and guiding your siblings. You should \n    also try to influence some of the other girls who attend these gatherings \n    and call them to the truth and the right path.\n\n    6.If you go there, we advise you \n    to avoid these gatherings as much as you can, by sitting with the women in a \n    separate room far away from these innovations and deviations. Be the last to \n    enter and the first to leave, as much as you can.\n\n    7.We advise you to sit with your \n    father and discuss with him what he is telling you to do, and to try to \n    convince him about these innovators. You are at an age where you can do that \n    with him. And you have enough knowledge to convince him in sha Allaah.\n\n    8.Always pray for your father and \n    advise him, and treat him well all the time, for \u201cthere is no kindness in a \n    thing but it adorns it, and it is not taken away from a thing but it makes \n    it defective\u201d as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said.\nWe ask Allaah to help you \n    to do that which He loves and which pleases Him, and to make you steadfast \n    in adhering to the truth, and to guide your father to the truth.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Source of \n    strength."

Children \u2013 \n    both male and female \u2013 go through different stages as they grow, and each \n    stage has its own problems.

Each of you is a shepherd and \n    each of you is responsible for his flock.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (853) and Muslim (1829).\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\n    The one who neglects to teach his son that which will benefit \n    him and leaves him to his own devices has wronged him severely. Most \n    children only become corrupt because of their parents and their neglect of \n    them, and their failure to teach them the obligatory duties and sunnahs of \n    Islam. They neglect them when they are young then they are not able to \n    benefit themselves or their parents when they grow up.\u00a0\n\n    Tuhfat al-Mawdood (p. 229).\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    What your son has done by ceasing to memorize Qur\u2019aan and \n    lead the prayer may be understood in two ways: \u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 That he is sincere in what he is saying, which is what \n    seems to us to be the case. In that case you must advise him and guide him \n    in the way that is best, and make him understand that there is no \n    contradiction between what you are telling him to do and having a sincere \n    intention. He can correct his intention if it was not right, and correcting \n    it is better for him in this world and in the Hereafter than giving up the \n    action altogether. You should also make him understand that the methods that \n    the shaytaan uses to stop the Muslim doing acts of worship and continuing in \n    them include whispering to him that his intention is not sound, and that he \n    is not doing it for the sake of Allaah, so that this Muslim will give up his \n    act of worship if he has started it, or he will refrain from starting it and \n    doing it if he had not started it, and thus the shaytaan will have attained \n    what he wanted.\u00a0\n\n    You can ask your son this: What will he do with his children \n    when Allaah blesses him with children and he is responsible for them on the \n    Day of Resurrection? Undoubtedly \u2013 in sha Allaah \u2013 he will answer by saying \n    that he will tell them to do that which is to their benefit, and encourage \n    them to obey and worship Allaah, which includes memorizing Qur'aan and \n    prayer. If he is honest with you and gives you this answer, then he will \n    have committed himself, and given evidence against himself, and this is what \n    you yourself have done with him.\u00a0\n\n    We advise you not to criticize him too much, and to discuss \n    with him. You can go to a scholar or seeker of knowledge whom he trusts to \n    discuss the matter with him, and hear something from someone other than you \n    who has knowledge that will put his mind at rest. You do not have to be the \n    one who advises him, changes his mind and convinces him, rather you should \n    delegate that to someone else, so that he will do that on the basis of being \n    pleased with what he has heard.\u00a0\n\n    We also advise you to stop your shunning of him straight \n    away, and stop refusing to treat him kindly. Right now he is in the greatest \n    need of you and your compassion. He is suffering \n    from something that the imams and scholars also suffered from, which is the \n    issue of intention (niyyah). Imam Sufyaan al-Thawri (may Allaah have mercy \n    on him) said: I have never dealt with anything more difficult than my \n    intention. So beware of forsaking him, and beware of being too harsh with \n    him, lest you lose him forever. We ask Allaah not to let that happen.\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 The second possibility is that he is lying, in which case \n    you have to find out whether your son has been affected by the sickness of \n    loss of interest and ambition. There are many causes for these sicknesses, \n    including the following: \u00a0\n\n    (i)Influence of bad friends\n\n    (ii)Too many duties in school and \n    at home, so that he feels overwhelmed and gives up on some of them.\n\n    (iii)Finding the Qur\u2019aan \n    memorization program too heavy, which has led to him becoming tired and \n    bored.\n\n    (iv)Not having the chance to relax \n    in permissible ways, such as going on trips, playing games, and watching \n    beneficial shows. Some fathers are too keen for their children not to pay \n    any attention to these things that allow for relaxation and bring more \n    energy for worship and obedience.\n\n    (v)Reaching the stage of puberty \n    and adolescence, which is a dangerous stage in a young man\u2019s life. Parents \n    must pay attention to their sons when they reach this age, and treat their \n    sons as men, not children, and lightening up on the things they tell them to \n    do. The stage of persuasion and understanding should begin, which is totally \n    different from when they were small.\n\n    What we have mentioned are some of the possible causes. You \n    know what is really going on, whether he is telling the truth or lying. \n    Hence we said that raising children is difficult, and needs knowledge and \n    wisdom, patience and forbearance. It is not a simple matter, especially with \n    all the corrupt influences, distractions and the war against virtue, \n    chastity and righteousness that is being waged inside and outside. \u00a0\n\n    Look for the reason why he has stopped memorizing Qur'aan and \n    given up his commitment. If he is telling the truth, then we have mentioned \n    above is the way to deal with it. If he is lying, then check on the \n    possibilities that we have mentioned, and seek the help of Allaah, asking \n    Him to guide you and help you. And do not forget to pray for your son, for \n    he is more in need of that than you.\u00a0\n\n    This is the experience of a famous Qur\u2019aan reader \u2013 Shaykh \n    Muhammad Siddeeq al-Manshaawi (d. 1388 AH). Read what his son Muhammad \n    al-Shaafa\u2019i wrote about him and the way he took care of his children and \n    taught them to memorize Qur\u2019aan.\u00a0\n\n    Professor Muhammad Husayn Ibraaheem al-Rantaawi said:\u00a0\n\n    Al-Shaafa\u2019i Muhammad Siddeeq \u2013 the name of the shaykh\u2019s son \u2013 \n    spoke of the methods of guiding and directing the children that his father \n    followed and said: My father was very keen that we should do the obligatory \n    duties, and he would often take us with him to the mosques where he read \n    Qur\u2019aan. That was an opportunity for me to visit and get to know most of the \n    mosques of Egypt. He would also keep an eye on us when we chose our friends, \n    and he would insist that they come from religiously-committed families of \n    good character, and join his children in studying, and he would help them to \n    do their homework and attend parents\u2019 meetings in the schools that his \n    children went to. During the summer holidays, he had us take part in sports \n    such as swimming and archery during the day, and at night he would read to \n    us the religious books that were suited to our age. Then when one of us had \n    acquired the habit of reading, he would supply him with books and encourage \n    him to read more. Before all of that came memorization of Qur\u2019aan, so that \n    even the one who had been left out because he was too small was encouraged \n    by his father Shaykh Siddeeq to memorize Qur\u2019aan, and he did that.

The accursed one wants to prevent people from doing good \n    whenever he finds a way to do that, and he comes to each person in the way \n    that is appropriate.\u00a0\n\n    Hence al-Fudayl ibn \u2018Iyaad (may Allaah be pleased with him) \n    said:\u00a0\n\n    Refraining from doing an action because of the people is \n    showing off, and doing it because of the people is shirk. Sincerity is when \n    Allaah protects you against both.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Adhkaar by al-Nawawi (18).\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that al-Haarith ibn Qays al-Ja\u2019fi said: If \n    you are doing something that has to do with the Hereafter then continue and \n    if you are doing something that has to do with this world then be careful. \n    If you intend to something good then do not delay it, and if the shaytaan \n    comes to you when you are praying and says \u2018You are showing off,\u2019 then make \n    it longer. Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Zuhd (430), with a saheeh \n    isnaad.\u00a0\n\n    Undoubtedly you know the status of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih \n    al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), and we think that you know \n    that he is one of the trustworthy scholars. We believe that you respect and \n    admire him, and we would never misquote the Shaykh. We will let you read \n    what he said about a problem similar to yours and we hope that you will pay \n    attention to his answer and act upon it, because that will bring you \n    happiness and goodness in this world and in the Hereafter.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) was asked:\u00a0\n\n    What is your advice to a seeker of knowledge who has worked \n    hard to correct his intention and to be sincere, but he could not manage to \n    do that? He is afraid that the ahaadeeth which carry a stern warning \n    addressed to the one whose intention is not sincerely for the sake of Allaah \n    alone will apply to him, and he will soon stop seeking knowledge. Please \n    advise us, may you be rewarded.\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\u00a0\n\n    This is an importance question for the seeker of knowledge, \n    for knowledge is one of the best and greatest acts of worship, which Allaah \n    has made equivalent to jihad for His sake, as He says, may He be blessed and \n    exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd it is not (proper) for the believers to go out to \n    fight (Jihad) all together. Of every troop of them, a party only should go \n    forth, that they (who are left behind) may get instructions in (Islamic) \n    religion, and that they may warn their people when they return to them, so \n    that they may beware (of evil)\u201d\n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:122]\n\n    Allaah tells us that the believers cannot all go out to fight \n    in jihad for the sake of Allaah; rather a few from every group should learn \n    the principles of the religion of Allaah, so that they may warn their people \n    when they return in order that they may beware (of evil), and the others \n    should fight for the sake of Allaah. \u00a0\n\n    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cWhen Allaah wills good for a person, He causes him to understand \n    the religion.\u201d If a person thinks that Allaah has caused him to understand \n    his religion, then he should accept the glad tidings that Allaah has willed \n    good for him, and he must be sincere in his intention towards Allaah when \n    seeking knowledge, by having the following intentions in his pursuit \n    thereof:\u00a0\n\n    Firstly: Obeying the command of Allaah, may He be blessed and \n    exalted, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSo know (O \n    Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) that Laa \n    ilaaha illAllaah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah\u201d [Muhammad \n    47:19]. Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: He started with \n    knowledge, before words or deeds.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0 He should intend by his learning to preserve the \n    laws of Allaah, for sharee\u2019ah is preserved in people\u2019s hearts and in books.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly: he should intend by his learning to protect the \n    sharee\u2019ah of Allaah against its enemies, because its enemies have been \n    trying to undermine it since the Messenger  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) was sent and they will carry on trying to do so until \n    the Hour begins. So by seeking knowledge let him intend to protect the great \n    sharee\u2019ah.\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly: He should intend thereby to defend sharee\u2019ah if \n    anyone attacks it, and in that case he must learn the weapons with which he \n    will defend his knowledge. Rather we say that he should focus on the issues \n    concerning which the enemies of Allaah try to cause confusion, and tackle \n    each issue in the manner that befits it. People vary with regard to this \n    matter. Some people may try to cause confusion about \u2018aqeedah, so one needs \n    to learn \u2018aqeedah by means of which he can ward off false beliefs. Some \n    people may attack Islam by means of bad manners, so he has to learn good \n    manners and learn the consequences of bad manners, and so on. \u00a0\n\n    Fifthly: The seeker of knowledge must also intend by his \n    pursuit of knowledge to worship Allaah in the manner that Allaah approves \n    of, because without learning a man cannot know how to worship Allaah whether \n    that is in his wudoo\u2019, his prayer, his charity, his fasting or his hajj. He \n    should also call others to Allaah with his knowledge, explaining sharee\u2019ah \n    to people and calling them to adhere to it.\u00a0\n\n    In fact knowledge is one of the best acts of worship and one \n    of the greatest and most beneficial. Hence you will find the that Shaytaan \n    is keep to keep people from acquiring knowledge; he will come to a person \n    and tell him that he is seeking knowledge to show off, so that the people \n    will see him and think that he is a scholar, so he will lose interest and \n    will say: I should keep away from showing off? Or he will come to him and \n    tell him: Have the intention when seeking shar\u2019i knowledge of making some \n    worldly gain, so that the warning \u201cThe one who seeks knowledge that should \n    be sought\u00a0 for the sake of Allaah, but he does it only for some worldly \n    gain, will not smell the fragrance of Paradise\u201d will apply to you. And he \n    comes to him with many things that will prevent him from seeking knowledge. \n    But one must seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed shaytaan, and go \n    ahead with his plans, and not pay any attention to these whispers that enter \n    his heart. Every time he feels that something is distracting him from \n    seeking knowledge \u2013 by whatever means \u2013 he should say, \u201cA\u2019oodhu Billaahi \n    min al-shaytaan il-rajeem (I seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed \n    satan)\u201d and \u201c Allaahumma a\u2019inni (O Allaah, help me) and so on.\u00a0\n\n    And I say to this student:\n\n    Go ahead and seek knowledge, and do not let the shaytaan \n    keep you from remembering Allaah or seeking knowledge. Carry on even though \n    you will encounter difficulty and hardship in making your intention correct, \n    but correcting one\u2019s intention is something easy. Go ahead, O young man, and \n    seek the help of Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and seek refuge \n    with Allaah from the accursed shaytaan.\u00a0 \n\n    Fataawa Noor \u2018Ala al-Darb (al\u2019Ilm), \n    quoting from the website of Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on \n    him).\u00a0\n\n    We think that there is a great deal of good in you, in sha \n    Allaah, and that the words of the imams of knowledge and faith, and the \n    advice of Shaykh al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) will all have \n    an effect on your heart, mind and life.\u00a0\n\n    You should remember that your father does not want anything \n    but good for you, and that every act of worship and obedience that you do is \n    for you and your father. \u00a0\n\n    And remember that attaining victory by the blessing of the \n    Qur'aan in the Hereafter will be shared between you and your parents, and \n    the loss caused by neglecting it will also be shared between you and them.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn \u2018Umar (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIt will be said to the companion of the Qur'aan: \n    Recite and rise in status, and recite as you used to recite in the world, \n    and your status will be at the last verse you recite.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by Abu Dawood (1464) and classed as saheeh by \n    al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Buraydah (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cWhoever reads the Qur\u2019aan and learns it and acts upon it \n    will be given a crown of light to wear on the Day of Resurrection, the light \n    of which is like the light of the sun, and his parents will be clothed with \n    two suits the equivalent of which is not to be found in this world, and they \n    will say: Why have we been clothed with this? And it will be said: Because \n    your son learned the Qur\u2019aan.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by al-Haakim (1/756); he said it is saheeh according \n    to the conditions of Muslim. Al-Albaani said It is hasan because of \n    corroborating evidence, as it says in Saheeh al-Targheeb.\u00a0\n\n    Goodness and happiness lie in obeying Allaah in this world, \n    and obeying your parents is obligatory for you. The acts of worship that you \n    do are not for any human being, rather they are for Allaah your Lord. We ask \n    Allaah to guide you and help you to do that which He loves and which pleases \n    Him.\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "He found out that his wife was having a relationship with a man, then she repented. Should he divorce her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nWe congratulate you both for repenting from the sins that you committed, which is by the grace of Allaah to you both. Allaah calls all His believing slaves to repent, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful\u201d\n[al-Noor 24:31].\u00a0\nYou should realize that Allaah rejoices at the repentance of His slave. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAllaah rejoices more over the repentance of His slave when he repents to Him than one of you who was on his mount in the wilderness, then he lost it, and his food and drink are on it, and he despairs of finding it. He goes to a tree and lies down in its shade, having lost hope of finding his mount, and whilst he is like that, there it is standing in front of him, so he takes hold of its reins and says, because of his intense joy, \u2018O Allaah, You are my slave and I am Your lord,\u2019 making this mistake because of his intense joy.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5950) and Muslim (2747). \u00a0\nYou should realize that Allaah has promised to turn bad deeds into good deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u201cExcept those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\n[al-Furqaan 25:68-70]\nBut this depends on the repentance being sincere. The conditions thereof are:\n\u00a01.Giving up the sin\n2.Regretting what one has done\n3.Resolving not to go back to it.\nSecondly:\u00a0\nUndoubtedly what your wife did is a bad thing, but now she has repented from it, so we hope that because of her repentance she will go back to the way she was before, or become even better.\nWe cannot be certain that it is better for you to stay with her, but we say to you:\u00a0\nIf you think that her repentance is sincere, and that she deeply regrets what she did, and that she has changed for the better, and her sin will not had any negative effect such as making you doubt her and hate her, then what we think is that you should keep her, so as to maintain her repentance and protect your children from being lost.\u00a0\nWe hope that her case is like this, and that you will keep her in kindness, and that what she has done will not affect you, especially since you say that you also committed sins and immoral actions before Allaah enabled you to repent. \u00a0\nUndoubtedly your falling short with regard to her rights played a major role in your wife\u2019s turning against you and falling into sin, even though it does not justify what she did. You have to watch yourself and fulfil the rights that Allaah has enjoined you to give to your wife and children.\u00a0\nOne of her rights over you is that you should help her to repent sincerely and guide her towards good and warn her against evil. It is not permissible for you to allow her to visit those who play a role in corrupting her and leading her astray, even if they are the closest of people to you. You are a shepherd and the head of your household, and Allaah will ask you about your flock and whether you neglected them or did the duties that Allaah enjoined upon you.\u00a0\nWhat we think is that you should conceal her sin and appreciate her repentance and stay with her. It is not diyaathah (cuckoldry) to keep her after she has repented, rather diyaathah is keeping her when she has not repented and is persisting in having haraam relationships, which is what we hope she has repented from sincerely.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Should he walk with his sister who makes a wanton display of her beauty (tabarruj)?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\nYou should \n    advise your sister and explain to her the rulings on hijab and that it is \n    haraam to make a wanton display of one\u2019s beauty (tabarruj). May Allaah guide \n    her and open her heart to the truth.\u00a0\nIt is important \n    to be wise and patient, and to show love, mercy and compassion towards your \n    sister when you speak to her. You should choose the most suitable ways and \n    times for that. You could also use some books and tapes that will encourage \n    her to wear hijab and will dispel her doubts.\n\u00a0As for going \n    out in the street with her when she is adorned, that is not permissible \n    except in cases of necessity, because her going out like that is an evil and \n    it is not permissible to help her in that, because Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cHelp you \n    one another in Al\u2011Birr and At\u2011Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but \n    do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, \n    Allaah is Severe in punishment\u201d\n[al-Maa\u2019idah \n    5:2]\nYou should \n    advise your parents and explain to them that it is haraam for a girl to go \n    out in the street wearing adornment openly, and that they are responsible \n    for that, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO you who \n    believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose \n    fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) \n    severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from \n    Allaah, but do that which they are commanded\u201d\n[al-Tahreem \n    66:6]\nAnd the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n\u201cEach of you is a shepherd \n    and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler of the people is a \n    shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his \n    household and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her \n    husband\u2019s house and children and is responsible for her flock. The servant \n    is the shepherd of his master\u2019s wealth and is responsible for it. And I \n    think he said: The man is the shepherd of his father\u2019s wealth and is \n    responsible for his flock. Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is \n    responsible for his flock.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari \n    (893) and Muslim (1829).\u00a0\nIt is not honouring one\u2019s \n    parents to obey them with regard to tabarruj or going out with a woman who \n    is showing her adornments openly, because there is no obedience to any \n    created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThere is no suggested \n    annual schedule for reading, rather each person should work it out according \n    to his work and free time, and the level of his comprehension, and other \n    factors. What matters is that you should organize your time and have the \n    desire to acquire and increase knowledge, as well as seeking the help of \n    some Shaykhs to determine your priorities in reading, to solve problems and \n    to explain difficult matters. \u00a0\nIf you cannot contact any \n    of the shaykhs who are qualified to teach, then you can make use of tapes \n    which explain the books of different disciplines, as well as seeking the \n    help of one of your righteous brothers with whom you can study and organize \n    regular appointments for getting together and studying which is one of the \n    greatest means of attaining blessing. \u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nReading books requires \n    awareness, insight and the ability to make good choices, as well as methods \n    that will help one to continue and succeed. With regard to this, we advise \n    you to read a book called Kayfa Taqra\u2019 Kitaaban (How to Read a Book), \n    which you will find via this link (in Arabic):\n\n\n    \n    http://audio.islamweb.net/audio/index.php?page=audioinfo&audioid=102290\nWe ask Allaah to help and \n    guide us and you.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

But having intercourse \n    should be delayed until the day of the consummation (wedding party), so as \n    to avoid any negative consequences that may result from that.\u00a0\nWith regard to engagement, \n    that comes before the marriage contract, and it does not make it permissible \n    to have intercourse, be alone with her or be intimate with her, rather when \n    the man proposes marriage it becomes permissible for him to look at the one \n    whom he wants to marry, but he is still a stranger to her like all other \n    men, until the marriage contract is done.\u00a0\nBased on this, intercourse \n    in the first case (when the marriage contract has been done) is permissible \n    and there is no sin in that. But in the second case (engagement) it is \n    zina.\u00a0\nWith regard to repairing \n    the hymen, it is not permissible in either case, because it is deceit and it \n    is a deception of the second husband as it will make him think that his wife \n    is a virgin, when in fact she is not. Having this operation also means that \n    the doctor will look at the most private part of the \u2018awrah when that is not \n    necessary.\u00a0\nIn addition to that, if the \n    hymen was torn due to zina, then the operation to repair it will be helping \n    in something haraam and making it easy.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "His mother does not like his wife and that has led to him living with her family",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not essential for you \n    to live with your family, rather it may be better for you and your wife and \n    your mother for you to live with your wife outside your parents\u2019 house. In \n    most cases the one who lives with his family \u2013 or even close to them \u2013 will \n    not have a problem-free life. Wise people who measure things against the \n    standards of sharee\u2019ah and wisdom are very few, especially among women \n    because of the jealousy and competition that exists among them.\u00a0\nYour living away from your \n    family may set things straight between your mother and your wife. Distance \n    is a bonus in many cases, so there is no need to worry. You may see \n    something as bad and feel distressed because of it, then it turns out to be \n    good. Your mother may begin to miss you and her grandchildren because of \n    your being away from her, and her feelings may change towards your wife if \n    she is out of sight and she only sees her occasionally. This is something \n    that is tried and tested.\u00a0\nBut if you want a solution \n    to the cause of the problem, which is that your mother does not like your \n    wife, you have to look for the reasons why she does not like her and find \n    out what is stopping her from liking her. These may be some of the reasons \n    why your mother does not like your wife:\u00a0\n\n    1-Mixing too much with her, which \n    leads to too much talk, and the one who talks too much makes too many slips \n    of the tongue.\u00a0 \n\n    2-Jealousy of your wife and your \n    love for her. This happens a great deal. You often see the husband\u2019s mother \n    being jealous of her son\u2019s love for his wife and his responding to her \n    wishes, and she thinks that this wife has taken her son from her.\n\n    3-Your wife\u2019s bad treatment of \n    your mother. Some wives do not treat their husbands\u2019 mothers well, so they \n    do not answer their requests or show them respect, which leads to many \n    problems between them. \n\n    4-Your falling short with regard \n    to your mother\u2019s rights and not paying attention to your wife\u2019s rights. The \n    mother cannot hate her son, rather she tries to pick on something which she \n    things is the cause of the problem, which is his wife, so she hates her.\nThese are some of the \n    reasons which may make your mother dislike your wife. If you see that all or \n    some of them are applicable in your case, then you must deal with it in a \n    wise and good manner.\u00a0\nWe advise you to take the \n    following steps to create love between your mother and your wife:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Live apart from your \n    mother, and tell your mother that you are doing this even though you don\u2019t \n    want to, for her sake, so that your mother will not put pressure on herself \n    and make herself ill.\n2 \u2013 Advise your wife to \n    send a lot of gifts to your mother, whether they are material things such as \n    clothes, food etc, or intangible gifts such as sending salaams and asking \n    after her health. \n3 \u2013 Asking wise people whom \n    your mother likes to intervene to change her mind about your wife. In this \n    case outsiders may have a greater influence on the mother than her son and \n    her husband. \u00a0\nWe should point out that as \n    you are no longer living with your mother, you should try find separate \n    accommodation for yourself that is separate from your wife\u2019s family too. \n    Perhaps your moving in with them has deepened the rift between the two \n    sides. Moreover it is not usually a good thing in establishing a marriage \n    and it may have a negative effect on the couple\u2019s life.\u00a0\nDo not forget to pray to \n    Allaah and ask Him to guide all of you to that which He loves and which \n    pleases Him, and ask Allaah to reconcile everyone and bring them together. \n    And to guide them to the best of words, deeds and attitudes.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Source of \n    strength."

        "question": "She was put under pressure and forced to steal from her maternal aunt",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    There follow three messages, addressed to you, your friend \n    and your aunt.\u00a0\n\n    The first message is addressed to you:\n\n    1.We ask Allaah to increase your \n    reward, and to relieve your distress, and to reconcile your family.\n\n    2.We hope that what happened will \n    be a lesson for you and for others, that women should not be careless about \n    their pictures or allowing themselves to have their pictures taken, even \n    with their friends, and they should not trust anyone with regard to such \n    matters, even the closest of people to them such as their sisters, for \n    example,\u00a0 because she cannot be sure that her sister\u2019s husband will not see \n    them or publish them, let alone trusting a stranger on the grounds of \n    friendship or being related.\n\n    3.You made a mistake before \n    stealing by not consulting people of knowledge and wisdom. When we read your \n    letter, we thought that it would end with your consulting them about what to \n    do with this treacherous friend, and we were shocked by the way things \n    developed and reached such an extent. Perhaps this is a lesson for everyone \n    who finds themselves in such a dilemma to look for a solution with others \n    before it gets even worse, because the more problems develop, the more \n    complicated they get, specially problems that befall women with regard to \n    evil and corrupt people. \n\n    4.What you did with regard to \n    your aunt was absolutely necessary. You told her the truth, restored her \n    rights and swore to her what the truth of the matter really was. She has to \n    believe you and overlook this matter. Remember that being truthful will save \n    a person, and Allaah will cause the truth to be known sooner or later. So be \n    patient and seek the help of Allaah, and persist in making du\u2019aa\u2019, asking \n    Allaah to grant you relief and cause justice and truth to prevail.\u00a0 \n    \n\n    5.We offer you this advice, which \n    you need to discuss with your family and with a lawyer \u2013 if possible \u2013 \n    because we do not know anything about the laws in your country: why don\u2019t \n    you tell the police about your friend who betrayed you with this picture, \n    because we think that if she is arrested and her computer is inspected, \n    Allaah will suffice you against her evil and the truth will come out in sha \n    Allaah.\n\n    The second message is addressed to your friend:\n\n    1.You have to repent to Allaah \n    and seek His forgiveness for what you have done, and you should realize that \n    you have committed many sins and caused many bad things to happen. You have \n    betrayed your friend and made false accusations against her, you have helped \n    to spread evil by means of bad pictures which you have spread after adding \n    the picture of your friend to them, you have taken money from her \n    unlawfully, and you have caused trouble for her and caused her to break \n    family ties.\n\n    2.Part of repentance is admitting \n    your error to your friend, her mother and her aunt. Allaah will not accept \n    your repentance otherwise, because one of the conditions of repentance is \n    setting right things that were affected by the sin. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cExcept those who repent and do righteous deeds, and \n    openly declare (the truth which they concealed). These, I will accept their \n    repentance. And I am the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:160]\n\n    You should understand that your admitting to what you did \n    will relieve your friend of distress, and will lift the false accusation \n    that has been made against her. Man\u2019s life is short, then he will meet his \n    Lord with his deeds, so beware of meeting your Lord with those deeds without \n    having repented sincerely from them. \n\n    3.Another part of repenting \n    properly is returning the wealth that you took unlawfully from your friend.\n\n    4.Another part of repenting \n    properly is destroying the picture completely, and not committing this sin \n    again either with your friend or with someone else.\n\n    The third message is addressed to your aunt:\n\n    1.You should understand that \n    Allaah is always watching you, He hears what you say and He knows that which \n    is hidden and that which is more secret. We do not wish anything but good \n    for you. It is to a woman like you that people would refer with regard to \n    problems, and it is to people like you that those who are astray look for \n    guidance. Your daughter and the daughters of your sisters turn to your for \n    help, because you are the source of compassion and the merciful heart that \n    they know, and our Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cThe maternal aunt is like the mother.\u201d Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari (2553).\n\n    2.We will ask you a single \n    question which we hope you will answer to yourself: What if something this \u2013 \n    Allaah forbid \u2013 had happened to one of your daughters? What if she had done \n    what your sister\u2019s daughter did? Would you like her aunt\u2019s attitude towards \n    her to be like your attitude now? We are sure \u2013 based on our good opinion of \n    you \u2013 that you would never want that. So why do you agree to that for \n    yourself? Do not think it is unlikely that bad would do things like that, \n    and do not think it is unlikely that good people may be falsely accused of \n    bad things. \n\n    We wish you and your sons and daughters well, and we hope \n    that you will have an open mind and accept the truth and realize that your \n    niece is innocent of the false accusation that her friend made against her. \n    We have advised her friend to repent and admit the truth to you. May Allaah \n    guide her to admit to you the awful thing she has done. But we also ask you \n    to think about this false accusation and understand that it is pure \n    fabrication, and your wisdom and compassion dictate that you should do the \n    right thing in this case.\n\n    3.Your Prophet Muhammad  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has enjoined something upon you \n    and we do not think that you will do anything but respond to it. This \n    command is that if someone swears to you by Allaah, you must believe him and \n    accept his oath. You have no certain knowledge that contradicts your niece\u2019s \n    oath, so you have no choice but to obey the command of your Prophet Muhammad \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\n\n    It was narrated that Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cWhoever swears by Allaah, let him fulfil his oath, and if an oath is \n    sworn for a person by Allaah, let him accept it. Whoever is not content with \n    Allaah has nothing to do with Allaah.\u201d Narrated by Ibn Maajah (2101); \n    classed as hasan by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari (11/536) and by \n    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb (2951).\u00a0\n\n    Al-Sindi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on\n    Sunan Ibn Maajah: \u201cif an oath is sworn for a person by Allaah\u201d means: \n    an oath is sworn for him by Allaah to please him. \u201cHas nothing to do with \n    Allaah\u201d means, will never be close to Him.\u00a0\n\n    The point is that that who are close to Allaah believe the \n    one who swears an oath, out of veneration towards Allaah. The one who does \n    not believe him when he is able to do so is not one of them. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan (may Allaah have mercy on \n    him) said:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the words \u201cand if an oath is sworn for a \n    person by Allaah, let him accept it. Whoever is not content with Allaah has \n    nothing to do with Allaah\u201d, if there is no way to settle the matter except \n    by asking his opponent to swear an oath and he swears an oath, then \n    undoubtedly he must accept it. But if what is happening between the people\n    is something on a personal level, where people are trying to justify \n    their positions with other and the like, then it is the right of one \n    Muslim over another that he should accept what he says when he swears an \n    oath absolving himself of blame or declaring his innocence of what he has \n    been accused of or justifying his position. Another right that he has \n    over him is that he should think well of him if there is no evidence to the \n    contrary, as in the report narrated from \u2018Umar (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him): \u201cDo not think badly of a word that is uttered by a Muslim when there \n    is a way of interpreting it positively.\u201d \u00a0\n\n    The hadeeth also points to humility, compassion, love and \n    other interests that Allaah loves, as is clear to anyone who has any \n    understanding. This is a means of uniting hearts in obedience to Allaah, and \n    it also comes under the heading of the good attitude which is the heaviest \n    thing that may be placed in a person\u2019s balance, as it says in the hadeeth, \n    and it is one of the noblest of characteristics.\u00a0\n\n    Fath al-Majeed (p. 405).\u00a0\n\n    We hope that you will think about the words of this Shaykh \n    (may Allaah have mercy on him), for they are relevant to your situation. One \n    of your niece\u2019s rights over you is that you should accept her oath, and one \n    of her rights over you is that you should think well of her.\u00a0\n\n    Do you know what \u2018Eesa (peace be upon him) did when he saw a \n    man stealing, and that man swore to him by Allaah that he did not steal? \n    Think about it:\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201c\u2018Eesa ibn Maryam saw a man stealing and \u2018Eesa said to him: \n    \u2018Did you steal?\u2019 He said: \u2018No, by the One besides Whom there is no other \n    god.\u2019 \u2018Eesa said: \u2018I believe in Allaah and I disbelieve my own eyes.\u2019\u201d \n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3260) and Muslim (2368).\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The \n    Messiah (peace be upon him), because of the great fear of Allaah in his \n    heart, thought that this person who swore by the Oneness of Allaah was \n    telling the truth, so his belief in Allaah made him believe him and make him \n    think that his eyes had deceived him, and shown him something that he did \n    not see, so he said: \u201cI believe in Allaah and I disbelieve my own eyes.\u201d \u00a0\n\n    Undoubtedly one\u2019s eyes may be mistaken and see things other \n    than they really are, and may imagine things that do not really exist, then \n    reason dictates that this is a mistake. The Messiah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) put his faith before his vision, and \n    disbelieved what his eyes had seen, and attributed the mistake to himself.\u00a0\n\n    Badaa\u2019i\u2019 al-Fawaa\u2019id (3/1159, \n    1160).\u00a0\n\n    We hope that what we have mentioned will be sufficient to \n    persuade you to accept your niece\u2019s oath and lift the accusation from her. \n    You cannot afford to go against Islamic teachings by rejecting this ruling, \n    We think that you are of a noble character, in sha Allaah. \u00a0\n\n    4.We end this message to you by \n    saying that if, Allaah forbid, your niece has committed any sin or error \u2013 \n    and we would never say that you know that from a third party but we will say \n    that you saw it yourself \u2013 then do you know what you should do? You should \n    conceal it for her! Yes, conceal her sin and do not broadcast it among \n    people. Do you know what the reward is that results from that? You will be \n    concealed by Allaah in this world and in the Hereafter.\n\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cWhoever removes a worldly hardship from a believer, Allaah \n    will remove one of the hardships of the Day of Resurrection from him. \n    Whoever grants respite to (a debtor) who is in difficulty, Allaah will grant \n    him relief in this world and in the Hereafter. Whoever conceals (the fault \n    of) a Muslim in this world, Allaah will conceal him (his faults) in this \n    world and in the Hereafter. Allaah will help a person so long as he is \n    helping his brother.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (2699).\u00a0\n\n    Think about what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said to a man who encouraged an adulterer to admit his \n    sin. He said to him: \u201cIf you had concealed him with your garment it would \n    have been better for you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by Abu Dawood (4377); classed as saheeh by \n    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb (2335).\u00a0\n\n    Think about the warning issued to the one who exposed his \n    brother\u2019s honour \u2013 which you would not do, because your niece\u2019s honour is \n    your honour, and whoever harms her (with regard to her honour) is harming \n    you too.\n\n    \u00a0It was narrated from Ibn \u2018Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u00a0\u201cWhoever conceals the fault of his Muslim brother, Allaah will conceal his \n    faults on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever exposes the fault of his Muslim \n    brother, Allaah will expose his faults even if he did that in his own \n    house.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by Ibn Maajah (2546); classed as saheeh by \n    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb (2338).\u00a0\n\n    Please excuse us for having spoken at length, which we would \n    not have but for our distress at the severing of family ties which resulted \n    from your niece\u2019s thinking well of people, and our concern about accusations \n    being made unjustly against people\u2019s honour. You did not see anything \n    yourself, and your niece did not confess to any sin, rather she swore an \n    oath to you\u00a0 and told you about her friend who caused all this trouble for \n    her. What excuse is there for anyone to accuse her or impugn her honour?\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted, to help you to \n    do all that is good and to ward off evil and its people from you, and to \n    reconcile between you, and to restore the ties between you and make them \n    stronger than they were before.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "Is it permissible to put the sperm of the husband and the egg from the wife in the womb of the second wife?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This method of fertilization, which involves placing the egg with the husband\u2019s sperm in the womb of the other wife, is a method that is not acceptable according to sharee\u2019ah, and a large number of scholars are of the view that it is haraam. Statements were issued concerning it by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League. Those who initially said that this method was permissible later retracted their view. There follows some of what was said in those statements.\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).\u00a0\nThe meeting of the Islamic Fiqh Council held on 8 \u2013 13 Safar 1407 AH (11\u201316 October 1986).\u00a0\nAfter examining the subject of artificial fertilization \u2013\u201ctest-tube babies\u201d \u2013 by studying the research presented and listening to comments of experts and doctors, and after discussion, the Council reached the following conclusions:\u00a0\nThe methods of artificial fertilization that are known nowadays are seven:\u00a0\ni.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm taken from the husband and an egg taken from a woman who is not his wife, then the embryo is implanted in his wife\u2019s uterus.\nii.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm of a man other than the husband and the wife\u2019s egg, then the embryo is implanted in the wife\u2019s uterus.\niii.Where fertilization occurs between the sperm and egg of the couple, and the embryo is implanted in the uterus of a woman who volunteers to carry it (surrogate motherhood).\niv.Where fertilization occurs outside the womb between the sperm and egg of strangers, then the embryo is implanted in the wife\u2019s uterus.\nv.Where fertilization occurs outside the womb between the sperm and egg of the couple, then the embryo is implanted in the uterus of the other wife.\nvi.Where sperm is taken from the husband and an egg is taken from the wife, and fertilization occurs outside the womb, then the embryo is implanted in the wife\u2019s uterus.\nvii.Where sperm is taken from the husband and placed in the wife\u2019s vagina or uterus so that fertilization may take place inside her body.\nIt was determined that the first five methods are all haraam according to sharee\u2019ah and are forbidden completely in and of themselves, or because of the results to which they will lead, such as mixing of lineages, loss of motherhood and other things that are forbidden according to sharee\u2019ah.\u00a0\nWith regard to the sixth and seventh methods, the committee thinks that there is nothing wrong with resorting to them in cases of need, after emphasizing that it is essential to take all necessary precautions. End quote.\u00a0\nMajallat al-Majma\u2019 (3/1/423).\u00a0\n2 \u2013Statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League:\u00a0\nand blessings and peace be upon our Master and Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.\u00a0\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council, in its eighth session held at the headquarters of the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah, from Saturday 18 Rabee\u2019 al-Aakhir until Monday 7 Jumaada al-Oola 1405 AH (19-28 January 1985), examined the remarks submitted by some of its members concerning what the Council had declared permissible \u2026 with regard to artificial fertilization and test-tube babies, which was issued in its seventh session, held between 11-16 Rabee\u2019 al-Aakhir 1404 AH, where it says:\u00a0\n\u201cThe seventh method, in which the sperm and egg are taken from the couple and, after fertilization in a laboratory vessel, the embryo is implanted in the womb of another wife of the same man, as she volunteers to carry this pregnancy of behalf of her co-wife whose womb has been removed \u2013 it seems to the committee that this is permissible in cases of need and subject to the general conditions mentioned previously.\u201d\u00a0\nThe remarks may be summed up as follows:\u00a0\nThe other wife in whose womb the embryo from the egg of the first wife is implanted may become pregnant with a second child before the embryo becomes established in her womb, as the result of relations with her husband around the time of the implanting of the embryo, then she may give birth to twins and it may not be known which child resulted from the (implanted) embryo and which resulted from relations with the husband, and it may not be known which wife is the mother of the child who resulted from the (implanted) embryo and which is the mother of the child who resulted from relations with the husband. Similarly, one of the two embryos may die at the \u2018alaqah or mudghah stage but not be expelled from the uterus until the other child is born, and it may also not be known whether he is the child that resulted from the (implanted) embryo or from relations with the husband. This means that there is confusion as to who the real mother is and there is mixing of lineages which affects a number of rulings. All of this means that the Council must retract their rulings in the case mentioned.\u00a0\nThe Council has also listened to the opinions presented by doctors and obstetricians who attended the meeting and who pointed to the possibility of the other pregnancy being miscarried as the result of marital relations with the woman who is carrying the embryo, and confusion of lineages as mentioned above.\u00a0\nAfter a discussion of the matter and an exchange of opinions, the Council decided to retract the view that the third type mentioned is permissible, and in the seventh session, 1404 AH.\u00a0\nQaraaraat al-Majma\u2019 al-Fiqhi (pp. 159-161).\u00a0\nBased on that:\u00a0\nIt is not permissible to take the husband\u2019s sperm and the wife\u2019s egg and put the mixture in the womb of another wife of the husband.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah the Almighty to make us and you steadfast in adhering to His religion, and to bless us and you with more obedience and righteousness.\u00a0\nWith regard to what you are asking about, it is better for you to stay with this girl towards whom your heart is inclined, and who feels likewise about you, and who has no faults that would cause you to leave her. All that there is, is that she needs a little care and encouragement and sound Islamic education to accept and follow the commands of Allaah.\u00a0\nA lot of that may come after marriage, especially if you treat her nicely and move her into a better environment than the one she is in, which is what we advise and encourage you to do. \u00a0\nThere is no reason why a woman who loves her religion and is obedient to her husband should not respond to the command of Allaah as regards her clothing, especially since this will make her husband love and respect her more.\u00a0\nHer refusal to wear niqaab may be because of the lies fabricated by some of those who are ignorant and who follow their own whims and desires, who say that the niqaab is a custom inherited from the Jaahiliyyah and that it was not brought by Islam. You should explain to her the ruling on a woman covering her face, with evidence from the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah, and tell her that the scholars are unanimously agreed that this ruling is prescribed in Islam.\u00a0\nRemind her of the Sahaabi women who hastened to tear their aprons so that they could cover their faces after the verse of hijab was revealed, and encourage her to have righteous friends. Tell her that this world is transient and soon each of us will meet our Lord with our deeds.\u00a0\nNeither you nor she should worry about what your families will say. As for such environments where the rulings of Islam are not known and people cannot differentiate between proper adherence to Islam and extremism no attention should be paid to them or to what they say about one who adheres to the path of righteousness.\u00a0\nIf your wife does not respond to the Islamic injunction to cover the face, then be patient with her, and try to convey the message to her in some other way, such as from another women who is involved in da\u2019wah, or by means of tapes and books by scholars whose knowledge and religious commitment can be trusted.\u00a0\nSeek the help of Allaah and persist in calling upon Him, asking Him for support and help to establish a household based on what our Lord loves and is pleased with.\u00a0\nShow her the answer to question no. 21134, which speaks of the obligation to wear niqaab according to the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah.\u00a0\nAnd please see question no. 20343 which speaks of the husband\u2019s duty to advise his wife and how he may do so.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "Their aunt wants to corrupt them; should they cut off ties with her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The command to uphold the ties of kinship is one of the first \n    commands that were revealed in Islam. It is indicated in a number of proven \n    saheeh ahaadeeth, such as the following:\u00a0\n\n    (a)\n\n    The story of how \u2018Umar ibn \u2018Absah became Muslim. He asked the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): With what were you \n    sent? He  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cHe has sent \n    me to uphold the ties of kinship, to break the idols and to proclaim the \n    Oneness of Allaah, not associating anything with Him.\u201d Narrated by Muslim \n    (832).\u00a0\n\n    (b)\n\n    The story of Abu Sufyaan and Heraclius when he sent for him \n    and said: What does he \u2013 meaning the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) \u2013 enjoin upon you? He said: He enjoins us to pray, give \n    charity, be chaste and uphold family ties.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7) and \n    Muslim (1773).\u00a0\n\n    In many verses Allaah warns us against severing the ties of \n    kinship, and states that there will be numerous punishments for the one who \n    does so, which includes incurring the curse of Allaah and a bad end. Allaah \n    says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd those who break the Covenant of Allaah, after its \n    ratification, and sever that which Allaah has commanded to be joined (i.e. \n    they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives), and \n    work mischief in the land, on them is the curse (i.e. they will be far away \n    from Allaah\u2019s Mercy), and for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e. Hell)\u201d\n\n    [al-Ra\u2019d 13:25]\n\n    Some relatives may cause the one who upholds ties with them \n    to fall into sin, especially if he is unable to change the evil that they \n    are doing.\u00a0 They may insist \u2013 for example \u2013 on listening to music and mixing \n    and indulging in swearing, mocking and backbiting. Such people have an \n    effect on their visitors and the one who seeks to uphold ties with them. The \n    Muslim has to advise his relatives as much as he is able to. They are more \n    entitled to this advice than others, but only if that will benefit them, \n    whether he is certain of that or thinks it most likely. But if he sees that \n    they are persisting in sin and especially major sins, and that is affecting \n    his faith and religious commitment, then it is sufficient for him to uphold \n    ties with them in the minimum fashion, so that he will not be severing the \n    ties of kinship. So instead of visiting them, he can just call them on the \n    phone, and if he visits them he does not have to stay for long, and so on.\u00a0 \n    \u00a0\n\n    But this should after trying his best to advise them and \n    exhort them and bring them back to the right way, as well as turning to \n    Allaah in du\u2019aa\u2019, asking Him to guide them to the straight path.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Is having false teeth fitted regarded as changing the creation of Allaah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Fitting false teeth to replace teeth that have been taken out \n    because they were unhealthy or damaged is something permissible and there is \n    nothing wrong with doing it, and we do not know of any scholar who disallows \n    it. It makes no difference whether the teeth are fixed in place in the mouth \n    or not. The patient should do what is best for him in consultation with a \n    specialist in that field.\u00a0\n\n    Changing the creation of Allaah means not accepting the \n    creation of Allaah with regard to the length or shape of the teeth or the \n    gaps between them. Hence the one who changes the creation of Allaah in \n    general is cursed, and the one who changes it with regard to his teeth in \n    particular is cursed. \u00a0\n\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThey (all those who worship others than Allaah) invoke \n    nothing but female deities besides Him (Allaah), and they invoke nothing but \n    Shaytaan (Satan), a persistent rebel!\n\n    118.\u00a0Allaah cursed him. And he [Shaytaan (Satan)] said: \u2018I \n    will take an appointed portion of your slaves.\n\n    119.\u00a0\u2018Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will \n    arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the \n    ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by \n    Allaah.\u2019 And whoever takes Shaytaan (Satan) as a Wali (protector or helper) \n    instead of Allaah, has surely, suffered a manifest loss\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:117-119]\n\n    It was narrated from \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mas\u2019ood (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cMay Allaah curse the one who does tattoos and the one who \n    has a tattoo done, the one who plucks eyebrows and the one who has her \n    eyebrows plucked, and those who file teeth for the purpose of \n    beautification, changing the creation of Allaah.\u201d Narrated by Muslim \n    (2125).\u00a0\n\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The one who does tattoos is the one who uses a needle and the \n    like on the back of the hand, wrist, temple or other place on a woman\u2019s body \n    where blood flows, then fills that place with kohl etc and it turns blue. \u00a0\n\n    \u201cThe one who plucks eyebrows\u201d is one who removes hair from \n    the face.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThose who file teeth\u201d refers to women who file the teeth to \n    create a gap between the front teeth and second incisors. This was done by \n    elderly women and those of similar age to make them look younger and to make \n    the teeth look more beautiful, because it is younger girls who have these \n    nice gaps between their teeth. When a woman grows older her teeth become \n    bigger, so they used to file them to make them look nicer and to make people \n    think they were younger. This action is haraam for the one who does it and \n    the one to whom it is done, because of these ahaadeeth, and because it is \n    changing the creation of Allaah, and because it is cheating and deceiving \n    people.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThose who file teeth for the purpose of beautification\u201d \u2013 \n    this indicates that what is haraam is that which is done for the purpose of \n    beautification. But if it is needed for medical reasons or to correct a \n    fault in the tooth and so on, then there is nothing wrong with it.\u00a0\n\n    Sharh Muslim (14/106, 107).\u00a0\n\n    The words of al-Nawawi point to the difference between \n    treating the teeth in order to remove a fault in them and not being pleased \n    with the creation of Allaah and tinkering with it for the purpose of \n    beautification. The former is permissible and the latter is haraam.\u00a0\n\n    There is evidence in the Sunnah which shows that it is \n    permissible to wear false teeth if the teeth have fallen out due to old age \n    or sickness, and it is permissible for them to be made of gold if nothing \n    else can be used.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated from \u2018Arfajah\u00a0 ibn As\u2019ad that his nose was \n    cut off at the battle of Kilaab during the Jaahiliyyah, and he wore a nose \n    of silver, but it caused a foul stench, so the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him to wear a nose made of gold. \u00a0\n\n    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1770), Abu Dawood (4232) and \n    al-Nasaa\u2019i (5161). Classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Irwa\u2019 \n    al-Ghaleel (824).\u00a0\n\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee said:\u00a0\n\n    But in cases of necessity it is permissible to use gold for \n    teeth, noses and the like, if nothing else can be used instead. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Fataawa Islamiyyah (4/248).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\n    We should note that it is not permissible to have a gold \n    tooth except when there is a need for that. It is not permissible for anyone \n    to have a gold tooth put in for the purpose of adornment, except women for \n    whom is it customary to have gold teeth, in which case there is nothing \n    wrong with it. But for men it is not permissible at all except in cases of \n    necessity. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Liqaa\u2019aat al-Baab il-Maftooh \n    (28/question no. 5).\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "She faced social pressures that made her stop praying and take off hijab",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    We understand the extent of the problem that you are \n    suffering and the extent of the pressure you are facing to give up your \n    religion and your commitment. This problem is not yours alone, rather it is \n    a problem faced by thousands of Muslims who want to adhere to the teachings \n    of this great religion, and want to live a moral life of honour and \n    chastity, but they face many problems in their societies that, \n    unfortunately, have deviated from Islam to a large extent and now look down \n    upon and scorn those who adhere to Islam, and governments that cause trouble \n    for those who are committed to Islam. Everyone knows what is going on in \n    your country, the war against Islam and those who are committed to it. We \n    ask Allaah to foil their plots and support His religion and His believing \n    slaves.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThe reward of Allaah is precious, the reward of Allaah is \n    Paradise.\u201d Thus said the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him), and undoubtedly the precious reward needs a high price, and there \n    is nothing more precious than Paradise. Hence the Muslim must accept that \n    whatever difficulties he faces on his way to Paradise, they are to be \n    expected, and in fact, no matter how hard it is, they pale into \n    insignificance when compared with the delights that await him in Paradise.\u00a0\n\n    This is what makes it easy for the Muslim to bear the \n    calamities of this world and the difficulties that he faces on his path \n    towards Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    has told us that the most destitute of the people in this world, of those \n    who will enter Paradise, will be brought and dipped once in Paradise, and it \n    will be said to him: O son of Adam, did you ever see anything bad? Did you \n    ever experience any hardship? He will say: No, by Allaah, O Lord. I never \n    saw anything bad and I never experienced any hardship.\u201d. Narrated by Muslim \n    (2807).\u00a0\n\n    The mind can imagine the state of this person, \u201cthe most \n    destitute of the people in this world,\u201d and imagine the worst of situations \n    and trials, but one dip in Paradise will make him forget all that.\n\n    \u00a0And the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) has told us about the days of patience, and that the one who \n    adheres to his religion at that time will be like the one who takes hold of \n    a burning ember. Perhaps the current time is what the Messenger  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) meant, so we have no choice but to be \n    patient and put up with hardships and even confront them, otherwise we may \n    lose out in this world and in the Hereafter:\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBy Al\u2011\u2018Asr (the time).\n\n    2.\u00a0Verily, man is in loss,\n\n    3.\u00a0Except those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do \n    righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one \n    another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al\u2011Ma\u2018roof) which Allaah has \n    ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al\u2011Munkar) \n    which Allaah has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the \n    sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allaah\u2019s Cause \n    during preaching His religion of Islamic Monotheism or Jihad)\u201d\n\n    [al-\u2018Asr 103]\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the social and political pressures that you \n    are facing \u2013 and we understand how hard it is \u2013 we offer the following \n    advice to you and to everyone who is facing a similar problem, whilst noting \n    that under such pressures a Muslim may face severe difficulty in adhering to \n    the rulings of Islam, so there may be no choice but to compromise and be \n    content with partial commitment for fear of giving up commitment altogether. \n    But that is subject to the condition that the Muslim always seeks that which \n    is better and strives hard to overcome these difficulties and gradually seek \n    to attain full commitment.\u00a0\n\n    So this compromise is a temporary stage, it is not \n    permanent.\u00a0\n\n    Whatever a Muslim cannot do in full today because of the \n    pressures he is facing, let him do whatever he can of it \u2013 even if there are \n    shortcomings \u2013 until he gradually reaches a stage of full commitment and the \n    society may accept his transformation from one stage to another, because \n    that is easier than going through confrontations and problems.\u00a0\n\n    There follows some advice, and we apologize for making it too \n    long, but the matter is serious and of the utmost importance, and affects \n    thousands and thousands of Muslims as we have said, so one or two words are \n    not enough.\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 \u201cLaa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (there is \n    no power and no strength except with Allaah)\u201d\u00a0\n\n    This is a beautiful phrase, and it is one of the treasures of \n    Paradise. We have no power to change from one state to another, from \n    disobedience to obedience, from imperfection to perfection, except with the \n    help and guidance of Allaah. \u00a0\n\n    So it is essential to seek the help of Allaah first and last. \n    In Soorat al-Faatihah which the Muslim recites several times each day, it \n    says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cYou (Alone) we worship, and You \n    (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)\u201d [al-Faatihah 1:5].\u00a0 \n    We cannot worship Allaah unless Allaah enables us and helps us to do that. \n    Among the du\u2019aa\u2019 of the people of Paradise are the words (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \u201cAll the praises and thanks be to \n    Allaah, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, \n    were it not that Allaah had guided us\u201d [al-A\u2019raaf 7:43]. \n    And among the du\u2019aa\u2019 of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) were the words: \u201cDo not leave me to myself even for the \n    blink of an eye.\u201d Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (226).\u00a0\n\n    So it is essential to seek the help of Allaah, rely on Him \n    and be aware that all things are in His hand, and with the word \u201cKun \n    (Be!)\u201d He does whatever He wills.\u00a0\n\n    So seek the help of Allaah and delegate your affairs to Him, \n    and trust that Allaah will grant you a way out: \u201cAnd whosoever puts his \n    trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him\u201d [al-Talaaq 65:3]. \u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 Constant du\u2019aa\u2019\u00a0\n\n    Say du\u2019aa\u2019 a great deal, asking Allaah to make things easier \n    for you, to help you to do all that is good, to guide and to keep evil and \n    its people away from you. \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) used to say: \u201cI am not worried whether Allaah will respond, but I am \n    worried about whether I will be able to make du\u2019aa\u2019, because if I am helped \n    to du\u2019aa\u2019, then the response will come with it.\u201d Du\u2019aa\u2019 relieves distress \n    and takes away worry. \u00a0\n\n    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cThere is no Muslim who says a du\u2019aa\u2019 in which there is no sin or \n    severing of family ties, but Allaah will give him one of three things: \n    either He will hasten to answer his prayer, or He will store it up for him \n    in the Hereafter, or He will divert an equivalent evil from him.\u201d They said: \n    Then we will say a lot of du\u2019aa\u2019! He said: \u201cAllaah can give more than that.\u201d \n    Narrated by Ahmad (10794), classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh \n    al-Targheeb (1633). The one who says du\u2019aa\u2019 is always in a good state, \n    no matter how much du\u2019aa\u2019 he says, for Allaah is greater in goodness, \n    blessing and grace.\u00a0\n\n    3 \u2013 Worship, especially prayer\u00a0\n\n    You have to pay attention to acts of worship, for they will \n    revive the heart and alert the one who is negligent, and they are among the \n    most important factors of steadfastness and the best help in achieving one\u2019s \n    goals, after the help of Allaah, may He be exalted.\u00a0\n\n    The greatest act of worship is prayer, for it is the main \n    foundation of faith after the shahaadatayn and it is the foundation of \n    Islam. The heart has no life without prayer. It brings relief from all \n    worries and hardships. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) used to say to Bilaal: \u201cLet us find rest in it (the prayer), O \n    Bilaal.\u201d Saheeh Abi Dawood (4985). So pray, and focus with proper \n    humility, and ponder, and weep, and relieve yourself of the worries and \n    stress of this world.\u00a0\n\n    4 \u2013Reading the Holy Qur\u2019aan\u00a0\n\n    Read the Holy Qur\u2019aan regularly, and have a portion of it \n    that you read every day, and do not neglect it. You should also have a brief \n    Tafseer (commentary) that will help you to understand and ponder the \n    meanings of the verses, such as Tafseer al-Sa\u2019di or Aysar \n    al-Tafaaseer by Shaykh Abu Bakr al-Jazaa\u2019iri.\u00a0\n\n    There is nothing greater than the words of Allaah, and there \n    is no exhortation more eloquent than the exhortation of Allaah. There is no \n    book that can offer guidance or relief from worry like the Qur\u2019aan.\u00a0\n\n    5 \u2013 Adhkaar and du\u2019aa\u2019s\u00a0\n\n    Always recite the adhkaar that are narrated from the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at various times and on \n    various occasions, such as the adhkaar for morning and evening, when going \n    to sleep and when waking up, when eating and drinking, when going out of the \n    house and when coming in, and in all situations. Be certain of the \n    importance of understanding their meanings. Among the useful books on this \n    topic are: al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah bi Sharh al-Adhkaar al-Nawawiyyah \n    by Ibn \u2018Allaan. This is a valuable book from which you can learn the \n    meanings of the adkhaar, so that hearts may be revived and become connected \n    to the Knower of the Unseen.\u00a0\n\n    6 \u2013 Listening to useful lectures and khutbahs\u00a0\n\n    Continue to listen to useful lectures and khutbahs, for you \n    always need someone to remind you, guide you and advise you. From lectures \n    etc you can learn a great deal about the rulings of Islam and how to behave \n    at times of crisis.\u00a0\n\n    7 \u2013 It is essential to read and learn.\u00a0\n\n    It is essential for you to learn, read and educate yourself \n    in Islamic matters, for \u201cwhomever Allaah wills good to, He causes him to \n    understand Islam\u201d, as was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. So it is \n    essential to know and understand the rulings of Islam. In many cases where \n    things seem difficult and complicated, if a person learned the rulings or \n    asked the scholars, he would find it easy and not complicated. There may be \n    a concession of which he is not aware, or there may be an alternative in \n    sharee\u2019ah that would make it easier for him. Among the useful books that we \n    advise you to read is Fiqh al-Sunnah by Shaykh Sayyid al-Saabiq [this \n    is available in English translation under the title Fiqh us-Sunnah, \n    published in 5 volumes by American Trust Publications,\u00a0 Plainfield, IN]; \n    al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan; \u2018Awdat al-Hijaab \n    by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ismaa\u2019eel. You can also learn from useful Islamic \n    websites.\u00a0\n\n    You should also read modern history, especially that of your \n    own country, and how Islam has been fought, and what their plots were, for \n    if the Muslim understands that, it will inspire him to face the challenge \n    and make him adhere to Islam even more.\u00a0\n\n    8 \u2013 With regard to marriage\u00a0\n\n    It is undoubtedly very important, and will bring many \n    benefits in your case, such as:\u00a0\n\n    (a)\u00a0\u00a0\n    Psychological stability, peace \n    of mind and tranquillity.\n\n    (b)\u00a0\n    By Allaah\u2019s leave, it will be a \n    means of reducing the social and family pressures on you, because you will \n    be able to move to a new home, away from your family and neighbours and the \n    society which is placing many restrictions on you that you cannot overcome.\n\n    (c)\u00a0\n    You will be able to raise \n    righteous offspring in an atmosphere of chastity, trust, modesty and \n    adherence to this religion, the upbringing that many of us have missed out \n    on, unfortunately.\u00a0\n\n    A person can do with his children that which he wishes that \n    his parents had done with him. Raising righteous offspring is one of the \n    most important benefits of marriage. The ummah is waiting for you and others \n    like you who love this religion and want to adhere to it. They are waiting \n    for righteous, believing offspring from you, through whom Allaah will \n    benefit the ummah and change it for the better.\u00a0\n\n    There are many other benefits that you will attain through \n    marriage, hence we emphasize the importance of this issue. Based on the \n    circumstances that you are suffering, the advice which we have to offer you \n    is: if there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character \n    you are pleased, do not hesitate to accept, and if there is no such person \n    then be content with one who is \u201csemi-committed\u201d, for if we cannot find that \n    which is perfect we must be content with the best that is available, even if \n    it is not perfect. This advice is just for you, based on your particular \n    situation.\u00a0\n\n    We do not mean by this that you should be content with an \n    evildoer or one who drinks alcohol, not at all. Rather what we mean is one \n    who is righteous in general terms, who prays regularly and loves Islam in \n    general, one who is of good character and chivalrous, who feels protective \n    jealousy with regard to matters of honour, even if he has some other \n    faults.\u00a0\n\n    You could encourage him to improve, by means of your \n    personality, your powers of persuasion and your wisdom in dealing with him, \n    after Allaah guides you and him.\u00a0\n\n    We do not agree that your going to websites is the last hope \n    for you, rather hope never ceases. The Muslim always has hope and expects \n    good from his Lord, and he thinks positively of his Lord Who says in the \n    hadeeth qudsi: \u201cI am as My slave thinks I am.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari and \n    Muslim.\u00a0\n\n    9 \u2013 With regard to the problem of hijab and your not being \n    able to wear it\u00a0\n\n    Once again, we state that we understand the extent of the war \n    that you are facing in your country because of hijab, hence we think that \n    there is no reason why \u2013 given your particular circumstances \u2013 you should \n    not take a gradual approach to wearing hijab. What your parents and society \n    may not accept today, they may accept gradually after a month or two, or a \n    year.\u00a0\n\n    You have to dress as modestly as possible, and try hard to \n    cover your head. Wear clothes that are loose, then when the people get used \n    to your dressing modestly, you can take another step forward, until you are \n    wearing full hijab as Allaah has enjoined upon the believing women and as \n    you yourself want and enjoyed wearing in the land of the two sacred mosques \n    during your visit.\u00a0\n\n    But do not be too hasty. Take it slowly, and you will attain \n    what you want, in sha Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    This is not the best way that the Muslim should follow, but \n    it is acceptable in cases of necessity and in the particular circumstances \n    that you are in. Attaining part of a thing is better than nothing, and \n    reaching perfection slowly is better than losing everything. \u00a0\n\n    10 \u2013With regard to prayer\u00a0\n\n    Prayer is the greatest of the pillars of Islam after the \n    Shahaadatayn. It is the connection between a person and his Lord, so you \n    should pay a great deal of attention to it and it is essential to offer \n    prayers regularly, at the proper times.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cVerily, As\u2011Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the \n    believers at fixed hours\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:10]\u00a0\n\n    We do not think there is any problem with regard to Fajr and \n    \u2018Isha\u2019, or with Maghrib during the summer, when the time for Maghrib begins \n    an hour or two after you come back from work.\u00a0\n\n    Based on that, there is no excuse for delaying these prayers \n    beyond the proper time, so strive hard to offer these prayers at the time \n    decreed for them in sharee\u2019ah. \u00a0\n\n    That leaves Zuhr and \u2018Asr, and also Maghrib during the \n    winter.\u00a0\n\n    The basic principle \u2013 as stated above \u2013 is that you should \n    offer each of them at the proper time, so look for a time when the place for \n    doing wudoo\u2019 is free of men. If that is not possible, there is nothing wrong \n    with entering the washroom and doing wudoo\u2019 in there, and wudoo\u2019 done there \n    will be valid. In most cases its floor \u2013 even if it is wet \u2013 will be taahir \n    (pure) and the water that is on it will be taahir, so there is nothing wrong \n    with doing wudoo\u2019 in there.\u00a0\n\n    When praying, a woman is required to cover all of her body \n    except her face and hands. If you cannot wear clothes like that for the time \n    being, then keep a hijab or other garment for prayer in your office, that \n    you can wear at the time of prayer.\u00a0\n\n    There is no special place where prayers must be performed, \n    rather prayers may be offered anywhere, so you can wait for a chance when \n    you are alone in your office, and then pray.\u00a0\n\n    If it is too difficult and you cannot offer every prayer on \n    time, then we hope that you will have a concession allowing you to join Zuhr \n    and \u2018Asr, so you can delay Zuhr until the time of \u2018Asr and pray them \n    together, but that is subject to the condition that it is done before the \n    time for \u2018Asr ends, and that is half an hour or forty-five minutes before \n    sunset. If that is not possible, then you have a concession allowing prayer \n    until sunset, but there is no excuse for delaying \u2018Asr until after sunset.\n\n    With regard to Maghrib in the winter, if you can do it at \n    work then this is what you must do, and if that is not possible then you may \n    delay it and join it with \u2018Isha\u2019 at the time of the latter, and you can pray \n    Maghrib and \u2018Isha\u2019 together when you go back home.\u00a0\n\n    Remember that if you do that, you are not delaying the prayer \n    beyond its proper time, because joining Zuhr and \u2018Asr, and Maghrib and \n    \u2018Isha\u2019, is permissible in cases of necessity and in order to ward off \n    hardship, whether one is travelling or not, unlike shortening the prayers, \n    which is not permitted except when travelling.\u00a0\n\n    But you must try hard to offer every prayer at the proper \n    time, and the Muslim should always be able to find a way. A senior military \n    figure was unable to ask for permission to pray, lest he be accused of \n    fundamentalism or terrorism and be put under watch, so he used to ask \n    permission to go to the bathroom, where he would do wudoo\u2019 then go and pray, \n    and come back.\u00a0\n\n    We do not think that you are incapable of coming up with some \n    way and finding an opportunity to offer every prayer on time. If you cannot, \n    then join Zuhr and \u2018Asr as described above.\u00a0\n\n    Finally, we would draw your attention to the fact that many \n    of the problems that you are facing at work, such as delaying the prayers \n    and not being able to wear hijab, are due to your working in a place where \n    you mix with men.\u00a0\n\n    A woman\u2019s working in a place where she mixes with men, with \n    no shar\u2019i guidelines, leads to many negative consequences, as is obvious to \n    you. Hence the wisdom of Islam dictates that this is haraam. If you can move \n    to another department or another job where there are no men, this will solve \n    your problems at work to a great extent, or you can choose to stop working \n    altogether, unless you are facing pressure from your family to carry on \n    working, in which case we hope that you have a concession to allow you to \n    continue, whilst trying to avoid the bad things as much as possible.\u00a0\n\n    Finally, we will be happy to keep in ouch with you and offer \n    advice, and\u00a0 we will be even happier to hear that you have acted upon this \n    advice and that you have taken steps in the right direction.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to make you steadfast and to help you to do all \n    that is good, and to divert all evil away from you, and to bless you with \n    righteous offspring.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah is the source of strength and the Guide to the \n    right path.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "She is travelling far away and fears fitnah (temptation) for herself",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to relieve your distress and worry and to protect you from falling into the way that leads to doom and destruction and slipping into sin, for He is able to do whatever He wills.\u00a0\nListen to this divine call (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSay: O \u2018Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\u00a0[al-Zumar 39:53]\u00a0\nListen to the call of Allah to His believing slaves (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)\u201d\u00a0[al-Tahreem 66:8]\u00a0\nAllah accepts the repentance of His slaves, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do\u201d\u00a0[al-Shoora 42:25]\u00a0\nWhat is it that made you leave your family and travel to a kaafir land and live there? No one can trust himself even in a Muslim country because there are so many doubts and whims and desires!\u00a0\nSo how about in a land where anything goes, and where the doors to sin are open wide?\u00a0\nBecause of that, and because of his keenness to protect his ummah from falling into the like of that which you have fallen into \u2013 we ask Allah to keep you safe \u2013 the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade living among the kuffaar and settling in their lands. He said: \u201cI disavow myself of any Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood (2645) and al-Tirmidhi (1604); classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Irwa\u2019 al-Ghaleel (1207). \u00a0\nSettling in a kaafir country is unhealthy and hard, a life of anxiety and stress. Their life \u2013 I mean the people of that land \u2013 is an unbearable hell, by their own admission, because they have lost spiritual discipline and the connection with God; their life has become purely materialistic. Mental illness has become widespread among them, and they have resorted, in many cases, to exiting from this life by means of suicide.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nOur advice to you is to look for the reasons why your family took this attitude towards you and refused everyone who came to propose marriage to you. Try to find out what it is and try to do something about it, so that you will be able to resolve the matter and come up with an appropriate solution so that you will be able to reconcile with your family. \u00a0\nIf that is not possible and things remain as they are, and you find out that the reasons that have come between you and your family are not legitimate, then in that case your guardian is the ruler or the shar\u2019i qaadi (judge). Since you are living in a country where there is no Islamic legal system and it is not a Muslim country, there is nothing wrong with the director of one of the Islamic centres or the imam of one of the mosques acting as your wali. See the answer to question no. 7989. \u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nIf you feel that you have sinned because of what you have done in the past, and have turned back to Allah and repented sincerely, meaning that you regret what you did and resolve not to go back to it, and give up the sin, and ask for forgiveness, and do a lot of good deeds, that will make up for what you did and will purify you. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cBut whosoever repents after his crime and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allah), then verily, Allah will pardon him (accept his repentance). Verily, Allah is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\u00a0[al-Maa'idah 5:39]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)\u201d\u00a0[Ta-Ha 20:82]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allah with true repentance\u201d\u00a0[al-Furqaan 25:71]\u00a0\nWhoever turns away from sin and turns to his Lord and submits to Him, Allah will accept his repentance and make the consequences good, and He will make him one of those who inherit Paradise. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThen, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As\u2011Sal\u00e2t (the prayers) [i.e. made their Sal\u00e2t (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell.\n60.\u00a0Except those who repent and believe (in the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and work righteousness. Such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged in aught\u201d\n[Maryam 19:59-60]\u00a0\nRepentance opens a new door from which he may start a new life, filled with faith, ihsaan and hope.\u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe one who repents is like one who did not sin.\u201d Narrated by Ibn Maajah (4250); classed as hasan by al-Albani.\u00a0\nI advise you not to tell him about that, because after repenting it is as if it never happened. Start a new life with him, filled with hope, love and happiness, and surrounded with worship, piety and righteousness, following true guidance. Our advice to you is to hasten to marry this young man, because his getting in touch with you and forming a relationship before marriage is haram, and may open the door to temptation. We ask Allah to protect us from slipping.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Problems Between Spouses Due to Children\u2019s Poor Performance at School",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Raising the children is a responsibility that is shared \n    between both parent. If there is a conflict or shortcoming in their \n    upbringing, that has a bad effect on the children, who will develop a bad \n    attitude and will be lost. Hence it is obligatory for the parents to raise \n    their children well and not to have any conflicts or shortcomings, \n    especially in front of the children. They should agree on the Islamic \n    educational means they will use to deal with their children\u2019s mistakes. If \n    one parents thinks that there should be consequences for wrongdoing, but the \n    other disagrees and thinks that they should be easy-going, they should \n    discuss it and come to some agreement, so that the child will realize that \n    they have agreed to be easy-going because of the intercession of one parent, \n    so that he will have another chance to set himself straight. But if one of \n    them objects to the other in front of the child and speaks harshly and with \n    bad manners, this is wrong and will have a bad effect on the children. \u00a0\n\n    The fact that the responsibility in raising children is \n    shared between the father and mother is indicated by the following:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cO you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families \n    against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are \n    (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the \n    Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded\u201d\n\n    [al-Tahreem 66:6]\n\n    2 \u2013 It was narrated that \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn \u2018Umar (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: \u201cEach of you is a shepherd and each of \n    you is responsible for his flock. The ruler of the people is a shepherd and \n    is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his household and is \n    responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband\u2019s house \n    and children and is responsible for her flock. The slave is the shepherd of \n    his master\u2019s wealth and is responsible for it. Each of you is a shepherd and \n    each of you is responsible for his flock.\u201d \u00a0\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (853) and Muslim (1829).\u00a0\n\n    See also the answer to question no. \n    10016 for more \n    information.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    The father\u2019s responsibility for raising his child should be \n    his first priority. The man has wisdom, experience and strength and he can \n    speak with others to find the best means to raise his child. The salaf \n    (early generations of Islam) were very keen to be directly involved in \n    raising and disciplining their children. It is narrated that the \u2018Abbaasi \n    caliph al-Mansoor sent word to those of Banu Umayyah who were in prison to \n    ask them: What is the hardest thing for you in this prison? They said: What \n    we have missed out on of raising our children.\u00a0\n\n    Some fathers think that raising their children and fulfilling \n    this trust is achieved by giving them food, drink, clothing and shelter, but \n    this is a false notion that is far removed from the laws of Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\n    Treating daughters and the like kindly means giving them an \n    Islamic education, teaching them and raising them to follow the truth, \n    striving to keep them chaste and keeping them away from that which Allaah \n    has forbidden of wanton display and the like,\u00a0 as also applies to raising \n    sisters and male children, and other kinds of kind treatment, so that \n    everyone will be raised to be obedient to Allaah and His Messenger and to \n    keep away from that which Allaah has forbidden, and to do their duty towards \n    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. Hence it is known that what is \n    meant by kind treatment is not just providing food, drink and clothing, \n    rather the meaning is more general than that and includes treating them \n    kindly in both religious and worldly terms.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 Fataawa wa Maqaalaat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz \n    (4/377)\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    The most important thing on which you should focus is \n    teaching your children sound Islamic belief (\u2018aqeedah), the rulings of \n    sharee\u2019ah and good morals. This is more important than anything else, but it \n    does not mean that they should not study other worldly sciences, so long \n    as the study environment is acceptable and there is no mixing with girls or \n    studying in Christian missionary schools or studying kaafir (non-Muslim)or corrupt \n    material.\u00a0\n\n    In Fatwa no. 4172, issued on 4/12/1401 AH by the Standing \n    Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas in the Kingdom of Saudi \n    Arabia, it says:\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly: All Muslims must pay attention to teaching \n    children, both male and female, true Islam with its beliefs, rulings, morals \n    and etiquette. It is not permissible for educational programs to be devoid of that or to mix\u00a0 Islamic teachings with any other false beliefs, views or \n    opinions.\u00a0\n\n    Fifthly: Every Muslim should realize that Allaah has \n    appointed him as a shepherd and that Allaah will ask him about this trust \n    that He has given to him. If he has fulfilled it in the best possible way \n    and has been sincere, then praise be to Allaah, but if it is otherwise then \n    he has no one to blame but himself. Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0 \u201cO you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families \n    against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones\u201d [al-Tahreem 966:6]. \n    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cEach \n    of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.\u201d And he \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said: \u201cThere is no one \n    whom Allaah appoints in charge of a flock and he dies being insincere \n    towards his flock, but Allaah will forbid paradise to him.\u201d End quote.\u00a0\n\n    This responsibility should be shared with regard to teaching \n    and guiding, each according to his abilities, and Allaah does not burden any \n    soul beyond its scope. It is not permissible for the father to throw the \n    burden of teaching the child on the mother\u2019s shoulders and then become a \n    mere spectator or become heedless about his child\u2019s upbringing nor is it \n    permissible for the mother to do the same thing. It is a shared \n    responsibility to discipline and teach the child. If the father is working \n    hard and the mother has no other job, then her share of the burden will be \n    heavier, and vice versa. They should consult one another and discuss matters \n    so that the mission will be fulfilled in the best possible way, but the \n    basic principle with regard to discipline is that the one who is in charge \n    and bears most responsibility is the father, not the mother.\n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Sons and daughters have a shepherd to take care of them, when \n    they are small, and the one who takes care of them and directs their affairs \n    is their father or older brother. \u201cThe man is the shepherd of his household \n    and is responsible for his flock.\u201d Guardians and shepherds of households \n    must direct their families to worship Allaah and to be keen to seek \n    knowledge. They should encourage their children and say, \u201cCome, my son, what have you memorized (of Qur\u2019aan) today? Recite to me what you have \n    memorized,\u201d so that he will be encouraged and he will know that there is \n    someone following up on him. The same may be said of daughters: encourage \n    them and teach them to seek knowledge and act upon it. Be approachable, do \n    not be like some fathers who are like planks of wood in their houses, they \n    do not do anything. Each man is responsible for his family and flock.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Liqa\u2019 al-Shahri (67).\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    We advise our sister not to go out of her house except with \n    the permission and approval of her husband, not even to learn or teach \n    Qur\u2019aan, because obedience to one's husband is obligatory and going out of \n    the house without one\u2019s husband\u2019s permission is haram (impermissible). Putting pressure on \n    him to make him let her go out is also not permissible. Do not open a door \n    to evil by going out in this way. You can divide your time between teaching \n    your son and learning yourself. Then convince your husband of this division \n    of time. We think that he will appreciate this move on your part and it will \n    be a means of working out both issues.\u00a0\n\n    You should note that your husband is not sinning by preventing you from going out to halaqahs (circles of learning)for memorizing Qur\u2019aan. It is a sin only if he prevents you from going out to pray in the mosque or to learn essential knowledge that you cannot learn at home. Allaah has made it easy for people to learn, a woman can read books or listen to tapes on all kinds of knowledge. There is nothing to prevent her from benefiting from modern means of learning. She will never get more by going out than she will get in \n    her house, if she wants that. You could also hold a halaqah for sisters to \n    memorize Qur\u2019aan and seek knowledge in your own house, with no need to go \n    out.\u00a0\n\n    Whatever the case, do whatever you can to help take care of \n    your son and teach him, treat your husband kindly and do what Allaah has \n    enjoined upon you towards him, and you will see that bear fruits for \n    yourself, your husband and your children, in sha Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    Fifthly:\u00a0\n\n    Our advice to the husband is also to treat his wife kindly. \n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe best \n    of you is the best of you to his wife.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3895); \n    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Saheehah \n    (385).\u00a0\n\n    If he thinks that her going out to the daar al-tahfeez is \n    beneficial for her, and this benefit extends to her children and to the \n    household as a whole, then why would he deprive her of that goodness? It is \n    also affecting the relationship between him and her because she thinks that \n    he is denying her something that would be beneficial for her. The life \n    between them should be based on mutual understanding and shared \n    responsibility, and keenness on the part of both for that which benefits the \n    other.\u00a0\n\n    You (the husband) should understand that your trying to make \n    your wife happy and helping her in something that does not constitute \n    disobedience towards Allaah will bring benefits to you and your children \n    too. We ask Allaah to join you together in goodness and to help you both to \n    do that which will benefit you in this world and in the Hereafter.\u00a0\n\n    Sixthly:\u00a0\n\n    There follow some comments by experts in the field explaining \n    the shared role of the father and mother in raising and teaching children: a \n    mother said, objecting: why does the husband accuse his wife of falling \n    short and neglect if the son does not achieve high grades, when he himself \n    is forgetting his duties that are essential with regard to this matter?\u00a0\n\n    Dr. Muhammad Abu Daff, a professor of education in the \n    Islamic University of Gaza said: \u00a0\n\n    Both the father and the mother have to cooperate with regard \n    to this matter. The father should make up for the shortcomings that the \n    mother cannot because she is too busy or because she does not have \n    sufficient knowledge of that particular subject.\u00a0\n\n    Dr. Abu Daff emphasized the importance of fathers playing an \n    effective role in following up on their children\u2019s studies so that they will \n    feel that it is important.\u00a0\n\n    He attributed the reason why fathers try to evade \n    responsibility to some negative ideas in their mind which says that the \n    educational role is part of the mother\u2019s job like any other job within the \n    home, and he continued: This is a grievous error, because this educational \n    responsibility needs the cooperation of both spouses. The father has to \n    understand that his role is not only outside the house in order to provide \n    food and the necessities of life, rather he has an important role to play in \n    the house as well, which includes teaching the children. It is not to be \n    taken lightly.\u00a0\n\n    And he urged fathers to understand this point and to realize their responsibilities in this area so as to avoid conflicts that may have a bad effect on the family and the children.\u00a0\n\n    Professor Usaamah al-Muzayni, a lecturer in the College of \n    Education in the Islamic University, said: The father has to follow up on \n    his children\u2019s studies and make it an important priority.\u00a0\n\n    He also said: Your wife is your life partner, and by taking \n    the responsibility of teaching the children and following up on their schoolwork, you will have fulfilled your role in their shared \n    responsibility. Otherwise ask yourself: What is my role? Remember that there is something more important that just providing material comforts to children, and that is to take an interest in their academic future. \u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "She is sharp-tongued towards her husband and she is complaining that he is keeping away from her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    A common mistake is for each spouse to tell the other \n    everything about their previous lives before marriage, on the grounds that \n    they should not leave anything of their past lives untold to their new loves \n    and should be completely frank and open, so their relationship will have a \n    strong foundation with nothing to affect it.\u00a0\n\n    Real life has shown this idea to be a failure, because in \n    most cases the spouses cannot stand this. If they put up with it at the \n    beginning when the intensity of new love prevents an immediate reaction, \n    then when love cools down things that were hidden begin to appear and affect \n    their lives and make things difficult for them. Then problems begin to \n    appear and the flames of jealousy begin to burn and the relationship begins \n    to break down. \u00a0\n\n    Whatever happened before you got married is over and belongs \n    in the past, and no one among people should know of it no matter what his \n    status or how close he is to you. If it was a sin and you have repented with \n    all the conditions of repentance, it is between you and Allaah, may He be \n    glorified and exalted, because repentance is what erases whatever sins come \n    before it, not telling the husband.\u00a0\n\n    One of the conditions of repentance is regretting what has \n    happened, giving up the sin and resolving not to go back to it. And you \n    should also do a lot of good deeds and pray for forgiveness, to make up for \n    what you have missed.\u00a0\n\n    And the believer is enjoined to conceal himself.\u00a0\n\n    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cAvoid these reprehensible things which Allaah has forbidden, but \n    whoever has done any of them, let him conceal himself with the concealment \n    of Allaah.\u201d Narrated by al-Haakim and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in \n    Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019 (149).\u00a0\n\n    Al-Bukhaari (6069) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cAll of my ummah will be fine except those who commit sin \n    openly. It is part of committing sin openly for a man to do something at \n    night then in the morning, when Allaah has concealed him, he says: \u2018O So and \n    so, I did such and such last night,\u2019 when all night his Lord had concealed \n    him, but the next day he discloses what Allaah had concealed for him.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    What you have mentioned about your love for your husband, \n    which is the basis for married life, is a good start and a solid foundation \n    for solving the differences that exist between you, in sha Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    Show your husband this love in real terms, by showing you \n    care about him. Change your attitude towards him, change yourself, your \n    appearance, your house, make a real change.\u00a0\n\n    Perhaps he is bored of routine and the rhythm of daily life \n    in which there is no change. \u00a0\n\n    Try to attract his attention to you, your house and your \n    daughter in all the ways that you can, but beware of complaining or showing \n    that you are unhappy about some of his private affairs because that would be \n    an obstacle to reaching an understanding between you.\u00a0\n\n    Adopt the etiquette of Islam and beware of being \n    hot-tempered, because the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) advised against getting angry.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Bukhaari (6116) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) that a man said to the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him): Advise me. He said: \u201cDo not get angry.\u201d He repeated \n    it several times, saying: \u201cDo not get angry.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    We are also enjoined to guard our tongues. The Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said when he was advising \n    Mu\u2019aadh (may Allaah be pleased with him): \u201cRestrain this,\u201d i.e., your \n    tongue. I said: O Messenger of Allaah, will we be called to account for what \n    we say? He said: \u201cMay your mother be bereft of you, O Mu\u2019aadh! Will people \n    be thrown in Hell on their faces or their noses for anything other than the \n    harvest of their tongues?\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by \n    al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Saheehah (772).\u00a0\n\n    What you have mentioned about your being hot-tempered and \n    sharp-tongued are things that lead to destruction and destroy the basis of \n    family life.\u00a0\n\n    Perhaps these are the reason why your husband has turned away \n    from you. Perhaps he finds with this family and other people the respect and \n    good manners that he does not find with you, and that has made him resort to \n    what he is doing.\u00a0\n\n    So try to change the way you behave and control yourself. \n    Turn to Allaah and pray that you and he be guided and develop a good \n    attitude and proper etiquette, for Allaah is Ever-Near, Most Responsive.\u00a0\n\n    I ask Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, to bring you \n    together and may He help us and you to do that which He loves and which \n    pleases Him.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows \n    best."

        "question": "Should he throw his alcoholic uncle out of the house?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The problems of Muslims in kaafir countries are innumerable \n    and heartbreaking. These societies and environments are not suitable for \n    Muslims, because their values are incompatible with Islam and its noble \n    principles, high moral standards and decent etiquette.\n\n    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) warned us sternly against living in such environments and societies, \n    because he knew the bad effect that this would have on Muslims, with regard \n    to their religious commitment, morals and behaviour. He said: \u201cI disavow \n    myself of any Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen.\u201d Narrated by Abu \n    Dawood (2654) and al-Tirmidhi ( 1604); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in \n    Irwa\u2019 al-Ghaleel (1207).\u00a0\n\n    Your uncle\u2019s situation \u2013 and that of many others \u2013 is the \n    result of settling among the kuffaar which our religion has forbidden.\u00a0\n\n    It is a great loss in this world and in the Hereafter, if \n    Allaah does not bestow His mercy upon him.\u00a0\n\n    You have no choice but to be patient with your uncle, for it \n    seems from your advice to him and his response to you that the seed of faith \n    is still alive in his heart, which needs your care and concern on an ongoing \n    basis. Always keep in mind the words of the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to \u2018Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him): \n    \u201cIf Allaah were to guide one man at your hands, that would be better for you \n    than red camels (i.e., the best kind).\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2942).\u00a0\n\n    If he stays with you in the house \u2013 and you keep advising him \n    and taking care of him \u2013 that is better for him than wandering the streets \n    and living as a vagabond, which could lead him to a bad end because of his \n    being far away from you. Doing the lesser of two evils and warding off one \n    by means of the other is what is required here.\u00a0\n\n    Treating him kindly is also part of honouring your mother and \n    pleasing her, so strive to call him to what is good and try to distract him \n    from what he is doing now. Take him to the mosque with you sometimes. We ask \n    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, to guide the Muslims who have gone \n    astray and to show them the right way, for He is Able to do that.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "His wife does not accept advice. What is the solution?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly your wife is persisting in making a serious mistake, and we ask Allah to guide her. The most serious thing that you mention about her is the matter of her careless attitude towards prayer, because not praying leads \u2013 Allah forbid \u2013 to one becoming beyond the pale of Islam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhat stands between a man and shirk or kufr is his giving up prayer.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 82). This applies to one who does not pray at all. But some of the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) thought that a person who fails to pray one prayer on time also becomes a kaafir. See al-Mughni, 3/354). This points to the seriousness of the matter.\u00a0\nYou have done your duty towards your wife by guiding and advising her, and this has borne fruit. Even though it may be incomplete, it is still a positive step which indicates that there is goodness in your wife and that she is prepared to change the rest. Yes, that may be slow but it is possible. You see that in the beginning she was not convinced of hijaab and did not wear it at all, but after the noble efforts on your part she has started to wear it partially. Even though it is not full hijaab as it should be worn, it still gives us hope and points to hidden goodness in her. You can bring it to the surface so that she will wear proper hijaab on the basis of conviction and her own desire to do it, as time goes by and as you continue your efforts. This means that you must continue to advise her and not give up, and you will be rewarded for that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf one man were to be guided at your hands, that will be better for you than red camels [i.e., the best kind].\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 6).\u00a0\nAlways remind her of Allah and make her fear Him; tell her of the importance of prayer in Islam and that she has to learn the things that have to do with prayer, such as the rulings on menstruation and post-partum bleeding, because it is obligatory on every woman, when her bleeding stops, to hasten to do ghusl when the time for prayer comes. Try to bring her useful books on that topic, such as the essay by Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) on \u201cThe Natural Blood of Women\u201d or some useful tapes. You can help her by sitting and reading with her, or listening to the tapes with her, because this is a kind of cooperating in righteousness and piety.\u00a0\n[Translator\u2019s note: Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen\u2019s essay is available in English with additional notes by Bilaal Philips, under the title Islamic Rules on Menstruation and Post-Natal Bleeding, published by Dar al-Fatah, Sharjah, UAE].\nWith regard to what you mention about her mistakes in reading Quran, if the mistakes are in her recitation of al-Faatihah and are such that they distort or change the meanings of the words \u2013 such as reading an\u2019amta [\u201cYou [masculine] have bestowed Your grace\u201d] as an\u2019amti [i.e., feminine form of the verb], or any other mistake which would make a listener understand something other than the correct meaning \u2013 this means that she has to learn how to read properly, because such mistakes make the prayer invalid, as reciting al-Faatihah is a pillar or essential part of the prayer, without which the prayer is not valid. But if the mistakes do not change the meaning , such as reading \u201car-Rahmaan ir-Raheem\u201d as \u201car-Rahmaan ur-Raheem\u201d, this does not invalidate the prayer.\u00a0\nThe Muslim must learn to read Quran so that he can recite it correctly, and so that he will not distort the Quran without realizing.\u00a0\nYou have to help her with that, either by teaching her yourself, or by showing her things that will help her, such as tapes of the Quran by readers who are known to recite well. You must also explain to her the virtues of reading Quran and the reward for that.\u00a0\nSo in conclusion you have to continue teaching and advising her, and be patient in doing so. Do not say that she has only responded a little after so much time and effort, for even this little is blessed by Allah. We have a good example in the Prophets, for Nooh called his people for nine hundred and fifty years. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd indeed We sent Nooh (Noah) to his people, and he stayed among them a thousand years less fifty years [inviting them to believe in the Oneness of Allah (Monotheism), and discard the false gods and other deities]\u201d\u00a0[al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:14]\nYet despite that only a few of his people believed in him.\u00a0\nMake her enjoy learning about her religion by making it easy for her. Encourage her if you see that she is responding to you, even if it is something small. Know that you are an example for her, so watch what you do and say. Beware of telling her to do something then being the first one to go against that, or of telling her not to do something then being the first one to do it, for this will stop her from accepting your advice, or will delay her.\u00a0\nYou have to be gentle in the way you advise her, for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAllah is Kind and loves kindness, and He confers upon kindness that which He does not confer upon severity and does not confer upon anything else besides it (kindness).\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 2593).\u00a0\nYou must also make a lot of du\u2019aa\u2019 and beseech Allah to open her heart to obedience towards Him and make His religion and laws beloved to her. I ask Allah to help you to do good."

        "question": "Her family has a bad reputation and she wants to go far away from them",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    This world is not free of worries and distress, and the \n    Muslim knows that, indeed all people know that. All people suffer in this \n    world, good and bad.\u00a0\n\n    The difference between the believer and the kaafir with \n    regard to that is that the believer has the hope of the reward of Allaah in \n    good times and bad, which the kaafir is deprived of because of his kufr. \n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cif you are suffering (hardships) then surely, they (too) \n    are suffering (hardships) as you are suffering, but you have a hope from \n    Allaah (for the reward, i.e. Paradise) that for which they hope not; and \n    Allaah is Ever All\u2011Knowing, All\u2011Wise\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:104]\n\n    The believer knows that whatever good he sees in this world \n    is only partial, and that whatever evil he sees in this realm, no matter \n    what this evil is, is only partial. True good is in Paradise and true evil \n    is in Hell.\u00a0\n\n    Shaddaad ibn Aws (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to \n    say: You do not see anything of good but its causes and you do not see \n    anything of evil but its causes. All goodness is in Paradise and all evil is \n    in Hell. This world is transient and passing, in which both the righteous \n    and the immoral eat. But the Hereafter is a true promise in which a stern \n    Sovereign will pass judgement. Each of them has its sons, so be among the \n    sons of the Hereafter and do not be among the sons of this world.\u00a0\n\n    Sifat al-Safwah (1/709).\u00a0\n\n    Because of this truth, the one who is destined for Hell will \n    forget all this goodness from the first time he is dipped in Hell, and the \n    one who is destined for Paradise will forget all this hardship the first \n    time he is dipped in Paradise.\u00a0\n\n    This is the wisdom of Allaah, which the believer sees in that \n    which Allaah has decreed for him. He tests His slaves with good and bad \n    alike.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cEveryone is going to taste death, and We shall make a \n    trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned\u201d\n\n    [al-Anbiya\u2019 21:35]\n\n    It is easy for anyone to speak the words of faith and claim \n    to be sincere, but it is through tests and trials that those who are sincere \n    are distinguished from those who are lying, and believers are distinguished \n    from hypocrites. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cDo people think that they will be left alone because they \n    say: \u2018We believe,\u2019 and will not be tested.\n\n    3.\u00a0And We indeed tested those who were before them. And \n    Allaah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and \n    will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, \n    (although Allaah knows all that before putting them to test)\u201d\n\n    [al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:2-3]\n\n    So the believer is different from all other people when he is \n    tested with good and bad. He is grateful for good things and he is patient \n    when bad things happen, and there is no goodness in anything other than \n    that.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cHow wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all of it is good, \n    and that applies to no one except the believer. If something good happens to \n    him he gives thanks, and that is good for him, and if something bad befalls \n    him he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.\u201d Narrated by Muslim \n    (2999).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n    One of the names by which Allaah has called Himself is \n    al-Hakeem (the Wise), and one of His deeds is wisdom which the human mind \n    cannot fully comprehend. That part of His wisdom which is known to us can \n    help the believer to be steadfast and patient. In the answer to question no. \n    35914 we have stated some of the wisdom and benefits that result from \n    calamities. Please refer to this question, as it is important.\u00a0\n\n    There are some things which, if the one who is stricken with \n    calamity thinks about them, his problem will seem less severe. Ibn al-Qayyim \n    mentioned in his book Zaad al-Ma\u2019aad (4/189-195) a number of these \n    things, which we have mentioned in the answer to question no. \n    71236. Please \n    refer to this question, as it is important.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    Honouring your parents is an Islamic duty, and it is haraam \n    to disobey them even if their attitude or their treatment of you is bad, and \n    no matter what has happened between them. Allaah has enjoined treating them \n    kindly even if they try to force you to disbelieve. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBut if they (both) strive with you to make you join in \n    worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them \n    not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him \n    who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your \n    return, and I shall tell you what you used to do\u201d\n\n    [Luqmaan 31:15]\n\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    enjoined maintaining ties with them and treating them kindly even if they \n    are kaafirs, as he said to Asma\u2019 (may Allaah be pleased with her) when her \n    mother, who was a kaafir, came to visit her because she needed something: \n    \u201cUphold ties of kinship with your mother.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2477) \n    and Muslim (1003).\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    Moving far away from your family and travelling by yourself \n    is not permissible because of the problem, rather it the wrong way to deal \n    with it. It is like jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. \u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Ibn \u2018Abbaas said: I heard the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: \u201cNo man should be \n    alone with a woman unless there is a mahram present with her, and no woman \n    should travel except with a mahram.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1763) and \n    Muslim (1341).\u00a0\n\n    This hadeeth indicates that for a woman to travel alone, \n    without a husband or mahram, is haraam. The word \u201ctravel\u201d in the hadeeth is \n    general in meaning, and includes travelling for Hajj and \u2018Umrah or to seek \n    knowledge. What you are intending to do comes under the heading of travel \n    that is forbidden in this hadeeth, and if the travel is to a kaafir country, \n    then it is even more haraam.\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible for a woman to take off her hijab, the \n    symbol of her chastity, religious commitment and modesty. Obedience to \n    Allaah takes precedence over desires, pleasures and worldly matters.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said:\u00a0\n\n    It is obligatory for a woman to observe hijab in front of \n    non-mahram men, both at home and abroad, because Allaah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask \n    them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their \n    hearts\u201d\n\n    [al-Ahzaab 33:53]\n\n    This verse includes the face as well as other parts, because \n    the face is the greatest part of a woman\u2019s beauty.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cO Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the \n    women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies \n    (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the \n    way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable \n    women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most \n    Merciful\u201d\n    [al-Ahzaab 33:59]\u00a0\n\n    \u201c\u2026and not to reveal their adornment except to their \n    husbands, or their fathers, or their husband\u2019s fathers, or their sons, or \n    their husband\u2019s sons \u2026\u201d\n\n    [al-Noor 24:31]\n\n    These verses indicate that it is obligatory to observe hijab \n    at home and abroad, in front of Muslims and kaafirs.\u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible for any woman who believes in Allaah \n    and the Last Day to take these matter slightly because that is disobedience \n    towards Allaah and His Messenger, and because that will cause fitnah at home \n    and abroad.\u00a0\n\n    Fataawa al-Mar\u2019ah al-Muslimah \n    (1/446, 447).\u00a0\n\n    Fifthly:\u00a0\n\n    You should not despair of the mercy of Allaah. What you say \n    in your question indicates that you have lost self confidence and have lost \n    hope in your Lord. The Shaytaan would like this to continue. Beware of \n    falling into the trap of the Shaytaan.\u00a0\n\n    We can see from your letter that you are upset and grieved by \n    the state of your family, and how their reputation is affecting you, which \n    has made you think of moving away from them. But we want you to think long \n    and hard lest you fall pray to evil people, especially if they know about \n    your family\u2019s situation and you are alone among them. So you have to plan to \n    solve this problem without doing anything that is haraam.\u00a0\n\n    We suggest that you should tell one of your relatives who is \n    wise and is a mahram about your problem, such as a paternal uncle or \n    maternal uncle, so that he may help you to solve the problem that results \n    from your remaining with your family. Moving to the house of one of your \n    mahrams is the best way to solve your problem, if living with them is as you \n    describe and there is no hope of them mending their ways. Maybe after that \n    Allaah will bless you with a righteous husband with whom you will have a \n    happy life and Allaah may bless you with good children from him.\u00a0\n\n    There is no reason why your relatives should not help you to \n    get married to a righteous man. If they do that, they will be deserving of \n    praise. There is no reason why you should not try to get someone whose \n    intelligence and religious commitment you trust to look for a suitable \n    husband for you, or mention you to a person who you think is righteous and \n    good.\u00a0\n\n    But whatever the case, we do not advise you to travel alone \n    or to move to a house on your own, rather we advise you to live with one of \n    your relatives who is a mahram, if that is possible, so long as you choose a \n    righteous household that is suitable for you to live in. If that is not \n    possible then we advise you to look for righteous sisters, such as students, \n    and live with them. If that is not possible, then look for a righteous \n    sister who is living with her sisters or mother, who you could live with. \n    What matters is that you should avoid living alone and avoid travelling, \n    especially to a kaafir country, and you should look for a good and suitable \n    environment where you can protect your religious commitment.\u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible for you to give in to the tricks of the \n    shaytaan for you are one of those who are despairing and are close to kufr. \n    All of that plays a role in worry and distress.\u00a0\n\n    Think about the words of Allaah (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cOr think you that you will enter Paradise without such \n    (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? They were afflicted \n    with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger \n    and those who believed along with him said, \u201cWhen (will come) the Help of \n    Allaah?\u201d Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allaah is near!\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:214]\n\n    You will realize that when calamity grows worse and reaches \n    the point that it feels like an earthquake, then relief is close at hand by \n    the mercy of the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.\u00a0\n\n    Think about the words of Allaah (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He \n    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\n\n    3.\u00a0And He will provide him from (sources) he never could \n    imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. \n    Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure \n    for all things\u201d\n\n    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cand whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He \n    will make his matter easy for him\u201d\n\n    [al-Talaaq 65:4]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cVerily, along with every hardship is relief,\n\n    6.\u00a0Verily, along with every hardship is relief\u201d\n\n    [al-Sharh 94:5-6]\n\n    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cO young man, shall I not teach you some words by means of which \n    Allaah may benefit you?\u201d I said: Yes. He said: \u201cBe mindful of Allaah, He \n    will take care of you. Be mindful of Allaah and you will find Him before \n    you. Remember Him at times of ease and He will remember you at times of \n    hardship. If you ask, then ask of Allaah, if you seek help then seek help \n    from Allaah. The Pen has dried and things are happening (as they have been \n    decreed). If all of mankind were to gather together to benefit you in some \n    way that Allaah has not decreed for you, they would never be able to do it, \n    and if they wanted to harm you with something that Allaah has not decreed \n    for you, they would never be able to do it. Remember that there is much good \n    in bearing with patience that which you dislike, and that victory comes with \n    patience, and that with hardship comes a way out and with difficulty comes \n    ease.\u201d Narrated by Ahmad, 2800 and classed as saheeh by Al-Albaani.\u00a0\n\n    Finally: we advise you to make du\u2019aa\u2019 and seek out the best \n    times such as the last third of the night, saying a lot of du\u2019aa\u2019 whilst \n    prostrating, being sincere in your du\u2019aa\u2019 and humbly beseeching your Lord to \n    guide your parents and set their affairs straight, and to help you to do \n    that which He loves and which pleases Him.\u00a0\n\n    See also the book \u201cAlhomoom \u2013 Dealing with Worries and \n    Stress\u201d in the Books section of this site.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on reading love stories and watching romantic movies",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nReading love stories results in many evils, especially if the reader is young. These evils include: provocation of desire, and stirring up of bad thoughts and fantasies, attachment to the hero or heroine of the story, and wasting time in something that brings no spiritual or worldly benefit, rather in most cases it cases harm. Islam came to close the door that leads to anything haraam; it enjoins lowering the gaze and forbids being alone with a member of the opposite sex or speaking in a soft tone, and other things that may provoke desire or lead to immoral actions. Undoubtedly reading these stories is the exact opposite of that, because they promote the wish to get to know men and form relationships with them, and fall in love with them, in addition to showing immoral images of love and meetings etc. Undoubtedly all of that is haraam.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nListening to music is haraam, because of a great deal of evidence which we have mentioned in the answer to question no. 5000 and 20406.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nThe same may be said about watching romantic movies as is said about reading romantic stories, rather the movies are more harmful and more corrupt, because they embody the meanings in moving images and scenes, and because they show \u2018awrahs and immoral actions, accompanied by\u00a0 music in most cases. They provoke desires and promote immorality, as is obvious to any wise person. It is strange that you are not bothered as the result of watching these movies.\u00a0\nConclusion: All of that is forbidden, as it leads to haraam things and sin, and the one who does it is in grave danger. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAllaah has decreed for the son of Adam his share of zina, which he will inevitably get. The zina of the eyes is looking and the zina of the tongue is speaking. The heart wishes and hopes, and the private part confirms that or denies it.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6243) and Muslim (2657). According to a report narrated by Muslim: \u201cThe son of Adam\u2019s share of zina has been decreed for him, which he will inevitably get. The zina of the eyes is looking, the zina of the ears is listening, the zina of the tongue is speaking, the zina of the hands is touching, and the zina of the foot is walking. The heart longs and wishes, and the private part confirms that or denies it.\u201d Think about this important hadeeth, and think about the movies that you mentioned. Watching them includes the zina of the eyes, the ears and the heart which longs and wishes. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.\u00a0\nRemember that it is obligatory to give up haraam things immediately, and that sin after sin darkens the heart, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhen the believer commits sin, a black spot appears on his heart. If he repents and gives up that sin and seeks forgiveness, his heart will be polished. But if (the sin) increases, (the black spot) increases. That is the raan which Allaah mentions in His Book: \u2018Nay! But on their hearts is the Raan (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn\u2019 [al-Mutaffifeen 83:14].\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3334) and Ibn Maajah (4244); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\nYou should also remember that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than it, so hasten to repent sincerely and give up these haraam things, and keep yourself busy with things that will benefit your spiritual and worldly interests. Read Qur\u2019aan a great deal and study the biography of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the biographies of the Mothers of the Believers and of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them all). Listen to useful lectures which will remind you of Allaah and encourage you to seek the Hereafter, and help you to keep away from haraam things.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to help and guide us and you.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "She entered Islam then she deviated from the path of guidance and she wants to repent",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.May Allaah \n    help you, relieve your distress, guide your footsteps and forgive your sin.\u00a0\nYour soul is \n    still in your body, your heart is still beating and your mind is still \n    thinking, so we will start from there.\u00a0\nThe \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cAllaah accepts the repentance of His slaves so long as the death rattle has \n    not reached his throat.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3537); classed as hasan by \n    al-Albaani.\u00a0\nYou are not \n    too weak and you are not a pile of dust like those who are in the graves, \n    rather you still have the strength to start again, and in sha Allaah you are \n    stronger than you think. The strong person is not the one who never falls, \n    rather the strong person is the one who can get up again if he falls.\u00a0\nWere you not \n    following the religion of your forefathers, associating others with Allaah \n    and disbelieving in His Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him), then Allaah gave you the strength to leave all that behind, and you \n    moved to a new religion that you were not used to and had not followed \n    before? That is a thousand times harder than leaving the state you are in \n    now.\u00a0\nWeren\u2019t the \n    cups of wine filled around you and paths of temptation open to you, with no \n    one watching for you to feel ashamed and thus be protected? But Allaah gave \n    you strength and protected you from immorality and drinking alcohol. So now \n    how can you give in to the situation you are in?\u00a0\nYou have the \n    strength to recover. Do not help your enemy against yourself. If some \n    wrongdoer slaps you, do not slap your other cheek. \u201cHe is not one of us who \n    slaps his cheeks, rends his garment and prays with the call of Jaahiliyyah.\u201d \n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1294).\u00a0\nThere is a \n    difference between the one who falls into a ditch and gives in to the fall, \n    and laments his luck, blames fate and thinks badly of his Lord, and one who \n    falls and knows that he deserved it because of his sin and bad deeds, and \n    because he chose that for himself. \u201cAnd verily, \n    Allaah is not unjust to His slaves\u201d [al-Anfaal 8:51]. \n    So he gets up after stumbling, and seeks the help of his Lord in ridding \n    himself of sin first of all, then relieving his distress, as he learns to \n    say every day: \u201cYou (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help \n    (for each and everything)\u201d [al-Faatihah 1:5]. Such is the strong \n    believer whom Allaah loves. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe strong believer is better and \n    more beloved to Allaah than the weak believer, although both are good. \n    Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allaah, and do \n    not feel helpless. If anything befalls you, do not say \u2018If only I had done \n    (such and such), the such and such would have happened,\u2019 rather say: \u2018Allaah \n    has decreed and what He wills He does,\u2019 for \u2018if only\u2019 opens the door to the \n    work of the shaytaan.\u201d\nNarrated by \n    Muslim (2664). \u00a0\nShaykh \n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Man is not \n    commanded to refer to the concept of the divine decree with regard to the \n    deeds that are enjoined upon him, rather he should refer to the concept of \n    the divine decree with regard to calamities that he has no means to ward \n    off. Whatever befalls you as the result of other people\u2019s actions or \n    otherwise, bear it with patience, accept it and submit. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cNo \n    calamity befalls, but by the Leave [i.e. Decision and Qadar (Divine \n    Preordainments)] of Allaah, and whosoever believes in Allaah, He guides his \n    heart [to the true Faith with certainty, i.e. what has befallen him was \n    already written for him by Allaah from the Qadar (Divine Preordainments)]\u201d\n\n    [al-Taghaabun 64:11]\nOne of the \n    salaf \u2013 either Ibn Mas\u2019ood or \u2018Alqamah \u2013 said: This is the man whom calamity \n    befalls and he knows that it is from Allaah, so he accepts it and submits.\n    Majmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (7/278).\u00a0\nIbn \n    al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth confirms some of \n    the most important principles of faith, which include:\u00a0\nMan\u2019s \n    happiness lies in his striving for that which will benefit him in this life \n    and in the Hereafter. Striving means doing one\u2019s utmost. As man\u2019s striving \n    and deeds can only be done with the help of Allaah and by His will, He has \n    commanded him to seek His help, so as to fulfil the meaning of the verse:\u00a0\n    \u201cYou (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and \n    everything)\u201d [al-Faatihah 1:5]. His striving for that which will benefit \n    him is an act of worship of Allaah and can only be achieved with Allaah\u2019s \n    help. So He commanded him to worship Him and to seek His help.\u00a0\nThen he \n    said: \u201cAnd do not feel helpless\u201d, because feeling helpless is the opposite \n    of striving for that which will benefit him, and it is the opposite of \n    seeking the help of Allaah. So the one who is striving for that which will \n    benefit him and seeking the help of Allaah is the opposite of the one who \n    feels helpless. This principle applies before what is decreed happens, and \n    it guides the Muslim to that which is one of the greatest causes of \n    attaining it, which is striving for it whilst seeking the help of the One in \n    Whose hand are all things, from Whom they originate and to Whom they will \n    return. If what is not decreed for him does not come to him, there are two \n    scenarios: the first of which is feeling helpless, which opens the door to \n    the works of the shaytaan, and this helplessness leads him to regret and say \n    \u201cif only\u201d and there is no benefit in saying \u201cif only\u201d, rather this opens the \n    door to blame, anguish, anger, regret and sorrow, all of which are from the \n    shaytaan and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    forbade opening the door to the shaytaan in this manner. Or in the second \n    scenario, he may look at the divine decree and think about it, for if it is \n    decreed (for him to get what he wanted) for him he would not have missed it \n    and no one would have beaten him to it. Hence he said: \u201cIf anything befalls \n    you, do not say \u2018If only I had done (such and such), the such and such would \n    have happened,\u2019 rather say: \u2018Allaah has decreed and what He wills He does.\u2019\u201d \n    So he taught him that which will benefit him in either case: if he gets what \n    he wanted and if he did not get it. Hence this hadeeth is one that a person \n    can never do without.\u00a0\nShifa\u2019 \n    al-\u2018Aleel (37-38).\u00a0\nOnce you \n    have understood this, there is no room for wishing for something different \n    than what was decreed, for that is in fact like suggesting that Allaah \n    should have decreed something else. There is no point in wishing that Allaah \n    had spared you from these trials that you went through and that made you so \n    alterable and confused after you had been guided to Him.\u00a0\nDo you not \n    know that tests and trials are an inevitable part of man\u2019s existence in this \n    life? \u00a0\n\u201cVerily, \n    We have created man from Nutfah (drops) of mixed semen (sexual discharge of \n    man and woman), in order to try him, so We made him hearer and seer\u201d\n\n    [al-Insaan 76:2]\nPeople are \n    like metals. Some are pure gold, some are a mixture, and some are less than \n    that. The test is like a fire which will show whether the gold is truly gold \n    or not.\u00a0\nAllaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAlif\u2011Laam\u2011Meem.\n[These \n    letters are one of the miracles of the Qur\u2019aan, and none but Allaah (Alone) \n    knows their meanings.]\n2.\u00a0Do \n    people think that they will be left alone because they say: \u2018We believe\u2019 and \n    will not be tested.\n3.\u00a0And We \n    indeed tested those who were before them. And Allaah will certainly make \n    (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) \n    known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allaah knows all \n    that before putting them to test)\u201d\n\n    [al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:1-3]\nShaykh Ibn \n    Sa\u2019di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAllaah tells \n    us of His perfect wisdom, and that His wisdom does not mean that everyone \n    who says that he believes will remain as such, free from tribulations and \n    tests, and not be faced with that which will confound their faith. If that \n    were the case, then there would be no way to distinguish between one who is \n    sincere and one who is lying.\u00a0\nBut His way \n    with the earlier nations and with this ummah is to test them with good \n    things and bad things, with ease and hardship, with good times and bad \n    times, with wealth and poverty. He tests them by causing their enemies to \n    prevail over them sometimes and He tests them when they strive against the \n    enemies in word and deed, and other kinds of trials, all of which result \n    from specious arguments about faith, which are contrary to certain faith and \n    desires which undermine the resolve of the believer.\u00a0\nIf a \n    person\u2019s faith remains firm in the face of doubts and does not waver, and he \n    wards them off with the truth that he has, and if, in the face of desires \n    that call him to sin or to go against that which Allaah and His Messenger \n    have enjoined, he does that which is required by faith, and strives against \n    his desires, this indicates that his faith is sincere and valid. \u00a0\nBut if his \n    heart is affected by doubts and desires, and they lead him to sin or divert \n    him from his duties, this indicates that his faith is not valid or sincere. \n    People are of varying degrees with regard to this matter, which are known \n    only to Allaah, We ask Allaah to make us steadfast in this world and in the \n    Hereafter, and to make our hearts steadfast in adhering to His religion, as \n    tests and trials are like the bellows which brings out the dross and the \n    good. \u00a0\nO \n    maidservant of Allaah, you do not want to live and you do not want to die. \u00a0\nWe say: We \n    too would not like you to have this life of sin, but we hope that you do not \n    die in this state, rather we hope that our Lord, the Lord of the Worlds, \n    will not like you to live such a life and will not like you to die in this \n    state.\u00a0\nThis \n    situation is not as confusing as you think, and the solution is not for you \n    to give in to loss, as you are doing now. Allaah does not want you to meet \n    Him, after you die, in any state other than Islam.\u00a0\n\u201cO you \n    who believe! Fear Allaah (by doing all that He has ordered and by abstaining \n    from all that He has forbidden) as He should be feared. (Obey Him, be \n    thankful to Him, and remember Him always,) and die not except in a state of \n    Islam [as Muslims (with complete submission to Allaah)]\u201d\n[Aal \n    \u2018Imraan 3:102]\nNor does \n    Allaah want you to live except in a state of Islam, which He has chosen for \n    His slaves:\u00a0\n\u201cSay (O \n    Muhammad): Verily, my Salaah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying \n    are for Allaah, the Lord of the \u2018Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that \n    exists).\n163.\u00a0He \n    has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the \n    Muslims\u201d\n\n    [al-An\u2019aam 6:162-163] \nSo what is \n    the solution? Where should we start?\u00a0\nThe solution \n    is to turn back to Him, and He will love you when you turn back to Him:\u00a0\n\u201cAllaah \n    loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify \n    themselves\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:222]\n\u00a0He will \n    grant you relief when you come back to Him, no matter how far astray you \n    have gone.\u00a0\nIt was \n    narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cAllaah, may He be glorified and exalted, says: \u2018I am as My slave thinks I \n    am, and I am with him when he remembers Me. If he remembers me to himself, I \n    remember him to Myself; if he remembers Me in a gathering, I remember him in \n    a gathering better than it; if he draws near to Me a handspan, I draw near \n    to him an arm\u2019s length; if he draws near to me an arm\u2019s length, I draw near \n    to him a fathom\u2019s length; if he comes to Me walking, I go to him at speed.\u201d \n    Narrated by Muslim (2675).\u00a0\nSo what \n    about sins and alcohol?\u00a0\nOur Lord, \n    the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful, says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSay: O \n    \u2018Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing \n    evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah \n    forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\n[al-Zumar \n    39:53]\nYou still \n    have a way to turn over a new leaf and make the record of your deeds white \n    and clean. We do not mean that it will be white with no good deeds or bad \n    deeds written on it so that we will go back to zero and start from scratch. \n    No; what we mean is that we want it to be white with no sins on it, and by \n    the mercy of the Most Merciful of those who show mercy, it will be filled \n    with good deeds instead of every bad deed that you did and every sin into \n    which you fell.\nHave you not \n    heard the words of Allaah which tell us of the characteristics of the slaves \n    of the Most Merciful, where He mentions a number of their beautiful \n    attributes that are beloved to Him, among which He mentions:\u00a0\n\u201cAnd \n    those who invoke not any other il\u00e2h (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such \n    person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal \n    sexual intercourse  \n    and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.\n69.\u00a0The \n    torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide \n    therein in disgrace;\n\n    70.\u00a0Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do \n    righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, \n    and Allaah is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful.\n71.\u00a0And \n    whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents \n    towards Allaah with true repentance\u201d\n\n    [al-Furqaan 25:68-71]\nDo you not \n    see how Allaah does not just forgive those major sins, but by His grace He \n    turns them into good deeds!\u00a0\nIt was \n    narrated from Abu Taweel Shatab al-Mamdood that he came to the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: \u201cWhat do \n    you think if a man has committed all kinds of sins, and has not left out any \n    of them, and he did not omit any minor or major sin but he did it, can he \n    repent?\u201d \u00a0\nHe said: \n    \u201cHave you become Muslim?\u201d\u00a0\nHe said: \u201cAs \n    for me, I bear witness that there is no god but Allaah alone, with no \n    partner or associate, and that you are the Messenger of Allaah.\u201d\u00a0\nHe said: \u201cDo \n    good deeds and abstain from bad deeds, and Allaah will make them all good \n    deeds for you.\u201d\u00a0\nHe said: \n    \u201cEven my betrayals and immoral deeds?\u201d \u00a0\nHe said: \n    \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0\nHe said: \n    \u201cAllaah is most great,\u201d and he kept saying takbeer until he left.\u00a0\nNarrated by \n    al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer (7/314); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in\n    Saheeh al-Targheeb.\u00a0\nSo, O \n    maidservant of Allaah, change your state and do good deeds, and give up bad \n    deeds, and they will all be turned to good deeds in your record of deeds. \n    Then you will know that you cannot lose that closeness to Allaah, for you \n    will still have the opportunity to be with Him in Paradise.\u00a0\nIbn \n    al-Qayyim said: Come and be with Allaah, and draw close to Him in an abode \n    of peace, with no exhaustion or tiredness or suffering via the closest and \n    easiest routes. You are in a time between two times, which in fact is your \n    life, your current time, between the past and the future. What has passed \n    can be set right by repentance and regret and prayers for forgiveness, and \n    that is something which will not exhaust you or tire you out and is not \n    difficult. Rather it is an action of the heart.\u00a0 As for the future, you \n    should refrain from committing sin, and refraining from sin will give you a \n    great deal of peace of mind.\u00a0 It is not a physical action that is too hard \n    to do, rather it is resolve and firm intention, which will bring physical \n    and mental peace. \u00a0\nBut what \n    matters is your life, which is your time between two times. If you waste it \n    you will lose happiness and salvation. But if you take care of the present \n    as well as correcting the past and the future as described above, then you \n    will be saved and will have peace of mind, pleasure and tranquillity. \u00a0\nTaking care \n    of it is more difficult than setting right that which comes before and after \n    it, for taking care of it requires you to do that which is best and most \n    beneficial for you, and which is most likely to bring happiness, and people \n    differ greatly with regard to that.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Fawaa\u2019id (117).\u00a0\nSo seek the \n    help of Allaah to deal with your situation and roll up the record of the \n    past with all that it contains, and move on to set the rest of your life \n    straight. Strive to keep company with good people who will help you deal \n    with your situation, and if you can move to a new place, close to good and \n    righteous people, then do that, for it will be better for you. Be mindful of \n    Allaah and He will take care of you; be sincere towards Him and He will \n    compensate you with good for what you have missed.\u00a0\nAllaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO \n    Prophet (Muhammad)! Say to the captives that are in your hands: If Allaah \n    knows any good in your hearts, He will give you something better than what \n    has been taken from you, and He will forgive you, and Allaah is \n    Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\n\n    [al-Anfaal 6:70]\nIn sha \n    Allah, we are sure that you will do this, and we look forward to another \n    message from you with good news of a new journey towards the light, just as \n    we were saddened to hear of your stumbling from the path.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah \n    knows best."

        "question": "She is in love and it has affected her \u2013 should she go to a psychologist?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Your \n    situation is not one of witchcraft or spells, such that you need to go to a \n    raaqi to perform ruqyah for you, and it is not a mental or nervous illness, \n    such that you need to go to a doctor. Rather it is the case of a heart that \n    has been affected by the shaytaan and his waswaas (whispers), who has \n    instilled ideas of haraam love, so that you started to inflame your desire \n    by means of poisonous (i.e., haraam) looks, wrong thoughts and false hopes, \n    until you have reached this state of sickness, as you are aware.\u00a0\nIbn \n    al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Chapter: The teachings of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on how to deal with \n    love.\u00a0\nThis is one \n    of the diseases of the heart, which are different from other diseases in \n    their causes and remedies. If they take hold, they become too difficult for \n    the doctors to treat and they cause a great deal of trouble for the sick \n    person. \nThen he \n    said: Love of images only affects hearts that are void of the love of Allaah \n    and that turn away from Him and are content with things other than Allaah. \n    But when the heart is filled with love of Allaah and the longing to see Him, \n    that wards off the sickness of attraction to images. Hence Allaah said \n    concerning Yoosuf (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThus it \n    was, that We might turn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse. \n    Surely, he was one of Our chosen, (guided) slaves\u201d\n[Yoosuf \n    12:24]\nThis \n    indicates that sincerity (ikhlaas) is a means of warding off love and the \n    evil and immoral actions that it leads to. Protecting oneself against the \n    cause is also protecting oneself against what it leads to. Hence one of the \n    salaf said: Love is the sign of an empty heart. Zaad al-Ma\u2019aad 4/365, \n    268\u00a0\nYou should \n    note, may Allaah protect you from the things that incur His wrath, that the \n    source of this sickness is in haraam looks, which are the harbinger of \n    calamity and which bring the sickness into the heart. Then the heart begins \n    to imagine things, until that leads to wishing for or imagining haraam \n    things. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cAllaah has decreed for the son of Adam his share of zina, which \n    he will inevitably get. The zina of the eyes is looking and the zina of the \n    tongue is speaking. The heart wishes and hopes, and the private part \n    confirms that or denies it.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6243) and Muslim \n    (2657).\u00a0\nIn that \n    case, you have to block the way that leads to this sickness and keep away \n    from places of danger and contagion. Hence Allaah commanded His believing \n    slaves to lower their gaze (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cTell the \n    believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and \n    protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for \n    them. Verily, Allaah is All\u2011Aware of what they do.\n31.\u00a0And \n    tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden \n    things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts)\u201d\n[al-Noor \n    24:30-31]\nThe greatest \n    means of protecting one\u2019s chastity is by directing one's desire in the way \n    in which Allaah has permitted, which is by getting married if possible. If a \n    person is attracted to a specific individual, then he can marry that person, \n    as it was narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cThere is nothing like marriage for two who love one \n    another.\u201d Narrated by Ibn Maajah (1847) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani \n    in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah.\u00a0\nIf a person \n    wants to get married in order to guard his chastity, without being attracted \n    to a specific person, then this is easier. In that case you can look to get \n    married quickly and overcome the obstacles that are in your way. There is \n    nothing wrong with seeking to keep yourself chaste. You can also seek the \n    help of people you trust in trying to achieve that, such as a righteous \n    sister or relative, or a mother who understands your needs.\u00a0\nUntil you \n    can manage to do that, keep yourself busy, mentally and physically, with \n    acts of worship and obedience, and do not give the shaytaan any opportunity \n    to reach your heart or distract you. The Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cO young men, whoever among you can afford it, \n    let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and \n    guarding one\u2019s chastity. And whoever cannot afford it should fast, for it \n    will be a shield for him.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1905) and Muslim \n    (1400).\u00a0\nYou should \n    also note that one of the most effective remedies for one who is affliected \n    with that is to turn sincerely to the One who answers the prayer of the \n    needy when he calls upon Him and to persist in seeking His help with \n    submission and humility. This is the first step, then he should strive to \n    remain chaste and conceal the feelings that are in his heart.\u00a0\nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201c \u2026 whoever seeks to \n    be independent of means, Allaah will make him independent, and whoever is \n    patient Allaah will bestow patience upon him, and no one is ever given \n    anything better and more generous than patience.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari \n    (6470) and Muslim (1053).\u00a0\nYou know \n    that the other party does not share your feelings, and you know that there \n    is no way you can marry him, and what you are doing is haraam and foolish. \n    You still have your life ahead of you and it will be easy for you to find \n    halaal love from a righteous husband, so do not concern yourself with that \n    which Allaah has forbidden to you.\u00a0\nIn the \n    answer to question no. 21677 we have explained the best way to treat \n    anxiety, and given some important advice which you have to ponder. We also \n    state there that it is permissible to seek treatment from a psychologist, \n    but we do not think that you need to do that, because your problem is well \n    known and you are the cause of it; the remedy for you is what we have \n    mentioned and suggested above.\u00a0\nIn the \n    answer to question no. 10254 we have discussed the case of a woman who was \n    in love with a young man at school and wanted a solution. Look at this \n    answer too, and perhaps you may benefit from it.\u00a0\nWe ask \n    Allaah to make faith dear to you and to make kufr, immorality and sin \n    hateful to you, and to guide you to the best of words and deeds, and to \n    bless you with a righteous husband and good offspring.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah \n    knows best."

This is something for which you should be thanked, and it is \n    indicative of strong religious commitment and deep wisdom.\u00a0\nYour helping \n    your fianc\u00e9 to go ahead with the marriage is helping him with his religious \n    commitment and faith, and this is one of the greatest acts of worship, and \n    is something that is regarded as praiseworthy in Islam. It is one of the \n    best ways of spending one\u2019s money.\u00a0\nIt was \n    narrated that Thawbaan said: When the verse \u201cAnd \n    those who hoard up gold and silver\u201d [al-Tawbah 9:34] \n    was revealed, we were with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) on one of his journeys. One of his companions said: This has \n    been revealed concerning gold and silver; if we knew of any better kind of \n    wealth we would acquire it. He said: \u201cThe best of it is a tongue that \n    remembers Allaah, a heart that is grateful and a believing wife who will \n    help him with his faith.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3094) and Ibn Maajah \n    (1856). In Ibn Maajah\u2019s report it says: \u201cwho will help one of you with \n    regard to the Hereafter.\u201d The hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi \n    and as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\nShaykh \n    al-Mubaarakfoori (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cA believing \n    wife who will help him with his faith\u201d means with his religious commitment, \n    by reminding him to pray and fast and to do other acts of worship, and will \n    prevent him from committing zina and other haraam deeds.\u00a0\nTuhfat \n    al-Ahwadhi (8/390)\u00a0\nUndoubtedly \n    marriage helps a man to obey Allaah and keeps him away from haraam things \n    such as looking and listening, and protects him from falling into zina.\u00a0\nThis is in \n    general terms, but you should pay attention to some things, including the \n    following:\u00a0\n\n    1-The man\u2019s seriousness with \n    regard to marriage and how hard is is striving to meet the requirements of \n    marriage. Because some people depend on the help of others and are not \n    serious about doing what is required of them.\n\n    2-If your fianc\u00e9 is serious and \n    he can afford some of the expenses of marriage but not all of them, there is \n    nothing wrong with your helping him with some of what he needs, such as the \n    wife buying some of the furniture and household equipment, or paying for \n    some of the wedding expenses.\n\n    3-The fianc\u00e9 is a \u201cstranger\u201d \n    (non-mahram) to his fianc\u00e9e until the marriage contract is done, so during \n    the engagement period it is not permissible for him to be alone with her, \n    shake hands with her or go out with her, rather he is like any other \n    stranger. See question no. \n    2572.\nWe ask \n    Allaah to help you both to do that which He loves and which pleases Him, and \n    to bless you with good offspring.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah \n    knows best."

End quote from al-Fataawa al-Kubra \n    (3/130).\u00a0\nWhat the \n    sister of your adoptive father has done by marrying a Christian man is a \n    great wrong, and it is an invalid marriage which must be annulled; it is not \n    permissible for her to stay with this man under any circumstances. She also \n    has to repent to Allaah and beseech Him to forgive her and pardon her.\u00a0\nIt is not \n    permissible for you to live with her in the presence of the husband \n    mentioned, because that involves remaining silent about this great wrong, as \n    well as what you have mentioned about him drinking alcohol.\u00a0\nAll of this \n    is in addition to the fact that this woman is not really your paternal aunt, \n    so it is not permissible for you to enter upon her or be alone with her, let \n    alone live with her in the same house!\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nYou should \n    look for permissible work by means of which you can take care of yourself \n    and your family. Be sure that provision comes from Allaah and that there are \n    many means of acquiring provision, although some people are unaware of that. \n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cBy \n    Allaah, for one of you to go out and carry firewood on his back and sell it \n    is better for him than to ask a man who may give him (something) or withhold \n    from him.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1470) and Muslim (1042).\u00a0\nYou have an \n    example in \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan ibn \u2018Awf (may Allaah be pleased with him). \n    Al-Bukhaari (2048) narrated that \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan ibn \u2018Awf (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) said: When we came to Madeenah, the Messenger of Allaah \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) established brotherhood \n    between me and Sa\u2019d ibn al-Rabee\u2019. Sa\u2019d ibn al-Rabee\u2019 said: I am the \n    wealthiest of the Ansaar, and I will give you half of my wealth. And see \n    which of my two wives you want; I will give her up for\u00a0 you and when she \n    becomes permissible (after the divorce and \u2018iddah), you can marry her.\u00a0\n\u2018Abd \n    al-Rahmaan said to him: I have no need of that. Is there any market in which \n    trading is done?\u00a0\nHe said: The \n    market of Qaynuqa\u2019.\u00a0\nThe next \n    morning, \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan went there and brought some dried yoghurt and ghee, \n    then he went there the next day, and soon \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan came with traces \n    of yellow perfume on him.\u00a0\nThe \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cHave you got married?\u201d He said: Yes. He said: \u201cTo whom?\u201d He said: To an \n    Ansaari woman. He said: \u201cHow much (dowry) did you give her?\u201d He said: The \n    weight of a date stone in gold (or a date stone of gold). The Prophet ( \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cGive a wedding feast, \n    even if it is with just one sheep.\u201d\u00a0\nSo seek the \n    help of Allaah, and do not feel helpless; ask Allaah to make you independent \n    of means by His bounty.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah \n    knows best."

        "question": "Is my marriage decreed? Do obedience and sin alter the divine decree?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe divine decree means that Allah has decreed all things from eternity, and He knows that they will happen at the times that are known to Him, in specific ways as He has written and willed. They will happen as He has decreed them and created them.\u00a0\nBelief in the divine decree is one of the pillars of faith without which a person\u2019s faith is not valid, and belief in the divine decree is not valid unless the Muslim believes in the four principles of the divine decree which are:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Belief that Allah knows all things in general and in details from eternity, and not even an atom is hidden from Him in heaven or on earth.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 Belief that Allah wrote all that in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz, fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Belief in the effective will of Allah and His all-encompassing power. Nothing happens in this universe, good or bad, except by His will, may He be glorified.\u00a0\n4 \u2013 Belief that everything is created by Allah; He is the Creator of all things and the Creator of their attributes and actions.\u00a0\nFor more details on this, please see the answers to questions no. 49004 and 34732.\u00a0\nThese details will explain to you that Allah has decreed from eternity who will be your family, who will be your wife, and who will be your children. Everything that has happened and will happen in the universe is decreed by Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainments of all things before their creation as written in the Book of Decrees __Al\u2011Lawh Al\u2011Mahfooz)\u201d\u00a0[al-Qamar 54:49]\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThis does not mean that a person has no will in this world, or that a person should not strive to apply the means of attaining happiness and soundness. Allah has created a means to reach every objective. Whoever wants to have a child has to get married. Whoever wants to be happy in the Hereafter has to strive hard for it, and follow the path of guidance. Whoever wants wealth has to work hard. \u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cKnow that everyone will be guided to do that for which he was created. Whoever is meant to be one of the people of happiness will be guided to do the deeds of the people of happiness, and whoever is meant to be one of the people of doom will be guided to do the deeds of the people of doom.\u201d Agreed upon.\u00a0\nAllah does not tell anyone the details of what will happen to him, good or bad. Hence everyone has to strive to bring goodness to himself and ward off harm from himself. It is not wise to travel a path that leads to the opposite of what he wants and then say, \u201cI will never get anything but that which has been decreed for me.\u201d No one should sit in his house and then say: \u201cI will never get any provision but that which has been decreed for me.\u201d No one should eat rotten food and then say: \u201cNothing will happen to me but that which Allah has decreed for me.\u201d These are things which if anyone does them or says them, he would be regarded as insane and he is indeed insane.\u00a0\nWith regard to marriage in particular, the Muslim knows that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged marriage to one who is religiously committed. This means that he should look for and seek out one who is religiously committed. No wise man would say \u201cI will never try to do that\u201d because if he is offered a woman who is insane or ugly or old or of bad character, he would never accept her as a wife. He will never say that he will marry the first woman he sees or the first woman who is offered to him. This supports what we have said, that he will turn away from some women and will think about others and will hesitate about some of them, and so on. If, after looking, thinking, consulting others and praying istikhaarah, he chooses a woman who is suitable for him, he will know that what Allah decrees happens and what He does not decree does not happen, so he should hope that his Lord will guide him and decree for him that which is best for him and dearest to Allah. Then if it happens, and his Lord decrees that he be given it or it be withheld, and whether it is in accordance with his desires or not, he has to think positively of his Lord and realize that Allah does not decree anything for His grateful, patient, believing slave but that which is good. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cHow wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good and this does not apply to anyone except the believer. If something good happens to him he is grateful, and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him he is patient, and that is good for him.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (2999).\u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 1804.\u00a0\nThirdly:\n\u00a0With regard to the effect of obedience and sin on changing the divine decree, you know that that which is in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz can never be changed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.\u201d Narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi (2516), from the hadeeth of Ibn \u2018Abbaas. As for the pages which are in the hands of the angels, Allah may command His angels to change it because of an act of worship that a Muslim does or because of a sin that he commits, but in the end it will not be anything other than that which was decreed from eternity. This is indicated by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u201cAllah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the Book (Al\u2011Lawh Al\u2011Mahfooz)\u201d\u00a0[al-Ra\u2019d 13:39]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to do some acts of worship which have an effect of increasing a person\u2019s lifespan, such as upholding ties of kinship, and he said that du\u2019aa\u2019 can repel the divine decree. What this means is that Allah knew from the beginning that His slave So and so would do this act of worship, so He decreed for him a long life or a blessed provision, and au contraire a person may commit a sin because of which he is deprived of provision, and Allah knew that and decreed it from eternity and decreed it according to His knowledge. Allah does not compel anyone to obey Him or disobey Him.\u00a0\n\u00a0The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) summed this up in one hadeeth:\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Thawbaan said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cNothing increases one\u2019s lifespan except righteousness and nothing repels the divine decree except du\u2019aa\u2019, and a man may be deprived of provision by a sin that he commits.\u201d\u00a0\nAl-Busayri said in Misbaah al-Zujaajah (no. 33)\u00a0\nI asked our Shaykh Abu\u2019l-Fadl al-\u2018Iraaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) about this hadeeth and he said: This is a hasan hadeeth. End quote.\u00a0\nIt was also classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever would like his rizq (provision) to be increased and his life to be extended, should uphold the ties of kinship.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari (5640) and Muslim (2557).\u00a0\nAl-Tabaraani narrated with his isnaad from Abu \u2018Uthmaan al-Nahdi, that \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab said when he was circumambulating the Ka\u2019bah and weeping: \u201cO Allah, if You have decreed that I should be doomed or commit sin, then erase it, for You erase whatever You will, and You confirm (whatever You will), and with You is the Mother of the Book, so make it happiness and forgiveness.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Taabi\u2019i Abu Waa\u2019il Shaqeeq ibn Salamah often used to supplicate with these words: \u201cO Allah, if You have decreed that we be doomed, then erase it and decree that we be blessed. If You have decreed that we be blessed, then confirm it for us, for You erase whatever You will and You You confirm (whatever You will), and with You is the Mother of the Book.\u201d (Tafseer al-Tabari, 7/398).\u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 43021.\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nYour love for a girl who is of good character and religiously committed means that you must beware of falling into anything that is forbidden in sharee\u2019ah, such as corresponding with her, speaking to her or being alone with her. We do not advise you to pray to Allah to make her like you, rather we advise you to pray that Allah will bless you with a righteous wife. If you see a woman to whom the description of a righteous woman applies, then go ahead and propose marriage to her. There is no need to specify a particular woman who may reciprocate your love and then you may both do something that is contrary to sharee\u2019ah but it may not be easy for you to get married. Asking Allah to help you to find a righteous wife is better for you, in our opinion.\u00a0\nTo be honest with you, we think that forming an attachment to that girl is a sign of idleness. What we mean is that you are not keeping yourself busy with important things, so the Shaytaan is filling your heart with things that will harm you and affect your religious commitment, or things that go against your best interests.\u00a0\nIbn al-Jawzi narrated that Ibn \u2018Aa\u2019ishah said: I said to a doctor who was highly proficient: What is love? He said: The occupation of an empty heart. [Dhamm al-Hawa 290].\u00a0\nBut tell me, by Allah, are you seriously looking for a suitable wife right now?\u00a0\nIf you are serious about it, would you really go ahead and get married now?\u00a0\nIf you are serious about getting married now, are your circumstances suited for that?\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Muhammad ibn Maslamah said: I proposed marriage to a woman, then I hid and waited to see her until I saw her among some date palm trees that belonged to her. It was said to him: Do you do such a thing when you are a companion of the Messenger of Allah (S)? He said, \u201cWhen Allah causes a man to propose to a woman, there is nothing wrong with him looking at her.\u201d\nNarrated by Ibn Maajah (1864); classed as saheeh by al-Albani.\u00a0\nLook at how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made permission to look conditional upon the intent to marry. \u00a0\nThe scholars said: This is an exception to the prohibition on looking at a non-mahram woman. Hence it is only justified in cases of necessity when it is hoped that the marriage will go ahead.\u00a0\nIbn al-Qattaan (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the one who is proposing marriage to a woman knows that she will not marry him, and that her guardian will not agree to it, then it is not permissible for him to look at her, even if he has already asked her family for her hand in marriage, because looking is only permitted so that it might be a cause of the marriage going ahead. If he is sure that it will not happen, then the basic principle that looking is not allowed remains in effect.\u00a0\nAl-Nazr fi Ahkam al-Nazr, 391.\u00a0\nIt is well known that wanting to get married on the part of one who cannot afford it or whose circumstances do not permit it at the present time is a kind of fooling about and wasting time, which distracts the heart from useful things, and may even cause harm.\u00a0\nWhen you are serious, then seek the help of Allah and ask Him to guide you. If she remains as she is, and you have prayed istikhaarah asking your Lord for guidance, then go ahead and propose to her. Otherwise, there are many other women like her, so seek one who is religiously committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust!\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to guide you to that which will please Him, and to help you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him, and to bless you with a righteous wife and good offspring.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Smacking and Pinching a One-Year Old Child",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This manner \n    of treating your son is very strange. There follows some advice, perhaps \n    Allaah will cause you to benefit from it: \u00a0\n1 \u2013 A small \n    child needs food, drink, sleep and air, and love and compassion are among \n    the best kinds of food that the parents can give their child. Giving \n    physical food without this emotional nourishment is neglect of the child\u2019s \n    natural need for both.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 Showing \n    compassion to the child brings positive results. Hence we are advised to \n    breastfeed the child naturally so that the goodness of food and drink will \n    be combined with the goodness of being in the proper place, which is his \n    mother\u2019s lap. Hence modern science has discovered the great effects that \n    mother\u2019s milk has on the physical and emotional development of the child and \n    \u2013 conversely \u2013 the negative effects of depriving the child of his mother\u2019s \n    milk and care. Societies in which violence towards children is widespread \n    have become societies in which crime and evildoing has become widespread.\u00a0\nSome \n    sociologists have stated that the parent\u2019s ongoing smacking and rebuking of \n    their children leads to psychological complexes in the child and increases \n    family violence. This leads to a problem which is difficult to confront, \n    because violence in the home leads to violence in society, which becomes \n    widespread, and the victims of this violence in turn inflict psychological \n    terrorism on individuals, which threatens the security of the society.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 The one \n    who is harsh towards his children is going against sound human nature \n    (fitrah) and sharee\u2019ah (Islamic law). Allaah has created people with love for their children. Hence Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) did not enjoin parents to care for their children in this \n    manner (because it is innate). On the contrary, Islam enjoins children to \n    care for their fathers and mothers, and warns them against disobeying them.\u00a0\nAs for going \n    against sharee\u2019ah: smacking children and not showing compassion towards them \n    is indicative of a lack of mercy in the heart of the one who does that, \n    which is a sign of being deprived of the mercy of Allaah, may He be \n    exalted.\u00a0\nIt was \n    narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed \n    al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali when al-Aqra\u2019 ibn Haabis al-Tameemi was sitting with him. \n    Al-Aqra\u2019 said: I have ten children and I have never kissed one of them. The \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cThe one who does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by \n    al-Bukhaari (5651) and Muslim (2318).\u00a0\nIt was \n    narrated that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: A Bedouin \n    came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and \n    said: Do you kiss children? We do not kiss them. The Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhat can I do for you if Allaah has \n    removed mercy from your heart?\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5652).\u00a0\nOur \n    Prophet\u2019s compassion towards children was so great that he would shorten the \n    prayer because of their crying, out of compassion towards them and their \n    mothers.\u00a0\nIt was \n    narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cI start to pray intending to make it long, then I \n    hear the crying of a child, so I make it short because of his mother\u2019s \n    distress.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by \n    al-Bukhaari (677) and Muslim (470).\u00a0\n4 \u2013 You \n    should understand that you are falling short in raising your child by doing \n    this, and you may see the evil consequences of it in this world before the \n    Hereafter. How can such treatment produce a good upbringing and a sound, \n    righteous child?\u00a0\n5 \u2013 You \n    should understand that a child\u2019s crying does not happen for no reason, \n    rather every kind of crying has its cause. So you should feel compassion \n    towards him when he is crying, so that you will be motivated to find the \n    cause, such as sickness or hunger. You should not be quick to smack him or \n    pinch him or mistreat him, lest you add another reason, which is crying \n    because of pain.\u00a0\nA \n    psychologist said: Psychologists think that crying, like other behaviour, is \n    usually a means of relieving tension. So crying, screaming, yelling, \n    breaking toys and possessions and fidgeting are all ways of expressing \n    tension that is connected to anger or grief, because the frustration that \n    the child is faced with may create aggressiveness in him, so crying is a way \n    to expressing this aggression and getting rid of it. Not crying may be \n    indicative of suppression of this aggression, which may then move to the \n    subconscious where the child may forget it, but it will not be hidden \n    completely and it may manifest itself when he grows older in the form of \n    sickness, anxiety, and aggression whenever the child finds an opportunity.\u00a0\n6 \u2013 You \n    should also note that shaking a child may cause mental or physical \n    disability, so how about if he is smacked?\u00a0\nAmerican \n    researchers have warned that shaking children may cause death or severe \n    mental disability. Researchers have explained that destruction of the brain \n    may occur when a child is shaken violently. It may cause them to die or may \n    cause nerve damage and mental disability, such as learning disabilities, \n    mental paralysis, blindness, convulsions, difficulty in reading, attention \n    deficit disorder and other educational problems.\u00a0\nOne female \n    specialist said: Infants\u2019 crying is annoying and disturbing, but it is their \n    only way to express their needs, so first of all we need to find out the \n    reason why the infant is crying and hasten to tend to it, instead of shaking \n    him. She emphasized that boys are more likely to be harmed than girls, as \n    57% of victims are male.\u00a0\nResearchers \n    noted that shaking a child violently when he cries or throwing him up in the \n    air and catching him, or shaking him violently on one's knees or jogging \n    with him are all factors that may lead to brain damage, as the result of the \n    brain being knocked against the skull, which causes blood vessels to break \n    and leads to haemorrhaging in the brain. Experts have pointed out that \n    nursing infants and newborns are the most likely to suffer disability \n    resulting from shaking, in comparison to older children.\u00a0\nConclusion: \n    You have to fear Allaah and not go against the fitrah (sound human nature) \n    or the laws of Allaah. You should be compassionate towards your beautiful \n    child and do not cause him to be lost or disabled, then you would have to \n    live your whole life with this mistake. Look at the life of the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions, and let them \n    be a good example for you. \u00a0\nStrive to \n    make du\u2019aa\u2019 (supplication) and recite ruqyah (incantations) for yourself, your family and your child, lest you be afflicted by the evil eye or witchcraft. Ruqyah is beneficial in all cases. \u00a0\nWe hope that \n    you will be guided aright and that your child will be safe from harm. We ask Allaah to help you to raise him soundly.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "His wife\u2019s family stipulated that he has to become rich before they will send his wife and children back to him",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe wife has \n    no right to go out of her husband\u2019s house without his permission, and her \n    family have no right to help her or encourage her to do that, because her \n    leaving and not returning constitute disobedience towards her husband and \n    rebellion against him which makes her guilty of nashooz (wilful defiance).\u00a0\nTheir taking \n    their daughter away is another act of wrongdoing, and their stipulating that \n    you must become very rich before they will return your wife to you is \n    wrongdoing upon wrongdoing. They have no right to do any such thing. When \n    they accepted the marriage and the marriage contract was done and the \n    husband paid the mahr, they were obliged to hand the wife over to the \n    husband, so how about when she was with him and had borne him a child!\u00a0\nYou do not \n    say anything about your financial situation, and whether you have enough to \n    spend on your wife or not. Are you hard up or do you have enough to spend on \n    yourself and your family? \u00a0\nThe majority \n    of scholars are of the view that the husband\u2019s inability to spend on his \n    wife is sufficient grounds for separating them, if the wife requests that. \n    But if she accepts it and does not ask for separation, then no one has the \n    right to separate them. See al-Mawsoo\u2019ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/254 and \n    29/58).\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nYou should \n    take the following steps to get your wife back:\u00a0\n\n    1-Reconcile between yourself and \n    Allaah, may He be exalted, so that you can reconcile between yourself and \n    other people.\n\n    2-Ask Allaah to divert harm from \n    you, and to suffice you against the evil of all evildoers.\n\n    3-Try to reach an understanding \n    with your wife\u2019s family and find out what their attitude really is.

In another case, a woman suffered the \n    same accident, and now religiously-committed brothers are coming to propose \n    marriage to her. They are both confused about their situation. Which is \n    better \u2013 should the married woman tell her husband before consummation of \n    the marriage or should she keep quiet? And should the one who is not married \n    yet go ahead with it, lest it become known and people think badly of her? \n    This happened when she was small and was not yet accountable. Or is this \n    regarded as deceit and cheating? Should she tell those who come to propose \n    or not, for the sake of getting married? \u00a0\nThey \n    replied: there is no shar\u2019i reason why she should not conceal it, then if he \n    asks her after consummation of the marriage, she can tell him the truth.

The \n    most correct view is that it is permissible, by analogy with these three, \n    based on the reason that is to be understood from the hadeeth, which is \n    necessity. End quote.\u00a0\nSharh \n    Muslim (10/236)\u00a0\nIbn \u2018Abd \n    al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIn my view, \n    the meaning of this hadeeth also includes keeping dogs if there is a purpose \n    in doing so and for warding off harm, if a person needs that. End quote.\nAl-Tamheed \n    (14/219)\u00a0\nFor this \n    woman to keep a trained dog \u2013 when there is no one who can help her, take \n    care of her and protect her \u2013 is more essential than guarding fields and \n    livestock.\u00a0\nShaykh \n    Yoosuf ibn \u2018Abd al-Haadi said, quoting from one of the scholars:\u00a0\nThere is no \n    doubt that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave \n    permission for keeping hunting dogs, according to numerous ahaadeeth, and he \n    said that the reward of the one who keeps a dog for hunting is not reduced. \n    In other ahaadeeth he gave permission for keeping dogs for herding \n    livestock, dogs for herding sheep and dogs for guarding the fields. Thus it \n    is known that the reason for allowing this is people\u2019s interests, and the \n    ruling is based on the reasons for and against. If there is an interest to \n    be served, then it is permissible (to keep a dog). Some interests may be \n    more important and greater than that of farming, and some interests may be \n    equal to those mentioned by the Lawgiver. There is no doubt that fruits are \n    equivalent to crops in the fields, and cattle are equivalent to sheep, and \n    chickens and geese \u2013 (as a dog is needed) in order to keep the fox away from \n    them \u2013 are equivalent to sheep too. Undoubtedly the fear of thieves \n    attacking a person, and keeping a dog to warn against them and wake one up \n    is even more important than that. Islam seeks to protect interests and ward \n    off harm. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Ighraab fi Ahkaam al-Kilaab (p. 106, 107).\u00a0\nBased on \n    this, there is nothing wrong with this woman keeping this trained dog until \n    Allaah provides her with a way out, such as her living with a Muslim family \n    who can take care of her for the sake of Allaah, or her marrying a Muslim \n    man who may seek reward with Allaah for looking after her.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows \n    best."

        "question": "His problems with his maternal uncle caused him to fail his exam; can he ask him for compensation?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We advise \n    you to forget what happened in the past between you and your uncle. We think \n    that you have given the matter more attention than it deserves. Your uncle\u2019s \n    entering the house without asking permission is not permissible for him, \n    even if he is entering the house of his sister. Seeking permission is \n    obligatory in his case, and your father\u2019s approval of your uncle visiting \n    his house is what matters. He agreed to that, as is suggested by the fact \n    that he continued to visit him for such a long time. The fact that you did \n    not take the exam that year and you failed is something for which you must \n    bear responsibility. Most Muslim families have their problems, and the wise \n    man is the one who knows how to deal with these problems and tries to solve \n    the problems or reduce them. We do not think that your giving up your \n    studying for the exam served any purpose, and you must bear responsibility \n    for that. You should not keep on thinking about what is past, for that will \n    cause psychological problems for yourself and your family. Forget about it \n    and get on with your work; seek the help of Allaah and uphold the ties of \n    kinship and give advice to those who are erring. Do not pay any attention to \n    what the shaytaan makes attractive to you, namely the idea of bringing a \n    case against your uncle and taking financial compensation from him. In \n    addition to the fact that this case may fail in court, it will cause more \n    rifts in your family, and we would not like you to be the cause of that. \n    Mercy should prevail over anger and the desire for revenge. We ask Allaah to \n    open your heart and to bring you and your family together in goodness.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah \n    is the Source of strength."

        "question": "His mother treated him badly after he got married",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We ask \n    Allaah to help you to honour your mother and treat her kindly, to set her \n    straight and to reconcile between you and help you both to obey Him and \n    please Him.\u00a0\nWhat you are \n    suffering may be caused by feelings of jealousy on your mother\u2019s part, or \n    because she feels that she has lost you after you got married and someone \n    else has taken possession of you. Some mothers have these feelings when \n    their sons get married, but they are inappropriate feelings and she should \n    strive to rid herself of them.\u00a0\nYou should \n    try to help her to go back to the way she was before. You can do this in \n    several ways:\u00a0\n\n    1-Strive to treat her kindly, by \n    honouring her, taking care of her and making her feel that you still care \n    about her as you did before and are still keen to respond to her wishes.\n\n    2-Avoid praising your wife or \n    paying her attention in front of your mother, but still give your wife her \n    rights to good treatment and respect, doing that out of your mother\u2019s sight, \n    until your mother\u2019s situation\u00a0 improves and things go back to normal.\n\n    3-Encourage your wife to get \n    close to your mother, by speaking to her, taking care of her, giving her \n    gifts and so on.\n\n    4-Be patient with her insults, \n    swearing and throwing you out, for you are commanded to honour her, and it \n    is not permissible for you to respond to her bad treatment in kind. If you \n    bear that with patience, then you will find a way out, for good consequences \n    are for those who are patient, and support comes with patience, and with \n    hardship comes ease. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cRepel \n    (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allaah orders the faithful \n    believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat \n    them badly) then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will \n    become) as though he was a close friend\u201d [Fussilat 41:34].\u00a0 Every time \n    she mistreats you, you should hasten to be kind, honour her and treat her \n    well. That guarantees that the negative feelings in her heart will go away, \n    in sha Allaah.\n\n    5-Pray for her, that Allaah will \n    guide her aright and set the situation straight. She is the person who most \n    deserves your du\u2019aa\u2019s and kind treatment. No matter what you do, you can \n    never repay her for her kindness and previous good treatment. \n    \n\n    6-Strive to be a good example to \n    your siblings, so that they may learn from you the best way of dealing with \n    this problem which may happen to them too after they get married. Be an \n    example of patience, good treatment and respect. Beware of letting the \n    shaytaan gradually make you scorn her or be rude to her or rebuke her, for \n    you will never find any good in such things. Allaah says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \u201csay not to them a word of \n    disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour\u201d [al-Isra\n    17:23].\n\n    7-You should discuss the problem \n    with one of your siblings, for perhaps there are other aspects of the \n    problem that you are not aware of, or you have done something that has made \n    your mother angry without realizing it. Finding out the reason will make it \n    easier for you to deal with the problem.\nWe ask \n    Allaah to guide us and you.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah \n    knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on one who puts something in his back passage, and how can he be treated?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\n\n    \u00a0We ask Allaah to cleanse his heart and body, and to guide \n    him to the best of attitudes, words and deeds.\n\n    \u00a0Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    It should be noted that this action of his comes under the \n    heading of perversion. It is not by doing such actions that the Muslim \n    expresses gratitude to his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and it is \n    not in this manner that the Muslim will preserve the great blessings that \n    Allaah has bestowed upon him. He should give up these perverse actions which \n    go against the sound nature that Allaah has instilled in man, and go against \n    all revealed laws, and for which everyone of sound mind will hate him.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\n\n    It should be noted that such perverse actions are a sign of \n    an idle mind, and he has to give up the things that led him to behave in the \n    manner of perverts. Perhaps among these reasons \u2013 and the greatest of them \u2013 \n    is having a heart that is devoid of faith, and a soul that is devoid of \n    shyness before Allaah and His angels, as well as watching haraam TV series, \n    movies and perverse actions, and having a life that is devoid of useful \n    work, not wanting to get married and liking to stay alone, and many other \n    such reasons which may cause a man to fall into bad ways.\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    He should hasten to give up this perverse action and repent \n    to his Lord. He must strive to furnish his heart with faith and fill his \n    life with righteous deeds and actions that will benefit his spiritual and \n    worldly interests. He must be keen to hasten to protect himself by means of \n    marriage to a righteous woman who will help him to remain chaste and obey \n    his Lord, and he must stop watching haraam things or staying alone which \n    makes it easy for him to fall into immoral ways.\u00a0\n\n    Fifthly:\u00a0\n\n    He should also note that he is causing physical and \n    psychological harm to himself. He will see the negative consequences of what \n    he is doing on his body after a while, and he will see how much \n    psychological pain he will suffer, which will deprive him of sleep and \n    prevent him from enjoying his food and drink. He will see how much he will \n    suffer of physical pain which will prevent him from relieving himself with \n    ease, and how much he will suffer of infections and ulcers if he persists in \n    this perverse action of his.\u00a0\n\n    Sixthly:\n\n    \u00a0He needs someone to explain to him that what he is doing is \n    haraam, and to remind him and exhort him (to follow the right path).\u00a0\n\n    The one who is afflicted with any of these haraam actions has \n    to remember two things:\u00a0\n\n    1-To feel shy before Allaah and \n    his angels and before himself too.\n\n    2-To fear death and to fear lest \n    Allaah causes him to die when he is doing that to himself.\n\n    With regard to shyness:\u00a0\n\n    We know that he believes that Allaah can see him in all \n    situations, but perhaps he forgets about that at the time when he is \n    committing this sin. If this belief becomes established in his heart, with \n    time he will begin to feel shy of Allaah seeing him falling short in \n    obedience or committing a sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cKnows he not that Allaah does see (what he does)?\u201d\n\n    [al-\u2018Alaq 96:14]\n\n    \u201cAnd indeed We have created man, and We know what his \n    ownself whispers to him. And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein (by \n    Our Knowledge)\u201d\n\n    [Qaaf 50:16]\n\u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mas\u2019ood \n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Feel shy before Allaah is the true \n    sense of the word. They said: We feel shy before Allaah. He said: That is \n    not the way; the one who feels shy before Allaah in the true sense of the \n    word should be watchful of his mind and whatever enters it, and he should be \n    watchful of his stomach and whatever enters it, and he should remember death \n    and decay. Whoever hopes for the reward in the Hereafter would shun the \n    temptation of this world. Whoever does that is shy before Allaah in the true \n    sense of the word.\n\n    Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, \n    1724.\u00a0\n\n    He believes that Allaah has appointed noble angels over him \n    who can see him and hear him, and they record what he does of good deeds and \n    bad deeds, and they never leave him in any situation. If he feels shy of \n    them, he will give up the perverse actions that he is doing.\n\n    \u00a0Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBut verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of \n    mankind) to watch you,\n\n    11.\u00a0Kiraaman (Honourable) Kaatibeen \u2014writing down (your \n    deeds),\n\n    12.\u00a0They know all that you do\u201d\n\n    [al-Infitaar 82:10-12]\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\ni.e., feel shy before \n    these honourable watchers and respect them; spare them from seeing you do \n    anything which you would not want those who are like you to see you doing, \n    for the angels are offended by that which offends the sons of Adam. If the \n    son of Adam would be offended by one who commits immoral actions and sins in \n    front of him, even if he might also do something similar, then how do you \n    think the honourable recording angels will be offended?\n\n    Al-Jawaab al-Kaafi, p. 75\u00a0\n\n    One of the salaf said: With you are those who never leave \n    you, so feel shy of them and respect them.\u00a0\n\n    He would feel shy of doing that in front of people, so how \n    can he not feel shy before Allaah and His angels?\u00a0\n\n    With regard to death:\u00a0\n\n    He should remember that he does not know when the Angel of \n    Death will come to him to take his soul, and he does not know the situation \n    that he will be in at that time. Would he like his death to come now, before \n    he repents? Would he like his soul to be taken when he is doing this \n    perverse action? Does he not know that deeds are judged according to a \n    person\u2019s final deeds? Does he not know that Allaah will raise the people in \n    the same condition that they died? What will his situation be when he \n    emerges from his grave on the Day of Resurrection? What will he say to his \n    Lord when he stands before Him?\u00a0\n\n    One of the salaf said: There are two things that put an end \n    of enjoyment of this world for me: remembering death, and remembering the \n    standing before Allaah, may He be exalted.\u00a0\n\n    \u2018Umar ibn \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez (may Allaah have mercy on him) used \n    to gather the scholars and they would talk about death, the Resurrection and \n    the Hereafter, and they would weep so much that it was as if there was a \n    funeral taking place before them.\u00a0\n\n    One of the salaf said: The one who remembers death is \n    honoured with three things: hastening to repent, contentment of heart and \n    energy for worship. Whoever forgets death is punished with three things: \n    delaying repentance, not being content with enough, and laziness in worship. \n    \u00a0\n\n    It should be noted that a good end is only granted to the one \n    who was righteous both inwardly and outwardly, and a bad end is given to one \n    who was inwardly corrupt, or who persisted in major sins. It should be noted \n    that a man will die as he lived, and his life will end in the manner that he \n    persisted in and did not give up.\u00a0\n\n    It was said to a man who was in the throes of death: \u201cSay \n    Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah.\u201d And he started singing, because he used to be \n    infatuated by singing. It was said to a drinker when he was dying: \u201cSay \n    Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah,\u201d and he started saying: \u201cDrink and pour me \n    some.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Perhaps what we have mentioned is sufficient to make him give \n    up his evil deeds and come back to his Lord, and to ask Him to help him and \n    guide him. We have given more advice and suggestions in the answer to \n    question no. 20068, which we \n    hope he will read too.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to guide him and set his affairs straight.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    To Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return. This, by \n    Allaah, is something that would make one weep. Have things become so bad \n    that the fitrah has been turned upside down and a father feels such things \n    towards his daughter?\u00a0\n\n    There is no doubt that this father is mentally ill and \n    sexually deviant, and he needs urgent and intense treatment for his heart \n    and mind, both psychological and physical treatment.\u00a0\n\n    For yourself, you need to take measures to make it difficult \n    for your father to find any opportunity or time to seduce you or interfere \n    with you. Do not be alone with him in the house, and lock the door when you \n    are in your room. Do not let him enter upon you on his own. All of these \n    measures will reduce the opportunities for interfering. But in order to stop \n    this problem altogether, that can only be done by getting treatment for your \n    father, or telling everyone about the problem. You have to realize that you \n    need to be prepared for the effects that disclosing the situation will have \n    on you and on the whole family, but this is better than things staying as \n    they are now.\u00a0\n\n    Your mother has to fear Allaah; her not caring about what her \n    husband is doing is something for which she will be called to account and \n    she will be regarded as a partner in his crime, because she could do \n    something to stop him doing this evil deed.\u00a0\n\n    You can seek the help of one of your wise relatives to \n    intervene in this matter and stop the deviation of this sick father.\u00a0\n\n    Undoubtedly these sick actions on the part of some fathers \n    have their causes, and no one can deal with a problem without knowing its \n    causes and how to treat it. Some of these causes have to do with the father, \n    some with the daughter herself and some with the time and place in which the \n    family lives.\u00a0\n\n    The causes of this deviation that have to do with the father \n    include the following:\u00a0\n\n    1-Weak faith, lack of fear of \n    Allaah and a failure to realize that He is watching.\n\n    2-Addiction to alcohol or drugs.\n\n    3-Mental or psychological \n    illness.\n\n    4-Watching provocative shows on \n    satellite channels, or looking at permissive pictures\n\n    5-Too much free time\n\n    The causes that may have to do with the daughter include:\u00a0\n\n    1-Careless in the manner of \n    dress. Many girls wear tight and short clothes in front of their fathers and \n    brothers, which goes against sharee\u2019ah and may provoke evil desires in sick \n    souls that have been stirred up by satellite channels and permissive \n    pictures.\n\n    2-Carelessness in some actions, \n    such as kissing on the mouth or provocative touching, or sleeping in the \n    same bed or under the same cover as her father or brother. These actions are \n    also contrary to sharee\u2019ah and provoke evil.\n\n    If we want to deal with such deeds that go against the fitrah \n    (sound human nature) and Islam then we must put a stop to these causes that \n    lead to such decadence. This may be done in the following ways:\u00a0\n\n    1-Striving to spread virtue and \n    good morals among the family members, and to strengthen their faith in \n    Allaah, their awareness that He is watching and their fear of Him. This may \n    be achieved by observing prayer regularly and on time, and keeping away from \n    forbidden things and bad attitudes.\n\n    2-Totally avoiding looking at, \n    listening to or reading provocative programs and stories.\n\n    3-Keeping away from bad company \n    who only lead one to evil and bad things.\n\n    4-Keeping girls away from clothes \n    that go against Islam, such as tight, short and see-through clothes; \n    avoiding provocative touching and kissing on the mouth.\n\n    5-Seeking spacious living \n    quarters where a girl will not need to be with her father or brothers in the \n    same room or under the same blanket.\n\n    6-The mother should play her role \n    in tackling such problems, by not being heedless or careless about anything \n    she sees or hears that goes against sharee\u2019ah, and she should not wait until \n    things get really bad or cannot be set right. Rather she has to be aware \n    from the outset, and not allow her daughter to be careless or allow her \n    husband to do whatever he wants.\n\n    7-Wise relatives should be \n    informed of such actions so that matters may be dealt with. If that does not \n    work, then you have to make a complaint to the sharee\u2019ah court or to the \n    security services in order to stop his evil actions towards you.\n\n    8-Our sister who has asked this \n    question needs to take the matter seriously and not delay taking action. We \n    advise her to make du\u2019aa\u2019 and seek out the times when du\u2019aa\u2019s are answered, \n    such as the last third of the night, asking that your father be guided and \n    that his evil be withheld from you.\n\n    9-It is haraam for you to take \n    your father\u2019s actions lightly. You have to ward him off with all the \n    strength you have, and raise your voice in shouting for help, even if that \n    leads to his being shamed or imprisoned.\n\n    10-If none of these \n    solutions work, then we do not advise you to stay in the house. We advise \n    you go and live with some righteous sisters or with your relatives where you \n    can live with them in accordance with Islamic rulings.\n\n    We ask Allaah to relieve your distress and to guide your \n    father and withhold his evil from you.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength."

This is the final religion which Allaah has chosen \n    for all of mankind, and He sent the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) to be a bringer of glad tidings and a warner to all \n    people. Many of those whom Allaah has guided have entered this religion \n    before you, and many have been deprived of it because of their stubbornness \n    and pride. So you should always be grateful to Allaah for having brought you \n    out of the darkness of kufr and ignorance into the light of Tawheed and \n    knowledge. You have to learn the rulings of Islam so that you will become \n    more convinced of your choice and so that Allaah may make your heart \n    steadfast in adhering to Islam.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    The fact that you are new in Islam does not prevent us from \n    telling you that this religion brought important rulings by means of which \n    the Muslim can protect his religious commitment, mind, wealth, honour and \n    lineage. Hence there are things that are forbidden in order to protect these \n    things, and there are things that are enjoined for the same reason. There \n    are two things that have to do with your question:\u00a0\n\n    In order to protect honour and lineage, Islam forbids mixing \n    between the sexes, and it forbids a man to be alone with a woman or to touch \n    her with his hand, let alone anything that is more serious than that, namely \n    the sin of zina (adultery or fornication). Hence we regard a woman as a \n    precious jewel which should not be treated as a cheap product \u2013 as is the \n    case in the kaafir nations and the fools among the Muslims who follow them \u2013 \n    in advertisements, newspapers and magazines. Women have an important role \n    which awaits them, that of wife and mother.\u00a0\n\n    The second matter has to do with protecting a woman\u2019s \n    religious commitment. Allaah has forbidden marriage of a Muslim woman to a \n    kaafir man. This is something that is proven in the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah and \n    by scholarly consensus.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible for a kaafir to marry a Muslim woman, \n    according to the texts and scholarly consensus. Allaah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cO you who believe! When believing women come to you as \n    emigrants, examine them; Allaah knows best as to their Faith, then if you \n    ascertain that they are true believers send them not back to the \n    disbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the \n    disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them\u201d\n\n    [al-Mumtahanah 60:10]\nIt is not permissible for \n    a Muslim woman to marry a kaafir, according to the texts and scholarly \n    consensus, as stated above, even if he is originally a kaafir and not an \n    apostate (from Islam). Hence if a kaafir man marries a Muslim woman, the \n    marriage is invalid and they must be separated. But if he becomes Muslim and \n    wants to marry her, that can only be done with a new marriage contract. End \n    quote.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen, \n    12/138-140\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\n\n    In order for the marriage contract to be valid, there must be \n    a wali (guardian) for the woman, but it is not permissible for a kaafir to \n    act as the wali of a Muslim woman, and there is no difference of scholarly \n    opinion on this point.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Qudaamah said:\u00a0\nAs for a kaafir, he \n    cannot be the wali of a Muslim woman under any circumstances, according to \n    the consensus of the scholars, including Maalik, al-Shaafa\u2019i, Abu \u2018Ubayd and \n    as-haab al-ra\u2019y. Ibn al-Mundhir said: There is consensus on this point among \n    all those from whom we acquired knowledge.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Mughni, 7/71\u00a0\n\n    Even in a situation such as yours, there has to be a wali for \n    the purpose of marriage. If no one among your family is Muslim, then whoever \n    acts in the stead of the ruler should arrange your marriage for you, namely \n    the Muslim qaadi (judge) or mufti or Shaykh of an Islamic centre or imam of \n    a mosque.\u00a0\n\n    You do not have to ask your father\u2019s permission to get \n    married because he has no authority over you as a wali. Once the marriage \n    contract is done, it is permissible to keep the news from your parents, and \n    you do not have to inform them.\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    Even if the wali is a Muslim, it is not permissible for him \n    to force his daughter to marry someone whom she does not like. Islam makes \n    the woman\u2019s consent one of the essentials of the marriage contract, and the \n    contract is not valid if she objects. If it is proven that she objects then \n    the Muslim qaadi should give her the choice between continuing the contract \n    or annulling it.\u00a0\n\n    Just as it is not permissible for both parents or one of them \n    to force his son to marry someone whom he does not like, so too Allaah has \n    not made the approval of the parents or one of them a condition of the son\u2019s \n    marriage contract being valid. But the son should be kind to his parents if \n    he refuses to do what they want. He has to do his utmost to win their \n    approval of his marriage to the one he wants. \u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible for a father to force his son to marry \n    a woman whom he does not like, whether that is because of some fault in her \n    religious commitment or a physical defect. How many people have regretted \n    forcing their children to marry women whom they do not want, saying, \u201cYou \n    will marry her because she is my brother\u2019s daughter\u201d or \u201cbecause she is from \n    our tribe\u201d and so on. The son is not obliged to accept, and it is not \n    permissible for the parents to force him. Similarly, if he wants to marry a \n    righteous woman but the father does not want him to, the son is not obliged \n    to obey him. If the son is pleased with a righteous wife and the father \n    says, \u201cDo not marry her,\u201d he has the right to marry her even if his father \n    objects, because the son is not obliged to obey his father in any matter in \n    which that will not harm the father but will benefit the son. If we say that \n    the son is obliged to obey his father in all things, even in matters where \n    there is benefit for the son and no harm for the father, then many negative \n    consequences would result from that. But in situations such as this, the son \n    should be diplomatic with his father, and be kind to him as much as he can \n    and try to convince him as much as he can. End quote\u00a0\n\n    Fataawa al-Mar\u2019ah al-Muslimah, \n    2/240, 241\u00a0\n\n    Fifthly:\u00a0\nYou have to do as much as \n    you can to save your parents and bring them into Islam, so that they and you \n    will find happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. You can use many \n    ways to call them to Islam, such as sending them e-mails, for example, \n    without them knowing that the messages are coming from you. You could give \n    their address to some of those who are specialized in Islamic knowledge and \n    da\u2019wah to undertake this mission on your behalf. You can also avail yourself \n    of the nearest Islamic centre to their home so that some daa\u2019iyahs can visit \n    them and call them to Islam. You can also use the regular mail to send them \n    tapes and booklets that will tell them about the Islamic religion.\u00a0\n\n    You know more about their situation than others. Perhaps if \n    you tell them that you have become Muslim, that may open the door for them \n    to enter Islam too. If that is the case, then tell them, but if you think \n    that this will not do any good, and that it may have a negative effect on \n    them or it might cause difficulties for you, then do not tell them. You can \n    delay that for a while until Allaah opens their hearts. Seek the help of \n    Allaah and turn to Him with du\u2019aa\u2019, sincerely asking Him to guide them.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to make you steadfast in adhering to this \n    religion, and we ask Him to guide your parents to Islam.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Delay of marriage and its connection to al-qada\u2019 wa\u2019l-qadar",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Qur\u2019aan and saheeh \n    Sunnah, and the consensus of the early generations of this ummah, indicate \n    that it is obligatory to believe in al-qadar (the divine decree), both good \n    and bad, and that this is one of the six basic principles of faith without \n    which a person\u2019s faith is incomplete. Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cNo calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it \n    is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al\u2011Lawh Al\u2011Mahfooz) before We bring it \n    into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allaah\u201d\n\n    [al-Hadeed 57:22]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cVerily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine \n    Preordainments of all things before their creation as written in the Book of \n    Decrees - Al\u2011Lawh Al\u2011Mahfooz)\u201d\n\n    [al-Qamar 54:49]\nIt was narrated from \n    \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, defining faith: \u201cIt is to \n    believe in Allaah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and \n    to believe in the divine decree, both good and bad.\u201d Narrated by Muslim, 8.\u00a0\n\n    Everything that happens in the universe happens only by the \n    decree of Allaah, so the one who believes in al-qadar must believe that \n    Allaah knew all things before they happened, then He wrote that in al-Lawh \n    al-Mahfooz (the Book of Decrees), then He willed that they should be, then \n    He created them. These are the four well-known stages of al-qadar, and there \n    is evidence for each of these stages, as has already been explained in \n    detail in the answer to question no. 49004.\u00a0\n\n    Marriage and whether it comes sooner or later, or is easy or \n    difficult, is all subject to the decree of Allaah. This does not mean that \n    the Muslim should not avail himself of the means that Allaah has decreed as \n    the steps leading to it, and applying the means does not contradict the idea \n    that a thing has been decreed from eternity. Man does not know what has been \n    decreed for him, but he is enjoined to apply the means.\u00a0\n\n    The calamities that Allaah decrees for a person are good for \n    the believer if he bears them with patience and seeks reward for that, and \n    does not panic, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cHow marvelous is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs \n    are good, and that does not apply to anyone except the believer. If \n    something good happens to him he gives thanks for it and that is good for \n    him. If something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience and that is \n    good for him.\u201d Narrated by Muslim, 2999.\u00a0\n\n    These calamities may be a punishment for sin, but that is not \n    necessarily the case. They may come in order to raise the believer in status \n    and increase his reward if he is patient and content\u2026 or there may be other \n    great reasons behind it.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was asked:\u00a0\n\n    If a person is tested with sickness or a calamity that \n    strikes him or his wealth, how can he know whether that is a test or is a \n    sign of the wrath of Allaah?\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\u00a0\n\n    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, tests His slaves \n    with good things and bad, with hardship and with ease. He may test them in \n    order to raise them in status and to increase their reward, as He did with \n    the Prophets and Messengers (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them) and \n    the righteous slaves of Allaah. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe people who are most severely tested are the \n    Prophets, then the next best and the next best.\u201d Sometimes Allaah does that \n    because of sins, so the punishment is hastened, as Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of \n    what your hands have earned. And He pardons much\u201d\n\n    [al-Shoora 42:30]\nUsually people fall short \n    and fail to fulfil their duties, so whatever befalls them is because of \n    their sins and shortcomings in obeying the commands of Allaah. If one of the \n    righteous slaves of Allaah is tested with sickness and the like, this is \n    akin to the testing of the Prophets and Messengers which raises them in \n    status and increases their reward, so that they may be examples to others of \n    patience and seeking reward.\u00a0\n\n    Conclusion: it may be a test in order to raise a person in \n    status and increase his reward, as Allaah does with the Prophets and some of \n    the elite, or it may be an expiation for sins, as Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cwhosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:123]\n\n    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cNo tiredness, exhaustion, worry, grief, distress or harm befalls \n    a believer in this world, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allaah \n    expiates some of his sins thereby.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cWhen Allaah wills good for a person, He afflicts him (with calamity so that \n    he may earn reward by bearing it with patience).\u201d\u00a0\n\n    That may also be a punishment that has been hastened because \n    of sins and a failure to hasten to repent, as stated in the hadeeth in which \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhen \n    Allaah wills good for a person, He hastens his punishment in this world, and \n    when He wills bad for a person, He withholds the (punishment) for his sins \n    from him until he comes to Him with that sin on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d \n    Narrated and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 Fataawa wa Maqaalaat, \n    4/370\u00a0\n\n    As you refused to marry those who came and proposed to you, \n    for the sake of Allaah and because they are not adhering to Islam, Allaah \n    will compensate you with something better than them. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He \n    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\n\n    3.\u00a0And He will provide him from (sources) he never could \n    imagine\u201d\n\n    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]\n\n    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cYou will never give up a thing for the sake of Allaah, may He be \n    glorified and exalted, but Allaah will compensate you with something that is \n    better for you than that.\u201d Narrated by Imam Ahmad; classed as saheeh by \n    al-Albaani in Hijaab al-Mar\u2019ah al-Muslimah, 47.\u00a0\nYou should turn to Allaah \n    with du\u2019aa\u2019 and acts of worship, and do not despair.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Bringing kaafir servants and entrusting them with our homes \n    and children poses a great danger to the morals and religious commitment of \n    the children.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to employing kaafir women as servants, whether \n    they are Buddhists, Christians or other kinds of kaafirs, is not permissible \n    in this Peninsula, i.e., in the Arabian Peninsula, because the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade that and urged that the \n    kuffaar be expelled from Arabia, for it is the cradle of Islam and the place \n    where the Message first dawned. So it is not permissible for two religions \n    to co-exist there, and it is not permissible to bring any kaafir there \n    except in cases of necessity as decreed by the authorities, then he (the \n    kaafir) should return to his homeland. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 6/361\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen said:\u00a0\nBecause a kaafir woman \n    should not remain among you in your house with your family and children, \n    even if the harm is no more than when the family get up to pray and this \n    woman does not pray, the children say: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this woman pray?\u201d and \n    they love her, so in that case they will think that it is not essential to \n    pray. This is even if she does not teach them her religion, as some people \n    have told us that they heard the servant teaching the children to say that \n    Jesus is God \u2013 we ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.

End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    Based on the above, it is permissible according to sharee\u2019ah \n    for your mother to take a payment for teaching the servant different ways of \n    cooking, but she should have told the servant of that before she started to \n    teach her. As for the situation mentioned in the question, the servant has \n    learned how to make food with the encouragement of your mother who chose to \n    do that. She is the one who helped her to do that of her own free will. So \n    it is not permissible for her to take the servant\u2019s notebook in which she \n    has written down what she learned, because it is her property which she has \n    written with her own hand and taken care of. Your mother\u2019s teaching of her \n    was purely voluntary.\u00a0\n\n    Beware of mistreating her and taking what is rightfully hers, \n    even if she is not Muslim.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (6/362) \n    to one who brought in a kaafir servant and mistreated her:\u00a0\n\n    What you and your mother have to do is to send her back to \n    her country. It is not permissible for you or your mother to mistreat her, \n    rather what you must do is treat her in a kind manner while she is with you, \n    until she returns to her country, because Allaah has forbidden wrongdoing to \n    His slaves to mistreat even with regard to kaafirs, as the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cBeware of wrongdoing, for \n    wrongdoing will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d Narrated by Muslim, \n    2578.

        "question": "Is it permissible for him to live with his paternal uncle who has adolescent daughters?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    What we advise you to do is not to live with your uncle and \n    his family, because you are not a mahram for your uncle\u2019s wife or for his \n    daughters, and this will cause you and them a great deal of restrictions if \n    you live with them.\u00a0\n\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    forbade entering upon women, and when the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) was asked about the husband\u2019s relatives, he spoke \n    more sternly about them than about anyone else. So listen to the hadeeth and \n    read what the scholars have said about it.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated from \u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018Aamir that the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cBeware of \n    entering upon women.\u201d A man from among the Ansaar said: O Messenger of \n    Allaah, what about the in-law? He said: \u201cThe in-law is death.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4934; Muslim, 2172.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The scholars of Arabic language are agreed that the word \n    ahma\u2019 (in-laws) refers to the relatives of a woman\u2019s husband, such as \n    his father, brother, nephew, cousin and so on.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the words of the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), \u201cthe in-law is death\u201d, what this means is \n    that the fear with regard to him is greater than the fear with regard to \n    others, and evil is expected from him and the fitnah is greater because he \n    is able to reach the woman and be alone with her without being denounced for \n    that, unlike one who is a stranger.\u00a0\n\n    What is meant by the in-law here is the relatives of the \n    husband, apart from his father (and grandfather) or his sons. Fathers and \n    sons are mahrams for his wife and it is permissible for them to be alone \n    with her, and they are not described as being death. Rather what is meant \n    here is the brother, nephew, uncle, cousin and so on, who are not mahrams. \n    The custom among people is to take this matter lightly, so a man may be \n    alone with his brother\u2019s wife.

        "question": "He is uncertain of his wife\u2019s virginity because there was no bleeding",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    You should note that the shaytaan is extremely keen to cause \n    division between a man and his wife. It is narrated in a saheeh report that \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIblees \n    places his throne on the water, then he sends out his troops, and those who \n    are the closest in status to him are those who cause the most tribulation \n    (fitnah). One of them comes and says, \u2018I did such and such,\u2019 and he says, \n    \u2018You have not done anything.\u2019 Then one of them comes and says, \u2018I did not \n    leave him alone until I caused division between him and his wife.\u2019 Then he \n    brings him close to him and says, \u2018How good you are.\u2019\u201d Narrated by Muslim, \n    5023.\u00a0\n\n    In order for the shaytaan to reach this objective of his, \n    there are many methods he uses to reach a man, one of which is creating \n    doubt about his wife\u2019s chastity.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    You should also note that the fact that a woman does not \n    bleed the first time she has intercourse does not necessarily mean that the \n    woman has been unchaste, because the hymen may be elastic and there is no \n    bleeding when intercourse takes place, as has been stated by doctors. \u00a0\n\n    It may also be broken for many reasons other than \n    intercourse, such as sports, jumping and so on.\u00a0\n\n    Moreover, the blood that is usually expected may be only one \n    or two drops, and this blood may come out mixed with other secretions, so \n    the man does not see it because it is not visible.\u00a0\n\n    For all of these reasons and others, it is not permissible \n    for a man to doubt his wife\u2019s chastity because she does not bleed when he \n    first has intercourse with her. The fact that there is no bleeding does not \n    mean that she is not chaste, just as the presence of bleeding does not mean \n    that she is chaste, because some women have surgery to repair the hymen.\u00a0\n\n    If your wife is a chaste woman and is religiously committed \n    and of good character, then you should not let the shaytaan have any way of \n    getting to you and spoiling your life. Seek refuge with Allaah from the \n    accursed shaytaan, and do not doubt your wife without any clear proof.\u00a0\n\n    May Allaah bless you both, and join you together in goodness, \n    and divert the plot of the shaytaan away from you.\u00a0\n\n    See also the answer to question no. \n    40278 for more \n    information.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Is it permissible for him to trim his beard so that he will not be exposed to harm?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Letting the beard grow is obligatory according to sharee\u2019ah, \n    and shaving it is haraam. In the answer to question no.\n    1189 we have stated the ruling on \n    shaving the beard, and that shaving it is a haraam action.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated that the \n    scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to shave the \n    beard.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Muhalla, 2/189\u00a0\nWith regard to shaving \n    it for fear of persecution or exposure to harm, this fear is not all of one \n    level.\u00a0 In some cases it may be what is likely to happen, and in other cases \n    it may be imaginary, and in yet others it may be six of one and half a dozen \n    of the other. \u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible for him to shave his beard or trim it \n    except in cases where harm is likely to result, and it is not permissible in \n    any other situation.\u00a0\n\n    This comes under the heading of cases of necessity. Allaah \n    says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBut if one is forced by necessity without willful \n    disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. \n    Truly, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:173]\n\n    Or in cases of compulsion. Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cWhoever disbelieved in Allaah after his belief, except \n    him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith; but such as \n    open their breasts to disbelief, on them is wrath from Allaah, and theirs \n    will be a great torment\u201d\n\n    [al-Nahl 16:106]\n\n    Force or compulsion means that he will be harmed if he does \n    not shave it. As for simply experiencing some annoyance or questions or \n    investigation, these are things from which those who do shave their beards \n    are not necessarily safe, so that does not mean that a person is permitted \n    to fall into sin.\u00a0\n\n    In cases of compulsion, there are conditions which must be \n    met in order for it to be permissible for a Muslim to be granted the \n    concession of doing or saying something that is haraam. Understanding what \n    these conditions are is very important, because many people are claiming \n    that they are forced to do things when that is not the case.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Qudaamah said:\u00a0\n\n    The conditions of compulsion include three things:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 That the one who is trying to force you has power to \n    cause harm\n\n    2 \u2013 That he thinks it most likely that the threat will be \n    carried out if he does not do what is being demanded of him\n\n    3 \u2013 That the harm be severe, such as being killed, beaten \n    severely, tied up or imprisoned for a lengthy period. As for being insulted \n    or cursed, this is not compulsion, and neither is taking a small amount of \n    wealth.\u00a0\n\n    If the person is of low status, a little harm may not be \n    compulsion in his case, unlike those of high position for whom a little harm \n    may be a humiliation and it is like a severe beating for someone else who is \n    of lower status.\nIf there is a threat of \n    torturing his child, this is not compulsion, because the harm is being \n    directed at someone else. But it is more likely that this is compulsion, \n    because that is worse for him than taking his wealth; that threat (to take \n    his wealth) is compulsion, so the same applies here.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Mughni, 7/292\u00a0\n\n    If the harm can be warded off by trimming the beard, then he \n    should not shave it off, rather it is sufficient to trim it, because shaving \n    is worse than trimming. It should be noted that a person should have the \n    need to undertake this journey to that country. But if there is no need for \n    that then it is not permissible to shave his beard for the sake of \n    travelling, because he is not being forced to do that.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "She is a new Muslim and cannot control her feelings at the time of her menses",

She must strive to control \n    herself with regard to that (jihad al-nafs), and she will find a change and \n    improvement, in sha Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    The husband should pay attention to his wife\u2019s feelings and \n    be sympathetic if she is suffering with anything. He should overlook her \n    mistakes and try to comfort her, and be patient in doing so. He should not \n    hasten to punish her or leave her, for married life is not based on \n    separation, rather it is based on stability and continuity. Life is not free \n    of disturbances, and the couple will succeed to the extent that they are \n    able to overcome troubles and create happiness and affection between one \n    another.\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly:\n\n    \u00a0The husband has no right to harm his wife physically; it is \n    not permissible for him to hit her except in the case where other means of \n    correction have\u00a0 failed, such as warning her and forsaking her in her bed. \n    If hitting becomes permissible, then it should not be done with the \n    intention of causing harm, rather the intention should be to rebuke and \n    discipline. Hence it is stipulated that it should not be a blow that leaves \n    a mark or causes pain.

If your husband falls short in this regard, you can \n    acquire many tapes through the Internet or by contacting some Islamic \n    centres that are close to you.\u00a0\n\n    Sixthly:\u00a0\n\n    Anger, swearing and feelings overwhelmed with what you have \n    to do may be dealt with in several ways:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 Seeking refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan \n    when feeling angry. Al-Bukhaari (3282) and Muslim (2610) narrated that \n    Sulaymaan ibn Surad said: I was sitting with the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and two men were trading insults, One of \n    them was red in the face and his veins were standing out. The Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cI know a word which, if \n    he said it, what he is feeling would go away. If he said, \u2018I seek refuge \n    with Allaah from the Shaytaan,\u2019 what he is feeling would go away.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 Changing one\u2019s posture when feeling angry. Abu Dawood \n    (4782) narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to \n    us: \u201cIf one of you gets angry when he is standing, let him sit down; if his \n    anger disappears, all well and good, otherwise let him lie down.\u201d Classed as \n    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\n\n    3 \u2013 Bring to mind the reward for patience, forbearance and \n    restraining your anger, for that is the characteristic of the pious who are \n    promised Paradise, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd march forth in the \n    way (which leads to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as \n    the heavens and the earth, prepared for Al-Muttaqoon (the pious).\n\n    134.\u00a0Those who spend (in Allaah\u2019s Cause) in prosperity and \n    in adversity, who repress anger, and who pardon men; verily, Allaah loves \n    Al-Muhsinoon (the good\u2011doers)\u201d\n\n    [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:133-134]\n\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cWhoever restrains his anger when he is able to act upon it, Allaah \n    will fill his heart with pleasure on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d Narrated by \n    Ibn Abi\u2019l-Dunya; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, \n    2623.\u00a0\n4 \u2013 Remember that anger \n    and swearing will not avail you anything and will not relieve you of any \n    burden, rather you earn sin thereby, and they bring more worry and stress. \n    Help and ease only come by drawing close to Allaah, may He be exalted, and \n    by striving to obey Him.\u00a0\n\n    5 \u2013 You should organize your time and hasten to carry out any \n    tasks you have to do, so that they will not pile up and make you feel \n    overwhelmed.\u00a0\n\n    6 \u2013 You should avail yourself of the beneficial treatment \n    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught to \n    his daughter Faatimah (may Allaah be pleased with her), when she complained \n    that she had too much work and it was burdensome, and she needed a servant. \n    Al-Bukhaari (6318) and Muslim (2728) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah \n    be pleased with him) that Faatimah (may Allaah be pleased with her) came to \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him \n    for a servant, complaining about her work. He said to her: \u201cShall I not tell \n    you of something that is better for you than a servant? Say Subhaan-Allaah \n    (Glory be to Allaah) thirty-three times, al-hamdu-Lillaah (praise be \n    to Allaah) thirty-three times, and Allaahu akbar (Allaah is Most \n    Great) thirty-four times when you go to bed.\u201d Some of the scholars have \n    explained this hadeeth by noting that the one who regularly remembers Allaah \n    will be given strength that is greater than the strength used by a servant, \n    or things will become easy for him and he will no longer need a servant.\u00a0\n\n    End quote from Fath al-Baari.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to grant you help, steadfastness and success.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

But at the least there is a measure of stress that a woman goes \n    through when she loses her husband and has to start dealing directly with \n    the burdens of life.\u00a0 Moreover, women vary in their ability to put up with \n    things and try to overcome them. There are many divorced woman who have been \n    able to overcome these problems, and live happy and contented lives. This \n    depends on certain reasons which may be the solution in your case, in sha \n    Allah. There follow some of them, for you to ponder and try to put into \n    practice, so that you can regain the happiness that you have lost.\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 Developing a strong relationship with Allaah. That \n    includes believing that this problem and others happen by the will and \n    decree of Allaah and that Allaah is more compassionate and merciful towards \n    you than a mother towards her child, and that His decree is good for His \n    slave, both in the short and long term. Calamities expiate sin, bearing them \n    with patience raises one in status, and when Allaah loves His slave He tests \n    him.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 You have two choices: \n    either you can live feeling miserable, worried and anxious, or you can bear \n    it with patience and seek reward, in the hope of attaining reward and rising \n    in status. Your sorrow will neither advance you nor put you back, as the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe greatest \n    reward comes with the greatest trial. When Allaah loves a people He tests \n    them. Whoever accepts that wins His pleasure but whoever is discontent with \n    that earns His wrath.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2396; Ibn Maajah, 4031; \n    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Pondering the \n    blessings of Allaah, and striving to show gratitude for them, and comparing \n    these many blessings with the calamity that befell you. This opens the heart \n    to contentment. So think of how many blessings Allaah has bestowed upon you, \n    in your religion, your self, your health, your wealth and your children. \n    Think of the calamities that have befallen others. How many women are \n    paralyzed, how many suffer calamities that befall their children, or are \n    tested in their religious commitment, or suffer sickness, and so on. If you \n    think about this you will find that you are enjoying blessings for which you \n    are to be envied. You will realize that there are people who are suffering \n    greater calamities than you. This should make things easier for you and make \n    you give praise and thanks, and acknowledge the bounty and mercy of Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    4 \u2013 Thinking about the calamity that has befallen you, and \n    seeing the blessings that may be hidden therein. How many married women \n    suffer from harsh treatment and abuse from their husbands and live a \n    miserable life with them. You have been spared all that, so give praise to \n    Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    5 \u2013 Filling your time with things that will bring benefit in \n    this world and in the Hereafter. For example, you could join a centre that \n    teaches memorization of the Holy Qur\u2019aan, attend religious lectures, read \n    useful books, learn useful domestic skills such as sewing, and so on.\u00a0\n\n    6 \u2013 Paying attention to the ultimate goal, which is to earn \n    the pleasure of Allaah and attain His Paradise and be saved from the Fire. \n    This requires buckling down to hard work and serious effort.

        "question": "She is in love with a married man and cannot keep away from him",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    You have to repent and seek forgiveness, and regret what you \n    have done by getting in touch with men who are not your mahrams, and \n    speaking to them and going out with them.\u00a0\n\n    You must also cut off all ties with this second man \n    immediately, with no hesitation, because the relationship between you is \n    haraam.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n    How can you accept to be the cause of his divorcing his wife? \n    If you were in her position, would you accept for your husband to divorce \n    you in order to marry another woman who has come between you to spoil your \n    lives?\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    We do not know how a wise man could agree to marry a woman \n    when he knows that she has had a haraam relationship with a man before him \n    and she has not repented from that relationship.\u00a0\n\n    Whatever happened to chastity and protective jealousy? Does \n    he not fear that this man may come back into her life again?\u00a0\n\n    To put it bluntly, either this woman has repented or she has \n    not. If she has repented from those relationships then there can never be \n    any contact or relationship between them except in marriage. In this case \n    there is nothing wrong with marrying her, but he should obey his mother, and \n    not divorce his first wife.\u00a0\n\n    If she has not repented from these actions, then it is not \n    unlikely that she may form a relationship with a third man and a fourth.\u00a0\n\n    Similarly, in your case, how can you agree to marry a man who \n    is content to form haraam relationships, speaking and meeting with women? If \n    he has repented, then there can never be any meetings between you, and if he \n    has not repented, then a man like that cannot be trusted. His aim may be \n    just to have fun with you, and even if he is sincere in wanting to marry \n    you, there is nothing that would stop him from forming haraam relationships \n    with other women.\u00a0\n\n    Hence you have to cut off all ties without hesitating, and \n    pray for forgiveness from Allaah for wasting your life in haraam pursuits. \n    Turn to Allaah and ask Him to purify your heart and to remove all traces of \n    those haraam relationships which have corrupted your heart and mind, let \n    alone detracted from your religious commitment.\u00a0\n\n    If you are sincere in repenting there is the hope that Allaah \n    will bless you with someone better than him, and will make it easy for you \n    to get married to a chaste and righteous man who will treat you in a decent \n    manner and help you to attain the pleasure of your Lord, and you and he will \n    form a believing family and produce good and righteous offspring.\u00a0\n\n    Do not pay any attention to your heart and emotions, for in \n    this case emotion has overpowered reason and religious commitment, and has \n    harmed your spiritual and worldly interests. Your heart now is sick so you \n    should not let it lead you to Hell.\u00a0\n\n    Seek the help of Allaah, for He will not let down the one who \n    seeks His help, and the one who humbles himself before his Lord will never \n    lose out. Do a lot of righteous deeds, and seek righteous, believing female \n    friends who can help you to deal with your worries and help you to obey your \n    Lord.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Offering sincere advice to the slaves of Allaah is one of \n      the most important branches of faith and symbols of Islam, to such an \n      extent that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n      described it as being the religion itself, as an indication of its great \n      importance. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n      said: \u201cReligion is sincerity (or sincere advice \u2013 naseehah).\u201d \n      (Narrated by Muslim, 55). And Allaah tells us that whoever does this, that \n      is true success. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cLet there arise out \n    of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining \n    Al-Ma\u2018roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and \n    forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has \n    forbidden). And it is they who are the successful\u201d\n\n    [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:104]\n\n    So long as you fulfilled your duty of offering sincere \n    advice, and your intention was good, then do not feel sad about the problems \n    that have befallen you (which is a test), for Paradise is the reward of \n    Allaah, and the reward of Allaah is precious and is surrounded with \n    hardships, and everything has a price.\u00a0\n\n    Remember that everyone who does this great duty will \n    inevitably meet with harm from people, or opposition. Hence Luqmaan the Wise \n    said to his son:\u00a0\n\u201cO my son! Aqim\u2011is\u2011Salaah \n    (perform As\u2011Salaah), enjoin (on people) Al\u2011Ma\u2018roof\u00a0 (Islamic Monotheism and \n    all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al\u2011Munkar (i.e. disbelief in the \n    Oneness of Allaah, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), \n    and bear with patience whatever befalls you. Verily, these are some of the \n    important commandments (ordered by Allaah with no exemption)\u201d\n\n    [Luqmaan 31:17]\n\n    Remember that the good end is for the pious (those who fear \n    Allaah), and Allaah will not cause the reward of those who do good to be \n    lost, and He is with those who are patient. So turn to Him and seek His \n    protection, and say Allaah (Alone) is Sufficient for me, and He is the Best \n    Disposer of affairs (for me). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThose (i.e. believers) unto whom the people (hypocrites) \n    said, \u2018Verily, the people (pagans) have gathered against you (a great army), \n    therefore, fear them.\u2019 But it (only) increased them in Faith, and they said: \n    \u2018Allaah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs \n    (for us).\u2019\n\n    174.\u00a0So they returned with grace and bounty from Allaah. \n    No harm touched them; and they followed the good Pleasure of Allaah. And \n    Allaah is the Owner of great bounty\u201d\n\n    [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:174-175]\n\n    No matter how much they plot against you, their plot will \n    backfire on them.\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBut the evil plot encompasses only him who makes it\u201d\n\n    [Faatir 35:43]\nSo receive the glad \n    tidings of the help and support of Allaah, make a lot of du\u2019aa\u2019 and pray for \n    forgiveness. Remember that the prayer of the one who has been wronged or \n    oppressed is not rejected, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThere are three whose prayers will undoubtedly be \n    answered: the prayer of a father, the prayer of a traveller, and the prayer \n    of one who has been wronged.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1536; al-Tirmidhi, \n    1905; Ibn Maajah, 3862; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi \n    Dawood.\u00a0\nBut we advise you to \n    leave this job and relieve yourself of that in which there is evil and harm, \n    and to move to another place; may Allaah give you someone better than them \n    and give you a trustworthy and kind boss.\u00a0\nIf you cannot move from \n    this place, then try to take a leave of absence for a while until things \n    calm down; Allaah may cause things to change.\u00a0\nIf you can do without \n    this job altogether, and save yourself from all this trouble and heartache \n    and devote your efforts to taking care of your house and children, then this \n    is best, and Allaah will reward you for that with His blessings and \n    compensate you with something better. \u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to relieve \n    your distress and take away your sorrow, and to protect you against the evil \n    of every evil person.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Afraid of marriage out of fear of committing sin",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is emphatically forbidden to have intercourse with one's wife in her back passage, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever has intercourse with a menstruating woman or with a woman in her back passage, or goes to a fortuneteller and believes what he says, has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 135; Ibn Maajah, 639; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\nAnd he said: \u201cCursed is the one who has intercourse with a woman in her back passage.\u201d Narrated by Ahmad, 9731; Abu Dawood, 2162; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. See also question no. 1103.\u00a0\nWith regard to your avoiding marriage because of these fears, this is dealing with one mistake by making another. Ignore this waswaas (whisper from the Shaytaan) and keep busy with things that will benefit you in both spiritual and worldly ways. Ask Allaah to purify your heart and protect your chastity; hasten to get married for that is the best remedy for you. Beware of the wrath and anger of Allaah and of His painful punishment, and do not be one of those who are heedless.\u00a0\nRemember Allaah a great deal and do lots of acts of worship, lower your gaze and avoid looking at haraam things, and avoid committing sinful actions, so that these evil devilish thoughts will leave you.\u00a0\nWith regard to coming to your wife from behind but over her clothes, you should avoid doing that. Do not be like a shepherd who grazes his flocks around a sanctuary and soon transgresses its boundary, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 25; Muslim, 1599).\u00a0\nIbn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAllaah has guarded these haraam things and forbidden His slaves to approach them, and he calls them His limits. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThese are the limits (set) by Allaah, so approach them not. Thus does Allaah make clear His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, revelations, verses, laws, legal and illegal things, Allaah\u2019s set limits, orders, etc.) to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:187]\nThus it is clear that Allaah has defined for them what is permissible for them and what is forbidden to them, so that they will not approach what is forbidden and they will not go beyond what is permitted. Hence Allaah says in another verse (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThese are the limits ordained by Allaah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allaah, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:229]\nThe one who grazes around a sanctuary and close to it will soon enter it. The same applies to one who goes beyond what is permitted and falls into doubtful areas. He approaches something haraam with the intention of merely coming close, but soon he will commit forbidden actions blatantly. This indicates that we must keep away from haraam things, and erect barriers between us and them.\u00a0\nJaami\u2019 al-\u2018Uloom wa\u2019l-Hukam, 1/208\u00a0\nMay Allaah protect us and you from all evils, and make us and you content with that which He has permitted. May He give us enough of what is permissible that we have no need of that which He has forbidden.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Feeling fed up of life",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There are many reasons for hating this world. There are some people who dislike this transient world and long for that which is with Allah of reward, and who love to meet Allah. Hence some of the salaf said: \u201cThe gift of the believer is death.\u201d For he detests this world and his heart is attached to the Hereafter. Yet despite his dislike for this world, he carries out his duties towards Allah and His slaves, and he strives to do good as much as he can, in accordance with the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e. death)\u201d\n[al-Hijr 15:99]\u00a0\nAnd there are some people who detest this world, not because of the Hereafter, but because they think that their share of it is very little, and that others are better off then them. Undoubtedly this is a kind of discontent with the will and decree of Allah, for Allah is the One Who bestows blessings and distributes provisions, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if Allah were to enlarge the provision for His slaves, they would surely rebel in the earth, but He sends down by measure as He wills. Verily, He is, in respect of His slaves, the Well\u2011Aware, the All\u2011Seer (of things that benefit them)\u201d\n[al-Shoora 42:27]\nSome people hate this world because they have been faced with a great deal of trial, stress and exhaustion in it. Undoubtedly these people do not understand the true nature of this world. This world is the realm of striving and trial, the realm of stress and exhaustion, especially for the righteous believer, who encounters all kinds of trials by means of which Allah expiates his sins and raises him in status. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, We have created man in toil\u201d\n[al-Balad 90:4]\u00a0\n\u201cDo people think that they will be left alone because they say: \u2018We believe,\u2019 and will not be tested.\n3.\u00a0And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)\u201d\n[al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:2-3]\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAllah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good. Nor will Allah disclose to you the secrets of the Ghayb (Unseen), but Allah chooses of His Messengers whom He wills. So believe in Allah and His Messengers. And if you believe and fear Allah, then for you there is a great reward\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:179]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As\u2011 Saabiroon (the patient).\n156.\u00a0Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: \u201cTruly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.\u201d\n157.\u00a0They are those on whom are the Salawaat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:155-157]\nMy dear brother\u2026 into which of these categories do you fall?\u00a0\nRemember how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was tested. His people showed enmity towards him, and the closest of people to him resisted him. Some people slandered him, others persecuted him. He was thrown out of his home and was subjected to a harsh boycott. The kuffaar gathered together to kill him, and his wife Khadeejah (may Allah be pleased with her) died at the most difficult time. He would go for a month or two at a time without eating anything but dates and water. All of this happened even though he was the Prophet of Allah, and His Messenger, the one to whom Allah entrusted His Revelation. All of this happened even though he is the owner of the position of praise and glory (al-maqaam al-mahmoud) and the Cistern (al-hawd) to which his ummah will come (on the Day of Resurrection). All of this happened even though his sins, past and future, had been forgiven.\u00a0\nSo what about us, with all our sins and shortcomings?\u00a0\nI advise you to do the following:\u00a0\nFirstly: make a lot of du\u2019aa\u2019, calling upon Allah, and seek to draw close to Him by different kinds of worship, such as praying, giving zakaah, fasting and so on. Beseech Allah to take away what is in your heart (of sorrow etc) and to grant you relief. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThose who believed (in the Oneness of Allah \u2014 Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest\u201d\n[al-Ra\u2019d 13:28]\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, those who are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious), when an evil thought comes to them from Shaytaan (Satan), they remember (Allah), and (indeed) they then see (aright)\u201d\n[al-A\u2019raaf 7:201]\nSecondly: Understand that whatever Allah decrees for His believing slave is all good. No matter how difficult your life may become, to Allah belong all things in the heavens and the earth. So set things straight between yourself and Allah, and Allah will suffice you against having any need of people.\u00a0\nThirdly: Your depression and tiredness may be because of something that you have missed out on and not acquired or achieved. In that case you should know how often a person has pursued something, not realizing that in it lay his doom; and how often has a person grieved for missing out on something he wanted, but he does not know that had he attained it, it would have spelled loss in both his spiritual and worldly affairs. So accept the will and decree of Allah, and seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless.\u00a0\nFourthly: Check your heart and mind, and examine your relationship with Allah thoroughly, because a person may be denied provision because of sins that he commits.\u00a0\nFifthly: You may have some personal or family problems; the way to solve these problems is by prioritizing them. Seek the help of Allah (first and foremost), then the help of experienced people to solve these problems, and resolve these issues.\u00a0\nSixthly: remember that the most sorely tried of all people were the Prophets, then the next best and the next best. It is proven in al-Musnad from the hadeeth of Mus\u2019ab ibn Sa\u2019d that his father said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, which of the people are most sorely tested? He said: \u201cThe Prophets, then the righteous, then the next best, then the next best of people. A man will be tested according to his level of religious commitment. If there is some solidness in his religious commitment, he will be more sorely tested, and if there is some weakness in his religious commitment the test will be lightened for him. A man will continue to be tested until he walks upon the face of the earth with no sin on him.\u201d Musnad al-Imam Ahmad, no. 1481. Shaykh Shu\u2019ayb al-Arna\u2019oot said: its isnaad is hasan. And it was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, no. 992.\u00a0\nSeventhly: Persist in praying for forgiveness and in worshipping. That is better for you than all the worldly steps you can take, no matter how great and how many they are. This will also relieve your worries. It was narrated in some reports that whoever persists in praying for forgiveness, Allah will grant him a way out from every worry and hardship and will grant him provision from sources he never thought of.\u00a0\nSo persist in worshipping Allah, and act in accordance with the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e. death)\u201d\n[al-Hijr 15:99]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd strain not your eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to various groups of them (polytheists and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah), the splendour of the life of this world, that We may test them thereby. But the provision (good reward in the Hereafter) of your Lord is better and more lasting\u201d\n[Ta-Ha 20:131]\u00a0\nMay Allah help us and you to do and say that which is right. And Allah knows best.\u00a0\nSee: Dealing with Worries and Stress in the Books section of this website."

Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1770; Abu Dawud, 4232; al-Nasai, 5161. This hadith was classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 824.\n(ii) \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Mas\u2019ud said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursing those women who pluck their eyebrows and file their teeth for the purpose of beautification and change the creation of Allah. Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nWith regard to the phrase \u201cthose who file their teeth\u201d, this refers to those who did that for the purpose of beautification and looking younger. This indicates that what is haram is that which is done for the purpose of beautification; but if it is needed for medical treatment or to correct a fault in the teeth and so on, there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah knows best.\u00a0\nCosmetic surgery for the purpose of beautification\n2 \u2013 The second type of cosmetic surgery is that which is done for the purpose of beautification.\u00a0\nThese are operations that are done to improve the appearance in the eye of the beholder, such as making the nose look more beautiful by making it smaller, or making the breasts look more beautiful by making them smaller or larger, or facelifts, and so on.\u00a0\nThis kind of surgery is not for any necessary reason, rather the purpose is to change the creation of Allah and tinker with it according to people\u2019s whims and desires. So this is haram and it is not permissible to do it, because it is changing the creation of Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThey (all those who worship others other than Allah) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him (Allah), and they invoke nothing but Shaytan (Satan), a persistent rebel! Allah cursed him. And he [Shaytan (Satan)] said: \u2018I will take an appointed portion of your slaves. \u2018Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah\u2019\u201d [al-Nisa\u2019 4:117-119]\nThe Shaytan is the one who tells people to change the creation of Allah.\u00a0\nPlease see: Ahkam al-Jarahah al-Tibbiyyah by Shaykh Muhammad al-Mukhtar al-Shanqiti.\u00a0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-\u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\u00a0\nWhat is the ruling on cosmetic surgery? What is the ruling on learning the science of beautification?\u00a0\nHe replied:\u00a0\nCosmetic procedures are of two types:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Those which are done to remove a fault resulting from an accident etc. There is nothing wrong with that because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave permission to a man whose nose had been cut off in battle to wear a nose made of gold.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 Those which are unnecessary and are not done to remove a fault but rather to increase beauty. This is haram and is not permissible, because the Messenger of Allah cursed women who pluck eyebrows, those who have their eyebrows plucked, those who fix hair extensions, those who have hair extensions done, those who do tattoos and those\u00a0 who have tattoos done, because that is done as an enhancement and is not done to remove faults.\u00a0\nWith regard to the medical student who learns about cosmetic surgery during the course of his studies, there is nothing wrong with him learning that, but he should not do that in haram cases, rather he should advise those who ask for that to avoid it because it is haram. Perhaps if this advice comes from the lips of a doctor it will have more effect on a person.\u00a0(Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/412)\nSee also the answer to question no.\u00a01006 .\u00a0\nIn conclusion, if there is some defect in the nose and the purpose of the cosmetic surgery is to remove that defect, then there is nothing wrong with that.\u00a0\nBut if the purpose is simply to make it more beautiful, then it is not permissible to do this surgery.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is it permissible for a father to force his daughter to work in a mixed environment?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Working in mixed environments is not free of the risk of some \n    haraam things happening, such as looking, being alone with a person of the \n    opposite sex, or feeling attracted. Hence the scholars have issued fatwas \n    stating that it is haraam, based on what usually happens. It says in \n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah (12/156):\u00a0\nMixing of men and women \n    in schools and elsewhere is a great evil and has serious implications for \n    people\u2019s religious and worldly interests. It is not permissible for a woman \n    to study or work in a place where men and women mix, and it is not \n    permissible for her guardian to allow her to do that.\u00a0\n\n    Based on that, the father has no right to force his daughter \n    to work in a mixed workplace. If he forces her to do that then she does not \n    have to obey him, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cThere is no obedience in sinful matters, rather obedience \n    is only (required) in that which is good and proper.\u201d Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari, 7257; Muslim, 1840.\u00a0\n\n    This daughter must explain to her father the dangers of \n    working in a mixed environment, and that it is haraam. She should remind him \n    of his duty to protect his family and save them from the Fire, and she \n    should do so in a wise manner and with beautiful preaching. \u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "He married her on the basis that he would come back to his country after a certain amount of time, then he decided not to go back",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    The Muslim is obliged to adhere to the conditions that he set \n    and to fulfil his promises. Among the conditions that are most deserving of \n    fulfillment are those by means of which it becomes permissible for a man to \n    enjoy intimacy with his wife, namely the conditions of marriage.\u00a0\nAl-Bukhaari (2821) and \n    Muslim (1418) narrated that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe conditions that most deserve to \n    be fulfilled are those by means of which it becomes permissible for you to \n    enjoy intimacy.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (7/448):\u00a0\n\n    The conditions of marriage fall into three categories:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 Those which must be fulfilled, which are those which \n    benefit the wife, such as the condition that he will not make her leave her \n    house or city, or make her travel with him (i.e., take her to another \n    country).\u00a0\n\n    These must be fulfilled. If the husband does not do that then \n    the wife has the right to annul the marriage, because the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe conditions that most \n    deserve to be fulfilled are those by means of which it becomes permissible \n    for you to enjoy intimacy.\u201d End quote.\u00a0\n\n    It is essential to differentiate between that which the \n    husband stated as a condition in the marriage, and a promise that he made \n    after the marriage contract was done. If it was a condition of marriage \n    (i.e., the marriage contract was done on the basis of this condition), then \n    the wife has the choice of waiving that condition or of annulling the \n    marriage, if her husband does not fulfil this condition. In this case she \n    should be given her rights in full.\u00a0\n\n    If it was a promise that he made after marriage, then he has \n    to fulfil his promise if he does not have an excuse. But the wife does not \n    have the right to annul the marriage if he does not fulfil it. This is the \n    ruling on this situation.\u00a0\n\n    We advise the husband to fulfil the condition and to keep his \n    promise, or to ask for his wife\u2019s consent to waive the condition or to delay \n    fulfillment of the promise until a later, stated time. He has to fear Allaah \n    with regard to his wife and not bring haraam things and haraam entertainment \n    into the house.\u00a0\n\n    The sister who asked this question should be more patient and \n    put up with it. She should also try to get wise people from her family and \n    from his to intervene, in order to resolve the differences between them.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly: \u00a0\n\n    The husband has made a serious mistake by bringing the \n    satellite dish into the home and enabling his wife to see all the sinful \n    content that the dish brings. The one whom Allaah has put in charge of \n    others should be sincere towards them and not be negligent or heedless in \n    his duties towards them.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    The sister made a mistake, because she is not forced to look \n    at the evil scenes brought by the dish, and her being alone is no excuse. \n    She can occupy herself by worshipping Allaah, keeping company with righteous \n    women, doing permissible things, and reading and listening to things that \n    will benefit her in both her religious and worldly affairs."

In that \n    case mocking them is mocking the path that they are following. They are like \n    those of whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cIf you ask them (about \n    this), they declare: \u2018We were only talking idly and joking.\u2019 Say: \u2018Was it at \n    Allaah, and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, \n    revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?\u201d\n\n    Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed\u2019\u201d\n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:65-66]\n\n    These words were revealed concerning some of the hypocrites \n    who said: \u201cWe have never seen anything like these reciters \u2013 meaning the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his \n    companions \u2013 they are the most greedy, the most false of speech and the most \n    cowardly in battle.\u201d Then Allaah revealed this verse concerning them. \u00a0\n\n    Those who make fun of the followers of truth because they are \n    religiously-committed should beware, for Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cVerily, (during the worldly life) those who committed \n    crimes used to laugh at those who believed.\n\n    30.\u00a0And, whenever they passed by them, used to wink one to \n    another (in mockery).\n\n    31.\u00a0And when they returned to their own people, they would \n    return jesting;\n\n    32.\u00a0And when they saw them, they said: \u2018Verily, these have \n    indeed gone astray!\u2019\n\n    33.\u00a0But they (disbelievers, sinners) had not been sent as \n    watchers over them (the believers).\n\n    34.\u00a0But this Day (the Day of Resurrection) those who \n    believe will laugh at the disbelievers\n\n    35.\u00a0On (high) thrones, looking (at all things).\n\n    36.\u00a0Are not the disbelievers paid (fully) for what they \n    used to do?\u201d\n\n    [al-Mutaffifeen 83:29-36]\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen, \n    2/question no. 236.\u00a0\nInsulting a Muslim is a \n    major sin, especially if one insults him for being religiously committed and \n    righteous. There is the fear that the one who does this may fall into \n    apostasy as stated above with regard to mocking them.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated from \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mas\u2019ood (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cInsulting a Muslim is immorality and killing him is kufr.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 48; Muslim, 64.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Nawawi said:\u00a0\n\n    In Arabic the word sabb (translated here as insulting) \n    means slandering a person and speaking of his honour in a disparaging \n    fashion. And fisq (translated here as immorality) means going out; in \n    sharee\u2019ah terminology it means going out of obedience (i.e., transgressing \n    the bounds of obedience).\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the meaning of the hadeeth: Insulting a Muslim \n    for no reason is haraam according to the consensus of the ummah, so the one \n    who does that is a faasiq as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) said.\u00a0\n\n    Sharh Muslim, 2/53, 54.\u00a0\nWe advise you to \n    continue advising her, and if that is via your brother, that will be better. \n    Tell him of the Islamic rulings on what she is doing, and encourage him to \n    guide her by whatever means he can.\u00a0\n\n    We do not advise you to sit with her unless she repents and \n    turns back to her Lord. We fear that you may react towards her, and we fear \n    that she may increase in sin every time she sees you or sits with you.\u00a0\n\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd when you (Muhammad) see those who engage in a false \n    conversation about Our Verses (of the Qur\u2019aan) by mocking at them, stay away \n    from them till they turn to another topic.

        "question": "Her father mistreats her and her mother resents her, and this has affected her relationship with her husband",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to your father, you have to keep on advising him \n    and reminding him of what Allaah has enjoined upon him with regard to \n    himself and to his family.\u00a0\n\n    You have to try different methods of advising him. It may be \n    hard for him to hear it from you, but do not despair of reminders and \n    exhortations reaching him by way of your relatives or his friends. You could \n    also let him listen to some useful tapes.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    You have to fear Allaah with regard to your husband. You \n    should not bring the worries of your family into your husband\u2019s house and \n    place them on his shoulders, especially since he treats you well and you do \n    not see anything from him that upsets you. What you have to do is to \n    appreciate him and treat him kindly. This is what Allaah commands you to \n    do.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    No one is free of diseases \u2013 except those on whom Allaah has \n    mercy. The fact that your father likes to show off and to appear to be \n    better than others means that you have to be compassionate towards him, not \n    resent him. The fact that he has treated you badly and is still doing so \n    means that you should show mercy towards him, for if he dies and meets his \n    Lord in that state, then he will meet Him with many sins.\u00a0\n\n    Hence you and your siblings and family have to look again at \n    your relationship with your father and your attitude towards him, for Allaah \n    has commanded us to treat parents well and honour them, even if they call us \n    to shirk and kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cBut if they (both) strive with you to make you join in \n    worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them \n    not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him \n    who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your \n    return, and I shall tell you what you used to do\u201d\n\n    [Luqmaan 31:15]\nIbraaheem (peace be upon \n    him) debated with his mushrik father politely, as Allaah tells us \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd mention in the Book (the Qur\u2019aan) Ibraaheem \n    (Abraham).

If you \n    do not visit her this is not regarded as disobedience or severing of family \n    ties.\u00a0\nYes, you will be \n    rewarded for visiting her and treating her kindly, if you do that sincerely \n    for the sake of Allaah, and this is part of treating your husband kindly, \n    but it is not obligatory for you to do that, especially since she is badly \n    behaved and has a bad attitude.

        "question": "He is having a problem with his second wife and he fears for his daughter",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The basic principle concerning divorce is that it is makrooh \n    (disliked), as is indicated by the verse in which Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThose who take an oath not to have sexual relation with \n    their wives must wait for four months, then if they return (change their \n    idea in this period), verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\n\n    227.\u00a0And if they decide upon divorce, then Allaah is \n    All-Hearer, All-Knower\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:226]\u00a0\n\n    In relation to changing their minds He said \u201cOft-Forgiving, \n    Most Merciful\u201d and in relation to divorce He said \u201cAll-Hearer, \n    All-Knower\u201d. This indicates a kind of warning, which in turn indicates \n    that divorce is disliked by Allaah (makrooh). \u00a0\n\n    But there may be some cases in which divorce is inevitable, \n    and even essential. In the case which you mention, divorce may be the \n    appropriate solution, because it is unthinkable that a wife would treat her \n    husband in such a bad way as you describe in your question. A woman could \n    say or do something to offend her husband, but to be constantly ungrateful \n    is very strange. \u00a0\n\n    But before divorce, you have to try to reconcile first, and \n    put up with the woman. If she has some bad characteristics, you will also \n    find some good qualities, so you can put up with the bad characteristics \n    because of the good ones.\u00a0\n\n    See questions no. 20044 \n    and 2076.\u00a0\n\n    If you can get some relatives involved to solve the problem, \n    then do so, as an act of mercy to this poor girl who will suffer \u2013 no matter \n    what the situation \u2013 from the bitterness of separation and the break-up of \n    the family.\u00a0\n\n    If divorce is the final solution, and you have exhausted all \n    possible solutions, then pray istikhaarah (asking for guidance) and consult \n    others, and put your trust in Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the matters that she has referred to the \n    court, this may be a request to the qaadi (judge) to compel the husband to \n    divorce her by talaaq or it may be khula\u2019, depending on the situation. If \n    she is going to give the husband some money or return the mahr to him in \n    return for getting a divorce, then this is khula\u2019; if she is not going to \n    pay anything then this is talaaq, if it takes place.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to custody, the basic principle is that the \n    mother has more right to custody, so long as there is no impediment to that. \n    If there is any impediment, such as the mother marrying someone who is a \n    stranger (non-mahram) to the child, or the mother\u2019s character or attitude is \n    bad, then custody passes to the mother\u2019s mother according to the majority. \n    If the mother\u2019s mother is the same (i.e., of bad character etc) then custody \n    passes to the father. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was of the view that in \n    the case of a dispute between the mother\u2019s mother and the father, custody \n    should be given to the father, because he is closer to the child. This view \n    was also favoured by Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen in his commentary on the chapter \n    on custody in Zaad al-Mustaqni\u2019. We have already discussed this in \n    detail in question no. 5234,\n    9463,\n    8189, and\n    21516. And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Her father tries to hit her and prevent her from fasting",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    You should praise Allaah for having guided you and brought \n    you back to Him. You have to observe the fasts that Allaah has enjoined upon \n    you, even if your father dislikes that, because there is no obedience to any \n    created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    You say that you feel ill and that you suffer from anaemia \n    and allergies. In that case you have to refer to a trustworthy doctor and \n    ask him whether fasting is harmful for you or not, and whether there is any \n    hope of a recovery from this disease or not. If fasting will harm you \n    because of this sickness, or will make the sickness worse, or delay \n    recovery, or make it very hard for you to fast, then Allaah has made things \n    easy for you and has allowed you not to fast. So you should not fast, and \n    you should make up the days that you do not fast after you recover, in sha \n    Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    But if this sickness is ongoing and there is no hope of \n    making up the fasts, then do not fast, and you have to feed one poor person \n    for each day that you do not fast. See question no.\n    12488.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    The father has to look after his family properly, and tell \n    them to do what is enjoined upon them and not to do that which is forbidden. \n    If he falls short in that then he is exposed to divine wrath and punishment. \n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO you who believe! Ward \n    off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and \n    stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey \n    not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that \n    which they are commanded\u201d\n\n    [al-Tahraam 66:6]\n\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cThere is no person whom Allaah appoints in charge of others and he \n    dies having betrayed his charges, but Allaah will forbid Paradise to him.\u201d \n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6731; Muslim, 142.\u00a0\n\n    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cEach of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock\u2026 The \n    man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock\u2026\u201d \n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 844; Muslim, 3408. Each person who was in a \n    position of authority and responsibility \u2013 including fathers \u2013 will be \n    questioned as to whether he did what was required of him, or not?\u00a0\n\n    It is well known that blessings and reward will result from \n    this questioning, if he did what was required of him, and that he will \n    deserve to be punished if he was careless and negligent. We ask Allaah to \n    keep us safe and sound.\u00a0\n\n    If the father\u2019s negligence is compounded by his having \n    forbidden his family to do good things or things that are obligatory, then \n    his sin will be even greater. Allaah has told us that this is the \n    characteristic of the hypocrites and evildoers, who enjoin evil and forbid \n    good. He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThe hypocrites, men and \n    women, are one from another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Munkar (i.e. \n    disbelief and polytheism of all kinds and all that Islam has forbidden), and \n    forbid (people) from Al-Ma\u2018roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam \n    orders one to do), and they close their hands [from giving (spending in \n    Allaah\u2019s Cause) alms]. They have forgotten Allaah, so He has forgotten them. \n    Verily, the hypocrites are the Faasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to \n    Allaah)\u201d\n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:67]\n\n    You have to be patient and seek reward, and continue to \n    advise your father. Seek the help of righteous people among your family and \n    relatives in doing so, and pray for him to be guided aright.\u00a0\n\n    You should beware of staying outside the home when there is \n    no need, because of the harm and fitnah (temptation) that may result from \n    that. If you need to go out, or are forced to do so, then you should observe \n    correct shar\u2019i hijaab. In question no.\n    6991 you can \n    find out the conditions of correct shar\u2019i hijaab.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to protect You and to guide your father to the \n    right way.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

When Allaah loves \n    people, He tests them, and whoever accepts that earns Allaah\u2019s pleasure, and \n    whoever is angry with that earns Allaah's wrath.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    (Hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2396; classed as hasan by \n    al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 146).\u00a0\n\n    So be patient and seek reward.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to what you mention about your husband, it is \n    regrettable. He has committed three haraam actions:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 Not spending on you and your children. The husband is \n    commanded to spend on his wife and children. If he fails to do that then the \n    wife has the right to refer the matter to the court, and she may also ask \n    for divorce.\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 His neglecting to look after his household and children \n    is a sin on him, even if he claims that this is for the sake of da\u2019wah, \n    because his soul has a right over him, and his wife has a right over him, \n    and his Lord has a right over him. He must give each of them his right. The \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) regarded neglect of \n    those who are under one\u2019s care as a sin, and he  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIt is sufficient sin for a man to neglect those \n    whom he supports.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1692; classed as hasan by \n    al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1484.\u00a0\n\n    Raising children and looking after them and the house is a \n    trust that rests on the father\u2019s shoulders. The Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cEach of you is a shepherd \n    and each of you is responsible for his flock\u2026 the man is the shepherd of his \n    household and is responsible for his flock.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 893; \n    Muslim, 1829.\u00a0\n\n    Please see also questions no. \n    20064 and \n    45359.\u00a0\n\n    3 \u2013 Taking drugs is a haraam action, and indeed is a major \n    sin. It corrupts a person\u2019s religious commitment and his worldly interests, \n    as well as damaging the body and mind, wasting money, and destroying honour. \n    It includes all kinds of evil.\u00a0\n\n    So beware of opening the door to it and falling in its trap.\u00a0\n\n    How many households has it destroyed, how many people has it \n    killed, how many blessings has it ruined, how much calamity has it brought \n    about!\u00a0\n\n    When people fall into the trap of drugs, hardly any are saved \n    therefrom, except those upon whom Allaah bestows His mercy and guidance.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to your desire for divorce, if your husband is \n    sincere in his repentance and truly regrets what he has done, and is \n    determined to reform himself, and if you still want him, then be patient and \n    seek reward for staying with him. Perhaps Allaah will reform him, especially \n    if he has asked you to stay with him and to wait for him. The fact that you \n    have children together may also make you think more carefully before you ask \n    for a divorce, because it is better for children to be raised with both \n    their father and their mother than for them to be raised by one parent \n    only.\u00a0\n\n    If the man is sincere in his repentance and his regret (of \n    the past), then it is better for you to be patient and to wait until he \n    comes out of prison, because that is in his interests and in the interests \n    of your children, and also in your own interests.\u00a0\n\n    But if you cannot bear to be patient and to stay without a \n    husband for this length of time (one year), or if the man is not sincere in \n    his repentance, there is no sin on you in that case if you seek a divorce, \n    and there is nothing good in your staying with him when he is persisting in \n    that sin.\u00a0\n\n    You have to make a great deal of du\u2019aa\u2019 to Allaah, and seek \n    His guidance by praying istikhaarah before you take any step. For \n    information on how to pray istikhaarah, please see questions no. \n    11981 and \n    2217. \u00a0\n\n    May Allaah set your affairs straight and guide you both to \n    the Straight Path.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Bringing servants from abroad",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is much that could be said about female \n    servants and the bad consequences of bringing them from abroad and letting stay in Muslim homes. Hence the Muslim should not resort to bringing \n    servants to live in the home, especially if there are adolescent boys in the house. If the servants are not Muslim, then it is even more definite \n    that they should not be brought into the home. The regrettable consequences of such actions are greater than can be enumerated.\u00a0\nThe one who brings in a servant also commits \n    other haraam actions, such as bringing her from her country without a mahram; causing her to be alone with non-mahram men in rooms and houses; and \n    looking at her and vice versa.\u00a0\nHence our scholars have warned against \n    employing servants except in cases of necessity.\u00a0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn \u2018Uthaymeen \n    said:\u00a0\nFirstly:\u00a0\nWe should not employ female or male servants \n    except in cases of necessity. That is because bringing these servants involves spending money that a person does not need to spend. It was proven \n    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade wasting money.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nSome of them are not honest enough to deserve \n    the trust we place in them, hence I say that we should not bring male or female servants from abroad unless the following conditions are met:\u00a0\nWith regard to women:\u00a0\nFirstly:\u00a0\nThe female servant should have a mahram with \n    her, because it is not permissible to bring her to the country otherwise. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \u201cNo \n    woman should travel without a mahram.\u201d If a woman is brought in and has no mahram with her, this is going against the prohibition of the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThere should be a need for her services. If \n    there is no need and the only reason for bringing her here is to live a life of luxury and have no obligations, or to make life easy for his wife \n    even though the housework is not much, then the issue is subject to further discussion.\u00a0\nThe third condition:\u00a0\nThere should be no fear of fitnah \n    (temptation). If a man fears that he or one of his sons \u2013 if he has sons \u2013 may be subject to temptation, then it is not permissible for him to \n    expose himself to that.\u00a0\nThe fourth condition:\u00a0\nShe should adhere to what is required of her \n    of hijab, so she should cover her face and not uncover it. It is not correct to quote as evidence the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and \n    protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for \n    necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over \n    Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their \n    husband\u2019s fathers, or their sons, or their husband\u2019s sons, or their brothers or their brother\u2019s sons, or their sister\u2019s sons, or their (Muslim) \n    women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess\u201d\n    [al-Noor 24:31]\u00a0\nand it is not correct to interpret that as \n    meaning that it is permissible for a female servant to uncover her face in front of her male employer, because the one who hires a servant does \n    not own her (as in the case of a slave); rather she is a hired worker employed by him, and a hired worker is like any other non-mahram female when \n    it comes to hijab.\u00a0\nThe fifth condition:\u00a0\nHe should not be alone with her. If there is \n    no one else in the house with him, it is not permissible for him to employ her at all. If there are other people in the house with him but the \n    household members go out from the house and leave him alone with this servant, that is not permissible, because the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cNo man should be alone with a woman unless her mahram is present.\u201d\u00a0\nAs\u2019ilat al-Baab al-Maftooh, \n    no. 619\u00a0\nHe also said:\u00a0\nBringing a female servant from her country without a mahram is haraam, because the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cNo woman should travel alone without a mahram.\u201d But if she is already in the country and \n    he brings her to work as a servant in his house, if she is going to come to the house, do what is needed then go back to her own house, there is \n    no doubt that this is permissible, but if she is going to stay in his house, this is a dangerous matter, especially if he has adolescent sons, for \n    then there is the fear of immorality as has happened on some occasions. But if he does not have adolescent sons, then we hope \u2013 in sha Allaah \u2013 \n    that there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better to avoid that and for her to stay elsewhere and come to do her work in the morning or \n    afternoon and then go back.\u00a0\nAs\u2019ilat al-Baab al-Maftooh, \n    no. 526.\u00a0\nIn conclusion: because of the shar\u2019i \n    restrictions that we have noted above, and because there is no need in your case \u2013 since the parents do not want to bring a servant \u2013 then we do \n    not advise the brother to bring a servant.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "He consummated the marriage with her and found that she was not a virgin even though she has never committed any immoral action",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If your husband is wise and religiously committed, and he trusts you a great deal, then what he should do is to believe you when you say that you are innocent of any wrongdoing, especially since the breaking of the hymen may be caused by many things, not necessarily by committing the sin of fornication.\u00a0\nThis is if we accept what you have discovered about your not being a virgin. It may be that intercourse has taken place between you but the hymen was not broken, and so there was no bleeding, because of the nature of the hymen. It may be that the hymen is flexible and cannot be broken by intercourse, and requires medical intervention, as is well known to the experts in this field.\u00a0\nThe hymen is simply a physical sign which cannot be considered proof of whether the woman is a virgin or not or whether she has committed an immoral act or not. Hence we find that in court, usually the absence of the hymen is not regarded as grounds for making accusations against the woman, because it may be broken for many reasons.\u00a0\nSo the fact that the hymen is present is not a positive indication that a woman is a virgin, and its absence is not a positive sign of the opposite.\u00a0\nWe advise you to refer to a female doctor to make the matter clear, because there may be many reasons why the hymen is broken.\u00a0\nWe hope that your husband will understand this matter and will not be hasty in judging you. You should be aware that one of the aims of the Shaytaan is to cause division between husbands and wives, because of the great evil that results from that affecting families and individuals, as we see in the hadeeth of Jaabir who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u2018Iblees placed his throne on water then he sends out his emissaries, and the closest of them to him in status is the one who causes the most fitnah (tribulation). One of them comes and says, \u2018I did such and such,\u2019 and he says, \u2018You have not done much.\u2019 Then another of them comes and says, \u2018I did not leave him alone until I caused division between him and his wife,\u2019 and he draws him close to him and says, \u2018How good you are.\u2019\u201d Muslim, 5023.\u00a0\nSo he should close this door to the Shaytaan and avoid thinking about this matter, so long as this matter is not definitive and you are certain that nothing bad happened. \u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to guide him and to reconcile between you.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "Her friend keeps company with men and commits sins, and she refuses to accept advice. What is to be done?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nStudying in a mixed environment is haram, and it causes a great deal of mischief in society. What the sister says in her question is only a small part of the results of forbidden mixing.\u00a0\nWe advise everyone who wants to protect himself and not to fall into that which Allah has forbidden to keep away from these mixed places as much as possible, whether that is for study or for work, because of the things involved that go against sharee\u2019ah and because of the evils to which they may lead.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWhat the questioner has mentioned about her friend is very unfortunate; we ask Allah to guide her and bring her back to the right path. Your duties towards her are to offer sincere advice and guidance, and to remind her of Allah and that death is real, and that this world does not last.\u00a0\nAllah has created Paradise for those who obey Him, and He has created Hell for those who disobey Him. If she responds to the advice then praise be to Allah. If she insists on committing sin and following the path of the Shaytaan, then Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThe duty of the Messenger [i.e. Our Messenger Muhammad whom We have sent to you, (O mankind)] is nothing but to convey (the Message)\u201d\n[al-Maa'idah 5:99]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd remind (by preaching the Qur\u2019aan, O Muhammad), for verily, the reminding profits the believers\u201d\n[al-Dhaariyaat 51:55]\u00a0\n\u201cSo remind them (O Muhammad) \u2014 you are only one who reminds.\n22.\u00a0You are not a dictator over them\u201d\n[al-Ghaashiyah 88:21-22]\u00a0\n\u201cO you who believe!

If you follow the (right) guidance [and enjoin what is right (Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbid what is wrong (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)] no hurt can come to you from those who are in error\u201d\n[al-Maa'idah 5:105]\nTry to look for righteous friends who can help you to adhere to the truth. Beware of sitting with bad companions, for Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur\u2019aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them.

We have discussed some of their (parents\u2019) rights in the answer to question no.\n    5053.\u00a0\nWhat you have said about your brother\u2019s \n    treatment of your parents is an evil action and is a major sin. You have to advise him and remind him of what Allaah has enjoined upon him towards \n    his parents and relatives.\u00a0\nIt is not permissible for you to accuse \n    others of practicing witchcraft against your brother. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us against suspicion, \n    and told us that it is the falsest of speech. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cBeware of suspicion, because suspicion is the falsest of speech; do not spy on one another, do not pry into others\u2019 affairs, do not hate \n    one another; be brothers.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4849; Muslim, 2563.\u00a0\nSo you have to look for the reasons why your \n    brother is doing this to you. There may be causes that you can put a stop to and help him to overcome.\u00a0\nIf there is no apparent reason, there is \n    nothing wrong with asking someone whose religious commitment and knowledge you trust to recite ruqyah for him and find out what is going on. If he \n    finds out that he has been bewitched, then you have to treat him with remedies that will remove that sihr (magic), remedies that are proven in the \n    Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah.\u00a0\nWhatever the case, such a situation requires \n    deliberation and wisdom in your dealing with him. Whether he is disobeying his Lord by treating his parents badly or he has been bewitched, he is \n    sick, and the sick person needs to be treated kindly in order to find the most suitable remedy for his condition. \u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to set the affairs of all the \n    Muslims straight.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "Their father is active in da\u2019wah but they are complaining about his bad treatment of his family",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Muslim must develop a good attitude and commendable conduct. He has to avoid the things that incur the wrath of Allaah, and say only that which is best. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd say to My slaves (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) that they should (only) say those words that are the best. (Because) Shaytaan (Satan) verily, sows a state of conflict and disagreements among them. Surely, Shaytaan (Satan) is to man a plain enemy\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:53]\nThe Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe believer does not slander, curse, or speak in an obscene or foul manner.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1977, from the hadeeth of \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mas\u2019ood. Classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibaan, 1/421; al-Haakim, 1/57; al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, 5381.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Abu\u2019l-Darda\u2019 (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah hates the obscene, foul-mouthed person.\u201d Narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, 2002.\u00a0\nAl-San\u2019aani said:\u00a0\nThis hadeeth tells us that swearing and cursing are not characteristics of the true believer, but an exception is made in the case of cursing kaafirs, drinkers of alcohol and those whom Allaah and His Messenger cursed.\u00a0\nSubul al-Salaam, 4/198.\u00a0\nSo the believer has to develop the attitude described in the Qur\u2019aan, and the attitude exemplified by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), especially towards his family. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \u201cThe best of you is the one who is best to his family.\u201d\u00a0\nAl-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nHere we are told that the best of the people are those who are best towards their families because the family are the ones who most deserve to cheerfulness, good attitude and kindness; benefits should be brought to them and harm warded off from them. If a man is like that then he is the best of people, but if he is the opposite then he is the worst type. People often make this mistake, so you see a man who, when he meets his family he treats them in the worst and most unkind manner, and when he meets strangers who are not part of his family, he is gentle and polite and kind to them. Undoubtedly a person who is like that is deprived of divine support and is going astray from the straight path. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. \u00a0\nNayl al-Awtaar, 6/360.\u00a0\nThe group with whom your father is going out is well known for having and promoting good characteristics, so the basic principle is that he is like that too, and that he fears Allaah. We say to you \u2013 if what you say about your father is true \u2013 that this is a test, and you have to be patient and pray that Allaah will guide him to the best of attitudes and characteristics.\u00a0\nPatience undoubtedly brings a great reward. His wife must also be patient and put up with her husband\u2019s annoyance, and obey him with regard to that which Allaah has permitted. If he is forbidding her to visit her relatives for a legitimate shar\u2019i reason, then he has the right to do that, but if there is no legitimate reason then she has to obey him, but he is sinning, and the wife will be rewarded in sha Allaah.\u00a0\nMore advice may be found in the answer to question no. 482. We advise you to look at that, and we advise both husband and wife to read the answer to question no. 10608, which explains the rights of each spouse over the other.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Her uncle sexually abused her and this has affected her psychologically",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly what your uncle did\u00a0 is a crime \n    that deserves punishment in this world and torment in the Hereafter. Many people\u2019s religious conscience has been weakened by what they see and \n    read, which provokes their desire, so they fulfil their desires in ways that Allaah has forbidden. One of the most abhorrent and evil examples of \n    that is incest between a man and his mahrams (female relatives to whom marriage is forbidden), which is deserving of a severe punishment in the \n    Hereafter.\u00a0\nYour mistake was not telling anyone in your \n    family so that they could put a stop to what this uncle was doing. But because that is in the past and has now ended, and you hated the situation \n    from the outset, there is no sin on you now.\u00a0\nYou have to try to forget the evil thing that \n    he did, and learn a lesson from it for the future, for yourself and your children. We advise you to pray to Allaah and ask Him to relieve you of \n    your worry and take away your distress. Some du\u2019aa\u2019s that have been narrated in the Sunnah are as follows:\u00a0\n\n    (a)\n    It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say:\n\u201cAllaahumma inni a\u2019oodhu bika min al-hamm \n    wa\u2019l-hazn wa\u2019l-\u2018ajz wa\u2019l-kasal wa\u2019l-bukhl wa\u2019l-jubn wa dala\u2019 al-dayn wa ghalbat al-rijaal (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from distress, \n    grief, incapacity, laziness, miserliness, cowardice, the burden of debt and from being overpowered by men).\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 6008.\u00a0\nIbn Hajar said:\u00a0\nThe interpretation of these things is: \n    \u201cdistress\u201d means bad things that the mind imagines are happening at present; \u201cgrief\u201d for what has happened in the past; \u201cincapacity\u201d is the \n    opposite of ability; \u201claziness\u201d is the opposite of being energetic; \u201cmiserliness\u201d is the opposite of generosity; \u201ccowardice\u201d is the opposite of \n    courage.\u00a0\nFath al-Baari.\u00a0\n\n    (b)\n    It was narrated that \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mas\u2019ood said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cThere is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: \u2018Allaahumma inni \u2018abduka ibn \u2018abdika ibn amatija naasyati bi yadika, maada \n    fiyya hukmuka, \u2018adlun fiyya qadaa\u2019uka.

I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught \n    to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Qur\u2019aan the life of my heart and the \n    light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety),\u2019 but Allaah will take away his distress and grief, and replace it \n    with joy.\u201d He was asked: \u201cO Messenger of Allaah, should we learn this?\u201d He said: \u201cOf course; everyone who hears it should learn it.\u201d\nNarrated by Ahmad, 3704; classed as saheeh by \n    Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 199.\u00a0\nSo do not give in to the pain of the past and forget yourself. You have to keep yourself busy \n    with acts of obedience to Allaah, such as memorizing Qur\u2019aan, reading books of knowledge and the biographies of the righteous salaf, and look for \n    good friends.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to bless you with that and \n    more.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "He has a problem with forgetfulness, lack of focus and not being organized",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nYou should praise Allaah for the blessings that He has bestowed upon you, namely Islam and true guidance, good health, the ability to hear, see and speak, and other innumerable blessings, including the positive things and success in your professional and family life that you mention. You should utter words of praise and thanksgiving to Allaah, for how many people are deprived of these blessings or many of them?\u00a0\nIf a person is content with that which Allaah has decreed for him, and is aware of the blessing of Allaah in the things that He has given him, he will enjoy peace of mind and his fear and grief will disappear. This will usually bring a solution to many of the things that are bothering him, such as lack of focus, shyness and so on.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nRest assured that these things that you mention can be dealt with, improved and changed, but this depends on whether you really want that and do the things that will help you to achieve that. One of the greatest means of doing that is asking Allaah to improve your attitude and to grant you maturity, and to protect you from the evil of your own self, and so on. So strive to recite a lot of the du\u2019aa\u2019s of that type narrated from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\u00a0\nAnother means of improving your memory and reducing forgetfulness is to keep your mind busy and make it get used to memorizing verses from the Book of Allaah. The more a person memorizes, the easier it becomes for him and the more enthusiastic he will become, and more able to achieve that.\u00a0\nAnother means is to stop looking, listening, speaking, eating and sleeping too much, so that your heart will be prepared to memorize that which is beneficial, for too many distractions make the mind unfocused.\u00a0\nWhat is meant by doing too much of these things is that for which there is no need and in which there is no benefit.\u00a0\nAnother means is to avoid haraam things, especially in food and drink, and looking. Concerning this al-Shaafa\u2019i (may Allaah have mercy on him) wrote his famous lines of verse:\u00a0\n\u201cI complained to Wakee\u2019 about my bad memory, and he advised me to give up sin.\nHe said, \u2018Know that knowledge is light, and the light of Allaah is not to be entrusted to a sinner.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nThere is nothing wrong with you reading some books about organization which will help you learn the methods of being organized, making decisions, and controlling your feelings of anxiety and shyness, and interacting with people in general.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to give you strength and success in this world and in the Hereafter."

        "question": "She is married to a Muslim and hijab is putting her off Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There can be no doubt that Allaah only enjoins that in which there is wisdom, but in some cases the wisdom behind some rulings may be hidden from people, and in some cases it may be quite obvious \u2013 such as the prohibition on alcohol which clouds the mind and hinders people from the remembrance of Allaah and from prayer [cf. al-Maa'idah 5:91].\u00a0\nThe wisdom behind the prescription of hijab is one of the most clear, because it is a covering for woman and guards their chastity, and it prevents the foolish from making approaches and harassing them. How often has a woman\u2019s hijab prevented the devils among mankind from harrassing her? How often have unveiled women made a display of their beauty and charms, which has led to their being harrassed by the foolish? Concerning this, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\n[al-Ahzaab 33:59]\nThis verse gives the complete answer to your question, because Allaah mentions here the command to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to tell his wives and daughters and the believing women to wear hijab, and it mentions the wisdom behind that, which is so that they may be protected and not exposed to annoyance.\u00a0\nWhen women go out showing most of their bodies \u2013 as the questioner mentions \u2013 this is one of the greatest causes of crime and corruption of men\u2019s morals, and of the spread of immorality. It is also degrading for woman, as we see women becoming cheap products for business-owners and advertisers, who show woman half-naked and devoid of modesty in order to attract customers and market their products.\u00a0\nA woman\u2019s body belongs to her and is not to be shared with people. When she gets married it belongs to her husband and she should not let anyone else have a share in it. What does a woman want when she shows her body and exposes her charms to onlookers? Does she just want them to look and stare, and what is the affect of that on rapists and the foolish? How are you going to stop them from getting what they want by attacking you and trying to rape you. Are you going to show some meat to the hungry and then try to stop them from eating it?\u00a0\nIn a modern study it was shown that:\u00a0\n65% of female workers are exposed to sexual harassment in their place of work in some European countries.\u00a0\n18% of women in America have been raped or been subjected to attempted rape at some stage in their lives.\u00a0\nMore than half of victims were under the age of 17.\u00a0\nKitaab Ihsaa\u2019aat, Diraasaat, Arqaam (p. 140).\u00a0\nIslamic sharee\u2019ah brought that which is best for men and for women, and for the family and society. It does not impose restrictions on women as some enemies of Islam claim. Islam allows women to work, seek knowledge, engage in business, testify in court, uphold the ties of kinship, visit the sick, and so on, but it has set limits regarding her going out in order to protect her and to prevent the foolish from harassing her.\u00a0\nWe say to the questioner:\u00a0\nMany western women, when they think about it and come to know the reality of Allaah\u2019s laws concerning women, do not hesitate to declare their Islam and enter into the religion of the Prophets and the righteous.\u00a0\nIn Islam, women are protected and looked after. That is not in return for her staying in the home only, rather that is because she plays a great role, which is taking care of her husband and raising and caring for children. This is an important role, because the soundness or corruption of society depends on the extent to which mothers are successful in their raising and teaching of their children.\u00a0\nOne of the largest British insurance companies carried out a study on one million housewives, which produced amazing results. This study showed that the average full-time housewife spends 19 hours per day meeting the needs of her family, because she is the one who is raising the children, teaching them, looking after family members when they fall sick, and is responsible for the household budget.\u00a0\nIn addition to that \u2013 looking at what the houswife\u2019s value from a purely materialistic point of view, far removed from any emotional criteria \u2013 a woman who stays at home is the most valuable thing the family can have.\u00a0\nOp. cit., p. 118, 119\u00a0\nIt has become clear to many wise women the serious danger posed by the false freedom that they are enjoying and they have finally realized where this path will lead them. It is stated in another study that:\u00a0\n80% of American women think that the freedom that women have gained in the last 30 years is the reason for the promiscuity and violence that are prevalent nowadays. \u00a0\n75% feel worried about the loss of values and the disintegration of the family.\u00a0\n80% have great difficulty in combining their responsibilities at work with their responsibilities towards their husbands and children.\u00a0\n87% said that if the clock was turned back they would consider the demands for equality as a social conspiracy against the United States and they would resist those who raise the banner of equality.\u00a0\nop. cit., p. 147\u00a0\nAll it needs is for you to think about the matter a little, and look at real life, and you will see that hijab spares women from evil, harm and crimes. Islam has closed the door to such evils with its laws, including the requirement for women past the age of puberty to wear hijab.\u00a0\nFinally we would like to congratulate you on the fact that Allaah has granted you a Muslim husband, so that you will be able to see Islam in practice from him and his Muslim relatives, which may encourage you to enter Islam and which may remove the barrier of fear about entering this great and purely monotheistic religion. Also note that entering this final religion, which Allaah wants for all people, is a great honour of which you may be deprived if you delay and death then overtakes you. So hasten to enter Islam, with submission to the will of Allaah, with eagerness and delighting in this blessing of Allaah.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou should note that if you fall short in your observance of hijab because your human weakness or you feel embarrassed in front of your people, this is regarded as a sin. That should not prevent you from doing the great good deed which will lead you to Paradise and save you from Hell, namely embracing Islam. You should also note that the Shaytaan (Satan) is the enemy of all the sons of Adam, and he is the one who is stirring up these doubts in order to prevent you from entering this religion, so that he can increase the number of those who will follow him to Hell. So be strong and courageous in making the decision that will lead to eternal happiness, by Allaah\u2019s leave. We ask Allaah to help you and to give you the will power to enter Islam as our sister in Islam, and to share this blessing. We thank you for your confidence in us.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Guide to the Straight path."

        "question": "She has the bad habit of nail biting",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The doctors say that the phenomenon of nail biting among children is connected to psychological problems. If you have had this problem since you were small, then we advise you to consult a psychologist whom you trust with regard to his religious commitment and knowledge.\u00a0\nFrom the point of view of sharee\u2019ah:\u00a0\nIslam brought the best of attitudes and habits, and forbids bad attitudes and habits. This habit \u2013 nail biting \u2013 is disliked by most people and they regard it as a bad habit. This is in addition to the physical harm that it may do, because of the dirt that collects under the fingernails and the damage that this may do to the nails and teeth.\u00a0\nHence you should make yourself stop this habit. That may be difficult in the beginning, but you will get used to it and it will become a habit after that. This is the case with all good attitudes that a person can make himself do until they becomes a habit and second nature for him. As the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \u201cKnowledge comes by learning and patience comes by making oneself be patient.\u201d classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, 2328.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Possession and the illusions and facts that are connected to it",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There are some facts and some illusions connected to the issue of jinn possession, and among most people nowadays the illusions outweigh the facts. The Sunnis are unanimously agreed that the jinn can dwell in the bodies of humans, but that does not mean that everyone who has epilepsy is possessed by the jinn, because epilepsy may have physical causes. The pains etc. that many people feel in their bodies cannot be ascribed for certain to the actions of the jinn, rather they may be illusions or something imaginary.\u00a0\nSo you should not pay any attention to the whispers of the Shaytaan that make you think that he has done this and that you can control it. This is one of the ways in which the Shaytaan deceives the Muslim and makes him think that he can control him, and that he has powers that in fact he does not possess. This may lead to bad consequences as has happened to many people.\u00a0\nYou have to keep on treating yourself with ruqyah, for the Book of your Lord is available to you. Recite from it and treat yourself with ruqyah. Whether you are possessed or not, you will undoubtedly benefit from this reading and ruqyah.\u00a0\nFor more information please see question no. 3476.\u00a0\nIf you go to someone who is known for using ruqyah as prescribed in sharee\u2019ah and is also righteous and keeps away from deviance and myths, there is nothing wrong with that and it may be a means of your being healed from this problem.\u00a0\nYou have to seek the help of Allaah and pray to Him and beseech Him to prevent the plots of the devils among mankind and the jinn from harming you. Man is always in need of his Lord, and Allaah is Able to rid you of these thoughts, illusions and facts that are harming you.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "He married a second wife and they became Muslim \u2013 what should he do with his first wife?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nWe praise Allaah for having guided them to Islam, and we ask Allaah to make them steadfast in Islam until death, so that they may attain the Paradise of Allaah and His good pleasure. We give them the glad tidings that Islam erases whatever sin came before it. No matter what sins a person may have committed, if Allaah then blesses him with guidance to Islam, then he will become cleansed and free from sin as on the day his mother bore him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSay to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven\u201d\n[al-Anfaal 8:38]\n\u201cIf they cease\u201d means if they give up their kufr or disbelief by submitting to Allaah alone, with no partner or associate. Tafseer al-Sa\u2019di.\u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIslam erases whatever came before it\u201d (narrated by Muslim, 121) \u2013 meaning, of sin.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nA man does not have the right to form a relationship with a woman who is a stranger (non-mahram) to him. If something of that nature happened before they got married, it is a sin which is recorded against them. If that happened before they became Muslim, then Allaah has forgiven it when they became Muslim.\u00a0\nIf that happened after they became Muslim, then they have to repent from that. Allaah has promised to accept the repentance of the one who turns to Him in repentance. He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do\u201d\n[al-Shoora 42:25]\n\u201cBut indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.\u201d\n[Ta-Ha 20:82]\nFor more information on repentance and its conditions, please see question no. 13990.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nThere is no sin involved in a man\u2019s marrying a second wife. Allaah has permitted a man to have up to four wives, if he is able to treat them fairly and give them all their rights. He does not have to inform his first wife of his desire to marry a second or that he has already done so.\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nWith regard to the man's duties towards his children and first wife, he has to spend on them according to their needs. What really matters is that he should try to guide them and save them from the Fire, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded\u201d\n[al-Tahreem 66:6]\nSo he must do all that he can to call his wife to Islam and to advise her, and encourage her to embrace Islam. If she refuses then he can still remain married to her and not divorce her if she is from among the People of the Book (i.e., Jewish or Christian). But if she is an idol-worshipper then it is not permissible for her to remain the wife of a Muslim, so in that case he has to divorce her.\u00a0\nPlease see also question no. 9949.\u00a0\nIt should be noted that if one of the parents becomes Muslim and his children are still small (i.e., below the age of adolescence), then they are judged to be Muslim because of his becoming Muslim. But if they are adults or have reached the age of adolescence, then that is not the case. See al-Mughni, 13/115; Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah by Ibn al-Qayyim, 2/507.\u00a0\nBased on this, if the small children know that Allaah has blessed him and them with guidance to the true religion, then he has to teach them about tahaarah (purity, i.e., wudoo\u2019) and prayer, and other rulings, so that they will grow up with it and get used to doing it, following the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \u201cTeach your children to pray when they are seven years old and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten, and separate them in their beds.\u201d\nNarrated by Abu Dawood, 495; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, 5868.\u00a0\nSee also question no. 10016.\u00a0\nHe should not stay here for work and leave his young children exposed to loss and deviation; he should try to bring them here to be with him, so that he will be able to do that which Allaah has enjoined him to do of bringing them up well. If he cannot bring them here then he should be in constant contact with them, corresponding with them and guiding them. It is not permissible for him to neglect them and leave them to be lost. He will be responsible for them on the Day of Resurrection. \u00a0\nWe also encourage our new brother and his wife to learn the rulings of Islam by reading and asking knowledgeable people and reading useful Islamic sites on the internet, and to apply whatever they have learned in the required manner.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to make them steadfast and help them to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Family problems caused by husband\u2019s brother",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The husband has to understand that Allaah has \n    enjoined upon him to take care of his children, to bring them up properly and to look after their affairs. He has also enjoined upon him to treat \n    his wife in a good and kind manner. Allaah will question him about every shortcoming with regard to these duties on the Day of Resurrection.\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO you who believe! Ward off yourselves and \n    your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from \n    executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded\u201d\n[al-Tahreem 66:6]\u00a0\n\u201cand live with them [women] honourably\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 4:19]\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThe husband should not allow into his life \n    anything that may come between him and his taking care of his family, such as working continually, or allowing friends or relatives to take all \n    his time or interfere in his family\u2019s affairs.\u00a0\nNowadays the Muslim cannot find enough time \n    to do all the things that Allaah has enjoined upon him, so how can he waste his time with other things at the expense of these duties?\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nThe wife should not try to come between her \n    husband and his family. She should not complain about him visiting them or their visiting him, unless he is giving that priority over the duties \n    that Allaah has enjoined upon him.\u00a0\nThe father should not give anyone priority \n    over his children, whether that is his brother or any other relative. Hence there is no need to cause a split and break the family ties between \n    your husband and his brother, or between the children and their paternal uncle, because that will have a far-reaching effect on their \n    relationships with other people and with their relatives.\u00a0\nFourthly:\n    We advise you to be kind and gentle towards your husband, and to show him that you have nothing against his relationship with his brother. Do not \n    cause your children to dislike him.\u00a0\nIf you see any shortcoming on your husband\u2019s \n    part with regard to his shar\u2019i duties towards you, then denounce that and remind him in a manner that is better, without being too harsh. You can \n    do that by hinting rather than stating it bluntly, unless there is a need for that. \u00a0\nWe have seen similar cases in some families \n    where the wife had another member of her family staying with them for some reason.\u00a0 So we think that the husband\u2019s treatment of his family will \n    get better if he sees his wife treating his family in a better manner.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Dealing With a Sister Who Doesn\u2019t Pray and is Misbehaved",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your getting in touch with us, and we ask Allaah to guide us and protect us from the evil of our own selves.\n\u00a0With regard to your sister\u2019s situation, it is the same in the case of many young people these days. We ask Allaah to guide them and us. Our duty towards them \u2013 as it seems to be \u2013 is as follows:\n\u00a0Firstly: we should turn to Allaah and ask Him to guide them, for He is the controller of the hearts. Perhaps a du\u2019aa (supplication) from the heart will be the cause of her happiness in this world and in the Hereafter.\n\u00a0Secondly: you should stop dealing with her on the basis that she is a child or that she does not know what is in her best interests. People \u2013 especially in adolescence \u2013 like the people around them to make them feel that they are important; they do not like people to treat them as if they are still children.\n\u00a0Thirdly: try to get her in touch with righteous young women, and keep her away from her friends who are not good, even if that means changing her school. That should be done without her realizing what is going on, because otherwise she may become more stubborn which will make the problem worse.\n\u00a0Fourthly: You should not look at her with disapproval only, rather you should express your approval of good things that she does and you should give her gifts if she does good things.\n\u00a0Fifthly: you could advise her via a person whom she likes, such as a teacher or friend, etc.\n\u00a0Sixthly: You should try to give her audio materials or books containing teachings in an indirect manner, such as putting them near her or listening to the audio in the car whilst she is riding in it.\n\u00a0With regard to her not praying, this is an extremely serious matter. The status of prayer in Islam is that of a foundation on which the entire structure rests. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \u201cThe covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever does not pray is a kaafir (disbeliever).\u201d (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2113)\n\u00a0And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cBetween a man and shirk (polytheism) and kufr stands his giving up prayer.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 82).\n\u00a0So you have to advise her and preach to her and guide her to the right way; for this purpose you may combine encouragement and threat, gentleness and strictness; if the matter requires some harshness sometimes, there is nothing wrong with using it.\n\u00a0The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cTeach your children to pray when they are seven years old, and hit them (lightly) if they do not pray when they are ten, and separate them in their beds.\u201d (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 495; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 466.\n\u00a0This strictness and harshness is only in her best interests.\n\u00a0We ask Allaah to set the affairs of the Muslims straight."

This is a great blessing that \n    cannot be matched by any other blessing on earth.\u00a0\n    Secondly:\u00a0\nUndoubtedly the committed Muslim who is new in Islam will face some difficulties \n    and problems, especially when they come from a way of life which has to be changed when one enters Islam. As a result, the new Muslim may face \n    some difficulties with his family and the society in which he lives.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nThe new Muslim must look for committed and righteous friends who can help him, \n    teach him and give him advice so that he will not be affected by the atmosphere around him, and so that the Shaytaan or bad friends cannot make \n    him slip or go back to his former ways. \u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nI advise this Muslim sister to fear Allaah and to wear proper Islamic hijab. She \n    may face some difficulties but Allaah will help her and will protect her if He knows that she has a sincere and pure intention.\u00a0\nFifthly:\u00a0\nI advise her not to go to university because that will lead her to doing some \n    things that are forbidden in sharee\u2019ah, such as dealing with riba (interest) \u2013 as mentioned in the question \u2013 or taking off her hijab or mixing \n    freely with men.\u00a0\nSixthly:\u00a0\nI advise her to look for a Muslim husband who will keep her chaste and under whose \n    protection she can live, as that Muslim taxi driver mentioned to her. She should seek the help of Allaah to achieve that. And she should strive to \n    learn Islam so that she can call others to Allaah and save whoever she can among her family, relatives and society from dying in shirk. This is \n    the best and most important of deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd who is better in speech than he who [says: \u2018My Lord is Allaah (believes in \n    His Oneness),\u2019 and then stands firm (acts upon His Order), and] invites (men) to Allaah\u2019s (Islamic Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and \n    says: \u2018I am one of the Muslims\u2019\u201d\n[Fussilat 41:33]\nI ask Allaah to make you steadfast in Islam and to guide your family.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "He doesn\u2019t like his wife to visit her family when her male cousins are there",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: I would like to remind you of what \n    the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cI have not left behind me any fitnah (temptation) that is more harmful to \n    men than women.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4808; Muslim, 2740, from the hadeeth of Usaamah ibn Zayd).\u00a0\nSecondly: It is permissible for a woman to be \n    in her father\u2019s house when there is a non-mahram present, so long as there is no fear of haraam mixing or of the fitnah (temptation) that may \n    happen as a result of that.\u00a0\nBut if there is no guarantee that there will \n    be no mixing and no fitnah, then that is not permissible. It is even more haraam if the woman does not observe proper Islamic hijaab.\u00a0\nThirdly: a boy of four years of age is not \n    considered to be a mahram because the role of a mahram is to guard and protect the woman, and this cannot be done by a four year old child. So it \n    makes no difference whether this boy is there or not.\u00a0\nFourthly: if your wife\u2019s father and brothers \n    take this man\u2019s presence lightly and do not care if he is alone with your wife or if she takes off her hijaab in front of him, then it is not \n    permissible for you to leave your wife with them, because they are careless about protecting their daughter. The Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cBeware of entering upon women.\u201d A man from among the Ansaar said: \u201cO Messenger of Allaah, what do you think of the \n    in-law?\u201d He said, \u201cThe in-law is death.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4934) and Muslim (2172), from the hadeeth of \u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018Aamir). So you must \n    protect your wife and feel protective jealousy and pride (gheerah) where she is concerned, and not expose her to temptation.\u00a0\nFifthly: With regard to her going on trips, \n    there is nothing wrong with that if the place to which she is going is not one where immoral people meet, such as beaches and other places which \n    are very dubious, and so long as she will keep her hijaab on and stay far away from places of temptation. If you are worried that the presence of \n    that non-mahram man will be a cause of fitnah or may make her do something that Allaah has forbidden, then you must not allow your wife to travel \n    with them. This is the matter of praiseworthy protective jealousy (gheerah) that is loved by Allaah and His Messenger. If a man feels protective \n    jealousy towards his family he will stop them from committing immoral actions and anything that may lead to that.\u00a0\nYou should note that most of the disasters \n    that befall families come from friends or relatives, so try your best to protect your wife from that.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Her husband\u2019s mother dislikes her \u2013 what should she do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    There is no problem that cannot by solved by anyone, as \n    stated in the question. For every problem there is a solution, but the \n    problem is not in finding the solution, rather it depends on the one who is \n    going to implement the solution. Many of those who go through difficult \n    circumstances and ask for a solution imagine that the person they are asking \n    is able to take away the problem, but this is not correct. Rather all that a \n    human being can do is to suggest the best possible ways of reaching the \n    desired result, but the person must still make the effort to solve his \n    problem \u2013 this is very important and essential.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to what you asked about:\u00a0\n\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    This dislike that they are showing may be based on incorrect \n    ideas about you, so perhaps it is only temporary and may disappear if you \n    try hard to be pleasant to them. I say this because we cannot be sure of \n    what may happen in the future. How often has a girl have been disliked by \n    her husband\u2019s family in the beginning, then as they got to know her and saw \n    her good manners and good attitude, they changed their minds about her and \n    their condemnation turned to praise and their hatred to love. So do not \n    worry about what may happen, just be cheerful and optimistic about your \n    future with your husband.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    You must show your best attitude towards your husband\u2019s \n    family, who have the right to be treated in a good manner by you because \n    they are the family of your husband. Pay a great deal of attention to his \n    parents, and take care of his mother as if she were your own mother. If she \n    comes to your house, try to meet her with a friendly and smiling face, and \n    do not pay too much attention to your husband whilst she is there with you, \n    because this may stir up feelings of jealousy, which are very strong in \n    human beings.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    Turn to Allaah and make du\u2019aa\u2019, and ask Him to help you to \n    treat them well and to soften their hearts and make them love you. Realize \n    that no matter how hard you look for a solution, help is ultimately in His \n    hand. So turn to Him with all sincerity. May Allaah send blessings and peace \n    upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family."

        "question": "How to Treat Anxiety in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can Muslims seek medical treatment?\nThere is nothing wrong with treating the diseases that befall a person, and this is not forbidden. But that is subject to the condition that the treatment does not cause side effects which are worse than the problem itself.\u00a0\nDoes ruqyah cure anxiety?\nWe advise the one who is sick \u2013 whether that is spiritual (mental) illness such as anxiety and depression , or physical illness such as various kinds of pain \u2013 to hasten first of all to treat the problem with ruqyah as prescribed in Shari`ah. This means verses and hadiths which are recommended in Shari`ah and in which the texts state there is healing for diseases.\u00a0\nHerbal treatment for anxiety\u00a0\nThen we advise treating it with natural materials which Allah has created, such as honey and plants, for Allah has created special properties in them which may treat many kinds of diseases, and at the same time they do not have any side effects on the one who takes them.\u00a0\nHow to treat anxiety in Islam\nWe think that you should not take artificial chemical remedies for anxiety . For this disease a person needs a spiritual remedy rather than a chemical one.\u00a0\n\nSo he needs to increase his faith and his trust in his Lord; he needs to make more du`a and pray more. If he does that, his anxiety will be removed.\u00a0\nSeeking to relax by means of doing acts of worship has a great effect on the soul, dispelling many kinds of psychological disease.\u00a0\n\nHence we do not see any benefit in going to a psychologist whose beliefs are corrupt, let alone one who is a non-Muslim. The more the doctor knows about Allah and His religion, the better advice he will give to his patient. \u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cWhoever works righteousness \u2014 whether male or female \u2014 while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)\u201d\u00a0[Al-Nahl 16:97]\nSuh\u2019ayb said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cHow wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and this applies to no one except the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks, and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by Muslim, 2999)\u00a0\n\nThis world should not be the main concern of the Muslim. Worry about his provision should not find any room in his heart or mind, lest that make his sickness and his anxiety worse.\u00a0\n\nAnas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever is mainly concerned about the Hereafter, Allah will make him feel independent of others and will make him focused and content, and his worldly affairs will fall into place. But whoever is mainly concerned with this world, Allah will make him feel in constant need of others and will make him distracted and unfocused, and he will get nothing of this world except what is decreed for him.\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2389; classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami\u2019, 6510)\u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cWhen a person spends his entire day with no other concern but Allah Alone, Allah, may He be glorified, will take care of all his needs and take care of all that is worrying him; He will empty his heart so that it will be filled only with love for Him, free his tongue so that it will speak only in remembrance of Him (dhikr) and cause all his faculties to work only in obedience to Him. But if a person spends his entire day with no other concern but this world, Allah will make him bear its distress, anxiety and pain; He will leave him to sort himself out, and cause his heart to be distracted from the love of Allah towards the love of some created being, cause his tongue to speak only in remembering people instead of remembering Allah, and cause him to use his talents and energy in obeying and serving them. So he will strive hard, labouring like some work-animal, to serve something other than Allah\u2026 Everyone who turns away from being a true slave of Allah and obeying Him and loving Him will be burdened with servitude, love and obedience to some created being. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018And whosoever turns away (blinds himself) from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent (Allah), We appoint for him a shaytan (devil) to be a qarin (intimate companion) to him.\u2019 [Al-Zukhruf 43:36].\u201d\u00a0(Al-Fawaid, p. 159)\nCan a believer become mentally ill?\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nCan a believer become mentally ill? What is the treatment for that according to Shari`ah? Please note that modern medicine treats these illnesses with modern medicines only.\nHe replied:\n\u201cUndoubtedly a person may suffer from psychological or mental diseases, such as anxiety about the future and regret for the past. Psychological diseases affect the body more than physical diseases affect it. Treating these diseases by means of the things prescribed in Shari`ah \u2013 i.e., ruqyah \u2013 is more effective than treating them with physical medicines, as is well known.\n\nOne of the means of treating them is mentioned in the sahih hadith from Ibn Mas\u2019ud (may Allah be pleased with him): \u201cThere is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: \u2018Allahumma inni \u2018abduka ibn \u2018abdika ibn amatika nasyati bi yadika, madin fiyya hukmuka, \u2018adlun fiyya qadauka. As-aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitabika aw \u2018allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw istatharta bihi fi \u2018ilm il-ghayb \u2018indaka an taj\u2019al al-Qurana rabi\u2019a qalbi wa nura sadri wa jala-a huzni wa dhahaba hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant; my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Quran the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety),\u2019 but Allah will take away his distress and grief, and replace it with joy.\u201d This is one of the remedies prescribed in Shari`ah.\nOne can also say \u201cLa ilaha illa Anta, subhaanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin (none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah), Glorified (and Exalted) be You [Above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers)\u201d [Al-Anbiya 21:87 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\u00a0\n\nWhoever wants to know more than that should refer to what the scholars have written about dhikr, such as al-Wabil al-Sayyib by Ibn al-Qayyim; al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Tayimiyah; al-Adhkar by al-Nawawi; Zad al-Ma\u2019ad by Ibn al-Qayyim.\u00a0\nBut because people\u2019s faith is weak nowadays, they are less receptive to the remedies prescribed in Shari`ah. So people nowadays have started to rely on physical medicines more than on the remedies prescribed in Shari`ah. But when a person\u2019s faith is strong, the remedies prescribed in Shari`ah are completely effective, and may work faster than physical medicine.\u00a0\nWe all know about the story of the man whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent on a campaign and he camped near some Arab people, but those people near whom he camped showed him no hospitality at all. Allah willed that their leader should be stung by a scorpion, and they said to one another, \u201cGo to those people who have camped nearby, perhaps you will find a raqi (one who can recite ruqyah) with them.\u201d The Companions said to them, \u201cWe will not recite ruqyah for your leader unless you give us such and such a number of sheep.\u201d They said, \u201cFine.\u201d So one of the Companions went and recited ruqyah for the one who had been stung. He recited Surat al-Fatihah only, and the one who had been stung got up as if released from a chain.\u00a0\nReciting al-Fatihah had such an effect on this man because it came from a heart that was filled with faith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him, \u201cHow did you come to know that it (Surat al-Fatihah) could be recited as a ruqyah?\u201d\u00a0\nBut in these times when religious commitment and faith have become weak, people have started to rely on external physical medicines, and they are suffering as a result.\u00a0\nBut on the other hand there are charlatans who play with people\u2019s minds; they are clever and are able to trick people, claiming that they are good reciters of ruqyah when in fact they are consuming people\u2019s wealth unlawfully. So people are caught between two extremes; one extreme is those who think that ruqyah has no effect at all, and the other is those tricksters who play with people\u2019s minds by reciting false and deceitful readings. And there are some who are moderate in their approach to this issue.\u00a0\u00a0(Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/465, 466)\nWe ask Allah to protect us and you from the evils of anxiety and worry, and to open our hearts to faith, guidance and tranquility.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Should he leave home because of his sisters\u2019 bad behaviour?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Your father made a grave mistake when he left the house and \n    went back to his own country. Allaah has entrusted him with something and he \n    has neglected that trust. What he should have done was to stay with his \n    children in order to discipline them, look after them and take care of their \n    affairs. Perhaps it is your father\u2019s leaving that made your sisters\u2019 \n    behaviour even worse.\u00a0\n\n    So we advise you, first of all, to convince your father, as a \n    matter of necessity, to come back to his wife and children, so that he can \n    take care of them and discipline them, or for all of them to join him in \n    Pakistan \u2013 even if that is done by force or by trickery \u2013 and perhaps that \n    would be better, because your staying in that land where there is kufr, \n    evildoing and moral laxity is what is affecting your sisters\u2019 attitude and \n    behaviour.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    Your mother, likewise, has to fear Allaah with regard to her \n    daughters and not give them free rein. Now she has taken on a heavy burden \n    of responsibility, especially since your father has left. So she should not \n    take things lightly with regard to her daughters. Your mother has to realize \n    the seriousness of what your sisters are doing and the damage their actions \n    may do to all of you in this world, and the sin which will be upon them in \n    the Hereafter and upon those who approved of their actions or who allowed \n    them to do that and made it easy for them to do evil actions.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    You have to be patient and to give thought to every action \n    before you do it. Staying with them is not entirely good, and leaving them \n    is not entirely good. Rather the matter depends on the effects of your \n    staying and the effects of your leaving. If your staying in the home will \n    affect your religious commitment and your sanity, and make you fall into \n    sin, then we advise you to leave. If your leaving will make their behaviour \n    worse and your staying will not affect your religious commitment and sanity, \n    then it is haraam for you to leave, because your leaving may make the sin \n    worse, which would mean that you were neglecting your responsibility and \n    being careless about that which has been entrusted to you.\u00a0\n\n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    Perhaps this is a test from Allaah for you, to expiate for \n    your bad deeds and to raise you in status, not a punishment. Hence we advice \n    you to be patient, not to make any hasty decisions, to make du\u2019aa\u2019 and to \n    beseech your Lord to guide your sisters to be good and chaste. We advise you \n    to look for means of guiding them such as getting them married, looking for \n    good sisters for them to mix with, moving house, and so on. Perhaps when \n    Allaah sees that you are sincere, He will help you and will guide your \n    sisters and your mother, and will unite the family in religious commitment \n    and goodness. For He is able to do that and He is the Guide to the Straight \n    Path.\u00a0\n\n    We will tell you the following story, from which you may \n    learn a lesson:\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: I used to call my \n    mother to Islam when she was a mushrikah. I called her one day and she said \n    something about the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) that I did not like to hear. So I went to the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) weeping, and said, \n    \u201cO Messenger of Allaah, I have been calling my mother to Islam, but she \n    refuses. I called her today and she said something about you that I did not \n    like to hear. Pray to Allaah to guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah.\u201d The \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \n    \u201cO Allaah, guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah.\u201d I went out feeling optimistic \n    because of the du\u2019aa\u2019 of the Prophet of Allaah  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him). When I came home and reached the door, I saw that it \n    was slightly ajar. My mother heard my footsteps and said, \u201cStay where you \n    are, O Abu Hurayrah!\u201d and I could hear the trickling of water. She took a \n    bath and got dressed, and put on her headcover, then she opened the door and \n    said, \u201cO Abu Hurayrah, I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah, \n    and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger!\u201d I went back to \n    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \n    and I came to him weeping with joy. I said, \u201cO Messenger of Allaah, rejoice, \n    for Allaah has answered your prayer and guided the mother of Abu Hurayrah.\u201d \n    So he praised Allaah and said good words. I said, \u201cO Messenger of Allaah, \n    pray to Allaah to make my mother and me beloved to His believing slaves, and \n    to make them beloved to us.\u201d The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \u201cO Allaah, make this slave of Yours \u2013 \n    meaning Abu Hurayrah \u2013 and his mother beloved to Your believing slaves, and \n    make the believers beloved to them.\u201d So there are no believing people who \n    hear of me even though they do not see me, but they love me.\n\n    \u00a0Narrated by Muslim, 2491\n\n    \u00a0And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "How can she tell her non-Muslim mother that her husband is going to take a second wife?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    There is nothing wrong with you happening to mention to your \n    mother whilst you are talking to her that your husband is thinking of taking \n    a second wife, and telling her that he has valid reasons for doing so, such \n    as not having any children from you, or that he is not satisfied with one \n    wife, and so on. That will be like an introduction for her if she knows. But \n    do not tell her about the matter now, less that open the door to problems \n    for you that you can do without. If she finds out about that in the future, \n    then you can explain to her, one way or another, that Islam is the religion \n    of justice and does not approve of injustice on anyone\u2019s part, and that in a \n    plural marriage there are many great benefits which the countries which \n    claim to be civilized cannot attain. (See question no. \n    12528). Even if she is not convinced at first, she will become \n    convinced as the days and years go by. But you should not express too many \n    objections about this matter in front of her, because by doing so you will \n    provoke her to criticize Islam. Rather you have to show her that you accept \n    this and approve of it, and show her that\u00a0 it is not affecting your \n    relationship with your husband."

        "question": "How to Control Sexual Desire in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Sexual desire is something that has been created in mankind and it cannot be got rid of . Getting rid of it is not something that is required of the Muslim; rather what is required of him is to refrain from using it in forbidden ways, and to use it in the ways that Allah has permitted.\u00a0\nThe problem of sexual desire in a young woman may be solved by taking two steps.\u00a0\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first step is to reduce and weaken the things that may provoke desire in a person. This may be achieved in a number of ways, including the following:\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lowering the gaze and refraining from looking at that which Allah has forbidden. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts).\u201d [An-Nur 24:31]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cDo not follow one glance with another, for the first [unintentional one] is pardoned but not the second.\u201d There are many sources of prohibited looking, such as looking directly at young men and thinking about their attractive looks, or looking at pictures in magazines and movies.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Avoiding reading stories and novels which focus on the sexual aspect , and avoiding reading internet websites which deal with such topics.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keeping away from bad company.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Avoiding thinking about desire as much as possible. Thinking in and of itself is not prohibited, but if one thinks about it for too long, that may lead a person to prohibited actions.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spending one's time in useful pursuits, because spare time may lead one to fall into prohibited things.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Avoiding as much as possible going to public places where young men and women mix .\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a girl is tested with studying in a mixed environment , and cannot find any alternative, she has to remain modest, serious and dignified, and should avoid sitting with young men and speaking to them as much as possible. She should restrict her relationships to friendships with righteous female classmates.\u00a0\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second step is to strengthen the factors that will prevent one acting in accordance with one\u2019s desires. This is achieved in a number of ways, including the following:\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strengthening the faith in one\u2019s heart and strengthening one\u2019s relationship with Allah. This may be achieved by remembering Allah a great deal, reading the Quran, thinking of the Names and Attributes of Allah, and doing a lot of Sunnah prayers. Belief strengthens the heart and soul, and it helps one to resist temptation.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fasting , as taught by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said: \u201cO young men, whoever among you can afford to, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and in guarding one\u2019s chastity. Whoever cannot afford it, then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.\u201d This is addressed to young men, but it also includes young women.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strengthening one\u2019s resolve and willpower, for this will make a young woman able to resist and control her desires.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Remembering what Allah has prepared for righteous young women. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, the Muslims (those who submit to Allah in Islam) men and women, the believers men and women (who believe in Islamic Monotheism), the men and the women who are obedient (to Allah), the men and women who are truthful (in their speech and deeds), the men and the women who are patient (in performing all the duties which Allah has ordered and in abstaining from all that Allah has forbidden), the men and the women who are humble (before their Lord Allah), the men and the women who give Sadaqat (i.e. Zakah and alms), the men and the women who observe Sawm (fast) (the obligatory fasting during the month of Ramadan, and the optional Nawafil fasting), the men and the women who guard their chastity (from illegal sexual acts) and the men and the women who remember Allah much with their hearts and tongues. Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise).\u201d [Al-Ahzab 33:35]\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thinking about the lives of righteous women who guarded their chastity, such as Maryam, whom Allah praises in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd Maryam (Mary), the daughter of \u2018Imran who guarded her chastity. And We breathed into (the sleeve of her shirt or her garment) through Our Ruh [i.e. Gabriel], and she testified to the truth of the Words of her Lord [i.e. believed in the Words of Allah: \u201cBe!\u201d and he was; that is `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) as a Messenger of Allah], and (also believed in) His Scriptures, and she was of the Qanitun (i.e. obedient to Allah).\u201d [At-Tahrim 66:12]\nAnd thinking about the immoral, fallen women, and comparing between the two types, for there is a huge difference between them.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choosing righteous companions and spending time with them, so that they can help one another to obey and worship Allah.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Comparing the effects of immediate fulfillment of desire when a girl responds to prohibited, which is followed by loss of pleasure and all that is left is regret and sorrow, with patience and striving against one\u2019s whims and desires, and realising that the pleasure of conquering one\u2019s whim and desires is far greater than the pleasures of enjoying prohibited things.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seeking help by calling upon Allah and asking Him for help. The Quran tells us the lesson to be learned from the story of Yusuf (peace be upon him):\u00a0\n\u201cHe said: \u2018O my Lord! Prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me. Unless You turn away their plot from me, I will feel inclined towards them and be one (of those who commit sin and deserve blame or those who do deeds) of the ignorant\u2019\n\u00a0So his Lord answered his invocation and turned away from him their plot. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.\u201d [Yusuf 12:33 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Her husband sits with non-mahrams and she objects to that",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    We begin by thanking Allaah for this \n    gheerah (protective jealousy); may Allaah help you to enjoin what is \n    good and forbid what is evil. We advise you to continue with what you are \n    doing of advising your husband and his relatives in the best manner, until \n    you find among these people someone whom Allaah will guide at your hands to \n    give up these haraam actions. In this way it will become easier for those \n    who think that they are weak and unable to change, to mend their ways and \n    adhere to the commands of sharee\u2019ah. You have to seek help in your efforts \n    to advise them by praying to Allaah for these people, being kind to them and \n    not acting superior to them, but rather showing kindness and compassion \n    towards them, because that is more likely to be accepted and this is \n    something that may earn their respect despite your young age.\n\n    \u00a0In addition to that, you must also strive \n    to avoid joining them in the wrong things that they are doing, lest you \n    yourself weaken with regard to these evil actions, especially the bad movies \n    that you mentioned. The believer cannot assume that he is safe from \n    temptation, rather he must help himself to fight it by keeping away from bad \n    things and by making du\u2019aa\u2019.\n\n    \u00a0With regard to what you said about feeling \n    sad, jealous and angry for the sake of one\u2019s religion, this is a blessing \n    from Allaah to His slave \u2013 but these feelings must be controlled according \n    to the guidelines of sharee\u2019ah. Sadness should not lead to despair and so \n    on. Allaah said to His Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him):\n\n    \u201cSo \n    destroy not yourself (O Muhammad) in sorrow for them\u201d\n\n    [Faatir 35:8]\n\n    Anger should not put off those whom \n    you are calling, for the purpose is to reform him, not simply to express \n    one's frustration and anger.\n\n    \u00a0So long as your husband is a Muslim who \n    prays and is kind (as you mention), then be patient with him and continue to \n    call him (da\u2019wah); perhaps Allaah will bless you by guiding him and causing \n    him to follow the ways of chastity.\n\n    \u00a0Perhaps if you think about the calamities \n    that have befallen other wives who have suffered because of husbands who are \n    worse than yours, that will make you put your husband\u2019s sins into \n    perspective. We ask Allaah to guide him and you, and to guide us and all of \n    mankind to that which He loves and is pleased with. And Allaah is the Source \n    of strength."

        "question": "Mixing with relatives who backbite",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The attribute of patience is a high status with which Allah blesses whomsoever He wills among His slaves, to make it easy for them to obey His commands and heed His prohibitions. Your attempts to bring people together and to get closer to your relatives is a praiseworthy effort which points to your success and correct thinking. For many people, if they are faced with even a part of what you have suffered, quickly lose patience and respond to cutting off of ties in like manner, because they think that upholding family ties is only obligatory when relatives respond in the same manner. This is a mistaken notion and the fact that it is mistaken is indicated by the hadeeth which was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, which says that a man said, \u201cO Messenger of Allah, I have relatives with whom I uphold the ties of kinship but they cut me off; I treat them well but they mistreat me; I am patient with them but they treat me in an ignorant manner.\u201d\u00a0 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf it is as you say, then it is as if you are stuffing hot ashes [in their mouths], and you will have with you [an angel] from Allah to support you against them so long as you continue to be like that.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2285). \u00a0\nIn this hadeeth, a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) complaining of his relatives\u2019 bad treatment of him, and in his complaint he mentioned something similar to what you have mentioned: he upheld the ties of kinship but they cut him off, he treated them well but they treated him badly. Yet despite that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him that if he was telling the truth, then his situation with them would be like one fills their mouths with ashes, so he is the one who is doing the right thing, and he would continue to have support from Allah against them. The general meaning of the hadeeth is to encourage the upholding of family ties even with those who doe not themselves uphold those ties. Praise be to Allah that this is what you have done and have forced yourself to do. I ask Allah to help you to do that which is good.\u00a0\nAfter that there is nothing more that you can do except to follow one good deed with another, one kind action with another. If they mistreat you then do to them the opposite of that which they have done to you.\u00a0\nYou should note that when you do that, you are doing it only to earn the pleasure and mercy of Allah. Do not expect any response to your good deed from them. But try not to tell people what they are doing to you. If you think that one of the causes of this problem is too much contact with them, there is nothing wrong with your reducing your visits with them.\u00a0\nPray to Allah to guide them; pray to Him when you are certain of a response, for Allah is Able to turn their hatred into love and their neglect into close ties.\u00a0\nWith regard to your question about du`as that will help you to be patient when faced with difficulties, there are many such du`as, and we will tell you some of them here:\u00a0\n-1-\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Ibn \u2018Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u201cWhen faced with difficulties the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would say: \u2018Laa ilaaha ill-Allah al-\u2018Azeem al-Haleem, laa ilaaha ill-Allah Rabb il-\u2018Arsh il-\u2018Azeem, laa ilaaha ill-Allah Rabb ul-samawaati wa Rabb ul-\u2018Arsh il-Kareem (There is no god except Allah, the Almighty, the Forbearing; there is no god except Allah the Lord of the Mighty Throne; there is no god except Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the noble Throne).\u2019\u201d\u00a0 (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7426).\u00a0\nAccording to a report narrated by Muslim: \u201cWhen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was concerned about an important matter or when he was worried\u2026\u201d (Muslim, 2130).\u00a0\n-2-\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u201cWhen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was distressed by something, he would say, \u2018Ya Hayyu, ya Qayyoom, bi rahmatika astagheeth (O Ever-Living, O Eternal One, by Your mercy I seek help).\u2019\u201d (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3524); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, 4777).\u00a0\nWe also want to tell you of something important which will help you to be more patient and will give you certain faith in Allah, especially when you are upset and worried. This is something which many people neglect. Do you know what it is?\u00a0\nIt is prayer, for prayer has a great effect in bringing peace to the heart and in dispelling worries and distress. It is one of the greatest means of being patient. This is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd seek help in patience and As-Salaah (the prayer) and truly, it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Khaashi\u2018oon [i.e. the true believers in Allah \u2014 those who obey Allah with full submission, fear much from His punishment, and believe in His Promise (Paradise) and in His Warnings (Hell)]\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:45]\nPrayer is the greatest thing by means of which help may be sought.\n\u00a0And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cIndeed, We know that your breast is straitened at what they say.\nSo glorify the praises of your Lord and be of those who prostrate themselves (to Him).\nAnd worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e. death)\u201d [al-Hijr 15:97-99]\n\u00a0Imaam Ibn Jareer al-Tabari said in his Tafseer: \u201c \u2018So glorify the praises of your Lord\u2019: with regard to matters which are worrying you, turn to Allah and give thank to Allah and praise Him, and pray, and Allah will take care of that which is troubling you.\n\u00a0This is similar to the hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \u2018When something troubled him, he would turn to prayer.\u2019\u201d (7/553)\n\u00a0Finally I ask Allah the Almighty, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, to bless us and you with certain faith, for He is Able to do that.\n\u00a0And Allah knows best."

        "question": "Can he delay Hajj because of problems with his wife?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    When a Muslim is able to do Hajj, he should hasten to do it, \n    and it is not permissible for him to delay it for no reason, because the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cHasten to do \n    Hajj \u2013 i.e., the obligatory Hajj \u2013 for none of you knows what will happen to \n    him.\u201d (Narrated by Ahmad, 2721; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in \n    al-Irwa\u2019, 990). And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cWhoever wants to do Hajj, let him hasten to do so.\u201d (Classed as hasan \n    by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1524).\u00a0\nWhat you have mentioned \n    about your brother\u2019s problems is not a reason for delaying Hajj, because \n    Hajj will not prevent him from dealing with this problem, since it is within \n    his power to try to solve this problem and finish with it before he goes for \n    Hajj. His Hajj may be the means of his problem being solved, because of the \n    help from Allaah it may bring and the blessing (barakah) of Hajj and \n    obedience to Allaah. It may be that he will make du\u2019aa\u2019 during his Hajj with \n    regard to this matter, and Allaah will answer and relieve him of this \n    distress.\u00a0\n\n    Moreover, our advice to your brother is that he should not \n    hasten to divorce his wife, rather he should take his time and not rush into \n    anything. For divorce is something that Allaah dislikes.\u00a0\n\n    If the problem between him and his wife is because of \n    negligence on her part regarding one of the duties towards Allaah, such as \n    if she neglects to pray or is not chaste, etc, then he has to warn her and \n    remind her about Allaah, and call her to Allaah, and try to guide her to \n    obey Allaah. If she persists in not responding to him, then in that case \n    there is nothing to be gained by keeping her.\u00a0\n\n    But if the problem between them is of the common type of \n    problems between spouses, and has to do with differences of opinion \n    concerning day to day life and household matters, etc., then he has to be \n    patient and treat her kindly, and try hard to correct what he thinks is \n    inappropriate. For Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cand live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it \n    may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of \n    good\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:19]\nThe husband has to live \n    with his wife honourably and keep her company in a good way, refraining from \n    harming her, and treating her kindly. Living with her honourably also means \n    putting up with any annoyance that his wife may cause him, and he should \n    remember that he will have a great reward for that from Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    A man may dislike his wife, but he keeps her out of obedience \n    to Allaah and treats her kindly, and then Allaah brings about a great deal \n    of good from that. He may be blessed with righteous children from her who \n    will benefit him in this world and in the Hereafter; or his dislike may be \n    taken away and replaced with love, as often happens.\u00a0\n\n    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cNo believing man should hate a believing woman; if he dislikes \n    one of her characteristics he will be pleased with another.\u201d (Narrated by \n    Muslim, 1469). What this means is that it is not appropriate for a believing \n    man to hate a believing woman, because even if he finds some bad \n    characteristic in her for which he may dislike her, he will find another, \n    praiseworthy, characteristic for which he will love her, such as her being \n    chaste or kind or obedient, or some other good characteristic. The same is \n    true of all people, each person has some good attributes and some bad \n    attributes. As the poet said:\u00a0\n\n    \u201cWho is there that is pleasing in all his characteristics? It \n    is enough honour for a man\u2019s faults to be few enough to count.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    The wise man is the one who weighs up both the good \n    characteristics and the bad.\u00a0\n\n    Your brother should make a lot of du\u2019aa\u2019 in the places and at \n    the times when du\u2019aa\u2019 is especially encouraged, during Hajj and otherwise, \n    asking that Allaah may reconcile him with his wife and create love between \n    their hearts.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best. May Allaah bestow \n    blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad."

        "question": "Can Muslims be affected by psychological problems?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly man may be afflicted with psychological problems such as worries about the future and grief over the past. Psychological problems affect the body more than physical problems do. We should know that the worries and distress that affect a person are among the things that expiate his sins and reduce the burden of sin; if he is patient and seeks reward with Allaah, he will be rewarded for that.\u00a0\nTreating these problems in the ways prescribed in Islam is more effective than treating them with physical medicine, as is well known.\u00a0\nOne of the treatments prescribed in Islam is to recite the du\u2019aa\u2019s narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to relieve worries and distress, for example, the saheeh hadeeth narrated from Ibn Mas\u2019ood (may Allaah be pleased with him): \u201cThere is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: \u2018Allaahumma inni \u2018abduka ibn \u2018abdika ibn amatija naasyati bi yadika, maada fiyya hukmuka, \u2018adlun fiyya qadaa\u2019uka. As\u2019aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw \u2018allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw ista\u2019tharta bihi fi \u2018ilm il-ghayb \u2018indaka an taj\u2019al al-Qur\u2019aana al-\u2018Azeema rabee\u2019 qalbi wa noor sadri wa jalaa\u2019 huzni wa dhihaab hammi (O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant; my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Holy Qur\u2019aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety),\u2019 but Allaah will take away his distress and grief.\u201d This is one of the remedies prescribed in sharee\u2019ah. One may also say: \u201cLaa ilaaha illa anta, subhaanaka inni kuntu min al-zaalimeen (There is no god but You, glorified (and exalted) are You, truly I have been of the wrongdoers).\u201d [cf. al-Anbiya\u2019 21:87]\u00a0\nAnother form of treatment is ruqya with which a person may treat himself \u2013 which is better. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do ruqyah for himself by reciting al-Mi\u2019wadhatayn (the last two soorahs of the Qur\u2019aan) when he went to sleep, then he would wipe his face and whatever he could of his body. Or a person may go to someone whose religious commitment he trusts to do ruqyah for him.\u00a0\nIf he wants to know more, he can refer to what the scholars have written about du\u2019aa\u2019 such as al-Waabil al-Sayyib by Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Shaykh al-Islam, al-Adhkaar by al-Nawawi, and Zaad al-Ma\u2019aad by Ibn al-Qayyim.\u00a0\nFrom the fatwas of al-Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen, Kitaab Fataawa Islamiyyah, vol. 4, p. 465-467."

        "question": "She married her boyfriend and is living a miserable life with him",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The story you tell in your question in and of itself offers a \n    serious lesson to every girl who follows her whims and desires, fails to \n    obey Allaah and leaves her family and her home in order to commit sin in an \n    atmosphere of fitnah. Your question also offers a lesson to every sinner, to \n    look at the consequences to which their sin may lead them. We ask Allaah to \n    forgive us, you and every Muslim man and woman.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the marriage contract between you and him, if \n    it was not done in the presence of your guardian and with his approval \u2013 \n    which is what seems to be the case \u2013 then it is not valid, and it is haraam \n    for you to stay with him in this case or to let him be intimate with you, \n    because he is not your husband. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said, \u201cThere is no marriage (nikaah) without a guardian \n    (wali).\u201d And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAny \n    woman who gets married without the permission of her guardian, her marriage \n    is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    I advise you to do a number of things:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 You must ask him to put this matter right, by making a \n    new marriage contract with you, with a mahr (dowry) and the presence of your \n    guardian and two witnesses. From what you say it seems that your family now \n    approve of your marriage to him. So there is nothing to prevent you putting \n    this haraam situation right. If that is not done then he is not your \n    husband, and it is haraam for you to stay with him.\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 I advise you to be patient and to seek reward with Allaah \n    for the difficulties and stress that you are facing. For these difficulties \n    will be an expiation for your previous sins. The Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cNo worry or grief befalls a \n    believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allaah will expiate thereby \n    some of his sins.\u201d Your patience will end in a way out, in sha Allah. As the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe way out \n    comes with patience.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    3 \u2013 Note that unpleasant things only happen to people because \n    of their sins. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of \n    what your hands have earned. And He pardons much\u201d\n\n    [al-Shoora 42:30]\nThe difficulties and \n    unhappiness that you are going through may be a punishment from Allaah for \n    your disobeying your family and committing this haraam action. But your \n    regret and putting this matter right, in sha Allaah, will be your \n    repentance, for the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cRegret is repentance.\u201d I hope that Allaah will take away from you, as \n    a result of this repentance, the worry and distress that you are feeling.\u00a0\n4 \u2013 Make a lot of du\u2019aa\u2019 \n    and feel that you are in need of Allaah and have no one else to turn to. \n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cIs not He (better \n    than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, \n    and Who removes the evil\u2026?\u201d[al-Naml 27:62]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd your Lord said: \n    \u201cInvoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for \n    anything] I will respond to your (invocation)\u201d[Ghaafir 40:60]\nIf a person is helped (by \n    Allaah) to make du\u2019aa\u2019, then his prayer will be answered. Make the most of \n    the times and places where du\u2019aa\u2019 is answered, such as when prostrating, \n    before saying the tasleem at the end of the prayer, in the last third of the \n    night, and on Fridays, especially after \u2018Asr prayer.\u00a0\n5 \u2013 You have to advise \n    your husband and cooperate with him in obeying Allaah. Take him by the hand \n    and start a new life in which your aim is to please Allaah. May Allaah help \n    you both to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allaah knows \n    best."

        "question": "Her brother is in love with a divorced woman with whom he had a previous relationship",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    I advise your father and the father of this woman not to \n    prevent this marriage, so long as there is no shar\u2019i reason to prevent it. \n    If your brother loves this woman and she loves him, then it is in their \n    interests to get married. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cThere is nothing better for two people who are in love than \n    marriage,\u201d i.e., if a man loves a woman and she loves him, then let them get \n    married, and that will calm them down and protect them from doing anything \n    haraam. Isn\u2019t their getting married better for him, for her and for their \n    families than their falling into something that Allaah has forbidden? The \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, addressing \n    the guardians of women, if a man comes to propose marriage: \u201cIf there comes \n    to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, \n    then marry (your daughter) to him; if you do not do that then there will be \n    fitnah (tribulation) and widespread corruption on earth.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    But if there is a shar\u2019i reason to prevent that, then our \n    advice to your brother is to obey his father and to remain chaste, and to \n    strive hard in doing so. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cWhoever strives to be chaste, Allaah will help him to be \n    chaste,\u201d i.e., whoever does his utmost to be chaste, Allaah will grant him \n    chastity and help him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAs for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will \n    surely guide them to Our paths (i.e. Allaah\u2019s religion \u2014 Islamic \n    Monotheism)\u201d [al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:69]\nAnd he should look for \n    another wife who will help him with his religious commitment and his worldly \n    interests.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to witchcraft, if a person regularly reads \n    Qur\u2019aan and recites the adhkaar that the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) used to recite when going to sleep, when waking up, \n    in the morning and the evening and at other times and in other \n    circumstances, then he will protect himself thereby from the accursed \n    Shaytaan. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cAllaah enjoined five things upon Yahya ibn Zakariyya, which he was to \n    follow and to enjoin upon the Children of Israel\u2026\u201d then he mentioned them, \n    among which was: \u201cand He commands you to remember Him. The likeness of that \n    is of a man who is being pursued by his enemy, until he comes to a strong \n    fortress where he protects himself from them. Similarly a person cannot \n    protect himself against the Shaytaan with anything better than the \n    remembrance of Allaah (dhikr).\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Al-Mi\u2019wadhaat (soorahs seeking protection with Allaah) are \n    among the greatest things by means of which a person may protect himself \n    against witchcraft, so recite them in the morning and in the evening, after \n    every prayer and before going to sleep.\u00a0\n\n    Make a lot of du\u2019aa\u2019 for your brother, that Allaah may guide \n    him and grant him wisdom.

Instead of rebuking him and putting him to shame, keep calm. This situation is an opportunity to teach your child.\n\n\nAdvise and exhort the child. Explain to him the Islamic rulings concerning stealing, and tell him that Allaah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\n\u201cCut off (from the wrist joint) the (right) hand of the thief, male or female\u2026\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:38]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted the pledge of women, when they made bay\u2019ah (oath of allegiance) to him, that they would not steal, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201c\u2026 that they will not steal\u2026\u201d [al-Mumtahinah 60:12].\nRemind your child that Allaah is always watching. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cHe is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be\u201d [al-Hadeed 57:4]\nAnd Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201c\u2026 Allaah is Witness to what you do.\u201d [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:98]\nTell him: Allaah can see you even if you steal something in secret, far away from the view of people, because He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cHe knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.\u201d [Ta-Ha 20:7]\nConfront the child: you have to confront the child with the reason and motive for stealing. For example, you could say to him, \u201cI know that you took candy from the store, and that you took it because you felt that you needed it, but stealing it was not the answer. Next time, if you want something, talk to me first.

Allaah has enjoined honouring \n          one\u2019s parents even if they believe in shirk (associating others in worship \n          with Allaah), so how about those whose sin is less than that?\nWith regard to your \n          moving out, if he agrees to that and it will be better for him, then \n          there is nothing wrong with it. Otherwise, strive to be patient in putting \n          up with what he does to you, for that will not be lost, and you will \n          meet it before Allaah (i.e., it will count in your favour on the Day \n          of Resurrection).\nIf a man who is employed \n          can put up with bad treatment from a boss, and bears his anger and insults \n          with patience for the sake of earning a living and keeping his job, \n          then you should certainly be able to put up with your father\u2019s bad treatment \n          and insults for the sake of pleasing Allaah and earning His reward. \n          If he dies after you have been patient with him, you will not regret \n          it, but if he dies when you are opposing him and shunning him, you might \n          blame yourself and say, \u201cIf only I had been patient, if only I had put \n          up with him\u2026\u201d I hope that you will convey my salaams to your father \n          and tell him that whoever strives against his own nafs (self) and does \n          not get angry will attain Paradise, as the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us.

Offer him advice when his \n          anger has ceased and he has calmed down, for then he will be more likely \n          to respond. Make the person with whom your father isangry go away quietly \n          so as not to make matters worse. There is nothing wrong with you defending \n          your mother, in fact this is required of you, but not by means of you \n          physically fighting with your father. Rather you should take your mother \n          quietly away from the scene after reminding your father of Allaah and \n          advising him to seek refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\u201cAnd \n          kill not your children for fear of poverty. We shall provide for them \n          as well as for you. Surely, the killing of them is a great sin\u201d [al-Israa\u2019 \n          17:31] \n\u00a0Allaah has commanded His slaves to put \n          their trust in Him in all their affairs, and He is Sufficient for those \n          who put their trust in Him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n          \n\u00a0\u201cand \n          put your trust in Allaah if you are believers indeed\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:23] \n          \n\u00a0\u201cAnd \n          whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him\u201d [al-Talaaq \n          65:3]. \n\u00a0So you have to put your trust in your \n          Lord and believe that He will provide for you and your children. Do \n          not let the fear of poverty prevent you from seeking to have children, \n          for Allaah has guaranteed provision for all. By not wanting children \n          for fear of poverty, you are imitating the people of the Jaahiliyyah.\n\u00a0You should also note that taking out \n          loans with interest is ribaa (usury), for which Allaah issues the warning \n          of a painful torment. It is one of the seven sins which condemn a person \n          to Hell. The Prophet  (peace and \n          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAvoid the seven sins\u00a0 which \n          condemn a person to Hell\u2026[which include] consuming ribaa.\u201d And he  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAllaah has cursed \n          the one who consumes ribaa, the one who pays it\u2026\u201d Consumption of ribaa \n          is one of the greatest causes of poverty and loss of blessings, as Allaah \n          says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\u00a0\u201cAllaah \n          will destroy Ribaa and will give increase for Sadaqaat (deeds of charity, \n          alms)\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:276]\n\u00a0I think that you do \n          not know the ruling on interest-based loans. So seeks Allaah\u2019s forgiveness \n          for what is in the past, and do not do it again. Wait for your Lord \n          to grant you a way out and seek provision from Him. Put your trust in \n          Him for Allaah loves those who put their trust in Him."

Advise \n          your brothers to try to honour your father and keep in touch with him \n          so as to strengthen the family ties and put right what has changed. \n          And Allaah is the Source of strength."

There is a need for people who have studied the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah, and who have an insight into and practical experience of human psychology, as well as knowledge of the experience and writings of non-Muslims in this field, to write about this subject properly and produce useful work in this field.

        "question": "Women wearing    perfume when they attend the mosque",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The point of reference for Islamic rulings must be the texts of the Quran and Sunnah, not one\u2019s own opinion, mood, desire or ideas about what is nice. Concerning this very issue many reports have been narrated which strictly forbid this (women wearing perfume when they go out). These reports include saheeh ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade women to wear perfume when they go out of their houses:\n\n\nAbu Moosa al-Ash\u2019ari said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAny woman who puts on perfume then passes by people so that they can smell her fragrance, is an adulteress.\u201d\n\n\nZaynab al-Thaqafiyyah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf any one of you (women) goes out to the mosque, let her not touch any perfume.\u201d\n\n\nAbu Hurayrah said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAny woman who has scented herself with bakhoor (incense), let her not attend \u2018Ishaa\u2019 prayers with us.\u201d\n\n\nMoosa ibn Yassaar said that a woman passed by Abu Hurayrah and her scent was overpowering. He said, \u201cO female slave of al-Jabbaar, are you going to the mosque?\u201d She said, \u201cYes,\u201d He said, \u201cAnd have you put on perfume because of that?\u201d She said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cGo back and wash yourself, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: \u2018If a woman comes out to the mosque and her fragrance is overpowering, Allah will not accept any prayer from her until she goes home and washes herself.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nThe reason for this prohibition is quite clear, which is that women\u2019s fragrance may cause undue provocation of desires. The scholars also included other things under this heading of things to be avoided by women who want to go to the mosque, such as beautiful clothes, jewellery that can be seen, excessive adornments and mingling with men. See Fath al-Baari, 2/279.\nIbn Daqeeq al-\u2018Eed said:\nThis indicates that it is forbidden for a woman who wants to go to the mosque to wear perfume, because this causes provocation of men\u2019s desires. This was reported by al-Manaawi in Fayd al-Qadeer, in the commentary on the first hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah quoted above.\nHaving examined all this saheeh evidence, there can be no room for debate or argument. Muslim women have to understand the seriousness of the issue and the sin involved in going against this shar\u2019i ruling. They should remember that they are going out to seek reward, not to fall into sin. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.\nBy the way, we recently read that biologists have discovered a sexual gland in the nose, i.e., there is a direct connection between the sense of smell and the provocation of desire. If this is true, then it is one of the signs that prove even to the kuffaar how precise are the rulings of this sharee\u2019ah which came to preserve chastity and to block the ways that lead to immorality."

        "question": "Her husband wants\r\n    to move far away from her family, and she does not want to go",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Basically the righteous wife should be obedient to her Lord and not\n        disobedient to her husband. There is no better deed than a woman obeying her husband as\n        Allaah has commanded, at the time when he is disobeying Him with regard to her. \nThe husband has the right to stop his wife from visiting her family\n        \u2013 if he thinks that doing so will serve some shar\u2019i purpose, for example, if she\n        is rebellious towards him every time she comes back from visiting them. But if he is doing\n        them wrong and they are not disobedient towards Allaah and they do not try to turn his\n        wife against him, then the husband is a sinner if he cuts their daughter off from them.\n        She also has to obey him with regard to not going out.\nThe husband has the right to relocate his family wherever he thinks will\n        be good for them, and his wife does not have the right to disobey him with regard to that,\n        unless it was made a condition in the marriage contract that he would not make her move.\n        If this condition was not stipulated, then she has no right to object.\nGood treatment of wives is a duty enjoined upon husbands by Allaah, when\n        He said (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c\u2026 and live with them\n        honourably\u2026\u201d [al-Nisa\u2019 4:19]. The husband does not have the right to\n        treat his wife badly. If he sees her doing something that goes against the sharee\u2019ah,\n        he should follow the steps laid down by sharee\u2019ah to put the matter right. Firstly,\n        he should exhort her in a good manner, and if that does not work, he should adopt the\n        method of forsaking her (i.e., not having marital relations with her). If that does not\n        work, then he may strike her, in a manner that does not cause pain or injury.\nIf the husband does treat his wife badly, that does not mean that she\n        should disobey him or go against what Allaah has commanded her to do with regard to him.\nWe advise the sister to do the following:\nstrive hard to do things that will please her husband such as speaking\n          nicely and treating him well.\n\nTo deal with him not on the basis that she is his opponent and his equal\n          with regard to commanding and forbidding, but on the basis that she is obedient to him and\n          is at his beck and call, because this will make a decent man feel shy, and will make\n          matters easier for her and help her to convince him. But he is the one who is in charge of\n          her (he is qawwaam over her), not the other way round.\n\nShe should offer lots of du\u2019aa\u2019 for her husband to be reformed\n          and for things to be made easy for her. She should put things right between herself and\n          her Lord so that Allaah will put things right between her and other people.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with asking someone whose religious commitment\n          she trusts and who is wise to intervene between her and her husband, to convince him to\n          change his mind about moving, if she thinks that this would have a bad effect on her\n          religious commitment or that it would make matters between them worse. Otherwise, she\n          should accept what Allaah has decreed for her.\n\nWe ask Allaah to make things easy for her and to choose for her whatever\n        is better for her spiritual and worldly interests.\n\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Tragedy of a woman\r\n    who has become Muslim, but she has two children and their father is Hindu",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.First of all, we would like to congratulate our sister for embracing\n        Islam, which is the joy for which wealth and souls would be sacrificed, for all the\n        blessing of Islam makes all grief and distress fade into insignificance.\nThe sister says that she loves a Muslim man. We say: it is not\n        appropriate for a Muslim woman to fall into the trap of nonsensical emotions and forbidden\n        relationships into which others fall. The love which people hear about and read about is\n        one of the dazzling tricks of the Shaytaan, and it usually happens with regard to things\n        that Allaah has forbidden. If a man finds that he likes a girl, the only option he has is\n        to ask her guardian (walee) for permission to marry her.\nThe mans mothers comment that new Muslims cannot be good\n        Muslims is false. Were the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) anything but new\n        Muslims, given that prior to their Islam they had been believers in Shirk? Does any\n        Muslim have any doubts about their commitment to religion and their character? Moreover,\n        we see that many new Muslims are many times better than many (born) Muslims! Just because\n        a Muslim is new does not mean that he will never be good, and just because a Muslim is\n        born in Islam does not mean that he is good. What counts is Taqwa (piety, awareness of\n        Allaah) and righteous deeds, as well as the length of time one has been in Islam and has\n        been worshipping Allaah.\nThere is no reason why knowledge of the man's marriage should not be\n        withheld from his parents, especially since this is in the interests of the sister and\n        there are so few people who can help her to overcome her difficulties. It is the woman who\n        needs a walee according to shareeah, not the man. However, we would prefer that he\n        wins his familys approval by convincing them, because this is in their best\n        interests, benefits which may be lost if they find out that their son concealed his\n        marriage from them.\nThe fact that the husband says he wants to call the children to Islam is\n        good. We ask Allaah to help him to achieve this. The fact that the Hindu father is evil is\n        sufficient reason for him not to make an open display of his calling the children to\n        Islam, if that could lead to this kaafir taking the children away by going to the kaafir\n        courts. You have to act with wisdom in this case.\nThe woman who is asking this question should not arrange her own\n        marriage even if she has been previously married, because shareeah does not permit\n        this. If she does not have a walee as required by shareeah, then her walee may be\n        the qaadi (judge) or whoever is in charge of the Muslim affairs in her country, such as\n        the head of the Islamic centre or his deputy.\nThey  especially the sister  have to seek the help of Allaah\n        in dealing with these problems which are giving her sleepless nights. Everyone should know\n        that whoever puts his trust in Allaah, Allaah will show him a way out. She has to make\n        duaa sincerely, and he has to try as hard as he can to advise his family and\n        change their views about new Muslims by showing them real examples of people who are the\n        opposite of what they think. With regard to the tragedy caused by the former husband, we\n        advise her again not to make an open display of her calling the children to Islam, lest\n        that should cause the father to do something that will have bad consequences. If they feel\n        suspicious about his intentions, there is no harm in calling the police to do whatever is\n        necessary with regard to him.\nIf getting married means that the sister will lose her right to custody\n        of her children, we advise her not to get married now, for fear that these two souls may\n        end up in Hell in the Hereafter  unless she fears that she herself may commit some\n        immoral action, in which case she should marry the Muslim man whom she has told us about,\n        with witnesses and a walee as we have stated above. Publicizing the marriage is sunnah,\n        although it does not have to be announced officially and in writing. But this sister has\n        to live in a protective Muslim environment and those people will have to know about her\n        marriage lest she bring upon herself gossip about her honour. If it will be better for her\n        to leave the place where her ex-husband lives and move to another place where she can be\n        free, have custody of her children and be able to marry a believing Muslim man who will\n        protect her and her children, then she should do that.\nShe has to make duaa and turn to Allaah to relieve her\n        distress and grief. We pray that Allaah will give her the strength to do that which He\n        loves and which pleases Him.\nAnd Allaah knows best."

Then he recited\n    (interpretation of the meaning): Shaytaan (Satan) threatens you with poverty and\n    orders you to commit Fahsha (evil deeds, illegal sexual intercourse, sins); whereas Allaah\n    promises you forgiveness from Himself and bounty [al-Baqarah 2:268].\n    (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2914; he said it is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth).\nShaytaan here refers to Iblees or one of his troops.\n    A hold (literally, touch) means coming close and having an effect. Here it\n    refers to what happens in the heart as a result of the influence of the devil or angel.\n    Reminding him of evil such as Kufr (disbelief), immorality and wrongdoing.\n    Disbelieving the truth means denying the rights of Allaah or the rights of\n    creation, or denying something that has been proven to be truesuch as Tawheed,\n    Prophethood, Resurrection, the Day of Judgement and Paradise and Hell. As for the\n    hold of the angel, it is reminding him of goodness such as prayer and fasting.\n    And believing in the truth such as the Books and Messengers of Allaah.\n    Whoever finds that means in himself, or notices or recognizes it, i.e., the\n    hold of the angel. Let him know that it is from Allaah means it is a great\n    blessing and wonderful mercy that has come to him because Allaah commanded the angel to\n    touch him. Let him praise Allaah for this great blessing, because it has\n    qualified him to be guided by the angel to this goodness. Whoever finds the\n    former means the hold of shaytaan. Then he recited means the Prophet\n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) he quoted the aayah (interpretation of\n    the meaning): Shaytaan (Satan) threatens you with poverty means he\n    scares you with it to stop you spending in good ways. and orders you to commit\n    Fahsha (evil deeds, etc.) means sins.\nIn the light of this great hadeeth, you can now understand your\n    situation. The something that is bringing you goodness is bringing you a\n    blessing from Allaah, so give thanks and praise to Allaah for it. The other one who is\n    coming to entice you to go out and dance and form illicit relationships with evil, dirty\n    people is from the Shaytaan, so seek refuge with Allaah from that every time he tempts you\n    with these evil dangers. \nSecondly, do not worry about there being so many lost souls around you,\n    do not let these hordes of kaafirs who are drowning in the sea of their reckless desires\n    and sins distract you from the purpose for which you were created. Allaah says\n    (interpretation of the meaning):\nAnd if you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead\n    you far away from Allaahs path (al-Anaam 6:116)\nAnd most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it\n    eagerly (Yoosuf 12:103)\nO young Muslim woman, what is the value of life if a person lives only\n    to follow his or her own desires, steeped in vice, dancing and singing, getting drunk and\n    causing uproar, engaging in illicit sexual conduct and behaving like an animal? Allaah\n    says (interpretation of the meaning):\nThey are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are\n    the heedless ones (al-Anaam 6:179).\nThirdly, as you are living in a negative atmosphere filled with so many\n    kuffaar and Muslims who do not adhere to their religion and who may not know anything\n    about Islam other than its name, and surrounded with trials and temptations as you are,\n    you have to cling to Allaah and adhere to His shareeah (laws), turn to Him and pray\n    always to Him to protect you from sin and help you to adhere to your religion. Always\n    repeat this duaa: Yaa muqallib al-quloob thabbit qalbi ala deenak\n    (O Controller of the hearts, make my heart adhere firmly to Your religion). Because\n    your mother, the Mother of the Believers Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with\n    her) narrated from her husband, your Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah\n    be upon him) that he used to recite this duaa (Yaa muqallib al-quloob\n    thabbit qalbi ala deenak) frequently. She asked, O Messenger of Allaah, we\n    believe in you and in what you have brought. Do you fear for us? He said, Yes,\n    for peoples hearts are between the fingers of Allaah and He turns them as He\n    wills. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2066. He said, this is a hasan hadeeth).\nFourthly, try to look for other Muslim women so that you can remind one\n    another of the truth and encourage one another to be patient. Do whatever you can to call\n    your parents to the way of truth, for how many young people have been the cause of their\n    elders being guided!\nFinally we ask Allaah to guide you in the ways of peace and to make you\n    steadfast on the path of Islam and to bless you with the sweetness of faith. We entrust\n    you to the care of Allaah, for those who are under His care will never be lost."

        "question": "His wife claims that she was raped",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If what \n          your wife has recently told you is what really happened, then she has \n          committed a major sin and an act of clear betrayal by giving in to this \n          attacker and not trying to escape or stop him or call for help and so \n          on.\u00a0 Her claim that she was forced to do it is not acceptable, \n          because she makes no mention of being threatened with a weapon or being \n          tied up, etc.\u00a0 If this is indeed the case, and she clearly did \n          not try to defend herself, then what should you do and how should you \n          regard her?\u00a0 \nThere \n          is no doubt that you should warn her and remind her about Allaah and \n          the Last Day and its horrors, and explain to her the seriousness of \n          overstepping the limits set by Allaah and betraying one\u2019s spouse. You \n          should also remind her of the terrible punishment dictated by sharee\u2019ah \n          for the married person who commits adultery, which is stoning to death.\u00a0 \n          \nAfter \n          warning her in this fashion, if you see that she regrets what she did \n          and is striving to be righteous, there is nothing wrong with staying \n          with her, and your marriage will still be valid.\u00a0 It seems most \n          likely that this woman is indeed sorry for what she did and has repented, \n          because she is the one who has brought up the subject after it had been \n          forgotten, and she has told you about it. Perhaps this is because of \n          her guilty conscience and sincere desire to seek forgiveness from her \n          husband.\u00a0 The sin that she committed when she was very young and \n          living in the ignorant environment of America, and where she may have \n          resisted at the beginning of the attack, then softened, is nothing like \n          the sin of a woman who goes out of her way to commit it, and plans to \n          do it deliberately. Our advice is that if this woman is now righteous \n          and truly regrets what she did, then you should forgive her, especially \n          as you may by now have children who will suffer if you divorce her.\u00a0 \n          At the same time, you should continue to teach her, keep an eye on her \n          and not stay away from her for too long.\u00a0 We ask Allaah to acceptance \n          repentance from us all.\n\u00a0Finally, \n          I want to address a serious matter that you refer to in the second part \n          of your question, which is the fact that you say you no longer want \n          to go to the mosque or pray or make du\u2019aa\u2019, because of the crisis that \n          you are facing.\u00a0 This is very strange, for whenever the Prophet \n           (peace and blessings of Allaah \n          be upon him) was faced with a serious matter he would turn to prayer \n          and ask Allaah to help him, and he taught us to do likewise. We should \n          not turn away from the houses of Allaah (mosques) or stop praying and \n          making du\u2019aa\u2019. Where else can you turn in times of trouble and who else \n          can you ask for protection in this crisis? Turn back to Allaah, my brother, \n          ask Him to relieve your distress and seek His help with patience and \n          prayer, for Allaah is with those who are patient."

        "question": "Are there social classes in Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Human societies have known all kinds of class systems.\n    In some societies there is a class of princes, a class of warriors, a class of farmers and\n    a class of slaves, and based on this there is a lot of oppression, abuse and trampling on\n    people\u2019s rights. But the sharee\u2019ah or law of Allaah does not recognize such\n    systems at all. Islam gives equal rights to all, rich and poor, noble and ignoble. The\n    basic principle on which people are differentiated in Islam is mentioned in the Holy\n    Qur\u2019aan, in Soorat al-Hujuraat (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cO mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and\n    made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most\n    honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has al-taqwa [i.e., is one of the\n    muttaqoon or pious]. Verily, Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware\u201d\n[al-Hujuraat 49:13]\nThe Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cO\n    people! Verily your Lord is One and your father [Adam] is one. An Arab is no better than a\n    non-Arab, and a non-Arab is no better than an Arab; a red man is no better than a black\n    man and a black man is no better than a red man \u2013 except if it is in terms of taqwa\n    (piety)\u2026\u201d (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 22391; al-Silsilat al-Saheeh,\n    2700).\n    This is the principle on which society is based in\n    Islam. This is the global human society which mankind is trying to attain through its\n    far-fetched ideas, but is failing to do so, because they are not following the one\n    straight path that will lead them there, the way to God, may He be glorified, and because\n    they are not standing under the one banner that could unite them, the banner of God, may\n    He be exalted.\nPeople live on this earth connected by all kinds of relationships, all\n    of which carry some weight or have some attraction in their lives\u2026 these include\n    lineage, power, wealth, etc. From these stem other connections, practical, economic, etc.,\n    where people have different positions and levels of status with regard to one another. So\n    some people have more status than others in worldly terms\u2026 Then Islam comes and says:\n    \u201cthe most honourable of you with Allaah [God] is that (believer) who has al-taqwa\n    [i.e., is one of the muttaqoon or pious]\u201d so it ignores all the values that carry\n    weight in people\u2019s lives, and replaces them all with this new value that is derived\n    directly from the Revelation and is the only one that is recognized in the standards of\n    God. This is piety and consciousness of God, which is manifested in the worship of God\n    lone, with no partner, no son, no equal\u2026 obeying what He commands and avoiding what\n    He forbids, seeking His pleasure and Paradise, and fearing His punishment and Hell-fire.\nAllaah is All-Seer of His slaves."

        "question": "He\r\n    discovered that his wife used to go out with someone before she got married",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If this woman has mended her ways and has repented to\n    Allaah and has given up haraam things and going out with men, and there are no reasons to\n    be suspicious about her, then our advice is that your friend should keep her and conceal\n    her past mistakes. Whoever conceals a Muslims faults, Allaah will conceal his faults\n    in this world and the next. Allaah is Forgiving and Merciful, He forgives and accepts the\n    repentance of the one who turns to Him in repentance. So we should be forgiving and should\n    treat the one who has repented in accordance with the way he is now, and help him to\n    continue to repent. The one who has repented is like one who has never sinned at all. If\n    the husband conceals his wifes past mistakes and treats her well, this will be of\n    immense benefit in helping this woman adhere to the straight path and encouraging her to\n    continue living a life of purity and chastity; her husband will also have a great reward\n    for concealing her faults, keeping her chaste and helping her to avoid evil and stay on\n    the straight path, living under his care in a pure atmosphere in the marital home.\nIf this woman is still persisting in mischief and going out with men\n    and committing haraam actions, and does not repent despite being advised to do so, then we\n    do not suggest that he should keep her at all. Let him get rid of her and Allaah will\n    provide him with another wife.\nIf she has repented, but he cannot bear what she has done in the past,\n    and he is tormented with bad thoughts that give him sleepless nights, and he is scared\n    that if he keeps her he may mistreat her even though she has repented, then he can divorce\n    her so as to give himself peace of mind and avoid mistreating her. But he should look at\n    the matter anew and think long and hard about the advice we have given here. Let him think\n    about himself too: maybe he has made mistakes in the past, or will do so in the future. We\n    ask Allaah to help him to make the right decision and to guide him to the best way. Allaah\n    is the Source of strength and the Guide to the Straight Path."

        "question": "Disaster for a\r\n    family because of a father who does not fear Allaah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If the situation is as you describe, then what can we\n    say about the immense disaster of a father who does not pray or fast, who drinks\n    intoxicants and commits immoral acts, who neglects his family and calls them to do evil\n    deeds? Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah; hasbunaa Allaah wa niam al-wakeel;\n    innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raajioon (There is no strength and no power except\n    with Allaah; sufficient unto us is Allaah and He is the best Disposer of affairs; verily\n    we belong to Allaah and unto Him we will return). [These are duaas\n    recited by Muslims when faced with calamity  Translator] Does he not\n    know that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n     Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire\n    (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern (and) severe,\n    who disobey not (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which\n    they are commanded.[al-Tahreem 66:6]\nDoes he not know that the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah\n    be upon him) said:\nThere is no person to whom Allaah has given responsibility and\n    dies neglecting that responsibility, but Allaah will deny him Paradise. (Reported\n    by Muslim, 203)\n    Every one of you is a shepherd and every one of\n    you is responsible for his flock (those under his care) a man is the shepherd over\n    the members of his household and he is responsible for them\nAllaah will ask every shepherd about that for which\n    he was responsible. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1627).\n    There is no person to whom Allaah has given\n    responsibility over others and he failed to take care of them by advising them sincerely,\n    but he will never smell the fragrance of Paradise. (Reported by al-Bukhaari,\n    6617).\n    We ask Allaah to bring this man back to the truth.\nKnow that even though your father has caused you so much suffering, it\n    is not permissible for you to sever your ties with him, in spite of all that you have\n    mentioned. You must keep in touch with him and treat him kindly. You and your siblings\n    should treat him kindly and express your fears for him and your love for him, because of\n    his rights as a father, and because severing ties with him and ignoring him in a hostile\n    manner will only make matters worse. Neither you nor your siblings should obey him in sin.\n    You mention in your message that your father used to treat you well when you gave him\n    money, so if giving him money will put an end to his bad treatment and make things go back\n    to normal, so that you will treat one another well and he will see love and sacrifice on\n    your part, then why not do that? This is provided that he does not use this money to buy\n    haraam things. Try to restrain your anger and forget his past shortcomings in his\n    behaviour towards you. Try to honour him and show love towards him. Visit him and look\n    after him. Maybe this will stir up true fatherly feelings in him, and maybe stop him from\n    doing haraam things. Dont even think of severing ties with him. Get in touch with\n    your brother and ask him to get back in touch with his father. Know that your being\n    patient with him is a kind of jihaad, which will be rewarded. The idea of not visiting him\n    until he repents is not right, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others\n    that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world\n    kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to\n    Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do. [Luqmaan 31:15]\nVisit him, so long as it does not cause you unbearable harm or make you\n    do wrongful things. Know that one of the ways to make a sinner repent is having someone\n    who will call him to repent and remind him of Allaah. A child has to treat his parents\n    honourably even if they are mushrikeen. Al-Qurtubi said:\nThe aayah indicates that one should honour kaafir parents as much\n    as possible by spending on them if they are poor, by speaking kindly to them, and by\n    calling them to Islam.\nWith regard to your sister, she must be careful when she stays with her\n    immoral father. Locking herself in is a good safety measure and may well be essential at\n    times. If she does not feel safe in the home of this immoral father, she should go and\n    live somewhere else where she can be safe, such as in your house, if it is suitable. Maybe\n    Allaah will give her a righteous husband who will take care of her and protect her.\nWe ask Allaah to guide your father and to bring him out of darkness\n    into light. May He forgive you for your sin and help your sister and all of us to adhere\n    steadfastly to the truth. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

        "question": "Resisting the temptation of women",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke the\n    truth when he said, I am not leaving behind any fitnah (trial, temptation) more\n    harmful to men than women. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4706).\n    He \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also\n    said: This world is sweet and dazzling, and Allaah has you put in charge of it to\n    see how you will do and what you will do, so beware of this world and beware of women, for\n    the first fitnah (temptation, trial) that befell the Children of Israel was concerning\n    women. (Reported by Muslim, 4925).\n    You have to deal with two things, one now and one in the\n    future. As far as your past misbehaviour is concerned, you must repent sincerely to Allaah\n    right now, and do good deeds to expiate for your bad deeds, as was reported in the hadeeth\n    of Ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that a man kissed a woman\n    [who was unlawful for him]; he came to the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be\n    upon him) and told him about it, [saying, I met a woman in the garden, and I\n    embraced her, touched her and kissed her]. [Here I am, judge concerning me as you\n    wish.] [He started asking how he could expiate for this, and (the Prophet \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) did not say anything]. Then Allaah revealed\n    the words (interpretation of the meaning): And perform al-salaah at the two ends\n    of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil\n    deeds [Hood 11:114]. The man asked, O Messenger of Allaah, is this\n    just for me? He said, It is for all of my ummah (reported by\n    al-Bukhaari, 495; additional material in brackets is from the reports of al-Tirmidhi,\n    Ahmad, Muslim and Ibn Maajah, in that order), so do a lot of acts of\n    worship and good deeds, so that Allaah may accept your repentance. \n    As far as the future is concerned, you are not permitted at all to go\n    to places where there is corruption and free mixing, where you are likely to meet women.\n    You say that you cannot control yourself, so why do you go to places where you spend time\n    chatting informally with women, and then say that you cannot resist? What you say is\n    completely unacceptable. If you avoid the places and things that lead to evil, and do not\n    expose yourself to it, you will protect yourself from falling into sin. Fear Allaah, for\n    Allaah is watching you to see how you will do and what you will do. Beware of going to\n    places that will lead you into haraam things. Remember that the more you indulge in haraam\n    activities, the more difficult it is to retreat, so nip it in the bud. Stick to righteous\n    company, and keep away from evil things and evil people. Do everything that will help you\n    to remain chaste, such as hastening to marry and lowering your gaze. I ask Allaah to\n    protect you from the temptation of women. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

        "question": "Family problems because a Muslim woman wants to marry a Christian man",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is regrettable indeed that anyone would fail to adhere to the\n    religion which Allaah has commanded us to adhere to. What is even more distressing is the\n    fact that a Muslim woman would have a relationship (of any kind) with a non-related\n    Christian man for ten years, when she knows that this is something which angers Allaah,\n    Who has forbidden believing women to do such things in the Quran (interpretation of\n    the meaning):  they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking\n    boyfriends [al-Nisaa 4:25]. Equally upsetting is the fact that what\n    this Muslim girls father fears most  with regard to the marriage described\n     is not Allaah, but what his mother will say and how his reputation among his\n    relatives will be affected.\nIn any case, there is no way out of this problem now except one: this\n    man must become Muslim in a real sense, and start to practise Islam, and he and this girl\n    should repent for what they have done. Then marrying him will be permissible, and what\n    people may say does not matter, so long as everything is done in accordance with Islam and\n    in a way that will not earn the anger of Allaah; the matter can also be explained to close\n    relatives. If this is not possible, then the relationship with this man should be cut\n    completely, and all thought of him should be dismissed from ones mind. If, my\n    sister, you feel that there is some harshness in this answer, then by Allaah it is only in\n    your best interests and out of concern for you. We ask Allaah to accept our repentance and\n    have mercy on us, for He is the One Who accepts repentance and is All-Merciful."
