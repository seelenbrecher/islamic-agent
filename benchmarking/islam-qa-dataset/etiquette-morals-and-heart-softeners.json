        "question": "Should the supplication for hearing thunder be repeated if the thunder is continuous?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is no proven report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he used to say this dhikr when hearing thunder. Rather it was narrated with a sound isnad from \u2018Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) that if he heard thunder, he would stop speaking and say: \u201cSubhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra\u2018du bi hamdihi wa\u2019l-mala\u2019ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him.\u201d Then he would say: This [thunder] is a stern warning to the people of the earth.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (723) and Malik in al-Muwatta\u2019 (3641). Its isnad was classed as sahih by an-Nawawi in al-Adhkar (235) and al-Albani in Sahih al-Adab al-Mufrad (556).\nIt was also narrated from others among the Sahabah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They narrated from Ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: We were with \u2018Umar on a journey and suddenly there was thunder, lightning and hail. Ka\u2018b said to us: Whoever says three times when he hears thunder \u201cSubhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra\u2018du bi hamdihi wa\u2019l-mala\u2019ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him\u201d will be protected from that thunder. We said it and we were protected.\"(Al-Adhkar by an-Nawawi\u00a0 p. 181).\nIbn \u2018Allan said: al-Hafiz said: This isnad is hasan and mawquf [meaning that it stops at the Sahabi]. Even though it was narrated from Ka\u2018b, Ibn \u2018Abbas and \u2018Umar approved of it, which indicates that it has a basis. \u00a0\nEnd quote from al-Futuhat ar-Rabbaniyyah \u2018ala al-Adhkar an-Nawawiyyah (4/286).\nHence it is recommended (mustahabb) to say this dhikr when hearing thunder.\nIt was narrated in a marfu\u2018 report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that when he heard the sound of thunder and lightning, he would say: \u201cAllahumma la taqtulna bi ghadabika wa la tuhlikna bi \u2018adhabika, wa \u2018afina qabla dhalika (O Allah, do not kill us with Your wrath and do not destroy us with Your punishment and protect us before that).\u201d\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (3450), who said: This is a gharib hadith; we only know it through this isnad. It was classed as da\u2018if (weak) by an-Nawawi in al-Adhkar (p. 181) and by al-Albani in Da\u2018if at-Tirmidhi (3694).\nEven though this hadith is da\u2018if, as at-Tirmidhi himself said, when it comes to the hadiths that encourage virtuous deeds in general, and supplications (du\u2018a\u2019s) in particular, the matter is flexible, and the scholars usually took a lenient approach towards their isnads.\nIn al-Mustadrak it was narrated that \u2018Abd ar-Rahman ibn Mahdi said: If we narrated a report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speaks about what is halal and haram, or about rulings, we are strict in examining its isnad and its narrators. But if we narrate hadiths that speak of the virtue of various deeds, reward and punishment, permissible matters and supplications, we are lenient in examining their isnads.\nAl-Mustadrak \u2018ala as-Sahihayn (1/666).\nAl-Qadi Abu Ya\u2018la (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from Imam Ahmad that he said: When we narrate [reports] from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speak of halal and haram, we are very stringent in examining the isnads. But when we narrate reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speak of the virtue of various deeds and reports that do not affirm or abrogate a ruling, we are lenient in examining the isnads.\"(Tabaqat al-Hanabilah\u00a01/425).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We have previously noted that the scholars are agreed that one may act on a da\u2018if hadith that speaks of righteous deeds, but not matters of halal and haram.\"(Al-Majmu\u2018 Sharh al-Muhadhdhab\u00a0 3/248).\nAl-Hattab said: Even though this is da\u2018if, the scholars are agreed that it is permissible to act in accordance with a da\u2018if hadith that speaks of the virtue of a particular deed.\"(Mawahib al-Jalil\u00a0 1/17).\nIbn Hajar al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is permissible to act in accordance with a da\u2018if hadith that speaks of the virtue of a deed, because if it turns out to be sahih, then the one who accepted it will have acted as is required, and if it does not turn out to be sahih, there will be no negative consequences for having acted upon it, such as making something haram halal and vice versa, and there will be no transgression against the rights of others.\"(Al-Fath al-Mubin bi Sharh al-Arba\u2018in\u00a0 p. 109).\nThe claim that there is unanimous scholarly agreement on this issue is not accurate, as we have stated previously that the scholars differed in the conditions that they stipulated for acting in accordance with a da\u2018if hadith (question no. 44877 ).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When it comes to hadiths in which there is some weakness, it is either due to a narrator whose memory was poor, or a narrator who has committed some mischief, or other, similar reasons for which it was said that his hadith is da\u2018if. A da\u2018if hadith may be quoted by scholars in the context of encouraging people to do righteous deeds that are established and well-known in Islamic teachings, such as the da\u2018if hadiths that speak of giving charity, because charity is something that is well-known in Islamic teachings, there are verses of the Quran which highlight the importance of charity, and there are sahih hadiths which speak about it. So if there are some da\u2018if hadiths which speak about the virtue of charity, the scholars quote them. The same applies if there are da\u2018if hadiths which speak about the virtue of supererogatory (nafil) prayers, or about the virtue of tasbih (saying Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah)) and tahlil (saying La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah)), and of dhikr. All these matters are established and well-known in Islamic teachings, so the scholars may be lenient regarding da\u2018if hadiths that speak of them, because the original deeds of which the da\u2018if hadiths speak are rooted in the Quran and Sunnah, and because acts of worship that are mentioned in da\u2018if hadiths are already well known from the Quran and Sunnah.\"(shaykh\u2019s website).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the issue of repeating the dhikr mentioned in the question \u2013 \u201cSubhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra\u2018du bi hamdihi ...\u201d \u2013\nIt is clear from the action of Ka\u2018b and the approval of \u2018Umar and Ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them all) that he used to say it three times.\nAnd it is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that it is recommended to repeat supplications three times. When he offered supplication, he would say it three times, and when he asked of Allah, he would ask three times.\nBased on that, if this dhikr is repeated three times, that is good.\nIf he repeats it every time he hears thunder, what appears to be the case is that there is nothing wrong with that, as it is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would sometimes repeat a supplication more than three times. It was narrated that Jarir ibn \u2018Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) blessed the horses of (the tribe of) Ahmas and their men five times. Al-Bukhari (4099).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that he used to repeat supplications an odd number of times, and he sometimes repeated them more than three times. This is an exception to the general meaning of the words of Anas, \u201cWhen he offered supplication, he would repeat it three times.\u201d That is to be understood as referring to what he usually did, and when he said it more than three times, there must have been a reason which dictated that he should say it more than three times. This is clear in the case of the tribe of Ahmas, because of their efforts in standing up to disbelief and supporting Islam, especially with regard to their own people to whom they belonged.\"(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar\u00a0 8/73-74).\nSo if there is a reason for repeating it, such as if the reason for saying the dhikr is repeated, then there is nothing wrong with repeating it.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to display Adhkar\u00a0for the purpose of remembrance, but they should be placed in a suitable location, to preserve their dignity and prevent disrespect. For example, the Dhikr for entering the washroom should not be placed on the bathroom door, but rather on the side of the door from the outside, to the right or left of the person entering.\nSheikh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him)\u00a0was asked:\n\"Is it correct to place verses or reminders Adhkar\u00a0from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) on the walls in rooms for the purpose of remembering Allah the Almighty and for contemplation? Please guide us, may Allah reward you with good.\"\nHe replied: \"The correct view is that there is no harm; if it is for the purpose of remembrance, placing verses on the wall, or hadiths for remembrance, there is nothing wrong with that, if it is for the purpose of remembrance and benefit, like hadiths about greeting (salam), supplication (du`a), hadiths about forbidding what Allah has forbidden, or encouraging obedience to Allah, or verses; there is no harm in that in a gathering or in an office,\" End quote from the website of Shaykh Ibn Baz.\nAnd Sheikh Ibn `Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him)\u00a0says: \"As for - writing hadiths - in the house: there is nothing wrong with writing a hadith that has a benefit, like the expiation of the gathering: (Subhanaka Allahumma Rabbana wa bihamdika, ash-hadu an la ilaha illa ant, astaghfiruka wa atubu ilayk) this contains a reminder,\" Eng quote from \"Liqa' Al-Bab Al-Maftuh\" (197 / 13).\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on giving gifts or charity to the servant",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with giving a gift to the servant, of giving her charity if she needs it.\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to give charity to the servant from zakah, noting that we give her a regular salary too?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with a person giving his zakah to his servant, whether the servant is a man or a woman, if he or she has a family in his home country who are in need, and the salary that he receives is not sufficient for them. But if the salary is sufficient, meaning that it is sufficient for the family, then it is not permissible to give them zakah, because Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect [zakah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allah . And Allah is Knowing and Wise} [at-Tawbah 9:60]. And because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Mu\u2018adh ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen: \u201cTeach them that Allah has enjoined upon them charity from their wealth, to be taken from their rich ones and given to their poor ones.\u201d End quote.\nFatawa Nur \u2018ala ad-Darb.\nIf this is permissible in the case of zakah on one\u2019s wealth, then it is more appropriate that it should be permissible in the case of voluntary charity.\nBut we should point out that it is not permissible for the one who is giving zakah to benefit from giving it to his servant, such as if he gives it to her instead of increasing her salary or instead of giving her some bonus that he had promised her, or to ask her to do more than was agreed upon, and the like.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 67926 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "What is the ruling on likening someone to the Companions?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The status of the Companions\nIt is a well-established fact that the Companions enjoy a great and lofty status , for Allah praised them and described them as having good qualities and sublime characteristics, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and those who followed them with good conduct - Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment}\u00a0[at-Tawbah 9:100]\n{So those who emigrated or were evicted from their homes or were harmed in My cause or fought or were killed - I will surely remove from them their misdeeds, and I will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow as reward from Allah , and Allah has with Him the best reward}\u00a0[Al \u2018Imran 3:195]\n{For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from Allah and [His] approval and supporting Allah and His Messenger, [there is also a share]. Those are the truthful\nAnd [also for] those who were settled in al-Madinah and [adopted] the faith before them. They love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what the emigrants were given but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful}\u00a0[al-Hashr 59:8-9]\n{Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that Allah may enrage by them the disbelievers. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward}\u00a0[al-Fath 48:29].\nIbn Mas\u2018ud said: Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, looked into the hearts of His slaves and chose Muhammad, then He sent him with His message, for He chose him on the basis of His knowledge. Then He looked into the hearts of people after him, and chose for him his companions, who He made the supporters of His religion and the helpers of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nNarrated by at-Tayalisi in his Musnad (1/199) and by Ahmad in his Musnad (3600).\nFor more information, please see question no. 159184 .\nRuling on emulating the Companions\nEmulating the Companions is a great good deed and an immense blessing. Ibn Mas\u2018ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whoever among you wants to take someone as an example, let him take the Companions of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as an example, for they were the purest in heart of this ummah, the deepest in knowledge, the most down to earth, the most guided and the best in attitude. They were people whom Allah, may He be exalted, chose to accompany His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so acknowledge their virtue and follow in their footsteps, for they followed right guidance.\"(Jami\u2018 Bayan al-\u2018Ilm\u00a0 2/947).\nAl-Hasan said: The companions of Muhammad were the purest in heart of this ummah, the deepest in knowledge, and the most down to earth. They were people whom Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose to accompany His Prophet and establish His religion. So imitate their attitude and conduct, for \u2013 by the Lord of the Ka\u2018bah \u2013 they followed right guidance.\"(Ash-Shari\u2018ah by al-Ajurri\u00a0 4/1685).\nLikening someone to the Companions\nThere is nothing wrong with likening someone to one of the Companions in any of his characteristics, actions of physical appearance. There does not seem to be any reason to disallow that, because he will resemble him in some ways and not others. So if you liken someone [to one of the Companions] by saying that he is courageous like Khalid, or knowledgeable like Mu\u2018adh, or strong like So-and-so among the Companions, or he has a beautiful voice like Abu Musa, that is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it.\nIn fact, if someone is likened to one who is greater and nobler, namely the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), there is nothing wrong with that, if what is meant is likening him to one of the characteristics, actions or manners of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that is not something that is a unique characteristic of Prophethood.\nMany of the Companions made comparisons of this nature.\nIt was narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: No one resembled the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) more than al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali. Narrated by al-Bukhari (3752).\nAnd he said regarding al-Husayn ibn \u2018Ali: He was the one who most resembled the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Narrated by al-Bukhari (3748).\nIbn al-Jawzi said: Among the Tabi\u2018in there was a man called Kabis ibn Rabi\u2018ah as-Sami, who resembled [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)]. Mu\u2018awiyah sent for him, then he kissed him on the forehead and allocated some land to him. When Anas ibn Malik saw him, he would weep. End quote from Kashf al-Mushkil min Hadith as-Sahihayn (1/42).\nSimilarly, they might also liken people to him in terms of conduct and attitude.\nHudhayfah ibn al-Yaman said: The one who most closely resembled the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in dignity, physical appearance and conduct was Ibn Umm \u2018Abd. Narrated by al-Bukhari (6079); he was \u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018ud (may Allah be pleased with him).\nIt was narrated that \u2018A\u2019ishah the Mother of the Believers said: I never saw anyone who more closely resembled the Messenger of Allah in bearing, dignity and conduct, and the way in which she stood and sat, than Fatimah the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (lettings and peace of Allah be upon him). Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3762), who said: This is a hasan sahih hadith. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nThe words translated above as dignity, bearing and conduct are close in meaning; they refer to outward appearance, conduct, being at ease with oneself, and so on. See: \u2018Awn al-Ma\u2018bud (14/87).\nIt is as if she was referring to what could be seen of a person\u2019s humbleness and humility towards Allah, and what he may possess of dignity, calm, a good attitude and gentle speech.\"(Mirqat al-Mafatih Sharh Mishkat al-Masabih\u00a0 7/2969).\nSee also the answer to question no. 179497 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Supplication after reciting Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt was narrated by an-Nasaa\u2019i in as-Sunan al-Kubra (11067) and in \u2018Amal al-Yawm wa\u2019l-Laylah (308), and by at-Taaraani in ad-Du\u2018aa\u2019 (1912) that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never sat in any gathering, or recited Quran, or offered any prayer, but he concluded that with certain words. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I see that you never sit in a gathering, or recite Quran, or offer any prayer, but you conclude it with these words. He said: \u201cYes. Whoever spoke good words, that will be like a seal on what he did of good and whoever spoke ill, it will be an expiation for him: \u201cSubhaanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika, laa ilaaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk (Glory and praise be to you, O Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You).\u201d\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (3164).\nIn this hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained that the dhikr of expiation for a gathering should be said at the end of any gathering in which a man sits, whether it was a gathering of dhikr or a gathering in which there was some ill or idle talk, for if it was a gathering of dhikr, it will be a seal on it for him.\nAs-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant is that it will be an affirmation of what he did of good, and will raise his deed to such a level that Allah will accept it, and it will like a guarantee that it will not be rejected, and if it was otherwise, then it will be an expiation for him. See: Mir\u2018aat al-Mafaateeh (8/204).\nBased on that, it is mustahabb for the Muslim to end any gathering with these words, no matter what kind of gathering it was. If it was a gathering to read Quran or to offer a prayer, or he sat with his friends, or with his family members, or to reconcile between people, or any other gathering, then he wants to leave, he should recite this dhikr just before he gets up to leave, then he should get up.\nSecondly:\nThere is no proven supplication specifically for completing the Quran, neither this supplication nor any other. From what has been explained above, it is clear that this dhikr and du\u2018aa\u2019 is not specifically for completing the Quran or anything else; rather it is general and may be recited in any gathering.\nHowever, the scholars have stated that it is mustahabb to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. An-Nawawi said: It is strongly encouraged (mustahabb)\u00a0 to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. At-Tibyaan fi Aadaab Hamlat al-Quran (159).\nIbn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (2/126): It is mustahabb to gather one\u2019s family and others when completing the Quran to listen to the supplication.\nAhmad said: When Anas completed the Quran, he would gather his family and his children.\nThat was narrated from Ibn Mas\u2018ood and others.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 65581 and 37683 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "How can we reconcile between the idea of competing in doing good and loving good for others?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nPart of the practice of the Muslim that Allah, may He be exalted, and His Messenger taught him is the importance of brotherhood among the believers, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThe believers are but brothers\u201d [al-Hujuraat 49:10].\nThere is no contradiction between the verse (interpretation of the meaning) \u201cSo for this let the competitors compete\u201d [al-Mutaffifeen 83:26] and what is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: \u201cNo one of you truly believes until he loves for his brother \u2013 or for his neighbour \u2013 what he loves for himself.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (13) and Muslim (45).\nThe scholars have several views with regard to dispelling this apparent contradiction:\n1-\u00a0That the hadith has to do with matters of this world and the verse has to do with matters of the hereafter. See: Saheeh Muslim bi Sharh al-Abi wa\u2019s-Sanoosi (1/244).\n2-\u00a0It was said that what is meant by that is loving good in general terms, but not in a specific or detailed way such as a person may seek for himself. Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If it is said: How can this be imagined when everyone wants to be ahead of others with regard to what he chooses for himself, and he loves to surpass others in virtues, and \u2018Umar competed with Abu Bakr? The answer is: that what is meant is to wish for good for them in general terms and wish that evil be warded off from them in general terms. The individual should love that for his brother as he loves it for himself. As for excelling in some specific virtue and attaining a high level of some specific characteristic, there is nothing wrong with the individual wanting to surpass others in that regard.\nEnd quote from Kashf al-Mushkil min Hadith as-Saheehayn (3/222). See also: al-Qabas Sharh al-Muwatta\u2019 by Ibn al-\u2018Arabi (929) and al-Masaalik Sharh al-Muwatta\u2019 (6/406-417).\n3-\u00a0This is a command to compete in doing more acts of worship, which will prompt others to join him and compete in doing good and righteous deeds. However, the hadith is general in meaning and includes matters of both this world and the hereafter. Hence the believer does not dislike others to join him in that; rather he loves for all people to join him in that competition and urges them to do so. This is a sign that he is very sincere towards people of faith.\nIbn Rajab said in Jaami\u2018 al-\u2018Uloom wa\u2019l-Hikam (1/327-335):\nThe point is that this is one of the characteristics of faith that one is obliged to have: the individual should love for his believing brother what he loves for himself, and hate for him what he hates for himself. If he fails to attain that, then his faith is undermined.\nAll of this can only be achieved if one\u2019s heart is sound and free of rancour, insincerity and envy, for envy makes the envier hate to see anyone excel him in any good characteristic, or even equal him in it, because he wants to stand out among the people in his virtues, and be distinct from them. But faith requires the opposite of that, which is that all believers should share in what Allah has granted him of good, without that detracting from what he has.\nIn general, the believer should love for the believers what he loves for himself, and hate for them what he hates for himself. If he sees any shortcoming in his brother in terms of religious commitment, he should strive to advise him.\nNevertheless, the believer should feel sad if he misses out on any religious virtue. Therefore he is instructed, with regard to issues of religious commitment, to look at those who are above him and to strive to compete in increasing in that as much as he can, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0 \u201cSo for this let the competitors compete\u201d [al-Mutaffifeen 83:26]. He should not resent it if anyone shares his virtues with him; rather he should like all people to compete in that, and should urge them to do so. This is a sign that he has attained perfect sincerity towards his brothers.\nAl-Fudayl said: If you love for people to be like you, then you are not being sincere towards your brother. So how about if you want them to be inferior to you in that regard?\nThis indicates that being sincere towards all believers means that you like them to be better than you. This is a high level and lofty degree of sincerity, but that is not obligatory. Rather what is enjoined in Islamic teachings is that you should love for them to be like you, yet if someone surpasses you in some religious virtue, you should strive to catch up with him and feel sad for falling short or falling behind those who have surpassed you \u2013 not out of envy for what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has given them by His grace , but because you are competing with them, and because you wish to attain what they have attained, without any ill-feeling towards them, and because you feel sad because of your falling behind and failing to attain the same level as those who have surpassed you.\nThe believer should always think of himself as falling short and not attaining high ranks. He will benefit from that in two important ways: striving to attain those virtues and increase in that, and regarding himself with dissatisfaction. That will result in him loving for the believers to be better than him, because he does not want them to be just like him. He will also be discontent with himself as he is, and will strive to better himself. Muhammad ibn Waasi\u2018 said to his son: As for your father, may Allah not increase his ilk among the Muslims.\nIf someone is not content with himself as he is, how can he wish for the Muslims to be like him, if he is sincere towards them? Rather he should love for the Muslims to be better than him, and he should love for himself to be better than he is.\nEnd quote.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The greatest goal a believer can pursue is seeking the pleasure of the Lord of the Worlds.\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAllah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence; but approval from Allah is greater. It is that which is the great attainment\u201d [at-Tawbah 9:72].\nIt was narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (6549) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (2829) that Abu Sa\u2018eed al-Khudri said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAllah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to the people of Paradise: \u2018O people of Paradise!\u2019 They will say: \u2018Here we are at Your service, our Lord.\u2019 He will say: \u2018Are you pleased?\u2019 They will say: \u2018How could we not be pleased, O Lord, when You have given us that which You have not given to anyone else among Your creation?\u2019 He will say: \u2018Shall I not give you something even better than that?\u2019 They will say: \u2018O Lord, what can be better than that?\u2019 He will say: \u2018I bestow My pleasure upon you and I will never be angry with you after that.\u2019\u201d\nThe main goal of the believer\u2019s life is that he seeks the pleasure of Allah alone, with no partner or associate, even if that displeases people. The sign of the hypocrites is that they are keen to please people, even if that angers the Lord of the Worlds.\nAllah says regarding the hypocrites (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThey swear by Allah to you [Muslims] to satisfy you. But Allah and His Messenger are more worthy for them to satisfy, if they should be believers\u201d [at-Tawbah 9:62].\nThings that will help a person to seek the pleasure of Allah alone include the following:\nFirstly: Learning about his Lord, so that he will be certain that all things are in His hand, and He alone is the One Who controls all things; He alone is the One Who brings low and raises high; He alone is the One Who grants honour and humiliates; no one can withhold what He gives and no one can give what He withholds; all people have no power to benefit or harm him or themselves, or to cause death, give life or anything else.\nOnce a person believes in that with certainty, his heart will be attached to his Lord, because he believes that people cannot benefit him except by his Lord\u2019s leave, and they cannot harm him except by his Lord\u2019s leave alone.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Know that if the nation were to come together to benefit you with something, they would not benefit you except with something that Allah has already decreed for you, and if they were to come together to harm you with something, they would not harm you except with something that Allah has already decreed for you.\u201d\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi in his Sunan (2516); classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (5/497).\nSecondly: being certain that people\u2019s loving him and being pleased with him only happens with the permission of his Lord, so if he pleases his Lord, He will instill love for him in the hearts of His believing slaves.\nAt-Tirmidhi narrated in his Sunan (3267) that al-Bara\u2019 ibn \u2018Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah, if I praise someone then he is praiseworthy, and if I criticize someone then he is blameworthy. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThat is only for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\u201d\nThis hadith was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi (2605).\nAllah alone is the One Who, if He praises someone, then he is praiseworthy, and if He is angry with someone and criticizes him, then he is blameworthy. As for people, they have no power in that regard except by Allah\u2019s leave.\nIn the hadith it says that it is Allah Who instills love or hate of someone in people\u2019s hearts.\nIt was narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (3209) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (2637) that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhen Allah loves a person, He calls Jibreel and says: \u2018I love So and so, so love him.\u2019 So Jibreel loves him, then he calls out to the people of heaven, \u2018Allah loves So and so, so love him.\u2019 So the people of heaven love him and he finds acceptance on earth. If Allah hates\u00a0 someone, He calls Jibreel and says: \u2018I hate So and so, so hate him.\u2019 So Jibreel hates him, then he calls out to the people of heaven: \u2018Allah hates So and so, so hate him.\u2019 So they hate him and he is hated on earth.\u201d\nThirdly: being certain that focusing on pleasing people and not the Lord of the Worlds is a sign of failure, and the one who does that will end up blameworthy, with no one to praise him; Allah will abandon him and he will have no one to support him. But if he seeks to please Allah alone, Allah will suffice him and he will have no need of people.\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cDo not make [as equal] with Allah another deity and [thereby] become censured and forsaken\u201d [al-Isra\u2019 17:22].\nIbn Hibbaan narrated in his Saheeh (277) from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever pleases Allah by angering the people, Allah will suffice him, but whoever angers Allah by pleasing the people, Allah will leave him to the people.\u201d Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (2311).\nLook at Ka\u2018b ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) and how his focus was on speaking the truth and pleasing Allah alone, because he believed that Allah would suffice him if he spoke the truth, and that if his main concern was to avoid angering the people by telling lies, then Allah would soon cause people to be angry with him.\nKa\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him) said, in the story of his repentance, that he said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Indeed, by Allah, if I sat before anyone in this world other than you, I would have saved myself from his anger with an excuse, for I have been given the ability to argue persuasively, but by Allah, I know that if I were to tell you a lie today that you accepted, soon Allah would make you angry with me, but if I tell you the truth today that may make you upset with me, then I hope that Allah will pardon me. No, by Allah, I had no excuse. By Allah, I was never stronger or more well off than when I stayed behind and did not accompany you [on the campaign to Tabook]. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAs for this one, he has spoken the truth. Get up and leave until Allah decides concerning you.\u201d\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (4418) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (2769).\nFourthly: knowing that there is no way to please people, for man is basically unfair and ignorant, and pleasing people is a target that cannot be achieved, for people are not even pleased with their Lord, so how can you think that they will be pleased with you?!\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated in az-Zuhd al-Kabeer (180) with a saheeh isnaad from al-Hasan al-Basri that it was said to him: People come to your gathering to pick on any error you may make, so that they can make it a reason to gossip about you. He said: Do not worry about it, for I thought of the pleasure of being close to Allah and I hope for that; I thought of Paradise and I hope for that; I thought of al-hoor al-\u2018een and I hope for that; I thought of being safe from people, and I found no way to achieve that. When I saw that people are not pleased with their Creator, I realized that they will never be pleased with a created being like themselves.\nAsh-Shaafi\u2018i (may Allah have mercy on him) said to Yoonus ibn \u2018Abd al-A\u2018la: O Abu Moosa, if you were to strive your utmost to please all the people, there is no way to do that. As that is the case, then make your deeds and your intention sincerely for Allah (may He be glorified and exalted) alone.\nNarrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu\u2018ab al-Eemaan (6518).\nSo let each person\u2019s main concern be to seek the pleasure of his Lord alone, for if He is pleased, that is sufficient for you.\nLet your slogan in life and your main concern before the Lord of the worlds be as the poet said:\nI hope that my relationship with You is sweeter and life is bitter; I hope that You are pleased and that people are angry.\nI hope that what is between You and me is in order, and that what is between me and people is in ruins.\nIf You love me then everything else is insignificant, and everyone on earth is as dust.\nWith regard to books, we do not know of any book that has been written specifically about this topic, but we advise the questioner and all Muslims to learn more about Allah, for the more a person comes to know about his Lord, the more his concern will be on seeking the pleasure of his Lord alone, and he will not worry about the displeasure of people.\nOne excellent book on this topic is an-Nahj al-Asma fi Sharh Asma\u2019 Allah al-Husna, by Dr. Muhammad al-Humood an-Najdi.\nWe also advise you to read widely in the books of Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali and Ibn al-Qayyim, for their words on this topic are among the most beneficial.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Between habit and worship",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nHabit is a neutral concept, so it is a good thing if a person gets used to doing good and to being steadfast when doing it, without finding it burdensome. It was narrated in the hadith: \u201cDoing good is a habit [that one may acquire easily] and evil is stubbornness [and man persists in it only out of stubbornness].\u201d Narrated by Ibn Maajah (221) and by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh (310).\nIt was narrated from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah that she said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had a reed mat with which he used to make a booth at night and pray in it, and the people started to follow his prayer, and he used to spread (that mat) out during the day. One night they gathered and he said: \u201cO people, you should only do deeds that you are able for, for Allah does not grow weary but you do. The most beloved of deeds to Allah is that which is done persistently, even if it is little.\u201d And if the family of Muhammad started to do something, they would persist in it. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5861) and Muslim (782).\nAs Abu\u2019t-Tayyib said: Each person will gain of his life that which becomes a habit for him.\nIt is well-known that one of the greatest means of a person becoming steadfast in his journey towards Allah is having acts of worship to which he commits himself, remains steadfast in doing them, and becomes accustomed to doing them, and he does not neglect them, become heedless concerning them or feel too lazy to do them. This was always the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); in other words, he would do them constantly and persistently. And if his family did something, they would persist in it.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to habit in the sense that a person does not have presence of mind when doing an act of worship, so he does it automatically, with no spirit or focus, that is something very dangerous, and he should be concerned about that.\nThe reward for worship is connected to presence of mind and humility whilst doing it, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cCertainly will the believers have succeeded:\nThey who are during their prayer humbly submissive\u201d\n[al-Mu\u2019minoon 23:1-2].\nIt is very important that the heart should be focused when doing an act of worship, and not be distracted from it.\nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nI have read some advice in a book which says: do not make worship a habit. How can a Muslim make worship of Allah truly for Allah, and not a mere habit? May Allah reward you with good.\nHe replied:\nWhat is meant is: do not do the prayer as a habit; pray as an act of worship so that you may draw closer to Allah thereby, and not because it is a habit that you have got used to. If you pray Duha, then pray it for the purpose of drawing closer to Allah, not because it is a habit. By the same token, if you pray tahajjud at night, pray it because it is an act of worship and obedience, not because it is merely a habit or because your father or mother used to do it.\nThirdly:\nAmong the things that may help one to attain focus of mind when doing acts of worship are the following:\n1. Variation in acts of worship. The individual should do a variety of acts of worship, including prayer, reading Qur\u2019an, dhikr, giving charity, honouring his parents, upholding ties of kinship, visiting the sick and attending funerals. By the mercy and grace of Allah, acts of worship are many and varied.\n2. Persistence in keeping the intention in mind when doing the acts of worship.\nIbn al-Qayyim said in \u2018Umdat as-Saabireen (60-65):\n\u2026 Being persistent whilst doing the good deed, so the person should persist in warding off any shortcomings or negligence in the action. He should persist in keeping his intention in mind and continue to be focused when standing before his Lord, and not be absent-minded when carrying out His command. What matters is not only doing what is enjoined; rather what matters above all is not forgetting the One Who enjoined it when doing what He enjoined. Rather he should persist in remembering Him whilst carrying out His command.\nThis is the worship of the true and sincere slaves of Allah. It requires patience and perseverance in order to be able to do acts of worship in the proper manner, by performing the act with all of its essential, obligatory and Sunnah parts. It also requires persevering in remembering the One Whom he is worshipping when doing that act of worship, and not letting himself be distracted from that by his worship. So his presence of mind with Allah should not distract him from carrying out the physical actions of the act of worship properly, and focusing on doing the physical actions in the proper manner should not distract him from presence of mind when standing before Allah, may He be glorified. End quote.\n3. Striving hard in du\u2018aa\u2019 (supplication).\nThis is one of the greatest means that help one to keep in mind the fact that Allah is with him and is helping His slave.\n4. Not giving up acts of worship.\nThat is one of the means by which the Shaytaan discourages a person from doing acts of worship, on the grounds that he is not able to focus. So let the believer be aware of that, and let him continue to do the acts of worship.\n5. Preparing oneself for a particular act of worship and getting ready for it, and keeping away from anything that may distract him from it.\nIt was narrated from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cDo not pray when food has been served and do not pray when resisting the urge to relieved oneself.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood (89).\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "He is heedless about sins, on the grounds that the Sahaabah also committed sins",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Such talk stems from the deceit of the Shaytaan, by means of which he makes sins seem insignificant to people, so that they will get carried away in sin and not repent from it.\nThis notion is false on several counts:\n-1-\u00a0The perfect example for the Muslim is the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThere has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often\u201d\u00a0[al-Ahzaab 33:21].\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis verse is an important principle, which is following the example of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his words, deeds and character. Hence Allah commanded the people to follow the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the day of al-Ahzaab, in terms of his patience, steadfastness, perseverance, striving in jihad and awaiting help and support from his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and may Allah send blessings and peace upon him constantly until the Day of Judgement.\nEnd quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer (6/391).\nBy the same token, we must adhere to what he brought of commands and prohibitions.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from. And fear Allah ; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty\u201d\u00a0[al-Hashr 59:7].\nWhoever goes against his prohibitions has failed to achieve the level of piety (taqwa) that is required of him, and he has exposed himself to the punishment of Allah, may He be exalted.\n-2-\u00a0The Muslim is enjoined to follow the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) in their good deeds, and not otherwise.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and those who followed them with good conduct - Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment\u201d\u00a0[at-Tawbah 9:100].\nMuhammad ibn Ka\u2018b al-Qurazi said:\n\u201cand those who followed them with good conduct\u201d \u2013 this is an condition that is required of those who follow them, which is that they should follow them in their good deeds and not their bad deeds. End quote.\nSee: ad-Durr al-Manthoor (4/272) and Tafseer al-Baghawi (4/88).\nSo the Muslim should strive to follow the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) in their good deeds, so that he may be included among the people mentioned in the verse quoted above. As for any errors that they (may Allah be pleased with them) made, we are not enjoined to follow them in that.\nAmong the good deeds of theirs in which the Muslim should follow their example is the fact that if they made any mistakes, they would hasten to repent, and their repentance was so great and sincere that Allah erased their sins thereby. The hadiths that speak of that are very well known, such as the repentance of Maa\u2018iz and of the Ghaamidi woman (may Allah be pleased with them).\nSo the Muslim should strive to obey Allah, may He be exalted, and to keep away from disobeying Him. Then if he slips up, he must hasten to repent sincerely and not try to excuse himself by referring to the mistakes made by some of the Sahaabah, because they would repent and they would not persist in sin.\n-3-\u00a0Even though some of the Sahaabah committed some major sins, that did not happen very often; in fact it was rare. In most cases, they (may Allah be pleased with them) adhered to the command of Allah and strove hard to attain His pleasure. So why would this person referred to in the question ignore what was usually the case with the actions of the Sahaabah, and try to use that which rarely happened as an excuse?\nMoreover, if he is sincere, then let him do what they did: they used to hasten to repent, and they did not persist in sin, as noted above.\nThen let him follow the example of the one who surrendered her life for the sake of Allah, and [admitted the sin of adultery] so that the hadd punishment would be carried out on her.\nThen let him follow their example with regard to worship, attitude, effort, striving, acts of charity, fasting and voluntary prayers at night.\nIn his attitude and actions, let this poor man strive to emulate the attitude and actions of the Sahaabah.\nThen let him see, in that case, whether the Shaytaan will try to entice him with such notions!\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Holding fast to Allah and His religion",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The \u2018holding fast\u201d that is mentioned in the Qur\u2019an is of two types: holding fast to Allah, and holding fast to the rope of Allah.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:103]\n\u201cand hold fast to Allah. He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper\u201d\n[al-Hajj 22:78].\nImam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nI\u2018tisaam (holding fast) means adhering to that which will protect you and will ward off from you that which you dread and fear. \u2018Ismah means protection and i\u2018tisaam means seeking protection. Hence fortresses are called \u2018awaasim (sing. \u2018aasimah) because they give protection and safety.\nWell-being and happiness in this world and the hereafter are based on holding fast to Allah and holding fast to His rope. There is no salvation except for the one who adheres to these two means of protection.\nWith regard to holding fast to His rope, it protects one from going astray.\nHolding fast to Him protects one from doom and destruction, for the one who is journeying towards Allah is like one who is travelling on a path towards his intended destination. Hence he needs guidance on the road and he needs to be safe whilst travelling; he cannot reach his intended destination except after attaining these two things.\nThe guide will protect him from losing his way, and will guide him to the right path; and equipment, physical strength and weapons will help him to be safe from bandits and any other troubles he may encounter on the road.\nSo holding fast to the rope of Allah will lead him on the path of guidance and help him to follow the guide.\nHolding fast to Allah will give him the strength, equipment, weapons and anything else that he will need [to protect himself] on his journey.\nHence the salaf [early generations] used a variety of phrases to explain what is meant by holding fast to the rope of Allah, even though these phrases all refer to the same idea.\nIbn \u2018Abbaas said: Adhere to the religion of Allah.\nIbn Mas\u2018ood said: It is the jamaa\u2018ah (main body of the Muslims). And he said: You should adhere to the jamaa\u2018ah, for it is the rope of Allah that He has enjoined us to hold fast to. What you may find of things you dislike when you are with the jamaa\u2018ah is better than what you may find of things you like when you are scattered.\nMujaahid and \u2018Ataa\u2019 said: It means adhering to the covenant of Allah. Qataadah, as-Saddi and many of the scholars of tafseer said: It means adhering to the Qur\u2019an.\nThen he said: As for holding fast to Him, it means putting one\u2019s trust in Him, seeking strength with Him, seeking protection with Him, and asking Him to protect the individual, give him strength and ward off harm from him. For the result of holding fast to Him is that He will ward off harm from His slave, for Allah defends those who believe. So He will ward off from his believing slave, if he holds fast to Him, any cause that could lead to problems, and He will protect him from that. So He will protect him from doubts and desires, and from the schemes of his enemies both apparent and hidden, and from the evil of his own self. He will ward off from him the consequences of that which may lead to problems and troubles after the causes thereof are all present, commensurate with the strength with which he holds fast to Him, so that the causes of troubles and problems will be removed in his case, and thus Allah will protect him from what could result from that and the causes thereof. He may ward off from him something that He had decreed by means of another decree, and something that He willed by means of something else that He wills, thus protecting him from it.

        "question": "How can we make ourselves feel when reading Qur\u2019an that Allah is addressing us thereby?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Making yourself feel that Allah is addressing you in the Qur\u2019an is attained by listening attentively to the Qur\u2019an, reflecting properly upon it, and acting in accordance with it, as the Muslim believes that Allah is addressing His slaves in the Qur\u2019an, issuing commands and prohibitions to them; sometimes He addresses a particular group in some contexts, and sometimes He addresses humanity as a whole.\nWhen He addresses the believers, then the Muslim should reflect on that and say: We hear and we obey. Ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When you hear Allah saying \u201cO you who believe\u201d, then pay attention, for it is something good that He is enjoining or something bad that He is forbidding.\nTafseer Ibn Katheer (1/374).\nWhen Allah addresses humanity as a whole, then you should think that Allah is addressing you in particular, so if it is a command then do it, and if it is a prohibition then refrain from it, and if it is an exhortation then act upon it.\nThe individual should reflect upon what Allah says throughout the entire Qur\u2019an, but that reflection varies according to the context of what is being recited of the text. If obedience is mentioned, then he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to obey. If disobedience is mentioned, then he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the prohibition on disobedience. If people of faith (believers) are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to take them as friends and allies and love them. If the people of disbelief and hypocrisy are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to hate them and regard them as enemies.\nIf the Shaytaan is mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to regard him as an enemy, go against him and not to follow him, and to strive to obey Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cDid I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy \u2013\nAnd that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path\u201d\n[Yaa-Seen 36:60-61].\nIf truthfulness and those who speak the truth are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to strive to be one of them.\nIf allies and liars are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to strive to not be one of them.\nImam Abu Bakr al-Aajurri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u2026 Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, urges people to reflect upon the Qur\u2019an, as He, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThen do they not reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon [their] hearts?\u201d\n[Muhammad 47:24].\nAnd Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThen do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it had been from [any] other than Allah , they would have found within it much contradiction\u201d\n[an-Nisaa\u2019 4:82].\nMuhammad ibn al-Husayn [al-Aajurri] said: Do you not see, may Allah have mercy on you, how your most generous Lord urges His creation to reflect upon His words? Whoever reflects upon His words will come to know the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and will come to know the greatness of His might and power, and will come to know the greatness of His grace and bounty towards the believers, and will come to know his duty to worship Him, so he will commit himself to do what is obligatory, and will beware of whatever his most generous Lord has warned him against, and will be eager to do what He has urged him to do.\nWhoever has this attitude when reciting Qur\u2019an, and when listening to someone else reciting it, the Qur\u2019an will be healing for him, and he will become independent of means even if he does not have wealth; he will feel honoured and proud even if he does not have a large family around him; and he will feel at ease in situations where others feel worried. His main concern, when starting to read or recite a soorah, will be \u201cwhen will recitation of Qur\u2019an have an impact on me?\u201d, not \u201cwhen will I finish the soorah?\u201d Rather his concern will be: when will I understand and pay heed to what Allah is saying to me? When will I rectify myself, when will I learn the lesson? Because recitation of Qur\u2019an is an act of worship, and an act of worship cannot be done properly when there is heedlessness and a lack of attention. May Allah help and guide us all.\nEnd quote from Akhlaaq Hamalat al-Qur\u2019an (3)\nThis is how the attitude of the one who recites Qur\u2019an should be.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on recording university lectures without the permission of the lecturer",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim who pays attention to matters of trust and hates betrayal to record the words of a speaker without his permission or without his knowledge, no matter what the type of speech, whether it is religious or worldly, such as fatwas, scientific discussions, financial matters, and so on.\nIt is proven in the hadith of Jaabir ibn \u2018Abdillah al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf one man speaks to another and looks around (to make sure no one is listening), then that is a trust (amaanah).\u201d Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood and at-Tirmidhi.\nWhat is meant by his looking around is that it is clear from the actions of the speaker that he is being cautious, by looking around, right and left, to make sure that no one can hear what he is saying. Thus what your companion says to you is a trust for the listener, that he has entrusted him with. If he tells someone else about it, then he has gone against the command of Allah, as he has disclosed the trust to people who are not entitled to receive it, and thus he becomes a wrongdoer. What he should do is conceal it, because when the person who told it to him looked around, that was like a gesture telling him not to tell anyone else. They said: This is a very concise expression, yet full of meaning, because the word translated here as looked around is very concise, and is encouraging us to observe good etiquette when mixing with people, to treat people well, to conceal secrets and maintain friendships, and it is a warning against spreading malicious gossip that could lead to resentment, as is quite clear.\nAr-Raaghib said: Confidential talk is that which is meant to be kept private, which may be understood directly, such as if you say to someone else: Keep what I tell you to yourself; or it may be indirect or circumstantial, such as if the speaker takes the opportunity of being alone with you, or he lowers his voice, or tries to conceal it from others in the gathering. This is what is meant in this hadith. End quote.\nIf you record his words without his permission or his knowledge, then this is a kind of treachery and a breach of trust.\nIf you then spread these words to other people, this exacerbates the treachery and violation of the trust.\nConclusion: Recording someone\u2019s words \u2013 on a phone or otherwise \u2013 without the knowledge or permission of the speaker is evildoing and a betrayal, and undermines one\u2019s good character and dignity.\nEnd quote from Adab al-Haatif by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (may Allah have mercy on him), p. 28\nI put this question to our shaykh, \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Barraak (may Allah preserve him), and he replied:\nThey have no right to record without his consent or knowledge.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    In such cases, if a person dies \n    in such circumstances, it has nothing to do with being praiseworthy or \n    blameworthy in and of itself, and there is no Islamic ruling connected to \n    that. Islamic rulings only have to do with the deeds of those who are \n    accountable. If a person dies in a particular place, or at a particular \n    time, or in a particular posture, that is not part of his deeds and it is \n    not within his control, so there is no ruling that is connected to it.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the death of one \n    who is fasting, this is the matter concerning which there are reports which \n    point to its virtue, not because death in this situation was within his \n    control, but because he died whilst doing a righteous deed and his life \n    ended with that.

        "question": "Annulling engagement because of a dream",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to rulings and his understanding of life and circumstances, and his evaluation of the experiences he goes through, the Muslim bases all of that on the reasoning, wisdom and measures that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has enjoined us to pay attention to and follow. This is what Islam teaches us; it instructs us to examine, contemplate and weigh up reason and experience, then to make our decisions after that regarding people and actions.\u00a0\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThus Allah makes clear His Ayat (Laws) to you, in order that you may understand\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:242].\u00a0\nThere is nothing in our religion to suggest that we should rely on dreams and visions, either with regard to worldly matters or religious rulings. Knowledge that is obtained via dreams is subjective, is not reliable and there is no certainty about it. rather it is subject to doubt, and it is not possible that Islam would instruct people to refer for knowledge to sources that are imaginary and cannot meet the least academic standards.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Dreams are of three types: a good dream which is glad tidings from Allah, a dream from the Shaytaan which causes distress, and a dream that comes from what a man is thinking of to himself\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0Narrated by Muslim (2263).\u00a0\nthe Shaytaan plays a role in what people see in their dreams, just as a person's own self does, and it is difficult for one to be certain of the source of his dream at all times. So how can a Muslim feel comfortable with a dream that he has seen and base his decisions on it, when he knows that the Shaytaan may have played the greatest role in producing it?\u00a0\nThat also applies to the case of marriage. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has set out for us the characteristics on which we should base our decision of accepting or rejecting a suitor, as he said:\n\u201cIf there comes to you one with whose character and religious commitment you are pleased, then marry (your female relative under your guardianship) to him, for if you do not do so, there will be tribulation and great mischief on earth.\u201d They said: O Messenger of Allah, even if there are some reservations concerning him?? He said: \u201cIf there comes to you one with whose character and religious commitment you are pleased, then marry (your female relative under your guardianship) to him,\u201d three times\u00a0 Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1085); he said: It is hasan ghareeb. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\nSo he defined character and religious commitment as the standards on which people should base their decisions when rejecting or accepting a suitor. Hence the questioner should not pay attention to anything else or respond to whatever she sees in her dreams of things in which the Shaytaan may have played a part, seeking to divide spouses and cause division and conflict.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked the following question in Liqa' al-Baab al-Maftooh (no. 5/question no. 17):\nA man proposed marriage to a woman, and in a dream she saw him clean-shaven. Should she agree to marry him or not? In real life he appears to be good, and he does not shave his beard; he is religiously-committed, but Allah knows best about him.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\nIf a woman sees a man who has proposed to her as clean-shaven in a dream, when in reality he does not shave his beard, what she sees in her dream does not matter, and that should not prevent her from marrying him, so long as he is upright in his religious commitment and character. End quote.\nMoreover, we should point out that istikhaarah has nothing to do with seeing dreams \u2013 as many people think \u2013 because the purpose of istikhaarah is to ask Allah, may He be exalted, to make easier the better of two options, and turning to Him, may He be glorified, for guidance to the best of affairs. Istikhaarah is a du'aa' (supplication) and when Allah answers it, He makes easy the thing that the person has chosen, after thinking and reflecting. The du'aa' has nothing whatsoever to do with dreams.\nOur advice to the sister is to think again, and not try to ruin her marital ties just because of a dream. Rather she should let religion and reason govern the issue of her engagement, then take an appropriate stance after that.\nSee also the answer to question no. 25793 and 34726.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "She committed an immoral action with a young man, then he left her; should she wait for him to marry her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThis relationship that developed between the young man and the young woman, which usually starts with a look and infatuation, and often ends with immoral actions, is a haraam and sinful relationship which can only lead to evil, corruption and temptation. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)), and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him)\u201d\u00a0[al-Isra\u2019 17:32].\u00a0\nShaykh as-Sa\u2018di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe prohibition on coming near it is more eloquent than simply prohibiting this action, because that includes the prohibition on all the things that lead to it and promote it. The one who plays with fire will soon get burnt, especially with regard to this matter which many people have a strong desire for.\nEnd quote from Tafseer as-Sa\u2018di, p. 457\u00a0\nFor a young man to get to know a girl who is not his mahram, and for them to fall in love with one another, and what that leads to of meetings and conversations and strong emotions and so on\u00a0 \u2013 all of these are among the most easily accessible doorways to mischief and fitnah. Anyone who has ears to hear or eyes to see will know that for certain.\u00a0\nThe issue here is not a case of magic that was done by his sister, or anything else; rather the issue is that this relationship was built on a false foundation from the outset. The first step to putting things right, and the most essential obligatory duty for both of them in this case is to repent to Allah; both the young man and the young woman should repent from that illicit relationship, then they should turn over a new page with Allah. One of the conditions of repentance for the sinner is that he should regret the sin that has passed, give it up, and resolve not to go back to it again. All of these steps mean that each of them is required to cut off ties with the other, because this is an invalid relationship that was based on haraam.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThere is no room here for praying istikhaarah, because salaat al-istikhaarah is only prescribed concerning permissible matters that a person may be confused about and not know which is better for him. With regard to obligatory or mustahabb (encouraged) matters, there is no istikhaarah for them at all, because it is enjoined to do them according to Islam. By the same token, there is no istikhaarah for haraam and makrooh (disliked) matters either, because it is forbidden to do them according to Islam.\u00a0\nSee the answer to question no. 11981\u00a0\nOnce it is understood that there is no room for istikhaarah in this case, according to Islam, and that what is required from both parties is to repent sincerely to Allah and put an end to the bad relationship between them, any wise person will realise that holding onto far-fetched notions and relying on a human being who has gone away is foolish and is contrary to what is in one\u2019s best interests in both religious and worldly terms. Hence it is said: Whoever referred you to someone who is absent has not been fair to you. This young man turned away from marrying that girl, even though he lived close to her in the same city, so how can she wait for him after he has left her and gone far away?\u00a0\nIf both of them repent, and cut off ties between them, then after that he wants to marry her, there is nothing wrong with that, but that is on condition that you do not wait for him; rather you should erase that dark page from your life, and start a new page, in the hopes that Allah will accept your repentance, help you to carry on with your life, conceal your past mistake, and give you some one better than him.\u00a0\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 117567 and 148528\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

It seems to be the \n    case that he may take his place, because the reason for the prohibition is \n    the fear that the Shaytan may cause temptation between them. \n\n    End quote from Subul as-Salam, 1/608\u00a0\n\n    Based on this, there is nothing wrong with the man allowing a \n    non-mahram to enter his house, on condition that he is not alone with his \n    wife and that he is trustworthy.

        "question": "Family Disputes",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly severing the ties of kinship is a major sin. The many texts of the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) that enjoin upholding ties of kinship highlight the great importance of this matter in our religion. One of the greatest aims of sharee\u2018ah (Islamic law) is to bring people together and maintain the ties of brotherhood and kinship among them.\u00a0\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThose who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e. they are good to their relatives and do not sever the bond of kinship), fear their Lord, and dread the terrible reckoning (i.e. abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which Allah has forbidden and perform all kinds of good deeds which Allah has ordained).\u201d\n[ar-Ra\u2018d 13:21].\nAmong the reports of the Prophet\u2019s (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Sunnah which give a stern warning against severing the ties of kinship is the following:\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n\u201cAllah created the universe, and when He had finished, kinship (al-rahim) stood up and said, \u2018This is the standing up of one who seeks Your protection from being cut off.\u2019 Allah said, \u2018Yes, would it please you if I were to take care of those who take care of you and cut off those who cut you off?\u2019 It said, \u2018Of course.\u2019 Allah said, \u2018Then your prayer is granted.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\nThen the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cRecite, if you wish: \u2018Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship? Such are they whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight. Do they not then think deeply in the Quran, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?\u2019 [Muhammad 47:22-24].\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhari, 5987; Muslim, 2554\u00a0\nIf people were to ponder what causes the severing of family ties amongst them, they would find the cause is disputes about some materialistic issues which will not avail for anything before Allah on the Day of Resurrection; or it may be because of what the Shaytan stirs up amongst them, leading to enmity and resentment amongst them because of insignificant reasons that are not worth paying any attention to in the first place.\u00a0\nThis happens despite the fact that Islam enjoins upholding the ties of kinship even if there are considerable reasons for cutting ties, and it encourages the believers to overlook mistakes and to adopt a forgiving and tolerant attitude, not to seek out mistakes and nurture resentment, grudges and envy.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said: O Messenger of Allah, I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off. I treat them well, but they abuse me. I am patient and kind towards them, but they insult me. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf you are as you say, then it is as if you are putting hot ashes in their mouths. Allah will continue to support you as long as you continue to do that.\u201d\nNarrated by Muslim, 2558\u00a0\nAn-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim (16/115):\nIgnorance here refers to bad speech. What this hadith means is that it will be like feeding them hot ashes. This is a metaphor for the pain they will feel, like the pain of one who eats hot ashes. There will be no sin on this doer of good, rather they will be sinning greatly for cutting him off and causing him harm.\u00a0\nAnd it was said that what is meant is that by treating them kindly you will make them feel ashamed of themselves because of how kindly you treat them and how badly they have treated you. And Allah knows best. End quote.\u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n\u201cThe upholder of kinship ties is not the one who is kind to them if they are kind to him, rather the upholder of kinship ties is the one who, if his relatives cut him off, he upholds the ties of kinship with them.\u201d\nNarrated by al-Bukhari, 5991.\u00a0\nThis is the conduct and attitude enjoined by Islam. No one should hesitate to denounce the one who cuts off ties with his sister or his mother. It is not permissible for you to go along with your father in cutting off ties with his sister; rather you have to uphold ties with her and treat her kindly, and try to reconcile between her and your father, doing all that you can to achieve this.\u00a0\nPlease see also the answers to questions no.  4631,\u00a07571 and\u00a075411\nAnd Allah knows best."

So one should not return its greeting. The ruling is the same as that on a tape on which the greeting is recorded and can be heard. It is a transmission of sound and does not come under the ruling on greeting when it is broadcast live, in which\u00a0case returning the greeting is prescribed and is a communal obligation (fard kifayah).\nAl-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSometimes the greeting may be recorded and they put it on the tape and run it. If it is recorded then you are not obliged to return the greeting, because this is just a transmission of sound.\u00a0\nLiqa\u2019 al-Bab al-Maftooh, 28/229\u00a0\nSee the rest of the fatwa and details on this issue in the answer to question number  128737.\nBased on this, the parrot does not intend to give the greeting of salam, because it does not possess the power of reason, and when it speaks it is just repeating what it has been taught, without meaning what it says.\u00a0\nSome of the scholars have stated that it is not prescribed to prostrate if one hears a verse from a parrot or from a recorded tape.\u00a0\nOne of the conclusions of the book Bahjat al-Asma\u2018 fi Ahkam al-Sama\u2018 fi\u2019l-Fiqh al-Islami by Prof. \u2018Ali ibn Dhariyan ibn Faris al-Hasan al-\u2018Anzi (published by Dar al-Manar in Kuwait) is:\u00a0\nThe listener need not do the prostration of recitation if he hears it from a source that is not human, such as a trained bird like a parrot or hearing it from an echo. End quote.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."
