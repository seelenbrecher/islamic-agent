        "question": "Is it wrong to feel more connected to an adopted child than to my own child?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.You should understand \u2013 may Allah keep you safe and sound \u2013 that it is possible, on the basis of real-life experience and rational thinking, for a father to form a bond with a child other than his own that is stronger than his bond with his own child, because of spending a great deal of time with him, or because the way the child acts and speaks indicates that the child is attached to that man in a manner that he does not see in his own child.\nIt is also possible that a child does not bond with his father, even if they live in the same house, either because the father treats him harshly or neglects him. These are natural feelings that fathers and children may feel in such circumstances.\nYet despite that, the natural inclination that Allah has instilled in people remains deeply rooted in the soul of the father and the soul of the son, and this prevents the father from becoming no more than a stranger like other people, and prevents the son from becoming a stranger like other children.\nNo matter what happens, this natural inclination that Allah has instilled in people will remain deep in your child\u2019s heart, and he will not be able to ward it off or ignore it under any circumstances.\nMoreover, it will increase in strength and depth if you show love to him, let him know that you care for him and treat him kindly.\nThe point is that it is important for you to be a positive and active presence in your child\u2019s life \u2013 in this situation \u2013 and you cannot do without that. So you should strive to see him regularly and do not stop visiting him, following his progress and showing him that you are keen to see him by all possible means.\nYou should also strive to show your love for him in words and deeds and in the way in which you interact with him.\nYou should show him that you appreciate him and praise him every time you meet him; you should encourage him, support his skills and hobbies that are dear to his heart, be gentle when advising him, and show him your disapproval in a gentle and loving manner when he behaves in a manner that is not appropriate.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "He Fears For His Kids in Non-Muslims Lands",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is no doubt that the situation your children have ended up in is the harsh and heavy price that families pay as a result of living in non-Muslim countries, whether in the West or the East, which ultimately leads to the children becoming westernized or easternized, or following whatever their desires dictate, in a direction far from the Religion of Allah and His pleasure; except for those whom my Lord has mercy upon; and they are few.\nFor benefit, please see the answer to question no. 52893 .\nSecondly:\nWhat you are considering, migrating to a Muslim country and leaving your family and children behind, is not the ideal solution; because it involves neglecting the trust and responsibility of raising children, which is a significant matter.\nFrom `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock: the ruler who governs the people is a shepherd and is responsible for them, a man is a shepherd over the members of his household and is responsible for them, a woman is a shepherd over her husband's house and children and is responsible for them, and a slave is a shepherd over his master's property and is responsible for it. So, all of you are shepherds and each of you is responsible for his flock.\" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (2554) and Muslim (1829).\nAnd from Ma`qil ibn Yasar, who said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) saying: \"There is no servant whom Allah has given responsibility over a flock, and he does not protect them with sincere advice, except that he will not find the fragrance of Paradise.\" Narrated by Al-Bukhari (7150) and Muslim (142).\nTherefore, your staying with your family, advising them, striving in their upbringing and guidance, falls under the reform mentioned in the words of Allah (translation of the meaning):\n{I only intend reform as much as I am able. And my success is not but through All\u0101h. Upon Him I have relied, and to Him I return.} Hud (88).\nA Muslim sometimes faces situations in life where he is between two goods and chooses the better of them, or between two evils and chooses the lesser of them.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\"The perfection of 'piety (scrupulousness)' is for a person to know the better of two goods and the worse of two evils, and to know that the Shari`ah is built upon achieving and perfecting benefits, and eliminating and minimizing harms. Otherwise, one who does not weigh the benefits and harms of an action or inaction according to the Shari`ah might neglect obligations and commit prohibitions.\" End quote from \"Majmu` al-Fatawa\" (10/512).\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\"The intelligent person should know that reason and Shari`ah mandate achieving and perfecting benefits and eliminating and minimizing harms. When an intelligent person faces a matter in which he sees both a benefit and a harm, he is obliged to do two things: a matter of knowledge and a matter of action. The matter of knowledge is to seek to understand which is more predominant between the two sides of benefit and harm. Once it becomes clear to him which is more predominant, he is obliged to choose what is better for him.\" End quote from \"Al-Da' wa Al-Dawa'\" (p. 491).\nIn conclusion:\nThe first thing you should do, if you are unable to reform them in your place and they do not agree to move with you to a better country, is to try to get custody of the younger ones, whom you can take care of, control, and reform, and bring them back to the path of their Religion as much as possible and within your capacity. Move with them to a Muslim country, where you can live among (Muslim) people and where you can reform their Religion.\nIf you are unable to do so, then move with them to another region, in the midst of a Muslim community, where you can be stronger in establishing your Religion for yourself and reforming your children as much as you can.\nHowever, in any case, we see that your leaving your children behind - if you are unable to migrate with them - leaving them in the hands of your wife, whose condition you have described, is a kind of neglecting the trust; and the better thing to do, if you are unable to move with them, is to stay with them as a guide, educator, and advisor, striving to reform them and yourself, and your wife as much as you can; until Allah provides relief and a way out for you and them, and enables you to improve them and guide them, or they grow up, and your authority over them ceases, and you are unable to return them or reform anything from them; then at that time, you are on your own; and every soul is held in pledge for what it has earned.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on making a video cartoon series for children",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that it is forbidden to draw and make images of animate beings, whether that is by carving (statues) or on paper, fabric or anything else, and whether the image is realistic or imaginary, because of the stern warning concerning that which is narrated in the religious texts, such as the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): \u201cThe people who will be most severely punished on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari (5950) and Muslim (2109).\nBut an exception is made from that for images and three dimensional objects (toys) with which children play, because of the hadith of \u2018A\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came back from the campaign to Tabuk or Khaybar and there was a curtain over her niche. The wind lifted the edge of the curtain and uncovered \u2018A\u2019ishah\u2019s toy dolls. He said: \u201cWhat is this, O \u2018A\u2019ishah?\u201d She said: My dolls. He saw among them a horse with two wings made of cloth and he said: \u201cWhat is this that I see in the midst of them?\u201d She said: A horse. He said: \u201cWhat is this that I see on it?\u201d She said: Two wings. He said: \u201cA horse with wings?\u201d She said: Have you not heard that Sulayman had horses with wings? She said: And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) smiled so broadly that I saw his eyeteeth. Narrated by Abu Dawud (4932); classed as sahih by al-\u2018Iraqi in Takhrij al-Ihya\u2019 (2/344) and by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari (10/527): This hadith is quoted as evidence that it is permissible to keep dolls and toys for girls to play with. This is an exception from the general prohibition on keeping images. This was stated definitively by \u2018Iyad, who narrated it from the majority of scholars, and said that they permitted the sale of dolls to girls for the purpose of training them from a young age to take care of their houses and their children. End quote.\nThis indicates that it is permissible for children to make these three-dimensional objects themselves, or for them to be made for children.\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with producing cartoons for children, if they are free of haram things such as music, because of the proven concession regarding images for children, and because making such films in accordance with Islamic guidelines helps to reduce evil and occupies children with that which is beneficial or permissible.\nThere is nothing wrong with making a lion-type baby character, and giving it eyes and a nose.\nDr. Ahmad al-Qadi (may Allah preserve him) said: I asked our shaykh [i.e., Ibn \u2018Uthaymin, may Allah have mercy on him]: What is the ruling on educational cartoons for children, such as the movie Muhammad al-Fatih?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with that, because it is beneficial, and because it will distract them from things that would harm them\u2026\"(Thamarat at-Tadwin min Fatawa Ibn \u2018Uthaymin).\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: I hope that you can explain to me the ruling on buying videos if there are cartoons in them, noting that these cartoons are for a good purpose and benefit children. And is the ruling different if the images are static (not moving) or animated (moving), or not?\nHe replied: With regard to these movies which contain beneficial material, and benefit children and keep them away from things that are worse than them, if there is no other alternative, then undoubtedly they are less serious than indecent movies, and concessions are granted for children with regard to leisure and play that are not granted to adults. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and his family) granted a concession to \u2018A\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) allowing her to play with dolls, because he married her when she was young. When he married her she was six years old, and he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine years old, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the best of people to his family. He would allow her to play with these toys. Thus a concession is granted to children that is not granted to adults. So if a person buys movies which entertain children and do not contain any haram elements, there is nothing wrong with that.(Al-Liqa\u2019 ash-Shahri, no. 47).\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: Many toys contain images of animate beings drawn by hand, and the purpose behind them is usually to educate the child, such as those that are found in talking books. Is that permissible?\nHe replied: If that is for the purpose of entertaining children, then the scholars who permitted toys for children also permitted such images, on the grounds that these images are not exactly like the images in which Allah created the creatures that are depicted, as is clear from what I see before me, so the matter is not that serious.\"(Majmu\u2018 Fatawa wa Rasa\u2019il al-\u2018Uthaymin\u00a0 12/339).\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible to make a cartoon series on the internet and to design an animated character to answer questions, if that is specifically for children, because of the concession allowing that, as noted above. And there is nothing wrong with receiving payment for that, because whatever is permissible to make or produce, it is permissible to sell it or rent it out.\nTo sum up:\nIt is permissible to make a cartoon video series for children, if it is for a good purpose and is free of haram things such as music or spreading deviant ideas and beliefs.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "How should fathers and mothers deal with their children\u2019s questions having to do with pregnancy and how it comes about?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is very beneficial for the parents to show interest in their children\u2019s questions, regardless of what the parents really think of these questions, then they should not behave as if these questions are causing some sort of embarrassment to them, so that the child will not develop some kind of sensitivity regarding some issues that he is asking about.\nWith regard to the question mentioned here, the mother could refer in her answer to Allah the Creator and His might, and how He can bring forth the living from the dead, and bring forth the dead from the living; how Allah created Adam from dust, then created his offspring and children after that in the bellies of their mothers; and how the might of Allah, may He be exalted, is manifested in making the belly, even though it contains what it contains, a suitable place for the foetus to live in for a while; and that the foetus goes through stages from a nutfah (sperm drop) to a \u2018alaqah (blood clot) to a mudghah (chewed piece of flesh), shaped and unshaped.\nThus the mother will shift the conversation to speaking of Allah\u2019s might, His power of creation, His care, His wisdom and how He guarantees provision to the foetus in its mother\u2019s belly, even though this foetus is powerless and its mother has no control at all over its provision. And the mother can speak of how Allah has allocated a particular length of time for the foetus to remain in the mother\u2019s belly, then by His might He brings the baby forth from his mother\u2019s belly, as He brings forth the chick from the egg.\nSimilarly, the mother could answer her child\u2019s question, at this age, by giving general answers so that the child will be able to understand what he hears, and it will undoubtedly be correct information. It is good to support the answer with appropriate verses from the Holy Qur\u2019an, so as to shift the conversation to a different category altogether, and spare the mother from having to give blunt, embarrassing and sensitive answers, and also to avoid giving incorrect information.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Will the maternal uncle be brought to account for the immodesty of his sister\u2019s daughters?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe maternal uncle has no guardianship over his sister\u2019s daughters if their father is still alive\nThe maternal uncle has no guardianship over his sister\u2019s daughters if their father is still alive, is of sound mind, is accountable and is present. It is well known that care of children is a duty on parents so long as they are alive, and they are the ones who are responsible before Allah, may He be exalted, for taking care of them and bringing them up.\nIt was narrated from \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cEach of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. The ruler of the people is in a position of responsibility and is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care. A woman is in a position of responsibility over her husband\u2019s house and children and is answerable for those under her care. The slave is in a position of responsibility over his master\u2019s wealth and is answerable for it. Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2554) and Muslim (1829).\nBut the maternal uncle has a responsibility with regard to enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong. So if he sees his sister\u2019s children doing something wrong, he must rebuke them.\nIt was narrated that Abu Sa\u2018eed al-Khudri said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: \u201cWhoever among you sees an evil deed, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (49).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the Prophet\u2019s words \u201clet him change it,\u201d this is in the sense that doing this is obligatory, according to the consensus of the ummah. The obligation to enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong is in accordance with the Qur\u2019an, the Sunnah and the consensus of the ummah. It is also part of that sincere advice (naseehah) which is Islam.\nEnd quote from Sharh Saheeh Muslim (2/22).\nSecondly:\nDoes the maternal uncle have the right to discipline his sister\u2019s children?\nIn a situation such as this, the maternal uncle does not have the right to smack his sister\u2019s children, because disciplining them by smacking them is only the right of the father or the one who has guardianship over the child, as appointed by the father or by the judge of an Islamic court.\nIt says in al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (10/25):\nIt is permissible for the father or mother to smack their child by way of disciplining him, and the same applies to the one who is appointed as the child\u2019s guardian\u2026\nAs for the teacher, he may obtain the authority from the child\u2019s guardian to discipline the child. End quote.\nBut if the father knows what the maternal uncle is doing and keeps quiet about it, then this is approval on his part of what the uncle is doing, so it is like delegating the uncle to educate and discipline them as he sees fit.\nIn some families, the maternal uncle has a status that allows him to discipline the children, and this is a matter of custom that people acknowledge and do not object to it.\nBut if the father objects to what the maternal uncle is doing, then the uncle should limit his involvement to offering advice [to the children], and he should also offer advice to the father and mother, because this is their responsibility regarding their daughters, and they are the ones who have the authority to prevent their daughters from wearing haraam clothing by force.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "How can this student keep away from other students who are a bad influence?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.First of all, it is essential to differentiate between mere supposition and imagination, and what it is feared may actually happen. Not everyone who makes friends with someone who is younger than him has bad intentions, unless he is known for doing bad things or he is not someone who is known for being righteous, in which case it is essential to be careful and take precautions.\nIn that case, what may be done is the following:\n\nAlert his family and urge them to keep an eye their son and watch his behaviour, whilst trying to get to know his friends better.\nExplain to him in a convincing manner the danger of making friends with such people, and the necessity of keeping away from them, whilst informing him of the intentions that some of them may have in making friends with him.\nExplain to the students as a whole the rulings having to do with the \u2018awrah and the obligation to cover it and guard it from people in general, and the obligation to avert the gaze, and to beware of mixing with bad friends.\nAddress those young men directly and advise them, and explain to them the warnings that the scholars gave against making friends with beardless youths, the danger of looking at them, and that the opinion of the scholars is that it is unlawful to look with desire at the face of a good-looking beardless young man; in fact some of the scholars stated that it is unlawful to look at him at all.\n\nAn-Nawawi said: The evidence for that is that is some ways he is like a woman, because he is desired as a woman is desired, and his appearance is beautiful like that of a woman. In fact, many of them may even be better looking than many women; indeed the prohibition may be more applicable to them for another reason, which is that in their case the ways of evil are more available than in the case of women.\nEnd quote. Sharh Saheeh Muslim (4/31).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The one who looks repeatedly at a beardless young man and the like, or persists in looking, and says, I am not looking with desire, is not to be believed, because if he has no reason for which he needs to look at him, then persisting in looking at him can only be interpreted as the result of the pleasure he finds in that. As for an accidental glance, it is pardoned if he then averts his gaze.\nEnd quote. Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (15/419).\n\nIf nothing of the sort is happening, but you still fear for him, then advise his family to move him to another circle, so as to keep him away from those mischief-makers.\n\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "What is the best approach to provide a proper Islamic education?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is obvious to anyone who reflects that there has arisen a division and separation between knowledge and action, between knowledge and proper manners and attitudes, in the minds of many of the ordinary people and of the elite. As a result of that, many of them think that the issue of good manners and morals is purely theoretical, and that it is connected to the parents\u2019 ability to fill their children\u2019s minds with all kinds of knowledge and memorisation of texts, in addition to their efforts to acquire and read the greatest possible number of books and research material that discuss approaches to teaching morals and manners, and the like \u2013 to the extent that in their minds, dealing with Islamic texts has become something purely theoretical and academic, without thinking that those texts should have an impact on people\u2019s behaviour and attitude, and on their deeds and actions.\nOne example of that is their interpretation of the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cOnly those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge\u201d [Faatir 35:28]. They interpret this verse as referring to everyone who has knowledge of shar\u2018i rulings, or of empirical science, even though the verse does not mean that every knowledgeable person fears Allah; rather it means that everyone who fears Allah is knowledgeable.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (7/539):\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cOnly those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge\u201d [Faatir 35:28]. This indicates that everyone who fears Allah has knowledge, and this is true; it does not indicate that everyone who has knowledge fears Him. End quote.\nElsewhere (7/21), he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant is that no one fears Him except one who has knowledge. Allah tells us that everyone who fears Allah has knowledge, as He says in another verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cIs one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing [in prayer], fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]? Say, \u2018Are those who know equal to those who do not know?\u2019\u201d\u00a0[az-Zumar 39:9].\nEnd quote.\nThis second verse is the other verse to which Shaykh al-Islam was referring, and which is misinterpreted as being praise for knowledge and understanding, even if they are disassociated from righteous deeds and good manners and attitude. That is because they quote the last part of the verse, and not the first part. The words \u201cSay, \u2018Are those who know equal to those who do not know?\u2019\u201d are to be understood in the light of what comes before them: \u201cIs one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing [in prayer], fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]?\u201d Therefore \u201cthose who know\u201d, in this instance, are those who stand and pray to Allah during the night, out of fear of His fire and hoping for His paradise and His mercy; those who do not know are who are heedless of that, so think about this! Hence Imam Ibn al-Qayyim said in Miftaah Dar as-Sa\u2018aadah (1/89), affirming an important guideline in this regard:\nThe early generations only used the word fiqh (lit., understanding) to refer to knowledge accompanied by action (and not just theoretical knowledge). End quote.\nThis is the real meaning of fiqh according to our righteous predecessors: Knowledge which is accompanied by action. But when many daa\u2018iyahs and educators overlooked this fact, they ended up focusing on knowledge as something theoretical and academic, and they did not think of it as a means of correcting behaviour, purifying hearts, striving against one\u2019s evil inclinations and developing right attitudes, because they thought that the academic side of knowledge and fiqh was all there was to it and was all that one should seek \u2013 but that is not the case.\nRaising the young generation and teaching them good morals and attitudes, and how to adhere to religious teachings, is something that cannot be achieved except by pious people, whether they are scholars, daa\u2018iyahs, reformers or teachers. The word translated here as pious scholar (rabbaani) refers to one who is greatly devoted to the Lord, may He be glorified, in his knowledge, his deeds and his teaching of others.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201c\u2026but [instead, he would say], \u2018Be pious scholars of the Lord because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied\u201d\u00a0[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:79].\nImam ash-Shawkaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fat-h al-Qadeer (1/407):\nThe word translated here as pious scholar (rabbaani) refers to one who is devoted to the Lord (ar-Rabb). The suffix -aani is added by way of emphasis, just as one who has a large beard (lihyah) may be described as lihyaani, and so on.\nAnd it was said that the pious scholar (rabbaani) is the one who teaches the people minor issues of knowledge before major issues, as if he is following the approach of the Lord, may He be glorified, in making things easy.\nEnd quote.\nConclusion:\nEducation is not mere words that have no impact on people\u2019s behaviour and attitude, and it is not mere theory separated from belief. Rather the aim of education is to help the student to develop a strong character, and to both acquire knowledge and develop patience, acquire understanding and develop wisdom, so that he acts upon what he learns and teaches others about it.\nHence Imam ash-Shawkaani said regarding the words \u201cbecause of what you have taught of the Scripture [bima kuntum tu\u2018allimoona al-kitaab]\u201d [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:79]:\nThose who read it as tu\u2018allimoona [so that the phrase means: because of what you have taught of the Scripture] must interpret the word rabbaani [translated above as pious scholar] as meaning one who has something in addition to knowledge and teaching; he should also be sincere or wise or patient.\nThose who read it as ta\u2018lamoona [so that the phrase would mean: because of what you know of the Scripture] may interpret the word rabbaani as meaning a knowledgeable person who teaches the people. Thus the meaning is: be teachers, for you have knowledge, and because you have studied knowledge.\nThis verse offers the greatest motivation for the one who has knowledge to act upon his knowledge, and one of the best ways of implementing what one knows is to teach it and to be sincere to Allah, may He be glorified.\"(Fat-h al-Qadeer\u00a0 1/407)\nThus it becomes clear that the essence and foundation of proper education is to educate by example, not by mere empty words that are detached from one\u2019s behaviour and deeds.\nHence al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his interesting essay, Fadl \u2018Ilm as-Salaf \u2018ala \u2018Ilm al-Khalaf (p. 5):\nMany seekers of knowledge among the later generations got it wrong when they thought that one who speaks a great deal about issues of religion, and argues and debates, is more knowledgeable than one who is not like that. This is pure ignorance; look at the senior Sahaabah and the most knowledgeable among them, such as Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar, \u2018Ali, Mu\u2018aadh, Ibn Mas\u2018ood and Zayd ibn Thaabit, and how they were. They spoke less than Ibn \u2018Abbaas, but they had more knowledge than he did.\nSimilarly, the Taabi\u2018een spoke more than the Sahaabah, but the Sahaabah had more knowledge than they did.\nSimilarly, the followers of the Taabi\u2018een spoke more than the Taabi\u2018een, but the Taabi\u2018een had more knowledge than they did.\nKnowledge does not mean memorising a lot of religious texts or speaking a great deal in khutbahs and lessons; rather knowledge is a light that is instilled in the heart, by means of which a person may understand issues on the basis of truth and be able to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and he expresses that in concise words that serve the purpose. End quote.\nThis is the greatest calamity that has befallen Muslim households and educational institutions, namely their lack of righteous and pious teachers who could educate and guide them by example, not only by their words, and when teaching would be able to combine sound words and sound deeds, using a wise approach and proper understanding of the religion of Allah, may He be exalted, and what He wants from His slaves.\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt should be understood that this education is like a seed and the educator is like the soil; if the soil is of poor quality, then the seed will be lost and wasted, but if the soil is good, the seed will grow and develop.\"(Al-Adaab ash-Shar\u2018iyyah by Ibn Muflih 3/580).\nBecause of the above, some of the scholars and reformers were able to raise righteous children and teach them good morals and attitudes, and many fuqaha\u2019 and educators were able to discipline their students. Here we may confirm that there is a limit to causes and measures that may be taken, and all matters are to be entrusted to the Lord of Lords, the Creator of people\u2019s deeds, the One Who guides to the straight path. All that educators and parents can do is discipline their children and teach them morals and manners. As for making a person truly righteous and purifying his heart, no one can do that except Allah.\nHence it is said that all that parents can do is teach their children good manners; righteousness may be attained by the help of Allah.\"(Al-Adaab ash-Shar\u2018iyyah by Ibn Muflih 3/552)\nFinally:\nThe way to achieve this, realistically, may be summed up in a few brief points:\n1. Daa\u2018iyahs and teachers should be made aware of what education means in a comprehensive sense.\n2.Reformers who work with ordinary Muslims should be made aware of various approaches to education.\n3.Reformers should cooperate with people of virtue and prominence in Muslim societies to establish educational institutions that focus on manners and behaviour, to work in conjunction with existing educational institutions, and to train some people to carry on the mission of educating people and teaching them proper manners, morals and behaviour.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Serious consequences of falling short in raising children",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Just as the parents have rights over their children, so too the children have rights over their parents.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cO you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, over which are [appointed] angels, harsh and severe; they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded\u201d\n[at-Tahreem 66:6].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cEach of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband\u2019s household and is responsible for her flock\u2026\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (893) and Muslim (1829).\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere is no person whom Allah puts in charge of others, and when he dies he is insincere to his subjects, but Allah will forbid Paradise to him.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (142).\nTherefore children have rights over their parents to which the parents must pay attention. These rights are many and include the following:\n1. A man must choose a good wife for himself and a woman must choose a good husband for herself. A man should choose a woman who will be a good mother for his children in the future, and a woman should choose a man who will be a good father to her children.\n2. Giving the child a good name, taking care of him, and fulfilling his basic needs of food, drink, clothing and accommodation, according to what one can afford, without falling short or being extravagant.\n3. One of the most important rights that children have over their parents is that they should give them a good upbringing and take care of them, paying attention to their manners and behaviour, and their practice of their religion in a manner that is pleasing to Allah, and following up with them regarding worldly matters in such a way that will help them to live a dignified and righteous life.\nMany parents fall short with regard to this duty that they owe to their children, then they suffer the consequences of their falling short, which is defiant disobedience from their children, and the children\u2019s mistreatment of them.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhoever neglects to teach his child that which will benefit him, and leaves him without any guidance, has wronged him gravely. Most children\u2019s deviance is because of their parents and the parents\u2019 neglect and failure to teach them the obligatory religious duties and the sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so they neglected them when they were small.\u2026\nHow many are the parents who were the cause of their children\u2019s misfortune and suffering in this world and the hereafter, because of their negligence and failure to discipline the child, and their encouraging and helping him to pursue his whims and desires. By doing that, they think that they are being kind to the child, at the time when they are disgracing him, and they think that they are showing mercy to him at the time when they are wronging him. Thus the child will be of no benefit to his parent, and the parent is the cause of the child\u2019s misfortune and of his missing out on opportunities for success in this world and the hereafter\u2026\nIf you think of the causes of children\u2019s misguidance and corruption, you will see that it is mostly the fault of the parents.\nEnd quote from Tuhfat al-Mawdood bi Ahkaam al-Mawlood (p. 229, 242).\nIt should be noted that if the father and mother fall short in raising their child, that does not mean that the child should fall short in his duties towards his parents and mistreat them; rather he has to treat them kindly and forgive any mistreatment on their part towards him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cand to parents, good treatment\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:23]\n\u201cBut if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them but accompany them in [this] world with appropriate kindness\u201d\n[Luqmaan 31:15].\nFor more information on the rights of children over their parents, please see question no. 20064.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "She stopped watching movies then she watched a movie by mistake, and she is asking how she can stop watching them",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The ways in which you can give up watching movies: you can \n    achieve that by means of several things that were mentioned by the scholars \n    and educators, such as the following:\u00a0\n\n    1.Finding out about the shar\u2018i \n    ruling, which has been discussed previously in many answers.\n\n    2.Bearing in mind that Allah, may \n    He be exalted, is always watching and that He knows what is secret and is \n    even more hidden. One of the early generation was asked about what they did \n    that help them to lower their gaze and refrain from looking at haraam \n    things. He said: By knowing that Allah sees you more quickly than you see \n    what you are looking at.\n\n    3.Righteous friends who will \n    remind you if you forget and alert you if you are heedless. They are close \n    friends who love one another for the sake of Allah and you are brought \n    together in obedience to Allah, may He be exalted. Allah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cFriends on \n    that Day will be foes one to another, save those who kept their duty (to \n    Allah)\u201d [al-Zukhruf 43:67]. That is the good companion whom the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) likened to the bearer of \n    musk. It was narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ash\u2018ari (may Allah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cThe likeness of a good companion and a bad companion is that of one \n    who carries musk and one who works the bellows. With the carrier of musk, \n    either he will give you some or you will buy some from him, or you will \n    notice a good smell from him; as for the one who works the bellows, either \n    he will burn your clothes or you will notice a bad smell from him.\u201d\n\n    4.Keeping yourself busy with \n    things will benefit you in religious and worldly terms. You should have a \n    daily wird that you recite; memorize the Book of Allah; study some books by \n    the scholars or listen to them, and busy yourself with things that are \n    beneficial and serve the people and society.\n\n    5.Marriage, which is what the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recommended to help lower \n    their gaze and guard chastity, as he said: \u201cO young men, whoever among you \n    can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the \n    gaze and guarding one\u2019s chastity. And whoever cannot afford it, let him \n    fast, for it will be a shield for him.\u201d \n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4779) and Muslim (1400).\n\n    6.Always asking Allah to help \n    you, guide you and purify your hearing and sight. The best thing that a \n    person can do to rid himself of evil inclinations after taking the proper \n    measures is to turn to his Lord and ask Him to help him with that, to make \n    things easy for him and to purify his physical faculties.\n\n    We ask Allah to enable you to do that which He loves and that \n    pleases Him.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is good for the teacher to be kind and gentle towards young and old, but if the situation calls for discipline or a (light) smack that is not severe, that is permissible. It is the habit of the foolish to behave badly and not show any respect, so there is a need for strictness and strength that is more effective than kindness and gentleness.

        "question": "Ruling on setting up a recorder to watch over a relative\u2019s conversations",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy\non him) and he said:\nI think that this is a kind of spying\nand it is not permissible for anyone to spy on anyone else, because we have no\nright the judge anybody except by what is apparent. If we start spying on\npeople we will have a lot of headaches because of this spying and we will be\nupset by what we hear and see. \nAllaah says\n(interpretation of the meaning) \u201cAnd spy not\u201d [al-Hujuraat\n49:12]\nafter saying (interpretation of the meaning), \u201cO you who believe! Avoid much\nsuspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not\u201d [al-Hujuraat 49:12].\nBut if the head of the household sees indications\nof these evil telephone calls, then there is nothing wrong with setting up a\nrecording device without their knowledge, but he realizes that there is\nsomething going on, he should not keep quiet and keep listening, rather he\nshould rebuke them straightaway, because if he communities to listen,because he may hear\nsomething that will upset him even more. For example, if he comes across a bad\ntelephone conversation, he must rebuke the one who is doing it straight away,\nand not delay it until the next day; he must put a stop to it from the\nbeginning.\nBut with regard to mere suspicion\nbased on waswaas (insinuating whispers of the Shaytaan), it is not permitted (for him to set up this\ndevice), but if he knows that the matter is serious and that it is actually\nhappening, then it is OK to set up a recorder so as to find out what is going on."

        "question": "How can she teach her five-year-old sister to memorize Qur\u2019aan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Raising children to follow Islam from an early age, teaching \n    them to memorize the Book of Allaah and educating them is the Sunnah of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and is regarded as \n    a very important matter, especially in this day and age. But it is something \n    that many people neglect with regard to their children and those under their \n    care, and they get distracted by things that will be of no benefit to them \n    in the Hereafter and may indeed harm them, and make them emotionally \n    attached to those who do not even deserve to be mentioned, let alone taken \n    as role models, such as actors, sports players and singers.\u00a0\n\n    We appreciate our sister\u2019s question and we ask Allaah to make \n    her steadfast and to help her in this matter and others, and to decree \n    reward for her on the Day of Judgement. What can be greater than meeting \n    one's Lord with a record of good deeds which includes guiding others to do \n    good or sharing in establishing good?\u00a0\n\n    With regard to this little sister and teaching her to \n    memorize Qur\u2019aan, we advise our sister to do the following:\u00a0\n\n    1-Start with that which is \n    easiest to read and memorize, namely Soorat al-Faatihah, then with the last \n    juz\u2019, working from the end. Starting with something easy helps one to move \n    on to more difficult material. Moreover she will have a real need for that \n    when she starts to learn the prayer.\n\n    2-The amount to be memorized \n    every day should be small, so that she will be able to memorize it and it \n    will be easy for her to memorize what comes next. This amount will vary from \n    one child to the next, depending on his or her intelligence and memory.\n\n    3-Review often so that what has \n    been memorized will stick. Do not let any day go by without memorizing \n    something new and reviewing the old.\n\n    4-Encourage her by giving her a \n    prize every time she finishes a juz\u2019 \u2013 for example \u2013 and memorizes it well.\n\n    5-Start to move from prompting \n    her and having her repeat, which is usually the first stage in memorization, \n    to teaching her how to read, so that it will be easy for her to read the \n    Qur\u2019aan by herself at times when her sister or teacher are not present.\n\n    6-Let her get used to reciting \n    what she has memorized in her prayer, whether that is obligatory or naafil \n    prayer, once she reaches an age where prayer is required of her and she can \n    understand it.\n\n    7-Let her get used to listening \n    to what she has memorized on tapes or on the computer, so that she can hear \n    both a good pronunciation and good recitation, and she can review and \n    consolidate what she has learned.\n\n    8-Choose a good time for \n    memorization when there are few distractions \u2013 such as after Fajr or between \n    Maghrib and \u2018Isha\u2019. Avoid times when she is hungry, tired or sleepy.\n\n    9-Praise her for what she has \n    memorized in front of neighbours and relatives, so as to encourage her and \n    encourage them to do the same thing; at the same time, pray for refuge for \n    her with Allaah for fear of the evil eye and envy (hasad).\n\n    10-It is essential for \n    her to have one style of Mus-haf with no changes, so that the layout of the \n    verses will be imprinted in her memory.\n\n    11-You should encourage \n    her to write out what she has memorized so that she may combine learning how \n    to write with reinforcing what she has memorized.\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength."
