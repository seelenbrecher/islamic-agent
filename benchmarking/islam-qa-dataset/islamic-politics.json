        "question": "Forsaking Your Muslim Brother because of Differences in Opinion",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to forsake a Muslim, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIt is not permissible for a man to forsake his Muslim brother for more than three days, each of them turning away from the other when they meet. The better of them is the one who gives the greeting of Salam first.\u201d (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5727; Muslim, 2560)\nIf the believer is a relative, such as a brother, nephew, uncle or cousin, then forsaking is an even worse sin.\u00a0\nThis applies unless the person is committing a sin and there is an interest to be served by forsaking him, i.e., it will make him give up the sin. In that case, there is nothing wrong with it because this comes under the heading of removing evil. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; if he cannot then with his heart [by hating it and feeling that it is wrong], and that is the weakest level of faith.\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by Muslim, 49) \u00a0\nThe basic principle is that it is prohibited for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim unless there is a reason to allow it.\u00a0(See Fatawa Manar Al-Islam, by Ibn \u2018Uthaymin, vol. 3, p. 732)\u00a0\nWali Al-Din Al-\u2018Iraqi said:\u00a0\n\u201cThis prohibition applies in cases where the forsaking is caused by anger with regard to something permissible and has nothing to do with religion. With regard to forsaking someone for a religious reason, such as his committing sin or Bid`ah; this is not prohibited. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded (his companions) to forsake Ka`b ibn Malik, Hilal ibn Umayyah and Mararah ibn Al-Rabi\u2019 (may Allah be pleased with them). Ibn \u2018Abd Al-Barr said: This Hadith of Ka`b indicates that it is permissible for a man to forsake his Muslim brother if he commits some act of Bid\u2019ah or immorality, in the hope that forsaking him may discipline him and serve as a rebuke to him. Abu Al-\u2018Abbas Al-Qurtubi said: With regard to forsaking a person because of sin or Bid`ah, it should be continued until he repents from that and does not go back to it. Ibn \u2018Abd al-Barr also said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is impermissible for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim for more than three days, unless there is the fear that speaking to him and keeping in touch with him will affect one\u2019s religious commitment or have some harmful effect on one's spiritual and worldly interests. If that is the case, it is permissible to avoid him, because peaceful avoidance is better than harmful mixing.\" (Tarh Al-Tathrib, 8/99)\nWhat you should do, if your brother has done something prohibited, is to advise him and explain that this thing is prohibited, and remind him of Allah. If you see that he is persisting in his sin and you think that forsaking him will serve a purpose, then it is permissible to do so, as stated above. But if he has simply done something that you do not agree with, or it is the matter of different points of view, then you should explain to him that you do not agree with what he has done, or with his mistaken point of view. But if you make forsaking him the sign of your disagreeing with him, this may lead to him rejecting your view completely, let alone the fact that this is not a legitimate Islamic justification for forsaking him for more than three days. We have seen above in the Fatwa of Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin that the basic principle is that it is prohibited for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim, unless there is a reason to allow it.\u00a0\nThe Muslim must be forbearing and sincere towards his brothers, he must be tolerant towards them and overlook their mistakes. He should not hasten to adopt a solution that may cause division and prohibited kinds of forsaking. May Allah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\u00a0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 13731 , 11018 , 126918 , 93775 , and 93146 ."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a woman to be appointed as a judge, because that is one of the positions of public authority that are restricted to men only. This has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 71338 .\nBut if there is no male judge, and the person has no choice but to refer the case to the court, and there is no one available to refer cases to except a woman, and if not referring the case to her would lead to loss of one\u2019s rights or cause harm, then in that case there is nothing wrong with referring the case to her as a matter of necessity.\nWe put this question to our shaykh, \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Barraak (may Allah preserve him), and he replied: If there is no one available except this female judge, then yes, it is permissible to refer cases to her for judgement as a matter of necessity, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSo fear Allah as much as you are able\u201d [at-Taghaabun 64:16].\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Sources of income for the bayt al-maal (treasury) in the Muslim state",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe causes on which zakaah may be spent are defined in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cZakaah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect [zakaah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allah . And Allah is Knowing and Wise\u201d\n[at-Tawbah 9:60].\nFor an explanation of this verse, please see the answer to question no. 46209.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the sources of income of the bayt al-maal (treasury), they are many and varied both in the past and in the modern era.\nIn al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah (8/245-248) it says:\nSources of income for the bayt al-maal:\n\nZakaah of all types, which the ruler takes whether it is taken from wealth that is visible or hidden, such as grazing livestock, crops, cash and trade goods.\nOne fifth (khums) of movable booty. Booty refers to all wealth that is taken from the disbelievers by means of fighting, apart from land and real estate. One fifth of this wealth is to be given to the bayt al-maal, to be spent on various prescribed causes. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd know that anything you obtain of war booty - then indeed, for Allah is one fifth of it and for the Messenger and for [his] near relatives and the orphans, the needy, and the [stranded] traveller\u2026\u201d [al-Anfaal 8:41].\nOne fifth of metals and the like extracted from the ground, such as gold, silver, iron and so on. It was said that this also applies to what is extracted from the sea, such as pearls, ambergris and so on.\nOne fifth of buried treasure. This refers to all wealth that was buried underground by human actions. What is meant here is the treasure of the disbelieving people of the Jaahiliyyah (pre-Islamic period of ignorance). If a Muslim finds it, one fifth of it is to be given to the bayt al-maal; the remainder belongs to the finder.\nFay\u2019, which is all movable wealth that is captured from the disbelievers without a fight and without mobilising troops. Fay\u2019 is of different types:\n\n\nLand and property from which the disbelievers fled for fear of the Muslims (at time of war). This is to be made into a waqf, like land that is seized by fighting, and its yield is to be shared out every year. This was stated by the Shaafa\u2018is, although there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning the matter.\nMovable wealth that is left behind and abandoned by the disbelievers. This is to be divided on the spot, and not turned into a waqf.\nWhat is taken from the disbelievers of taxes or rental of land of which the Muslims have gained possession and rented out to a Muslim or a dhimmi [non-Muslim living under Muslim rule], or rental of land that the Muslims have left in the possession of its original owners, whether it was acquired on the basis of a peace deal or was taken by force then left in their hands on the grounds that they are still its owners and they pay kharaaj (land tax) to us.\nJizyah, which is a poll tax paid by the disbelievers in return for their living in Muslim lands. It is imposed on each adult, able-bodied male, or on a city as a whole, to pay a specific amount of money. If someone pays it who is not obliged to do so, it is regarded as a gift, not as jizyah.\nOne tenth paid by ahl adh-dhimmah [non-Muslims living under Muslim rule]. This is a tax paid on trade goods that they export to dar al-harb [hostile non-Muslim territory] or that they import from dar al-harb to dar al-islam [Muslim territory], or that they move from one city to another within Muslim territory. It is to be paid by them once a year.\n\nSimilar to that is the one tenth paid by traders from dar al-harb, if they come to us with trade goods and seek our protection.\n\nWhat the non-Muslims in a state of war with the Muslims agree to pay in return for a peace deal.\nThe wealth of an apostate if he is executed or dies, and the wealth of a heretic if he is executed or dies. Their wealth is not to be inherited [by their heirs]; rather it comes under the heading of fay\u2019. According to the Hanafis, the wealth of an apostate is subject to further discussion.\nWealth of a dhimmi [non-Muslim living under Muslim protection] who dies and has no heir, or what is left over from his wealth after his heirs have taken their shares.\u00a0 This is also regarded as fay\u2019.\nLands captured by means of fighting that are agricultural lands, according to those scholars who do not think that such lands are to be divided among the fighters who capture them.\n\n\nThe yield of land belonging to the bayt al-maal, or rent on property owned by the bayt al-maal, and earnings on related trade and business dealings.\nGifts, donations and bequests that are given to the bayt al-maal for jihad or other purposes that are in the public interest.\nGifts that are given to judges who were not given gifts before being appointed to that position, or gifts that are given to judges but the giver has a dispute before the judge. If these gifts are not returned to the giver, they are to be given to the bayt al-maal, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) took from Ibn al-Latbiyah [who was sent out to collect zakaah and gave the zakaah to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) but he wanted to keep what was given to him as gifts] what had been given to him as gifts.\n\nThe same applies to gifts that are given to the ruler by non-Muslims who are hostile towards the Muslim state, and gifts that are given to state workers, unless the recipient pays towards these items from his personal wealth.\n\nTaxes imposed on people in order to take care of their own interests, whether that is for jihad or other purposes. These taxes should not be imposed on them unless there are insufficient funds in the bayt al-maal to serve that interest and it is essential. Otherwise, this is an illegitimate source of income.\nLost wealth; this refers to wealth that is found but it is not possible to know who the owner is, whether it is found in the street, entrusted to someone for safe keeping, given as collateral, found with thieves and their ilk, and similar wealth of which no one claims ownership. It is to be given to the bayt al-maal.\nThe estate of any Muslim who dies and has no heir, or he has heirs who do not inherit all of his wealth, according to the scholars who think that what is left over should not be given to his relatives. In the case of someone who is killed and has no heir, the diyah (blood money) for his killing goes to the bayt al-maal and is to be spent on the same causes as the fay\u2019.\n\nThe right of the bayt al-maal to this kind of wealth is subject to the rulings on inheritance, according to the Shaafa\u2018is and Maalikis. The Hanbalis and Hanafis say that it is to be given to the bayt al-maal according to the rules on fay\u2019, not inheritance.\n\nPenalties and confiscated wealth. It is narrated in the Sunnah that one who withholds zakaah is to be penalised by having half of his wealth seized. This is the view of Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh and Abu Bakr \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez. It was narrated that a penalty is to be imposed on one who picks fruit for free and takes it out [of the garden or orchard]; the penalty is to be double the value of the fruit. This is the view of the Hanbalis and Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh. What appears to be the case is that when such penalties are taken, they are to be spent in the public interest, thus they become due to the bayt al-maal.\n\nIt was narrated that \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) took half of the wealth of some people who were appointed to positions of authority when they became rich because of their positions.\nOne of the sources of income for the bayt al-maal in the modern era is the natural resources that were discovered in the lands of Muslim states, namely petroleum, natural gas, minerals and so on. It is very rare to find a state in which there are no resources of that nature.\nAnother source of income is what the state charges in return for what it carries out of agricultural, industrial or commercial projects, or services that it offers to the people, such as electricity, telephones, water and so on.\nThus it will become clear that there are many sources of income for the bayt al-maal.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Definition of terrorism and what it means in Islam and in the West",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nTerrorism (Arabic irhaab) is a term that refers to scaring others. In and of itself it is neither good nor bad, unless the one who uses this word intends it to mean something and unless we see the consequences of the actions based on it. Whoever says that terrorism (irhaab) in Islam is synonymous with killing is mistaken, because the linguistic meaning of the word does not reflect that. Terrorism refers to scaring, not killing per se. In terms of Arabic usage, words derived from the same root as irhaab (terrorism) appear in the Qur\u2019an where our Lord, may He be exalted, instructs us to fear Him, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cand fear [only] Me [wa iyyaaya farhaboon]\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:40]. He has also commanded us to prepare to face the enemy from whom we expect plots against us and plans to wage war against us. This preparation is intended to scare (or terrify) the enemy so that we will not become easy prey for him. This is stated clearly in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know [but] whom Allah knows\u201d\n[al-Anfaal 8:60].\nThe unjust colonialist states use this word in conjunction with Islam, intending thereby to distort its image in the sight of all people. Hence they set up conferences and held seminars, and established research institutes in the name of fighting terrorism, but in all of these efforts there was no discussion at all about these criminal colonialist states who are oppressing the weak Muslims, such as the Hindus and their terrorising of Muslims in Kashmir, or the Russians and their terrorising of Muslims in Chechnya, or the Americans and their terrorising of Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Zionists and their terrorising of Muslims in Palestine. Some na\u00efve Muslims have started to use this word to describe anyone they want to fight, and put people off him. They may be right in describing a particular group of Muslims as terrorists, but what about the states that use terrorism, and what about criminal racist organisations that have been spared from having this word used against them, which has become used exclusively in reference to Muslims?!\nThe rulings and teachings of Islam were prescribed by Allah for the purpose of protecting the honour, life and wealth of the Muslim. For that purpose Islam forbids killing, theft, zina (unlawful sex), and slander, and has ordained severe punishments for anyone who commits those crimes. The punishment may go as far as execution \u2013 as in the case of the previously-married zaani (adulterer) \u2013 so as to protect people\u2019s honour.\nThere is a severe punishment for one who terrorises and frightens people, such as gangs of bandits on the highways and those who do similar deeds within the city. They are the ones who strive to spread mischief and corruption on earth. Allah has prescribed the severest punishments for them, so as to ward off their evil and protect people\u2019s wealth, lives and honour. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cIndeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment\u201d\n[al-Maa\u2019idah 5:33].\nIn fact, Islam went even further, as it forbids the Muslim to scare his brother, even in jest. It was narrated from as-Saa\u2019ib ibn Yazeed that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: \u201cNo one of you should take his brother\u2019s property in jest or in earnest, and whoever has taken his brother\u2019s staff, let him return it.\u201d Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2160) and Abu Dawood (5003); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.\nIt was narrated that \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi Layla said: The companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that they were travelling with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey. One of the men fell asleep, and some of them went and took some arrows that he had with him, and when the man woke up he panicked, and the people laughed. He said: What made you laugh? They said: Nothing, but we took this man\u2019s arrows and he panicked. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIt is not permissible for a Muslim to scare or alarm another Muslim.\u201d Narrated by Ahmad (23064) and Abu Daawood (4351). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Daawood.\nSecondly:\n\u201cTerrorism\u201d (irhaab) in Islam is of two types:\n\nThat which is praiseworthy\n\nThis refers to scaring an enemy lest he attack the Muslims and occupy their land. That involves being fully prepared, arming themselves with faith, being united, and equipping themselves with weapons. The verse from Soorat al-Anfaal quoted above explains that it is obligatory for the Muslims to do this.\nIslam is not alone in this regard. Rather all nations compete in manufacturing arms and equipping themselves with weapons of mass destruction, establishing huge armies, and holding military parades to show off their troops and weapons. All of that is a show of strength intended to scare their neighbours and enemies, lest they think of attacking them.\n\nThat which is blameworthy\n\nThis refers to scaring those who do not deserve to be scared, Muslims or others whose lives are protected by Islamic law, such as those who have a covenant with the Muslims, those to whom the Muslims have granted protection and safety, and non-Muslims living under Muslim rule (ahl adh-dhimmah)\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council has defined terrorism as: acts of aggression and enmity carried out by individuals, groups or states by way of transgressing against people (affecting their religious commitment, physical and mental well-being, wealth or honour). That includes all ways of scaring, harming and threatening people, or killing them unlawfully, and all actions that are connected to those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, scaring wayfarers and travellers, acts of banditry, and all violent acts or threats that take place in support of criminal objectives, whether they are done by individuals or groups, with the aim of instilling fear and terror in people, scaring them by harming them, or exposing their lives, freedom, sense of security and well-being to danger. Another type of terrorism is damaging the environment, facilities, public or private property, or exposing some national or natural resources to danger. All of these are ways of spreading mischief and corruption on earth, which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has forbidden the Muslims to do in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters\u201d\n[al-Qasas 28:77].\nSixteenth session, Makkah al-Mukarramah, 21-26/10/1422 AH -- 5-10/1/2002 CE\nIn this statement, they pointed out two important issues:\nThe first issue is refuting the argument of those who describe Islam as being a religion of terrorism. Among other things, this statement said:\nThe members of the Council have noted that media campaigns are well orchestrated, and based on lies and nonsense, as they are organised by the types of media that are irrational and hostile, which are directed by the Zionist media organisations to stir up resentment, hatred and discrimination against Islam and Muslims, and to make false accusations against the final religion of Allah, foremost among which is the accusation of terrorism.\nIt became clear to the members of the Council that accusing Islam of terrorism through media campaigns is but an attempt to put people off Islam, as people are showing interest in it and are entering the religion of Allah in crowds.\nThe members of the Council call upon the Muslim World League and other Muslim organisations, and indeed all Muslims, to defend Islam, whilst paying attention to choosing the best methods that are appropriate to the honour that may be attained by undertaking this mission in the context of refuting the lies against Islam, and the accusation of terrorism. It may be noted that terrorism is a global phenomenon that cannot be attributed to a particular religion or people. Rather it is a phenomenon that stems from extremism of which no modern society is free. They explained that there are different types of extremism, such as political extremism, ideological extremism or religious extremism. Extremism that results from exaggeration about some issues of religion is not limited to the followers of a particular religion. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, mentioned the People of the Book exaggerating about their religion, and He forbade them to do that, as He says in His holy Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cSay, O People of the Scripture, do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way.\"\u201d\n[al-Maa\u2019idah 5:77].\nThe second issue that the council discussed is terrorism carried out at the level of the state. This is a matter concerning which the global media is silent, and has not exposed the people behind it. Among other things, the council said in a statement:\nThe Council affirms that there is another type of terrorism, which is terrorism carried out at the level of the state. One of its clearest and most abhorrent forms is the terrorism that is perpetrated by the Zionists in Palestine, and what the Serbs did in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Kosova. The Council regards this type of terrorism as posing the gravest danger to security and peace in the world, and regards confronting it as coming under the heading of self-defence and jihad in Allah\u2019s cause.\nEnd quote.\nThirdly:\nWith regard to terrorism perpetrated by the West, it is what we read of and witness of their invasion of weaker states and the plundering of their resources, and what we see of torture, rape and killing, all of which is documented via audio and video media, in documents that cannot be denied. This is a continuation of their historical practice of occupation by means of force, violence and weapons.\nWhat is really strange is that Western states \u2013 especially America \u2013have not given a definition of terrorism until now! It is clear that they would implicate themselves by any definition they chose. Therefore they have given this word a vague meaning, to be applied to whoever they decide to accuse of terrorism.\nShaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said:\nFrom ancient times, the disbelievers have waged war against Islam, describing it in the worst of terms, in order to put people off it. \u201cThey want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it.\u201d [at-Tawbah 9:32]. That includes their description of Islam as terrorism and savagery. They forget that terrorism, savagery, genocide, transgression against people unlawfully, and all other blameworthy attitudes in fact belong to the way of the disbelievers and are part of the disbelievers\u2019 character.\nThe fact that some so-called Muslims have behaved wrongly \u2013 either out of ignorance or bad intentions \u2013 cannot be attributed to Islam, for Islam forbids such deeds.\nThe way to protect Islam from this accusation is to explain that the actions of these individuals has nothing to do with Islam; rather these are cases of individuals acting badly, and every Muslim is prone to error; no one is infallible except the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAl-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Fawzaan (1/416, question no. 247)\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Politics from an Islamic perspective",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The word siyaasah (translated above as political outlook) comes from a root (saasa) meaning to become in charge and take care of something, which means looking after something in a manner that maintains its well-being. The phrase sawwasahu al-qawm refers to people appointing someone to run their affairs.\nSee: Lisaan al-\u2018Arab (6/107); al-Qaamoos al-Muheet (p. 170).\nAl-Bukhaari (3455) and Muslim (1842) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe Children of Israel were ruled by the Prophets (tasoosuhum al-Anbiyaa\u2019); every time one prophet died, another prophet would succeed him.\u201d\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201c[They] were ruled by the Prophets\u201d means the Prophets took care of their affairs as rulers who are in charge of the people do. Thus siyaasah means to take care of something in a manner that maintains its well-being and serves its interests. End quote.\nIbn Nujaym said:\nSiyaasah refers to an action taken by the ruler as he sees fit, even if there is no partial evidence for the action he takes.\nAl-Bahr ar-Raa\u2019iq (5/11).\nIbn Khaldoon defined as-siyaasah ash-shar\u2018iyyah [siyaasah on the basis of Islamic teachings] as follows: [It means] to lead the people in accordance with shar\u2018i guidelines, in a manner that serves their interests in the hereafter as well as in this world, for their interests in this world are connected to and may serve their interests in the hereafter, because the Islamic guidelines concerning the life of this world are connected to what serves people\u2019s interests in the hereafter. Thus as-siyaasah ash-shar\u2018iyyah, in reality, means acting in the stead of the Messenger in guarding religious affairs and taking care of worldly affairs. End quote from Muqaddimat Ibn Khaldoon (p. 97)\nBased on that, siyaasah is an indivisible part of Islam, and there is no separation between siyaasah (politics) and deen (religion).\nBased on the above and on modern usage of the word siyaasah, we may say that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to conduct the people\u2019s affairs and run the affairs of state on the basis of wise politics (siyaasah), because he brought a set of laws that were aimed at achieving what is in people\u2019s best interests and warding off what is harmful and bad.\nThis is also how the Rightly Guided Caliphs and leaders of guidance after him ran the affairs of the ummah.\nSee also: at-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah by Ibn al-Qayyim (p. 17-20).\nAnd Allah knows best."

But they were the swiftest of people in doing good, and they were the foremost in knowledge of the truth, acting upon it and the swiftest to acknowledge and correct their mistakes, if one of them made a mistake, like any other human.\nWhat is required of anyone who is accountable is to refrain from discussing the differences that arose among the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) and to think positively of every one of them.\nWhere could you find any people who are better than those who accompanied the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), migrated with him, strove with him in jihad, and prayed behind him?\nSee the answer to question no. 127028.\nII.\nIt was narrated by \u2018Abdullah ibn Ahmad in as-Sunnah (1312), Ibn Abi \u2018Aasim in as-Sunnah (1219) and al-Bayhaqi in al-I\u2018tiqaad (p. 358) that \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib said: No one gives me precedence over Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) but I shall flog him with the hadd punishment of one who fabricates lies.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is proven via many isnads from \u2018Ali that he said: No man will be brought to me who gives me precedence over Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar but I shall flog him with the hadd punishment of one who fabricates lies.\nEnd quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (4/479).\nHe also said:\nIt was narrated from \u2018Ali via approximately eighty isnaads or more that he said on the minbar of Kufah: The best of this ummah after its Prophet are Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar.\nEnd quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (4/407).\nIII.\nIt is proven in as-Saheehayn that \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib swore allegiance to Abu Bakr, even though it was delayed by a few months.\n\u2018Ali did not show any disagreement towards Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) or express any disapproval of the caliphate of Abu Bakr, and never expressed any dissent. Rather he delayed giving his allegiance to Abu Bakr. The reason for that was that he objected to Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar and others among the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) deciding the matter of the caliphate without him, despite his virtue, honour and high status, for he had the right to be present and be consulted about the matter, and that no decision should be taken without him.\nThe excuse that the Sahaabah gave was that they had hastened to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr so as to ward off fitnah and turmoil in the Muslim community, because they feared that disputes and conflicts might arise if they delayed it.\nAnother reason for the delay [in \u2018Ali swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr] was the fact that Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) got angry with Abu Bakr\u2019s response to her when she asked him about her inheritance (from the Prophet(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)], and \u2018Ali thought that he should show sympathy to her by staying away from Abu Bakr, especially since she was going through sorrow, distress and grief at the passing of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\n\u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) did not refuse to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him); rather he delayed doing so for the reasons mentioned above. Then he came and swore allegiance to him without being forced to do so.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\nIt is known via tawaatur reports that no one held back from swearing allegiance to him \u2013 namely Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) \u2013 except Sa\u2018d ibn \u2018Ubaadah. As for \u2018Ali and Banu Haashim, all of them swore allegiance to him, according to consensus, and none of them died until after swearing allegiance to him. But it was said that \u2018Ali delayed swearing allegiance to him for six months, or that he swore allegiance to him on the second day. Whatever the case, they swore allegiance to him without being forced to do so.\nEnd quote from Minhaaj as-Sunnah (8/232).\nSee also the answer to question no. 147540.\nIV.\nIt is not proven that \u2018Uthmaan beat \u2018Ammaar (may Allah be pleased with them both), let alone that \u2018Ali saw that and did not object. All of the reports that have been narrated concerning that are not sound in their isnaads (chains of narration).\nIbn Shabbah said in Taareekh al-Madinah (3/1098):\nAl-Qaasim ibn al-Fudayl told us: \u2018Amr ibn Murrah told me, from Saalim ibn Abi\u2019l-Ja\u2018d, who said: \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) called some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), among whom was \u2018Ammar, and said: I am going to ask you something; I adjure you by Allah, do you know that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to give precedence to Quraysh over all other people, and he used to give precedence to Banu Haashim over the rest of Quraysh? The people remained silent, so he said: If the keys of Paradise were in my hand, I would give them to Banu Umayyah so that all of them, to the last man, would enter it. By Allah, I would surely give to them and appoint them (to positions of authority), in spite of you. \u2018Ammar said: Inspite of me? \u2018Uthmaan said: In spite of you. \u2018Ammaar said: And in spite of Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar? \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) got angry and leapt up, and started to beat him severely, and the people intervened and pushed him away from \u2018Ammaar.\n\u00a0This is a da\u2018eef (weak) isnad. Saalim ibn Abi\u2019l-Ja\u2018d did not hear [reports] from \u2018Uthmaan. Al-Haafiz al-\u2018Alaa\u2019i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Saalim ibn Abi\u2019l-Ja\u2018d al-Kufi is well known; he narrated many mursal reports from the senior Sahaabah such as \u2018Umar, \u2018Ali, \u2018Aa\u2019ishah, Ibn Mas\u2018ood and others (may Allah be pleased with them). Abu Zar\u2018ah said: [Reports narrated by] Saalim ibn Abi\u2019l-Ja\u2018d from \u2018Umar, \u2018Uthmaan and \u2018Ali are mursal.\nEnd quote from Jaami\u2018 at-Tahseel (p. 179)\nIbn \u2018Abd Rabbihi said in al-\u2018Aqd al-Fareed (5/57):\nIn a hadith narrated by al-A\u2018mash from Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah, he said: The companions of \u2018Uthmaan wrote down his mistakes on a page and wrote down people\u2019s criticisms of him. They said: Who will take this to him? \u2018Ammaar said: I will. So he took it to him, and when he read it he [\u2018Uthmaan] said: May Allah cause your disgrace. \u2018Ammaar said: And Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar too? \u2018Uthmaan stood up and beat him until he fell unconscious. Then \u2018Uthmaan regretted it, and he sent Talhah and az-Zubayr to him to say to him: Choose one of three: either forgive me, or accept compensation for the injury, or retaliate in kind [qisas]. \u2018Ammaar said: By Allah, I will not accept any of them until I meet Allah! Abu Bakr [ibn Abi Shaybah, the narrator of this report] said: I mentioned this hadith to al-Hasan ibn Saalih, and he said: \u2018Uthmaan could not have done more than he did (to seek reconciliation).\nThis is a da\u2018eef (weak) isnad, like the previous report. Al-A\u2018mash is regarded as being among the junior Taabi\u2018een; he was born too late to have met \u2018Uthmaan or \u2018Ali or \u2018Ammaar.\nSee: Mizaan al-I\u2018tidaal (2/224) and at-Tahdheeb (4/196).\nIn fact, Ibn \u2018Abd Rabbihi, who quoted this report in his book, did not trace its isnad back to al-A\u2018mash. As it is possible that this report may be traced to someone who comes before al-A\u2018mash [in the chain of narration], it is also possible that it may be traced to someone who comes after him,\u00a0 whom Ibn \u2018Abd Rabbihi omitted between Ibn Abi Shaybah and al-A\u2018mash.\nIbn Abi Bakr al-Maaliqi said: If it is said that \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) beat \u2018Ammaar, it should be pointed out that this is not proven. Even if it could be proven, the imam (ruler) has the right to discipline some of his subjects, as he sees fit, even if he is mistaken.\nDo you not see that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) allowed people to settle scores with him. Similarly, Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) disciplined some of their subjects slapping and hitting with a stick, and they allowed others to settle the score with them.\nIf someone says that \u2018Uthmaan did not allow anyone to settle a score with him,\nIt should be said to him: How can that be true, when he made offers to that effect in an unprecedented manner, especially when he was under siege in his house, when he said: O people, if you find in the Book of Allah that you should put my feet in fetters, then do so.\u201d\nEnd quote from Shubuhaat hawla as-Sahaabah: Dhu\u2019n-Noorayn \u2018Uthmaan (p. 144).\nThere are sounder reports which contradict that. It was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in his Musannaf (7/521) and Ibn Shabbah in Taareekh al-Madinah (3/1101), via Husayn ibn \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan who said: Juhaym, a man from Banu Fihr, told me: I witnessed this event. He said: Sa\u2018d and \u2018Ammaar came and sent word to \u2018Uthmaan, saying: Please come; we want to remind you of something novel that you introduced, or things that you did. He sent word to them telling them: Leave for today, because I am busy; your appointment is on such and such a day.\nSo Sa\u2018d left, but \u2018Ammaar refused to leave.\nSo \u2018Uthmaan\u2019s messenger grabbed him and beat him.\nWhen they and those who were with them gathered at the appointed time, \u2018Uthmaan said to them: What grievances do you have against me?\nThey said: Our grievance is your beating of \u2018Ammaar.\n\u2018Uthmaan said: Sa\u2018d and \u2018Ammaar came, and I sent word to them, then Sa\u2018d left but \u2018Ammaar refused to leave, so a messenger grabbed him and beat without me instructing him to do that. By Allah, I did not give any instruction to that effect and I am not pleased with it. This is my hand for \u2018Ammaar; let him retaliate.\nThere is nothing wrong with this isnad, and its men are thiqaat (trustworthy). Juhaym is a Taabi\u2018i from whom two trustworthy narrators narrated, and he was classed as trustworthy by Ibn Hibbaan, so his hadith may reach the level of hasan.\nThis report is the soundest of those that were narrated about \u2018Uthmaan beating \u2018Ammaar.\nConclusion:\nIt is not proven that \u2018Uthmaan beat \u2018Ammaar in the first place, let alone any notion that he beat him in the presence of \u2018Ali and that \u2018Ali remained silent and did not defend him. What is required of us is to acknowledge the high status of the companions of our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), to love them and defend them.\nIt is not permissible to rely on everything that has been narrated in the books of history, except for that which is proven to be sound. How good are the words of Ibn Khaldoon:\nHow often the historians, mufassireen and narrators of reports make mistakes in the stories they narrate, because their method is mere transmission of reports, whether sound or unsound, without examining these reports and their chains of narration, and comparing them to other, similar reports, and without examining them in the light of reason and in the light of human nature. Thus they drifted away from the path of truth and fell into grievous mistakes and errors.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on abiding by the law of the land in western countries",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to laws promulgated in non-Muslim countries, one of the following three scenarios must apply:\n1.\nThe laws are contrary to what Allah has prescribed, such as giving the wife the power of divorce, or not giving the father guardianship over his daughter after she reaches puberty, or giving a daughter the same share of the estate as a son, allowing the drinking of alcohol and zina (sex outside of marriage), and so on. It is not permissible to act upon these laws or approve of them.\n2.\nThe laws are in accordance with what is mentioned in Islamic teachings. In this case, one should abide by them, in obedience to Allah and His Messenger.\n3.\nThe Islamic texts have not said anything about the laws, but they are in the best interests of people, such as laws having to do with driving and the age at which driving is allowed. These laws must be adhered to, in accordance with the religious texts which enjoin being faithful to contracts and covenants, such as the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cO you who believe! Fulfill (your) obligations\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:1] and the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): \u201cMuslims are bound by their conditions, except a condition that forbids something permissible or permits something forbidden.\u201d Abu \u2018Eesa [at-Tirmidhi] said: This is a hasan saheeh hadith.

        "question": "Concept of democracy in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      \n      Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    \n    Democracy is not an Arabic word. Rather it is derived from the Greek, and it \n    is a composite of two words: demos, meaning the masses or the people, \n    and kratia, meaning rule. So what is meant is the rule of the masses \n    or the rule of the people.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    \n    Democracy is a system that is contrary to Islam, because it gives the power \n    of legislation to the people or to those who represent them (such as members \n    of Parliament). Based on that, in democracy legislative authority is given \n    to someone other than Allah, may He be exalted; rather it is given to the \n    people and their deputies, and what matters is not their consensus but the \n    majority. Thus what the majority agree upon becomes laws that are binding on \n    the nation, even if it is contrary to common sense, religious teaching or \n    reason. In these systems legislation has been promulgated allowing abortion, \n    same-sex marriage and usurious interest (riba); the rulings of sharee\u2018ah \n    have been abolished; and fornication/adultery and the drinking of alcohol \n    are permitted. In fact this system is at war with Islam and its followers.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Allah, may He be exalted, has told us in the His Book that legislative \n    authority belongs to Him alone, and that He is the wisest of those who issue \n    rulings and judge. He has forbidden the association of anyone with Him in \n    His authority, and no one is better than Him in ruling.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cSo \n    the judgement is only with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great!\u201d\n\n    [Ghaafir \n    40:12]\n\n    \u201cThe \n    command (or the judgement) is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you \n    worship none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight \n    religion, but most men know not\u201d\n\n    [Yoosuf \n    12:40]\n\n    \u201cIs \n    not Allah the Best of judges?\u201d\n\n    \n    [at-Teen 95:8]\n\n    \u201cSay: \n    \u2018Allah knows best how long they stayed. With Him is (the knowledge of) the \n    unseen of the heavens and the earth. How clearly He sees, and hears \n    (everything)! They have no Walee (Helper, Disposer of affairs, Protector, \n    etc.) other than Him, and He makes none to share in His Decision and His \n    Rule\u2019\u201d\n\n    [al-Kahf \n    18:26]\n\n    \u201cDo \n    they then seek the judgement of (the Days of) Ignorance? And who is better \n    in judgement than Allah for a people who have firm Faith?\u201d\n\n    [al-Maa\u2019idah \n    5:50].\u00a0\n\n    \n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Creator of all things and He \n    knows what is good for them and what is in their best interests of rulings. \n    Human beings vary in intellect, attitude and customs, and they are unaware \n    of what is best for them, let alone what is best for others. Hence in \n    societies that are ruled by the people in terms of legislation and laws, one \n    sees only corruption, immorality and disintegration of the social fabric.\u00a0\n\n    It \n    should be noted that in many countries this system has changed into \n    something that has no reality behind it, and it is mere slogans by which \n    people are deceived; in fact the real ruler is the head of state and his \n    helpers, and the people are suppressed and have no say in anything.\u00a0\n\n    There \n    is nothing more indicative of that than the fact that when this democracy \n    produces results that do not suit the desires of the rulers, they crush it \n    underfoot. Cases of election fraud, suppression of freedoms and silencing of \n    the voices of those who speak the truth are well known to everyone and do \n    not need further proof.\u00a0\n\n    This \n    is very clear in many countries and does not need any proof.\u00a0\n\n    It \n    says in Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Adyaan wa\u2019l-Madhaahib al-Mu\u2018aasirah (2/1066):\u00a0\n\n    \n    Representative democracy:\u00a0\n\n    This \n    is one of the democratic systems in which the people exercise authority \n    through a council of elected representatives of the people. In this system \n    the people retain the right to exercise some aspects of authority directly \n    by various means, the most important of which are:\u00a0\n\n    1.\n    \n    The right to propose laws, which is done when a number of \n    people propse a law in general terms or in detail, which the parliament will \n    then discuss and vote upon.\n\n    2.\n    \n    The right to a referendum, whereby a law that has already \n    been approved by Parliament is presented to the people so that they can have \n    their say.\n\n    3.\n    \n    The right of objection, whereby a number of voters defined by \n    the Constitution have the right to object to a law within a certain period \n    after it has been passed, which will result in taking the matter to the \n    people for a general referendum; if the people agree with it, it will be \n    promulgated, otherwise it will be annulled. This is included in most modern \n    constitutions.\n\n    \n    Undoubtedly democratic systems are one of the modern forms of shirk, in \n    terms of obedience and submission, or in legislation, as it disregards the \n    authority of the Creator, may He be glorified and exalted, and His absolute \n    right of legislation, and regards that as one of the rights of created \n    beings. But Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cYou \n    do not worship besides Him but only names which you have named (forged), you \n    and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. The command \n    (or the judgement) is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you worship \n    none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, \n    but most men know not.\u201d\n\n    [Yoosuf \n    12:40]\n\n    \u201cSay \n    (O Muhammad SAW): \"I am on clear proof from my Lord (Islamic Monotheism), \n    but you deny (the truth that has come to me from Allah). I have not gotten \n    what you are asking for impatiently (the torment). The decision is only for \n    Allah, He declares the truth, and He is the Best of judges.\u201d\n\n    \n    [al-An \u2018aam 6:57].\n\n    End \n    quote.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    Many \n    people think that the word democracy means freedom! But this is incorrect \n    because freedom is one of the by-products of democracy. What we mean by \n    freedom here is freedom of belief, freedom of decadence, and freedom of \n    expression, and these also have many negative impacts on Muslim societies, \n    because matters have gone so far that aspersions are cast upon the \n    Messengers and the messages, and upon the Qur\u2019an and the Sahaabah, on the \n    grounds of freedom of opinion; and wanton display and uncovering are \n    tolerated, and indecent images and movies are propagated on the grounds of \n    freedom. Many such things are happening, of which there is a long list, all \n    of which are playing a part in the corruption of the ummah, morally and \n    spiritually.\u00a0\n\n    Even \n    that freedom for which countries are calling by means of democratic systems \n    is not absolute. We see whims and desires, and vested interests, behind the \n    limitations on those freedoms. At the time when their systems tolerate \n    aspersions upon the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) and the Qur\u2019an, on the grounds of freedom of expression, we find that \n    this freedom is denied when speaking about matters such as the \u201cNazi \n    Holocaust of the Jews\u201d! In fact anyone who denies this Holocaust is treated \n    as a criminal and put in prison, even though it is a historical matter that \n    may be denied.\u00a0\n\n    If \n    these people really are promoting freedom, then why do they not let the \n    Muslim peoples choose their own path and religion? Why did they colonize \n    their lands and play a role in changing their religion and beliefs? What do \n    these freedoms have to do with Italy\u2019s slaughter of the Libyan people, or \n    with France's slaughter of the Algerian people, or with Britain\u2019s slaughter \n    of the Egyptian people, or with America\u2019s slaughter of the Afghan and Iraqi \n    peoples?\u00a0\n\n    \n    According to those who promote it, freedom may be subject to several \n    restrictions, including the following:\u00a0\n\n    1.\n    \n    The law. Man does not have absolute freedom to drive in the \n    opposite direction to traffic in the street, or to open a shop without a \n    license, and if he says \u201cI am free,\u201d no one will pay any attention to him.\n\n    2.\n    \n    Custom. A woman in their countries \u2013 for example \u2013 cannot go \n    to offer condolences to the bereaved wearing a bathing suit. If she says \u201cI \n    am free\u201d, the people will look down on her and throw her out, because it is \n    contrary to custom.\n\n    3.\n    \n    Public taste. One of them \u2013 for example \u2013 cannot eat and pass \n    wind in front of people, or even burp! The people will look down on him even \n    if he says, \u201cI am free.\u201d\n\n    \n    Furthermore, we say:\u00a0\n\n    Why \n    shouldn\u2019t our religion restrict our freedom, as their freedom is restricted \n    by things that they cannot deny? Undoubtedly what is taught by Islam is that \n    which is in people\u2019s best interests. If a woman is forbidden to make a \n    wanton display, or if the people are forbidden to drink alcohol and eat \n    pork, and so on, all of that is in their best interests, physically and \n    mentally, and for their general welfare. But they refused to restrict their \n    freedom if the injunction comes from religion, but they say \u201cwe hear and we \n    obey\u201d if it comes from human beings like them or from a (man-made) law.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    Some \n    people think that the word democracy is equivalent to shoora (consultation) \n    in Islam! This is a mistaken notion for many reasons, including the \n    following:\u00a0\n\n    1.\n    \n    Shoora has to do with new matters that arise or with matters \n    that are not explained in detail in the texts of the Qur\u2019an or Sunnah. With \n    regard to the \u201crule of the people\u201d, the people may discuss what is \n    well-established in religion, which may lead to refusing to acknowldge the \n    prohibitions on that which is forbidden, and to forbidding that which Allah \n    has permitted or made obligatory. So the sale of alcohol is permitted \n    according to these laws, as are fornication/adultery and riba (usury), but \n    these laws put pressures on Islamic organizations and the activities of \n    those who call people to Allah. This is diametrically opposed to sharee\u2018ah, \n    so what does this have to do with shoora?\n\n    2.\n    \n    The majlis ash-shoora (consultative committee) is to be \n    formed of people who have a deep knowledge of fiqh, Islam and sharee\u2018ah, \n    fahm, and have a high level of piety and good character. So no one who is of \n    bad character or foolish, or is a disbeliever or atheist, is to be consulted \n    or involved in the shoora process. As for the democratic councils of \n    representatives, they pay no attention to any of the con ditions mentioned \n    above. The representative may be a disbeliever, or of bad character or \n    foolish. What does this have to do with shoora as prescribed in Islam?\n    \n\n    3.\n    \n    Shoora is not binding upon the ruler; the ruler may give \n    precedence to the view of one member of the council that is supported by \n    proof, and prefer his view over that of the other council members, whereas \n    in the case of representative democracy, the agreement of the majority \n    becomes legally binding upon the people.\n\n    Once \n    this is known, then what the Muslims must do is be proud of their religion \n    and trust that the rulings of the Lord are best for them in this world and \n    in the Hereafter, and they should disavow systems that go against the laws \n    of Allah.\u00a0\n\n    What \n    all other Muslims must do \u2013 rulers and ruled alike \u2013 is adhere to the laws \n    of Allah, may He be exalted, in all their affairs. It is not permissible for \n    anyone to follow a system or methodology other than Islam. One of the \n    indications of their acceptance of Allah as their Lord, Islam as their \n    religion, and Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as their \n    Prophet and Messenger, is that the Muslims adhere to Islam outwardly and \n    inwardly; they respect the laws of Allah and follow the Sunnah of the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\u00a0\n\n    We \n    ask Allah to honour us with Islam and to cause the plots of the traitors to \n    fail.\u00a0\n\n    And \n    Allah knows best."

        "question": "There is nothing wrong with reporting criminals, even in an non-Muslim country",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Naasir al-Barraak (may Allah preserve him) and he answered as follows:\u00a0\nDealing in hashish is an evil action according to all Islamic and rational standards. Hence it is prescribed to report such crimes, as it is also prescribed to report criminals such as murderers, thieves and rapists, so long as we are certain that dealing in hashish is an evil and harmful action.\u00a0\nIf the one who is dealing in hashish is a Muslim, then he is spreading corruption in the land and is also harming himself, because he is the one who is giving the disbelievers a reason to pursue him and pass judgement against him according to laws other than Islamic sharee\u2018ah and to subject him to a punishment other than that which Allah has revealed. As for reporting him, that comes under the heading of combatting evil and corruption.\u00a0\nI have no doubts whatsoever concerning this matter.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Oath of allegiance (bay\u2018ah) of \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with them both)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe swearing of allegiance (bay\u2018ah) by \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) [to Abu Bakr] is proven in as-Saheehayn (al-Bukhaari and Muslim), even though it happened a few months late.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that her father Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) entered upon \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) after he requested a meeting with him:\n\u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib recited the Tashahhud, then he said: O Abu Bakr, we acknowledge your virtue and what Allah has given you. We do not envy you for any favour that Allah has bestowed upon you, but you did it without consulting us and we thought that we had the right (to be consulted) because of our kinship with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He kept speaking to Abu Bakr until Abu Bakr\u2019s eyes filled with tears. When Abu Bakr spoke, he said: By the One in Whose hand is my soul, kinship with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is dearer to me than kinship with my own people. As for this dispute that occurred between me and you concerning these properties, I have not deviated from the right path with regard to them, and I have not given up something that I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do with them, rather I have done it too.\n\u2018Ali said to Abu Bakr: Your appointment for my oath of allegiance is this afternoon. When Abu Bakr had prayed Zuhr, he ascended the minbar and recited the tashahhud, and he spoke of \u2018Ali and his delay in swearing allegiance, and the excuse that he had given, then he prayed for his forgiveness. And \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib recited the tashahhud and spoke highly of Abu Bakr, and said that what he had done was not due to jealousy of Abu Bakr, or a refusal to accept the favour that Allah had bestowed upon him, but we thought that we should have had a share in the matter, but it had been decided without consulting us, and we were upset with that. The Muslims were pleased with this and said: You have done the right thing. Then the Muslims became closer to \u2018Ali, when he did the right thing.\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (3998) and Muslim (1759).\u00a0\nAccording to another version narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh:\nThen \u2018Ali stood up and spoke highly of Abu Bakr, and he mentioned his virtue and the fact that he had been one of the first to enter Islam. Then he went to Abu Bakr and swore allegiance to him, and the people came to \u2018Ali and said: You have done the right thing, you have done well. And the people became close to \u2018Ali when he did the right thing.\u00a0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nWith regard to \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) delaying swearing of allegiance (to Abu Bakr), \u2018Ali mentioned it in this hadith and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) apologised to him.\u00a0\u00a0\nMoreover, this delay on \u2018Ali\u2019s part did not undermine the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr and it did not undermine \u2018Ali himself.\u00a0\nWith regard to swearing allegiance, the scholars are unanimously agreed that for an oath of allegiance to be valid, it is not essential that all the people, or even all the decision-makers and prominent people, should swear allegiance. Rather there should be a group of scholars, leaders and prominent figures who do so.\u00a0\nWith regard to it not undermining \u2018Ali or his character, that is because it was not essential for everyone to come to the leader, put his hand in his and swear allegiance to him; rather once the decision-makers and prominent figures have sworn allegiance to the leader, the individual is required to accept his leadership, not show dissent and not rebel against him.\u00a0\nThat was the case with \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) during that period, before he swore allegiance, because he did not show dissent towards Abu Bakr or rebel against him. But he was held back from coming to him for the reason mentioned in the hadith. In order for swearing allegiance to be valid and proper, that did not depend on him being present, and neither he nor anyone else was required to attend for that purpose. As it was not required, he did not come.\u00a0\nNothing has been narrated from him to suggest that he thought that the oath of allegiance was not valid, and he never expressed any objection (to Abu Bakr being appointed caliph). However he did have some misgivings in his mind, hence his coming was delayed until that matter had been dealt with.\u00a0\nThe reason for his misgivings was that, because of his high status and the fact that he himself was a person of virtue in all aspects, and was closely related to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and so on, he thought that no decision should be made without him being consulted and being present. But the excuse given by Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar and the rest of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them all) was quite clear: it was because they thought that hastening to swear allegiance was in the greater interest of the Muslims, and they were afraid that if they delayed it, that could lead to problems and disputes that would in turn lead to serious negative consequences. Therefore they delayed burying the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) until they had sworn allegiance, because that was the most important matter, so as to ensure that no dispute would arise concerning his burial, shrouding, ghusl, funeral prayer and so on, without having anyone who could have the final say on such matters. Hence they thought that giving precedence to swearing allegiance was the most important issue at that time. End quote.\u00a0\nSharh Muslim (12/77-78)\u00a0\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIt was as if they excused him for not coming to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr whilst Faatimah was still alive, because he was preoccupied with caring for her during her illness, and consoling her for the grief she felt at the loss of her father (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Moreover, when she got upset with Abu Bakr\u2019s response when she asked him about inheritance, \u2018Ali decided to go along with her in keeping away from him.\nEnd quite. Fath al-Baari (7/494)\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThere is also a report which says that \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) swore allegiance to Abu Bakr at the very beginning, and he did not delay doing so, but there is some doubt as to whether the report which mentions that can be confirmed.\nThe hadith was narrated via Wuhayb ibn Khaalid, from Dawood ibn Abi Hind, from Abu Nadrah, from Abu Sa\u2018eed.\u00a0\nThe hadith was taken from Wuhayb ibn Khaalid by four of his companions, three of whom narrated a brief version which does not mention \u2018Ali and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) at the beginning of his caliphate. These three are:\u00a0\n1.\u2018Affaan ibn Muslim\nas we shall see the report narrated from him, and we will explain that anyone who narrated from \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim concerning the issue of the oath of allegiance ( bay\u2018ah) was mistaken\u00a0\n2.Abu Dawood at-Tayaalisi in al-Musnad (1/495, no. 603)\nAnd it was narrated via him by Ibn \u2018Asaakir in Tareekh Dimashq (19/314)\u00a0\n3.Zuhayr ibn Ishaaq\nwho is a da\u2018eef narrator, as it says in Mizaan al-I\u2018tidaal (2/82). He narrated it via Ibn \u2018Adiyy in al-Kaamil (3/223) and said: I do not know that anyone narrated it from Dawood apart from Zuhayr ibn Ishaaq and Wuhayb. Zuhayr has some strong hadiths, and the one who narrated the most from him among the Basris was Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr al-Maqdimi. I hope that there is nothing wrong with him. Ibn Ma\u2018een only objected to him for an interrupted hadith, as I have mentioned. As for his hadiths that have isnaads, most of them are sound. End quote.\u00a0\nAs for the fourth narrator from Wuhayb ibn Khaalid, he narrated a lengthy version which mentions \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them all).\nThis narrator was al-Mugheerah ibn Salamah Abu Hishaam al-Makhzoomi, who was trustworthy, as it says in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (10/261). Imam al-Bayhaqi narrated it from him in as-Sunan al-Kubra (8/143) and said:\u00a0\nAbu\u2019l-Hasan \u2018Ali ibn Muhammad ibn \u2018Ali al-Haafiz al-Isfaraa\u2019eeni said:\u00a0 Abu \u2018Ali al-Husayn ibn \u2018Ali al-Haafiz told us: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ishaaq ibn Khuzaymah and Ibraaheem ibn Abi Taalib informed us: Bandaar ibn Bashaar told us: Abu Hishaam al-Makhzoomi told us: Wuhayb told us: and he mentioned a similar report.\u00a0\nAbu \u2018Ali al-Haafiz said: I heard Muhammad ibn Ishaaq ibn Khuzaymah say:\u00a0\nMuslim ibn al-Hajjaaj came to me and asked me about this hadith, and I wrote it for him in a document, and read it to him, and he said: This hadith is worth a camel. I said: Worth a camel? It is worth a pearl the size of the full moon! End quote.\u00a0\nThe words \u201cand he mentioned a similar report\u201d refer to the report which mentions the oath of allegiance, as was clearly stated in the report of Ibn \u2018Asaakir in Tareekh Dimashq (30/277), via Imam al-Bayhaqi himself.\u00a0\nImam adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after quoting the report which mentions the oath of allegiance:\nAlthough its isnaad is good, it contains some objectionable matters, so think about it. End quote.\u00a0\nAl-Muhadhdhab (6/3239)\u00a0\nWith regard to the difference of opinion concerning \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim, there follow some details concerning this matter:\u00a0\nThe difference of opinion concerning \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim was due to two reasons:\u00a0\n-1-\nthe first reason was that it was narrated by senior imams who had learned the brief version of the report from \u2018Affaan, in which there is no mention of \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them all). The wording of this report is as follows:\u00a0\nWhen the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, the spokesmen of the Ansaar stood up and some of them said: O Muhaajireen, when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent a man from among you, he would pair him with a man from among us, so we think that two men should take charge of this matter, one man from among you and one man from among us.\u00a0\nZayd ibn Thaabit stood up and said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was one of the Muhaajireen, and we were the helpers of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). So the leader should only be from among the Muhaajireen, and we will be his helpers as we were the helpers of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)).\u00a0\nAbu Bakr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: May Allah reward you with good, O Ansaar, and may He keep your spokesman steadfast. By Allah, if you had said something other than this, we would not have accepted it from you.\u00a0\nNarrated from him by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (7/430)\u00a0\nAnd by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (35/489) \u2013 Mu\u2019sasat ar-Risaalah edn.\u00a0\nAnd by Ibn Sa \u2018d in at-Tabaqaat (3/212)\u00a0\nAnd by al-Balaadhuri in Ansaab al-Ashraaf (3/318)\u00a0\nAhmad ibn al-Qaasim ibn al-Musaawir al-Jawaahiri, as narrated by at-Tabaraani in al-Mu\u2018jam al-Kabeer (5/114)\u00a0\nJa\u2018far as-Saayigh, as narrated by Ibn \u2018Adiyy in al-Kaamil (3/223). He said: \u2018Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Marwaan narrated it to us: Abu\u2019s-Saqr al-Warraaq, who is Yahya ibn Dawood al-Baghdaadi, narrated it to us, and Muhammad ibn Muneer ibn Sagheer told us: Ja\u2018far as-Saayigh told us: \u2018Affaan told us.\u00a0\nAdh-Dhahabi said concerning this report:\u00a0\nThis is a saheeh isnaad. End quote.\u00a0\nSiyar A\u2018laam an-Nubala\u2019 (2/433)\u00a0\nAl-Haythami said concerning this report:\u00a0\nIt was narrated by at-Tabaraani and Ahmad, and its men are the men of as-Saheeh. End quote.\u00a0\nMajma\u2018 az-Zawaa\u2019id (5/183)\u00a0\n-2-\nthe second reason is that it was narrated by one of the companions of \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim, who narrated the longer report which mentions \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with them all). The wording is as follows:\u00a0\nWhen the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, the spokesmen of the Ansaar stood up and one of them said: O Muhaajireen, when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed a man from among you, he would pair him with a man from among us, so we think that two men should take charge of this matter, one of them from among you and the other from among us.\u00a0\nAnd the spokesman of the Ansaar began to speak, one after another, along the same lines.\u00a0\nThen Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allah be pleased with him) stood up and said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was one of the Muhaajireen; the leader should only be from among the Muhaajireen, and we will be his helpers as we were the helpers of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\u00a0\nAbu Bakr (may Allah have mercy on him) stood up and said: May Allah reward you with good, O Ansaar, and may He keep your spokesman steadfast. Then he said: If you had done something other than this, we would not have accepted it from you.\u00a0\nThen Zayd ibn Thaabit took Abu Bakr\u2019s hand and said: This is your leader, so swear allegiance to him; so they began to swear allegiance to him.\u00a0\nWhen Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) sat on the minbar, he looked at the faces of the people, and he did not see \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), so he asked about him, and some of the Ansaar got up and brought him. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: O son of the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his son-in-law, do you want to cause division among the Muslims?\u00a0\n\u2018Ali said: Not at all, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. And he swore allegiance to him.\u00a0\nThen he did not see az-Zubayr ibn al-\u2018Awwaam (may Allah be pleased with him), so he asked about him and they brought him, and he said: O son of the paternal aunt of the Messenger of Allah and his disciple, do you want to cause division among the Muslims? He said the same as \u2018Ali had said: Not at all, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. And they both swore allegiance to him.\u00a0\nNarrated by Ja\u2018far ibn Muhammad ibn Shaakir from \u2018Affaan in this lengthy version. It was also narrated thus by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak (3/80), and from him and from his shaykh Abu Muhammad al-Muqri\u2019, by al-Bayhaqi in as-Sunan al-Kubra (8/143). Al-Haakim said: This hadith is saheeh according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, although they did not narrate it. End quote. Adh-Dhahabi did not say anything about it in at-Talkhees.\u00a0\nAlthough Ja\u2018far ibn Muhammad ibn Shaakir was classed as thiqah (trustworthy) by al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi, Ibn Manaadi and Maslamah ibn Qaasim \u2013 as it says in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (2/102) \u2013 he differed from the senior imams who had memorised the hadith of \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim better than he did. The correct version of the hadith from \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim is the shorter version, in which there is no mention of \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) at that time.\u00a0\nSa\u2018d ibn Iyaas al-Jareeri followed Dawood ibn Abi Hind in narrating from Abu Nadrah, and his version mentions \u2018Ali and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them all), as it says in Tareekh Dimashq (30/278). But its isnaad includes \u2018Ali ibn \u2018Aasim ibn Suhayb al-Waasiti, who made a lot of mistakes in narration. \u2018Ali ibn al-Madeeni said concerning him: \u2018Ali ibn \u2018Aasim made a lot of mistakes, but if he made a mistake and someone pointed it out, he would not repeat it. This was the verdict of all the critics concerning him.\nEnd quote from Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (7/348)\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nConclusion: the oath of allegiance of \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) which is proven is that which is mentioned in the Saheehs of al-Bukhaari and Muslim. As for the earlier oath of allegiance which is mentioned in the hadith of Abu Sa\u2018eed al-Khudri, there is some doubt as to whether it is proven.\u00a0\nWith regard to the claim of the Raafidi liars, that the oath of allegiance given by \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) was sworn under compulsion, this is a false and fabricated claim that stems from obvious stubbornness and wilful blindness to the facts narrated with sound isnaads. If someone is like this, you cannot debate with him, because he is ignoring all rational, logical principles that you should both agree on as a reference point. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cand turn away from the ignorant\u201d [al-A \u2018raaf 7:199]. And Allah knows best.\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIt is known from mutawaatir reports that no one refrained from swearing allegiance to him \u2013 namely Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) \u2013 except Sa\u2018d ibn \u2018Ubaadah. As for \u2018Ali and Banu Haashim, all of them swore allegiance to him, according to scholarly consensus, and none of them died without having sworn allegiance to him. However it was said that \u2018Ali delayed his oath of allegiance for six months; it was also said that in fact he swore allegiance to him on the second day. Whatever the case, they swore allegiance to him without being forced to do so. End quote.\u00a0\nMinhaaj as-Sunnah (8/232)\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

The soundest of its chains of narration is the mursal chain of \n    \u2018Abdullah ibn Buraydah, but the fact that it is widespread and mentioned in \n    the books of the leading scholars of the Muslims and those who are most well \n    versed in history and biography, along with the fact that it has been \n    transmitted through numerous chains of narration, indicate that it has some \n    solid basis.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    From \n    the fiqhi point of view, this story comes under the heading of giving \n    precedence to the public interest over private interests; allowing \n    undermining of a personal interest for the purpose of protecting the public \n    interest is a must in general terms.\u00a0\n\n    Badr \n    ad-Deen az-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Manthoor \n    fi\u2019l-Qawaa\u2018id al-Fiqhiyyah (1/348-349):\u00a0\n\n    Ibn \n    \u2018Abd as-Salaam said: They were unanimously agreed that the greater evil may \n    be warded off by means of the lesser. Ibn Daqeeq al-\u2018Eid said: One of the \n    holistic general principles is that the greater of two evils may be warded \n    off by allowing the lesser, if there is no option but to allow one of them \n    to occur, and that the greater of two interests may be served by foregoing \n    the lesser, if only one option is inevitable. I mean: this is a general \n    rule, but it is not absolute and is not applicable in all cases.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Shaykh \u2018Izz ad-Deen said: \n\n    If \n    there is a conflict between two interests, the greater interest is to be \n    attained by foregoing the lesser.\u00a0\n\n    As-Sarkhasi \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mabsoot (9/45):\u00a0\n\n    If it \n    is proven (in a story) that a person was banished, then this is by way of \n    achieving a purpose and interest, not by way of applying a hadd punishment. \n    The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) banished \n    the effeminate man from Madinah, and \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) \n    banished Nasr ibn Hajjaaj from Madinah when he heard a woman saying: \u201cIs \n    there a way to get some wine to drink, and is there a way to be with Nasr \n    bin Hajjaj?\u201d So he banished him, although good looks do not dictate that one \n    should be banished; rather he did that in the public interest. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Aloosi \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The \n    ruler may banish someone in the public interest, as he sees fit, as it was \n    soundly narrated that \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) \n    banished Nasr ibn Hajjaaj to Basra because of his good looks, as some of the \n    women were tempted by him.\n\n    End \n    quote from Tafseer al-Aloosi (9/280).\u00a0\n\n    If it \n    is said: The women of Basra would be tempted by him after he moved there, so \n    what should we do? We have only transferred the problem from one place to \n    another, and we have not dealt with the root of the problem! The answer is:\u00a0\n\n    \n    Firstly: banishing him from his homeland and exiling him in a way that looks \n    like a punishment would cause the motive of fitnah (temptation) in his heart \n    andin the heart of others to be weakened, and it will teach the people to \n    resist whims and desires, and will serve as a condemnation of immorality. If \n    the people at the time of \u2018Umar \u2013 whom the Shaytaan feared and was afraid of \n    encountering him \u2013 realised that this man was only banished because of fear \n    of fitnah, they would take precautions and be on guard against being tempted \n    by him. So it is as if it was said to the people of Basra: I have banished \n    this man to your land so that he will not be resident in the same city as \n    me, so beware of being tempted by him.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Secondly: the one who is in exile is a stranger and is not like a resident, \n    for he is in a strange land where he will be distracted by his own affairs \n    or by working and earning a living, which will keep him away from the life \n    of ease and luxury that he used to enjoy in his homeland, when he was among \n    his family and clan. This will reduce his good looks and distract him from \n    taking care of himself and of his appearance.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    \u2018Umar \n    ibn al-Khattaab banished Nasr ibn Hajjaaj from Madinah, from his homeland, \n    to Basra, when he heard women composing poetry expressing their infatuation \n    with him. Before that, he had issued orders that his hair be shaved off, so \n    as to reduce his good looks by which the women were tempted. But after that \n    he saw that he was one of the most handsome of people in terms of his \n    cheeks, and that upset him, so he banished him to Basra. This was not \n    because he had done anything wrong or committed some immoral deed for which \n    he was to be punished; but among the women there were some who were tempted \n    by him, so \u2018Umar issued orders that something be done to reduce his stunning \n    good looks. By moving him from his homeland, his ambition and physical \n    strength would be weakened, and he would feel that he was being punished. \n    This is by way of protective measures for fear of immorality and infatuation \n    before they take place; it was not by way of punishment.\n\n    End \n    quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (15/313).\u00a0\n\n    \n    Thirdly: the fact that this happened and was narrated, and people knew of \n    it, teaches the new generation to fight temptation and teaches people in \n    authority how to run people\u2019s affairs from a shar\u2018i point of view, and how \n    to give the public interest precedence over private interests. It also \n    demonstrates that the temptation of women is one of the greatest \n    temptations.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Fourthly: the sanctity of Madinah requires the banishment of anyone who is a \n    source of temptation to women; he should be made to leave and go to some \n    other land, out of respect for its sanctity.\u00a0\n\n    For \n    more information, please see the answer to question no. \n    \n    151671\n\n    And \n    Allah knows best."

        "question": "He was Muslim, then he went back to his country and apostatised, then he came back to a Muslim country; is he a mu\u2018aahad (non-Muslim living under Muslim protection)? How should we deal with him?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    If a person was a Muslim, then he apostatised from Islam and \n    became an atheist, he is an apostate, and there is no confusion about that. \n    The one who apostatises from Islam to another religion is not regarded as a \n    follower of that religion and does not come under the same rulings as \n    followers of that religion. Rather he is an apostate, like the atheist \n    mentioned above, and is to be treated as such. He is to be asked to repent \n    and come back to Islam; if he repents and comes back (all well and good), \n    otherwise he is to be executed because of his disbelief (kufr).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    If anyone apostatises and becomes a Jew or a Christian, we do \n    not accept that, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cWhoever changes his religion, execute him.\u201d Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari (2854). In other words: whoever changes from being a Muslim, we \n    should execute him.\u00a0\n\n    Ash-Sharh al-Mumti\u2018 \u2018ala Zaad al-Mustaqni\u2018, \n    11/306\u00a0\n\n    Based on that, if a person was Muslim then he became a \n    Christian or a Jew, meat slaughtered by him is not permissible because he is \n    not a kitaabi (one of the People of the Book); rather he is an apostate \n    whose meat cannot be eaten. If such a person is a woman, it is not \n    permissible to marry her, for the same reason. These people cannot be dhimmi \n    or mu\u2018aahad or musta\u2019man (one who is granted protection and security by the \n    Muslims), because these statuses can only be granted to one who was \n    originally a kaafir, not to an apostate. The one who apostatised from Islam \n    has no choice but to return to his religion or to be executed as a kaafir, \n    if he persists in his apostasy.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said:\u00a0\n\n    In shar\u2018i terminology, the apostate (murtadd) is the \n    one who disbelieved willingly after having been a Muslim, by words, beliefs, \n    doubts or actions.\u00a0\n\n    There are rulings concerning the apostate in this world and \n    in the hereafter.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to this world, it was explained by the Messenger \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who said: \u201cWhoever changes his \n    religion, execute him.\u201d The scholars are unanimously agreed on that and on \n    what results from it of his wife being separated from him and his being \n    prevented from disposing of his wealth before he is executed.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the hereafter, that is stated by Allah, may He \n    be exalted, in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd whosoever \n    of you turns back from his religion and dies as a disbeliever, then his \n    deeds will be lost in this life and in the Hereafter, and they will be the \n    dwellers of the Fire. They will abide therein forever\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:217]. \n    Apostasy occurs when one commits any of the actions that nullify Islam, \n    whether that is done in earnest or in jest or in mockery. Allah, may He be \n    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cIf you ask them (about \n    this), they declare: \"We were only talking idly and joking. Say: Was it at \n    Allah ( ), and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, \n    revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (SAW) that you were mocking? Make no \n    excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed\u201d [at-Tawbah 9:65].\u00a0\n\n    Al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi, 2/565, \n    566\u00a0\n\n    See also the answer to question no.\n    20060 for further information.\u00a0\n\n    We should point out that the hadd punishment for apostasy \u2013 \n    like all other hadd punishments \u2013 cannot be carried out except by the caliph \n    or his deputy, according to scholarly consensus. It is not permissible for \n    individuals to carry out the hadd punishments themselves.\u00a0\n\n    We have discussed this in the answers to questions no.\n    107105,\n    12461 and\n    8980.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the way he should be dealt with, that is the \n    same as any other disbeliever: he should be called to Islam with kindness, \n    reminding him of his past when he was a Muslim, and that he must inevitably \n    feel the difference between his life in Islam and his life outside of it. \n    Help may be sought in doing that from those who know his language and come \n    from his country, so that it will be easier for him to understand. Giving \n    gifts also has a good impact on people\u2019s hearts, so give him things that he \n    needs, by means of which you will be able to reach his heart. If he has some \n    difficulties in some worldly matters you can help him with them and make \n    things easier for him. All of that will make him think again about what he \n    has done, and perhaps he will come back to Islam before he dies, and that \n    will be recorded among your good deeds.\u00a0\n\n    All of that has to do with interacting with him. With regard \n    to the ruling, we have stated above that he is not like one who was \n    originally a kaafir. It is not permissible for a Muslim to inherit from an \n    apostate or for him to inherit from a Muslim, and the apostate woman cannot \n    marry a Muslim. If a Muslim woman is married to the apostate, her marriage \n    contract is rendered invalid. And there are other rulings. But we should \n    differentiate between the rulings and how we treat the individual.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is it permissible for ordinary people to label as a kaafir one who reviles Islam, without referring to the scholars concerning that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    There is no doubt that reviling Allah, may He be exalted \u2013 \n    Allah forbid \u2013 or reviling His Messenger or His religion \u2013 Allah forbid \u2013 \n    comes under the heading of disbelief in Allah the Almighty. The one who does \n    that has committed major kufr that puts one beyond the pale of Islam. If he \n    dies in that state without having repented from it, then he will be one of \n    the people of Hell who will abide therein for all eternity.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The scholars are unanimously and definitively agreed that if \n    a Muslim reviles Islam, or criticises it, or he reviles the Messenger \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or criticises or mocks him, then \n    he is an apostate and a kaafir and it is permissible to sentence him to \n    death and seize his wealth.\n\n    End quote from Fataawa Noor \u2018ala ad-Darb by Ibn Baaz, \n    p. 139\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\n\n    What is the ruling on one who reviles Allah and His Religion? \n    What is the expiation for that? Please note that the man concerned is \n    married; does his wife become haraam for him or is she divorced?\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\n\n    There is no doubt that this is apostasy from Islam and \n    disbelief in Allah for which the person who does it deserves to be sentenced \n    to death unless he repents; his wife is divorced from him and his ties of \n    kinship with his relatives are severed, so he does not inherit from them and \n    they do not inherit from him. But if he repents, regrets it, prays for \n    forgiveness and acknowledges his mistake, Allah will accept his repentance \n    and he can take his wife back if her \u2018iddah has not ended; if it has ended \n    then it is up to her, and it is not permissible for him to take her back \n    except with her consent.\n\n    End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/533\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    If a person hears someone clearly reviling Allah, or shar\u2018i \n    proof is established to that effect, then there is nothing wrong with him \n    believing that this person is a kaafir. This is the most abhorrent and \n    serious kind of reviling, and no one does that except one who has gone far \n    astray and has no respect for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, or one \n    who has lost his mind and does not know what he is saying.\u00a0\n\n    This kind of reviling is not one of the obscure issues that \n    need a ruling from the scholars or need to be subjected to examination; \n    rather it is something very clear and obvious that can be recognised by \n    ignorant and knowledgeable alike, and old and young will be disgusted by \n    it.\u00a0\n\n    But at the same time it is essential to bear in mind the \n    shar\u2018i purpose behind denouncing that and regarding it as repugnant, which \n    is to remove and ward off that evil and to strive to make the one who said \n    it repent and come back to his Lord, even if he has apostatised and gone \n    beyond the pale of Islam. Asking the apostate to repent is something that is \n    well known and well established. So efforts should be made to exhort him in \n    a manner that is appropriate to his situation, explaining the abhorrent \n    nature of what he has done and to discuss with him the shar\u2018i way that is \n    appropriate to his situation.\u00a0\n\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee said:\u00a0\n\n    Reviling Islam \u2013 Allah forbid \u2013 is kufr according to the \n    texts and scholarly consensus. Allah, may He be exalted, said \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cWas it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, \n    lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (SAW) that you were \n    mocking?\n\n    Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had \n    believed\u201d\n\n    [at-Tawbah 9:65].\n\n    And there are other similar texts.\u00a0\n\n    It is essential to advise him and denounce him for that; if \n    he responds, praise be to Allah, otherwise it is not permissible to initiate \n    the greeting of salaam with one who has reviled Islam, or to return his \n    greeting if he initiates the greeting; it is not permissible to accept his \n    invitation and he must be shunned completely until he repents or until the \n    ruling of Allah, which is to be sentenced to death, is carried out on him by \n    the authorities, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cWhoever changes his religion, execute him.\u201d Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, 3017.\n\n    End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa\u2019imah, 2/12\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n    If a person repents from any sin, even if that was reviling \n    Islam, his repentance will be accepted, if he fulfils the conditions that we \n    have mentioned. However it should be noted that a word may constitute kufr \n    or apostasy, but the one who utters it does not (necessarily) become a \n    kaafir thereby, because of the presence of some factor that prevents him \n    being labelled as a kaafir. In the case of this man who said that he reviled \n    Islam in a moment of anger, we say to him: If your anger was so severe that \n    you did not know what you were saying, and you did not know whether you were \n    in the sky or on the ground, and you said something without thinking and not \n    knowing what you were saying, there is no ruling that is applicable to these \n    words and you are not to be labelled an apostate, because this is something \n    that was said involuntarily and without thinking, and if anything is said \n    involuntarily and without meaning to, Allah, may He be glorified and \n    exalted, will not bring one to account for it. Allah, may He be exalted, \n    says concerning vows (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAllah will not \n    call you to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths, but He \n    will call you to account for that which your hearts have earned\u201d [al-Baqarah \n    2:225].\n\n    End quote from Fataawa Noor \u2018ala ad-Darb, 24/2\u00a0\n\n    For more information on the guidelines on labelling anyone as \n    a kaafir, please see the answer to question no.\n    85102\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "How to Treat Non-Muslims",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islamic view of humanity\nThe Islamic view of humanity is filled with mercy and compassion, and it cannot be otherwise, because the Islamic religion is the last of the religions that were prescribed by Allah, may He be exalted, and He commanded all of mankind to enter this religion. He revealed this religion and sent it down to the most compassionate of mankind, Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is confirmed in the Book of Allah, where He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd We have sent you (O Muhammad) not but as a mercy for the \u2018Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).\u201d [al-Anbiya 21:107].\nHow to treat non-Muslims\u00a0\n1- With regard to that, there are commands in the Quran and Sunnah to the Muslims, instructing them to call people to affirm the Oneness of Allah (Tawhid ), and to offer their wealth, time and selves for that purpose.\u00a0\nThis is only out of compassion and mercy towards all people, so as to save them from worshipping people and calling them to worship the Lord of all people; to save them from the constraints of this world and bring them to the abundance of this world and the Hereafter. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cLet there be a group among you who call \u02f9others\u02fa to goodness, encourage what is good, and forbid what is evil\u2014it is they who will be successful.\u201d [Al `Imran 3:104]\n2- Showing kindness to parents even if they are non-Muslims and even if they (parents) were to try hard to keep their children away from Islam and tell them to associate others with Allah and to disbelieve. Concerning that Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years; give thanks to Me and to your parents, unto Me is the final destination.\nBut if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.\u201d [Luqman 31:14-15]\n2- Islam advises us to treat neighbours kindly , even if they are not Muslim. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cWorship Allah \u02f9alone\u02fa and associate none with Him. And be kind to parents, relatives, orphans, the poor, near and distant neighbours, close friends, \u02f9needy\u02fa travellers, and those \u02f9bondspeople\u02fa in your possession. Surely Allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful.\u201d (An-Nisa' 4:36)\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nI say: based on that, kind treatment of neighbours is enjoined and is recommended, whether they are Muslim or not. And this is the right thing to do. Kind treatment may be in the sense of helping or it may be in the sense of being kind, refraining from annoyance and standing by them. Al-Bukhari narrated from \u2018Aishah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cJibril kept urging me to treat neighbours kindly until I thought that he would make them heirs.\u201d And it was narrated from Abu Shurayh that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cBy Allah, he does not believe; by Allah, he does not believe; by Allah, he does not believe.\u201d It was said: O Messenger of Allah, who is that? He said: \u201cThe one whose neighbour is not safe from his annoyance.\u201d This is general in meaning and applies to all neighbours, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) affirmed that the neighbour should not be annoyed by swearing three times and stating that the one who annoys his neighbour is not a believer in the complete sense. So the believer should avoid annoying his neighbour and refrain from doing what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden; he should strive to do that which pleases Him and encourage others to do likewise.\n4- Ensuring justice and showing kindness to non-Muslims who are not fighting Muslims.\u00a0\nConcerning that Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAllah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.\u201d [al-Mumtahanah 60:8]\n\u201cIn other words, Allah does not forbid you to be kind, uphold ties, return favours and be fair towards the mushrikeen (polytheists), whether they are relatives and others, so long as they are not fighting you because of your religion or seeking to drive you out of your homes.\u00a0\nSo there is nothing wrong with you upholding ties with them, because upholding ties with them in this case does not involve anything that may lead to negative consequences.\u201d (Tafsir al-Sa'di, p. 856)\u00a0\n5- Islam prohibits killing non-Muslims living under Muslim rule.\nIt was narrated from \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever kills a mu\u2018ahid (a non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) will not smell the fragrance of Paradise, although its fragrance may be detected from a distance of forty years.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2995\n\u201cWhat is meant is one who has a deal with the Muslims, whether that is by paying jizyah or a peace treaty with the Muslim ruler or a guarantee of safety from a Muslim.\u201d (Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar, 12:259)\n6- Islam prohibits wronging a mu\u2018ahid, detracting from his rights, or burdening him with more work.\nThere is a hadith that speaks of that. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf anyone wrongs a mu\u2018ahid, detracts from his rights, burdens him with more work than he is able to do or takes something from him without his consent, I will plead for him (the mu\u2018ahid) on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3052; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawud.\n\u201cIf any non-Muslim come to our country for work or business, and has permission (from the authorities), he is either a mu\u2018ahid (one who has a treaty with the Muslims) or a mustamin (one who has been granted security by the Muslims). So it is not permissible to transgress against him. It is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever kills a mu\u2018ahid will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.\u201d We are Muslims who submit to the command of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and we respect those whom Islam instructs us to respect of those who have treaties and guarantees of security. Whoever transgresses against them has misrepresented Islam and has given Islam an image of terrorism, treachery and betrayal. The one who adheres to the rulings of Islam and respects treaties and covenants is one for whom it is hoped that he will do well and succeed.\u201d (Fatawa Ibn Uthaymin, 15:493)\n7- Islam prohibits committing transgression and commands justice.\nConcerning that Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cand let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from Al-Masjid al-Haram (at Makkah) lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part).\u201d [al-Maidah 5:2]\n\u201cand let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety.\u201d [al-Maidah 5:8].\n\u201cLook at what these verses contain of noble characteristics and the command to respond to the one who disobeys Allah concerning you by obeying Allah concerning him.\u201d (Adwa al-Bayan by Al-Shinqiti 3:50)\nFacts about Islam\nHowever, in addition to what has been stated above, it is essential to confirm some important points:\n1- There is no comparison whatsoever between what this world has seen the \u201cnon-Muslims\u201d do and what the Muslims have done. The two World Wars in which 70 million people were killed were \u201cChristian\u201d wars.\n2- Then there is the occupation of Muslim lands and the exploitation of their resources, which was and still is happening at the hands of \u201cnon-Muslims\u201d of all religions. This should be borne in mind when speaking of the Islamic view of humanity and of love and compassion. Fair-minded historians should compare the Islamic conquests of other lands with the Crusades, for example, and what happened in each case. They will see a clear difference between compassion and cruelty, love and hatred, life and death.\n3- What was mentioned above about Islam and how it regards non-Muslims, and what was mentioned about rulings is the highest level of love, compassion and mercy. However, that does not mean that we should neglect some rulings that some ignorant people want us to neglect.\nFor example:\n1- In Islam it is forbidden to love non-Muslims and take them as close (intimate) friends. Anyone who has common sense can distinguish between kindness, fairness, compassion and mercy, on the one hand, which we have been enjoined to show towards a non-Muslim who is not in a state of war with us, and love on the other hand, which we are not allowed to feel towards disbelievers because of their disbelief in Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and because of their not being Muslims.\n2- It is not permissible for us to give our daughters, sisters and other womenfolk in marriage to any non-Muslim, no matter what his religion is, whereas it is permissible for us (Muslim men) to marry only women from the People of the Book, Jews and Christians, who are chaste. Undoubtedly \u2018aqidah (belief) and tawhid (affirming the Oneness of Allah) play a major role in this ruling, because it is very likely and possible that a kitabi (Jewish or Christian) woman who is married to a Muslim may become Muslim, whereas it is very possible and likely that a Muslim woman may be tempted away from her religion by marrying a non-Muslim. This ruling is entirely in accordance with the compassion and mercy of the rulings of this great religion: it represents compassion towards the Jewish or Christian woman in the hope that she might become Muslim and towards the Muslim woman lest she leave her religion.\n3- It is not part of Islam to force the non-Muslim to enter this religion , because sincerity is one of the conditions of accepting Islam. And Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThere is no compulsion in religion.\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:256]\n4- Islam prescribes stoning for the married adulterer, cutting off the hand for the thief, and flogging for the one who slanders the honour of a woman who is chaste (all following due process, of course). We do not feel ashamed of these laws; rather we firmly believe that the whole world is in need of application of these laws. If they do that, they will live in an atmosphere of safety with regard to their honour, their wealth and their lives, safe from transgressions against them.\u00a0\nAny wise person who ponders these rulings will realise that they were prescribed, first of all, so that no one will dare to do these things. Anyone who looks at the state of other nations, and sees how widespread the crimes of rape, theft and murder are, will realise that there is an urgent need to put a stop to that, and that the rulings of Islam are based on wisdom, mercy, justice and care.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on democracy and elections and participating in that system",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nDemocracy is a man-made system, meaning rule by the people for the people. Thus it is contrary to Islam, because rule is for Allaah, the Most High, the Almighty, and it is not permissible to give legislative rights to any human being, no matter who he is.\u00a0\nIt says in Mawsoo\u2019at al-Adyaan wa\u2019l-Madhaahib al-Mu\u2019aasirah (2/1066, 1067):\u00a0\nUndoubtedly the democratic system is one of the modern forms of shirk, in terms of obedience and following, or legislation, as it denies the sovereignty of the Creator and His absolute right to issue laws, and ascribes that right to human beings. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cYou do not worship besides Him but only names which you have named (forged) \u2014 you and your fathers \u2014 for which Allaah has sent down no authority. The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism); that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not\u201d\n[Yoosuf 12:40]\u00a0\n\u201cThe decision is only for Allaah\u201d\n[al-An\u2019aam 6:57]\nEnd quote.\u00a0\nThis has been discussed in detail in the answer to question no.  98134.\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThe one who understands the true nature of the democratic system and the ruling thereon, then he nominates himself or someone else (for election) is approving of this system, and is working with it, is in grave danger, because the democratic system is contrary to Islam and approving of it and participating in it are actions that imply apostasy and being beyond the pale of Islam.\u00a0\nBut as for the one who nominates himself or nominates others in this system in order to join the parliament and enjoin good and forbid evil, and establish proof against them, and reduce its evil and\u00a0 corruption as much as he can, so that people of corruption and disbelievers in Allaah will not have free rein to spread mischief in the land and spoil people\u2019s worldly interests and religious commitment, this is a matter that is subject to ijtihaad, according to the interests that it is hoped will be served by that.\u00a0\nSome scholars are even of the view that getting involved in these elections is obligatory.\u00a0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on elections, and he replied: I think that elections are obligatory; we should appoint the one who we think is good, because if the good people abstain, who will take their place? Evil people will take their place, or neutral people in whom there is neither good nor evil, but they follow everyone who makes noise. So we have no choice but to choose those who we think are fit.\u00a0\nIf someone were to say: We chose someone but most of the parliament are not like that,\u00a0\nWe say: It does not matter. If Allaah blesses this one person and enables him to speak the truth in this parliament, he will undoubtedly have an effect. But what we need is to be sincere towards Allaah and the problem is that we rely too much on physical means and we do not listen to what Allaah says. So nominate the one who you think is good, and put your trust in Allaah. End quote. \u00a0\nFrom Liqaa\u2019aat al-Baab al-Maftooh, no. 210\u00a0\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:\u00a0\nIs it permissible to vote in elections and nominate people for them? Please note that our country is ruled according to something other than that which Allaah revealed?\u00a0\nThey replied:\u00a0\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim to nominate himself in the hope that he can become part of a system which rules according to something other than that which Allaah has revealed and operates according to something other than the sharee\u2019ah of Islam. It is not permissible for a Muslim to vote for him or for anyone else who will work in that government, unless the one who nominates himself or those who vote for him hope that by getting involved in that they will be able to change the system to one that operates according to the sharee\u2019ah of Islam, and they are using this as a means to overcome the system of government, provided that the one who nominates himself will not accept any position after being elected except one that does not go against Islamic sharee\u2019ah.

There are parties which call for Islamic rule, and there are others that do not want Islamic rule. What is the ruling on one who votes for something other than Islamic rule even though he prays?\u00a0\nThey replied:\u00a0\nThe Muslims in a country that is not governed according to Islamic sharee\u2019ah should do their utmost and strive as much as they can to bring about rule according to Islamic sharee\u2019ah, and they should unite in helping the party which is known will rule in accordance with Islamic sharee\u2019ah. As for supporting one who calls for non-implementation of Islamic sharee\u2019ah, that is not permissible, rather it may lead a person to kufr, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd so judge (you O Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) among them by what Allaah has revealed and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they turn you (O Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) far away from some of that which Allaah has sent down to you. And if they turn away, then know that Allaah\u2019s Will is to punish them for some sins of theirs. And truly, most of men are Faasiqoon (rebellious and disobedient to Allaah).\n50.\u00a0Do they then seek the judgement of (the days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith\u201d\n[al-Maa'idah 5:49-50].\nHence when Allaah stated that those who do not rule in accordance with Islamic sharee\u2019ah are guilty of kufr, He warned against helping them or taking them as allies or\u00a0 close\u00a0 friends, and He commanded the believers to fear Him if they were truly believers. He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO you who believe! Take not as Awliyaa\u2019 (protectors and helpers) those who take your religion as a mockery and fun from among those who received the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before you, and nor from among the disbelievers; and fear Allaah if you indeed are true believers\u201d\n[al-Maa\u2019idah 5:57]\nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength.

        "question": "Advice to the Muslims in Finland",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    We have read more about the country \u2013 Finland \u2013 in which you \n    are living; some of it saddened us, but other things made us happy.\u00a0 We are \n    saddened by the division that there is among you, and by the fact that many \n    neglect to call people to Allaah or pay attention to their families and \n    children. We are also saddened to learn that some Muslim women have married \n    Christian men in that country, as these are invalid marriages; and that many \n    people have failed to obey Allaah and adhere to His religion. All of that \n    makes the burden of the people of knowledge and goodness even greater, and \n    lays upon them a huge responsibility towards the Muslim community in that \n    European land.\u00a0\n\n    But what made us happy is the news that the number of Muslims \n    in that country is increasing, and the Muslim community is now one hundred \n    thousand strong, according to some reports, although we do not know how many \n    of them are Sunnis. And we are happy to learn that many of the people of \n    that country have entered the religion of Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    What we advise you, and we hope that our words will have a \n    good effect on your hearts and actions:\u00a0\n\n    1.\n\n    First and foremost, every Muslim should try to return to his \n    homeland, and those who have become Muslim should move to a Muslim country \n    where they can practise their religion safely. They should leave that \n    country where the religious commitment, minds and hearts of many Muslims \n    have been corrupted, whenever they are able to do so.\u00a0\n\n    2.\n\n    Those who cannot leave or who do not want to should fear \n    Allaah with regard to themselves and the members of their household; they \n    should advise them sincerely and take good care of them, and protect \n    themselves and their families from the Fire of Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    3.\n\n    You must strive to establish study circles for learning \n    Qur\u2019aan and (Islamic) knowledge, in which the ignorant may be taught and the \n    young Muslims (?) may learn to obey Allaah. It is not permissible for you to \n    be careless about this matter. We have read how the Tatars in Finland \n    preserved their language and culture; your Islam and Arabic language are \n    more important and you must take great care of them in your daily lives. \u00a0\n\n    4.\n\n    Try to invite scholars and seekers of knowledge to come to \n    you, so that they can undertake the duties of calling people to Islam, \n    exhorting, guiding and teaching. Such meetings will play a part in uniting \n    you and helping you adhere to the rulings of sharee\u2019ah which have to do with \n    the realities of your lives.\u00a0\n\n    5.\n\n    Do not leave any room for the devils among mankind and the \n    jinn to cause division in your ranks and spread disunity among you. You have \n    to be aware that you are living in a Christian society, a Christian country, \n    whose flag bears the cross! You have to remember that what happens between \n    Muslims who have differences is not like your differences with other \n    religions. The difference between Muslims who pray in the same direction \n    (ahl al-qiblah) is may be a difference between Sunnah and bid\u2019ah, and in \n    some cases it may be the difference between a correct view and a less \n    correct view, but the difference between you and the other religions is the \n    difference between Islam and kufr. These are two different issues. \u00a0\n\n    6.\n\n    With regard to this party that is trying to establish an \n    Islamic state in Finland, they should think on the basis of reason and not \n    emotion; they should look at reality and not turn a blind eye to it. You \n    cannot even bury a Muslim in a graveyard that is just for Muslims, so would \n    you be able to close liquor stores and establish an Islamic state there?!\u00a0\n\n    What is this, O slaves of Allaah?! This is imaginary dreams \n    and farfetched thinking, which may be excused in a man who does not know the \n    reality of where you live and does not know anything about the difficulties \n    that you face. But a man who sees what you see and knows what you know \n    should think soundly on the basis of fitrah, sharee\u2019ah and reason, and his \n    efforts should be aimed at achieving whatever he is most able to of the \n    Muslims\u2019 interests in your country, and warding off whatever evils, harm and \n    oppression he can.\u00a0\n\n    Based on that, if those people have an Islamic party, they \n    should invest their efforts in establishing Islamic institutions, schools, \n    Muslim graveyards, and stop thinking about establishing an Islamic state, \n    because in fact that is virtually impossible and is just an illusion, based \n    on what we have seen of the Muslims\u2019 inability to achieve that, even in \n    their own countries, so how can they do it in a non-Muslim country? Just \n    demanding an Islamic state will bring evil consequences such as only Allaah \n    knows, so how about if they took practical steps towards it? If the state is \n    unable to stop them \u2013 which is not the case \u2013 then let them imagine their \n    fate if the European Union were to get involved in stopping that. What would \n    be the fate of all the efforts that have been made for decades?\u00a0 We have \n    read about the situation of Muslim men and women in your country after \n    September 11th, so how about if the anti-Islam establishments \n    were to spread the idea that the Muslims only want to rule in order to apply \n    Islam and limit freedoms and oppress women? Yes, they are exaggerating and \n    lying, but we are giving them the ammunition that they are throwing in our \n    faces. \u00a0\n\n    7.\n\n    One of the priorities of that Islamic party should be to \n    preserve Islamic identity and strive to spread the message of Islam, free of \n    distortions; they should present it to the Muslims so as to bring them back \n    to commitment and righteousness, and you should prove to non-Muslims that \n    your religion is a religion of unity, brotherhood and cooperation in \n    righteousness and piety.\u00a0\n\n    8.\n\n    The Muslim brothers who are of that land should continue to \n    call people to Allaah among their families and relatives, and tell others of \n    the joy they have found by entering Islam. It seems that they will have more \n    impact on the people of that land than Muslims who have migrated from other \n    countries.\u00a0\n\n    9.\n\n    Strive to buy a piece of land as soon as possible to be used \n    for graves for Muslims who believe in Tawheed (the oneness of Allaah), and \n    try to move the Muslims who were buried with non-Muslims to these Islamic \n    graves.\u00a0\n\n    10.\n\n    It should be a priority of Islamic groups and political \n    parties, especially those that are trying to establish an Islamic state, as \n    we said, to preserve the identity of the Muslims who are living there. One \n    of the most important means of preserving their identity is for Muslim men \n    to marry Muslim women and to strive to create an Islamic atmosphere in their \n    social lives. In the Islamic parties and organizations there should be \n    people who direct the Muslims\u2019 private matters such as marriage, divorce and \n    social relationships in accordance with the laws of Allaah, without trying \n    to impose that on everyone in the Christian country which, as we have said, \n    is a very farfetched idea, the consequences of which will be bad for you.\u00a0\n\n    11.\n\n    We advise everyone to be gentle in calling people to Allaah \n    and to follow the way of the Prophets and Messengers and successful \n    daa\u2019iyahs. You should direct your da\u2019wah to leaders, politicians, decision \n    makers, journalists, writers and all classes of people. Perhaps Allaah will \n    guide one of them who will become very influential. And strive to remove \n    evils from the lives of Muslims in the way that is best.\u00a0\n\n    12.\n\n    You should always be in contact with your Muslim brothers in \n    Europe and in the Muslim world, so that you can consult them about your \n    affairs and ask the scholars about issues and problems that you are facing. \n    The Muslim is the mirror of his brother, and two brothers together are \n    stronger than one on his own.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "How the caliph of the Muslims is appointed",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The Muslim ruler must appoint people who are qualified to \n    hold positions of high office in the state, and he must also hold \n    consultations with people of knowledge and those who are specialized in \n    various fields. That should not be left to the common folk or the masses for \n    everyone to elect his relative or a member of his party, or to elect the one \n    who will pay the most.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Official positions that are lower than that of caliph or \n    ruler: Appointing people to these positions was the job of the caliph or \n    ruler. He had the authority to select for them people who were competent and \n    had integrity. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cVerily, \n    Allaah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom \n    they are due; and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice\u201d \n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:58]. This is addressed to rulers and those in authority. \n    Trusts (amaanaat) here refers to official positions and positions of \n    high office in the state, which Allaah made a trust that is entrusted to the \n    ruler. The way in which it is to be fulfilled is by choosing people who are \n    competent and have integrity, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) and the caliphs who came after him and the Muslim rulers \n    after them appointed to various positions those who were fit to hold those \n    positions and were able to fulfil these duties as prescribed in sharee\u2019ah.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to elections as they are known today in different \n    states, they are not part of the Islamic system and they may lead to \n    disorder and chaos and personal ambitions. They are subject to favouritism \n    and greed, and may lead to fitnah (tribulation) and bloodshed. They do not \n    achieve the purpose they are meant to achieve; rather they are more like \n    auctions, buying and selling, and false propaganda. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Jazeerah newspaper, issue no. \n    11358.\u00a0\n\n    The imam (ruler) or caliph was appointed to lead the Islamic \n    state by one of three methods:\u00a0\n\n    1-\n\n    He was chosen and elected by the decision makers (ahl al-hall \n    wa\u2019l-\u2018aqd). For example, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq became caliph when he was \n    elected by the decision makers, then the Sahaabah unanimously agreed with \n    that and swore allegiance to him, and accepted him as caliph.\u00a0\n\n    \u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) became \n    caliph in a similar manner, when \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) delegated the appointment of the caliph to come after him \n    to a shoora council of six of the senior Sahaabah, who were to elect one of \n    their number. \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan ibn \u2018Awf consulted the Muhaajireen and Ansaar, \n    and when he saw that the people were all inclined towards \u2018Uthmaan, he swore \n    allegiance to him first, then the rest of the six swore allegiance to him, \n    followed by the Muhaajireen and Ansaar, so he was elected as caliph by the \n    decision makers.\u00a0\n\n    \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) became \n    caliph in a similar manner, when he was elected by most of the decision \n    makers.\u00a0\n\n    2-\n\n    Appointment to the position by the previous caliph, when one \n    caliph passes on the position to a particular person who is to succeed him \n    after he dies. For example, \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab became caliph when the \n    position was passed on to him by Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased \n    with him).\u00a0\n\n    3-\n\n    By means of force and prevailing over others. When a man \n    becomes caliph by prevailing over the people by the sword, and he \n    establishes his authority and takes full control, then it becomes obligatory \n    to obey him and he becomes the leader of the Muslims. Examples of that \n    include some of the Umayyad and \u2018Abbasid caliphs, and those who came after \n    them. This method is contrary to sharee\u2019ah, because it is seized by force. \n    But because great interests are served by having a ruler who rules the \n    ummah, and because a great deal of mischief may result from chaos and loss \n    of security in the land, the one who seizes authority by means of the sword \n    should be obeyed if he seizes power by force but he rules in accordance with \n    the laws of Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    If a man rebels and seizes power, the people must obey him, \n    even if he seizes power by force and without their consent, because he has \n    seized power.\u00a0\n\n    The reason for that is that if his rule is contested, it will \n    lead to a great deal of evil, and this is what happened during the Umayyad \n    period when some of them seized power by means of force and gained the title \n    of caliph, and people obeyed them in obedience to the command of Allaah.

The same applies to individuals. \u00a0\nThe Fiqh Council has issued a statement on this issue: Participation of Muslims in elections with non-Muslims, the text of which is as follows:\u00a0\nalone, and blessings and peace be upon the one after whom there is no Prophet, our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and companions.\u00a0\nThe Islamic Fiqh Council in its nineteenth session, which was held in the headquarters of the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah between 22 and 27 Shawwaal 1428 AH (3 to 8 November 2007 CE) has examined the issue of \u201cParticipation of Muslims in elections with non-Muslims in non-Muslim countries.\u201d This is one of the topics on which discussion was deferred in the sixteenth conference which was held between 21 and 26 Shawwaal 1422 AH in order that it may be examined more thoroughly.\u00a0\nAfter listening to the research that was presented and the discussions concerning it, the Council has determined the following:\u00a0\n1.\nMuslim participation in elections with non-Muslims in a non-Muslim country is one of the shar\u2019i political matters in which the ruling is determined in the light of weighing up the pros and cons, and fatwas concerning it differ according to time, place and circumstances.\u00a0\n2.\nit is permissible for a Muslim who enjoys the rights of citizenship in a non-Muslim country to take part in elections and the like because it is more likely that his participation will bring benefits such as presenting a true picture of Islam, defending Muslim issues in that country, supporting the rights of religious and other minorities, strengthening their role in circles of influence, and cooperating with reasonable, fair-minded people on a basis of truth and justice. That should be in accordance with the following guidelines:\u00a0\n(i)The Muslim participants should intend thereby to serve the interests of the Muslims and ward off evil and harm from them.\n(ii)The Muslim participants should think it most likely that their participation will have positive effects that will benefit the Muslims in that country, such as supporting their position, conveying their requests to the decision makers and those who are in charge of the country, and protecting their religious and worldly interests.\n(iii)The Muslim\u2019s participation in these elections should not lead to him neglecting his religious duties.\nAnd Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah send blessing and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.\u00a0\nhttp://www.themwl.org/Fatwa/default.aspx?d=1&cidi=167&l=AR&cid=17\nFor more information please see the answers to questions no. 3062 and 107166.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Is it permissible to swear allegiance to a kaafir ruler?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Allegiance (bay\u2019ah) is a pledge to obey. And it is a shar\u2019i \n    contract between the one who swears allegiance and the one to whom \n    allegiance is sworn, namely the ruler or caliph.\u00a0\n\n    Allegiance is sworn to a caliph after the decision makers (ahl \n    al-hill wa\u2019l-aqd) select him; they are the ones who meet the conditions \n    of being trustworthy and of sound opinion.\u00a0\n\n    In al-Mawsoo\u2019ah al-Fiqhiyyah (9/274) it says:\u00a0\n\n    Bay\u2019ah or allegiance, as defined by Ibn Khuldoon in his \n    Muqaddimah, means: a pledge to obey; it is as if the one who swears \n    allegiance is promising his ruler that he will accept his authority with \n    regard to his own affairs and the affairs of the Muslims, and he will not \n    dispute with him with regard to any of that, and he will obey him in any \n    duties that he assigns to him, whether at times of ease or at times of \n    hardship. When they swore allegiance to a ruler and made this pledge, they \n    would put their hands in his as confirmation of the pledge. That is akin to \n    what the seller and purchaser do, so bay\u2019ah or allegiance was accompanied by \n    a handshake. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    It also says (9/278):\u00a0\n\n    The selection by the decision makers of the ruler and their \n    swearing allegiance to him (bay\u2019ah) is the basis of his taking that \n    position. The decision makers (ahl al-hill wa\u2019l-\u2018aqd) are the scholars and \n    people of wisdom and high status, whose knowledge is accompanied by other \n    essential conditions: trustworthiness, good character and wisdom. End \n    quote.\u00a0\n\n    Just as there are conditions that must be met by the decision \n    makers, there are also conditions that must be met by the caliph to whom \n    allegiance is sworn. Some of these conditions are the subject of scholarly \n    disagreements, but on others there is consensus. Not one of the scholars \n    disagreed with the condition that the ruler must be a Muslim, because what \n    is implied by bay\u2019ah (swearing allegiance) is the implementation of the laws \n    of Allaah, carrying out of hadd punishments and guarding the borders of \n    Islam, so how can a kaafir implement the laws of Allaah and do these things? \n    Rather if the ruler is a Muslim and becomes a kaafir, he must be removed \n    from office because of his kufr.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, discussing the \n    conditions of leadership:\u00a0\n\n    He should be a Muslim, because Allaah says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \u201cAnd never will Allaah grant to the disbelievers a way (to \n    triumph) over the believers\u201d [al-Nisa\u2019 4:141]. Rulership is the greatest \n    of such ways. And Allaah has enjoined us to put the people of the Book in \n    their place and to take the jizyah from them.

End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Sharh Muslim (12/229).\u00a0\n\n    In al-Mawsoo\u2019ah al-Fiqhiyyah (6/218) it says:\u00a0\n\n    The fuqaha\u2019 stipulated conditions for the ruler, on some of \n    which there is consensus and concerning others there is a difference of \n    opinion.\u00a0\n\n    The conditions of rulership on which there is consensus are:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 Islam (i.e., the ruler should be a Muslim), because this \n    is a condition of testimony being acceptable and guardianship being valid, \n    which are much less serious issues than rulership. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd never will Allaah grant to the \n    disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers\u201d [al-Nisa\u2019 4:141]. \n    And rulership, as Ibn al-Qayyim said, is the greatest of such ways.

        "question": "Trying to avoid being appointed as a judge",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe position of judge is a \n    noble position, which brings great virtue for the one who is able to \n    undertake that role. The Prophets (peace be upon them), some of the senior \n    Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) and some of the prominent \n    Tabi\u2019een and others who came after them took on this role. By judging justly \n    one is enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and supporting \n    those who have been wronged.\u00a0\nMuhammad al-Khaadimi (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nKnowledge of judicial \n    matters is one of the noblest and most sublime branches of knowledge, \n    because it is a high position and prophetic role. Through it blood may be \n    protected or shed; it may determine which marriages are valid and invalid; \n    it may confirm ownership or loss of wealth; and it may show which dealings \n    are permissible or forbidden, disliked or recommended. The evidence that \n    knowledge of judicial matters is not like other (branches of knowledge) is \n    the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd (remember) Dawood (David) \n    and Sulaymaan (Solomon), when they gave judgement in the case of the field\u2026\u201d \n    [al-Anbiya\u2019 21:78]. For that reason the Messengers were sent and on the \n    foundation of justice the heavens and the earth are established. The Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described it as one of the \n    blessings for which envy (hasad) is permitted, as he said: \u201cThere should be \n    no envy except in two cases: a man to whom Allaah has given wealth and \n    granted him the authority to spend it in a rightful manner and a man to whom \n    Allaah has given wisdom and he judges and acts on the basis of it.\u201d And it \n    was narrated from Ibn Mas\u2019ood (may Allaah be pleased with him): \u201cIf I were \n    to judge for one day, that would be dearer to me than worshipping for \n    seventy years.\u201d Hence judging justly between people is one of the best of \n    righteous deeds that brings the highest status in the Hereafter. Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd if you judge, judge with justice \n    between them. Verily, Allaah loves those who act justly\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:42]. \n    And what can be better than the love of Allaah?\u00a0\nBareeqah Mahmoodiyyah fi \n    Sharh Tareeqah Muhammadiyyah wa Sharee\u2019ah Nabawiyyah \n    (4/2,3).\u00a0\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) said:\u00a0\nThere is a great deal of \n    virtue in it for the one who is able to do it properly, hence Allaah has \n    decreed reward for it even if one errs, and has forgiven him for passing a \n    wrong judgement. It is also enjoining what is good, supporting the one who \n    is wronged, giving rights to those who are entitled to them, deterring the \n    wrongdoer from doing wrong, reconciling between people, settling disputes \n    between them, and these are among the best means of drawing close to Allaah. \n    \u00a0\nHence the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the other Prophets before \n    him assumed the position of judge and they judged their nations.\u00a0\nThe Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent \u2018Ali to Yemen as a judge, and he sent \n    Mu\u2019aadh as a judge.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Ibn \n    Mas\u2019ood that he said: To sit between two people as a judge is dearer to me \n    than worshipping for seventy years.\u00a0\nAl-Mughni \n    (11/376).\u00a0\nIn al-Mawsoo\u2019ah \n    al-Fiqhiyyah (33/289) it says:\u00a0\nBecause of its high status \n    and great virtue, Allaah has decreed reward for it even if one errs, and has \n    forgiven him for passing a wrong judgement. The Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIf the judge rules and \n    strives his utmost to work it out and gets it right, he will have two \n    rewards, and if he rules and strives his utmost to work it out and gets it \n    wrong, he will have one reward.\u201d (Agreed upon) He is rewarded for his \n    ijtihaad and efforts, not for his mistake. End quote.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nTaking up a position as a \n    judge may be obligatory, or it may be permissible, or it may be haraam. It \n    is haraam for the one who takes up such a position when he is ignorant of \n    the rulings of sharee\u2019ah. It is permissible for the one who can judge well \n    but there are others who can also do it. And it is obligatory for the one \n    who can judge well when there is no one else who can judge between people.\u00a0\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nPeople fall into three \n    categories with regard to judging:\u00a0\n\n    1.The one for whom it is not \n    permissible to get involved with it. He is the one who is not qualified for \n    it and does not fulfil all its conditions. It was narrated that the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cJudges are of three \n    types,\u201d and he mentioned among them a man who judges between people on the \n    basis of ignorance, and he will be in Hell. And because the one who is not \n    qualified for it cannot be just, so he will take rights from the one who is \n    entitled to them and give them to someone else.\n\n    2.The one for whom it is \n    permissible, but not obligatory. This is the one who is of good character \n    and is able to engage in ijtihaad, but there are others who are like him. So \n    he may take up a position as a judge based on his situation and suitability \n    for the post, but it is not obligatory for him, because he is not the only \n    one who can do it. According to one view of Ahmad, it is not recommended for \n    him to enter into it, because of the dangers and risks involved, whereas \n    there is safety in not doing it, and because of the reports which speak \n    sternly about it, and because the way of the salaf was to avoid it. \u2018Uthmaan \n    (may Allaah be pleased with him) wanted to appoint Ibn \u2018Umar as a judge but \n    he refused. Abu \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Haamid said: If a man is unknown and people \n    do not refer to him concerning the rulings of sharee\u2019ah, and he is not \n    known, then it is better for him to accept this post so that the people may \n    refer to him concerning the rules of sharee\u2019ah and the truth may be \n    established by means of his rulings and the Muslims may benefit from him. \n    But if he is famous among the people for his knowledge, and people refer to \n    him for knowledge and fatwas, then it is better for him to keep busy with \n    that, because of the benefit involved, and because it is also safe from \n    risks. Something similar was said by the companions of al-Shaafa\u2019i. They \n    said: If he is in need, and can earn a living from working as a judge, then \n    it is better for him to do that, and it may be better than other ways of \n    earning a living because it is an act of worship and obedience.\n\n    3.The one for whom it is \n    obligatory. This is the one who is suited to be a judge, and there is no one \n    apart from him. In this case it is an individual obligation, because it is a \n    communal obligation that no one else is able to undertake, so it becomes an \n    individual obligation for him, like washing and shrouding the deceased \n    [which becomes an individual obligation for the one who knows how to do it \n    when no one else knows that].\n\n    There is a report narrated from Ahmad which indicates that it is not an \n    individual obligation in this case. He was asked: Is the judge sinning (by \n    refraining from judging) if there is no one else (who can judge)? He said: \n    He is not sinning.\n\n    This may be understood according to its apparent meaning, that it is not \n    obligatory for him, because of the danger that it brings to him, so he does \n    not have to harm himself in order to benefit others. Hence Abu Qilaabah \n    refused it, although it was said to him, There is no one else. Or it may be \n    understood as referring to one who cannot do what is required because of \n    injustice on the part of the ruler and so on, because Ahmad said: The people \n    need a judge; we cannot let the people\u2019s rights be lost?\u00a0\nAl-Mughni \n    (11/376).\u00a0\nSome scholars stated that \n    the issue of working as a judge is subject to the five rulings and it may be \n    either prohibited, obligatory, recommended, disliked or permissibley.\u00a0\nSee: Mu\u2019een al-Hukkaam \n    fima yataraddadu bayna al-Khasmayni min al-Ahkaam by Shaykh \u2018Ala al-Deen \n    al-Taraabulsi (may Allaah have mercy on him) (p. 10).\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nSome of the imams warned \n    against being appointed as a judge and warned of the danger of this post. \n    For example:\u00a0\n1-\nIt was narrated that \u2018Ali \n    ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If the people knew what \n    is involved in judging they would not judge concerning the price of a piece \n    of camel dung. But the people need judges and rulers, whether they are \n    righteous or immoral.\u00a0\nAkhbaar al-Qudaah \n    by Abu Bakr al-Dabbi who is known as al-Wakee\u2019 (p. 21). \u00a0\n2-\nIt was narrated that \n    Mu\u2019alla ibn Rawbah said: Raja\u2019 ibn Haywah said to me: Today the ruler \n    appointed \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mawhab as a judge. If I had a choice between being \n    carried to my grave or being appointed to that to which Ibn Mawhab has been \n    appointed, I would (choose to) be carried to my grave. I said to him: The \n    people say that you nominated him. He said: They are speaking the truth, \n    because I was thinking about the people and not thinking about him. \u00a0\nAkhbaar al-Qudaah \n    (p. 23, 24).\u00a0\n3-\nIt was narrated that \n    Mak-hool said: To go forth and have my neck struck is dearer to me than \n    being appointed as a judge.\u00a0\n4-\nIt was narrated from Raafi\u2019 \n    that \u2018Umar ibn Hubayrah summoned him to appoint him as a judge, and he said: \n    I would not like to be appointed as a judge, even if the pillars of this \n    mosque were turned into gold for me. \u00a0\n5-\nal-Fudayl ibn \u2018Iyaad said: \n    If a man is appointed as a judge, let him allocate one day for judging and \n    one day for weeping.\u00a0\n6-\nIt was narrated that Ibn \n    Shubrumah said: Do not dare to assume the position of judge until you dare \n    to be exposed to the sword.\u00a0\nAkhbaar al-Qudaah \n    (p. 24).\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nMany of the imams sought to \n    avoid being appointed as judges, and some of them even accepted beatings and \n    imprisonment instead of being appointed, and some fled from their homelands \n    in order to avoid being appointed as judges. The reasons why these imams \n    avoided being appointed as judges may be summed up as follows:\u00a0\n1-\nHe (the imam) thought that \n    he was not qualified to be a judge. It is well known that acting as a judge \n    requires a great deal of patience, intelligence and astuteness, and the imam \n    who turned down an appointment as a judge may have thought that he did not \n    fulfil these conditions.\u00a0\nShaykh \u2018Ala al-Deen \n    al-Taraabulsi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nOne of the imams said: The \n    sign of the pious is that they avoid this and flee from it. A number of \n    exemplary imams endured hardship in order to keep away from this and they \n    bore it with patience.\u00a0\nLook at the case of Abu \n    Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy on him) and how he refused it and bore the \n    hardship with patience until he was relieved of that, as did other imams.\u00a0\nAbu Qilaabah fled to Egypt \n    when he was asked to become a judge, where he was met by Ayyoob who tried to \n    encourage him to do it by saying: If you get it right you will attain a \n    great reward. Abu Qilaabah said to him: The one who is drowning in the sea, \n    how long can he swim? \u00a0\nThese words of Abu Qilaabah \n    and other imams, which speak of warnings and fear, are the words of one who \n    acknowledges his own weakness and inability to fulfil the necessary \n    conditions. The same applies to one who thinks he is qualified to act as a \n    judge but other people do not think he is qualified for that.\u00a0\nOne of the scholars said: \n    There is nothing good in a person who thinks that he is qualified for \n    something for which the people do not think he is qualified.\u00a0\nWhat is meant by the people \n    here is the scholars. It is obligatory for such a person to avoid being \n    appointed as a judge, and seeking to protect himself is essential.\u00a0\nMu\u2019een al-Hukkaam fima \n    yataraddadu bayna al-Khasmayni min al-Ahkaam by \n    Shaykh \u2018Ala al-Deen al-Taraabulsi (may Allaah have mercy on him) (p. 9)\u00a0\n2-\nHe thought that it was not \n    obligatory or mustahabb for him. Indeed, a comment by Imam Ahmad may be \n    understood as meaning that it is not obligatory for him even if it becomes \n    unavoidable for him and there is no one else [who is qualified for it].\u00a0\n3-\nThere is the danger of \n    passing an incorrect judgement and the scholars fear being appointed as a \n    judge because of that.\u00a0\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIn acting as a judge there \n    is grave danger and a huge burden for the one who does not do it properly. \n    Hence the salaf (may Allaah have mercy on them) would refuse it \n    emphatically, fearing its dangers.\u00a0\nAl-Mughni \n    (11/376)\u00a0\nIn al-Mawsoo\u2019ah \n    al-Fiqhiyyah (33/289, 290) it says:\u00a0\nMany of the righteous salaf \n    avoided being appointed as judges and refused it emphatically, even if they \n    were harmed as a result, because they feared its grave danger, as is \n    indicated in many ahaadeeth, in which a stern warning is issued to the one \n    who is appointed as a judge and does not do the job properly, such as the \n    hadeeth, \u201cAllaah is with the judge so long as he is not unjust, but once he \n    becomes unjust He forsakes him and the shaytaan stays with him\u201d [narrated by \n    al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majaah; classed as hasan by al-Albaani] and \u201cWhoever is \n    appointed as a judge or is made a judge has been slaughtered without a \n    knife\u201d [narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majaah; classed as \n    saheeh by al-Albaani] and \u201cJudges are of three types, two of whom will be in \n    Hell and one in Paradise: a man who judges unjustly and knowingly, who will \n    be in Hell; a judge who has no knowledge and destroys people\u2019s rights, who \n    will be in Hell; and a judge who judges in accordance with the truth, who \n    will be in Paradise\u201d [Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3/604) and al-Haakim (904) from the hadeeth of Buraydah; this version was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as saheeh by al-Haakim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him.]. End quote.\u00a0\n4-\nNot being able to put up \n    with the trials of judging.\u00a0\nShaykh Abu\u2019l-Hasan \n    al-Nabaahi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\nBecause of the trials \n    involved in being a judge, many virtuous people fled from it and avoided it \n    until they were no longer asked to do it, and others were imprisoned for \n    their refusal, such as Abu Haneefah, whose name was al-Nu\u2019maan ibn Thaabit. \n    \u2018Umar ibn Hubayrah summoned him to become a judge, but he refused, so he \n    imprisoned him and had him beaten for several days, ten lashes every day, \n    but he persisted in refusing it, until he let him off. \u00a0\nTareekh Qudaat \n    al-Andalus (p. 7)\u00a0\n5-\nThey were preoccupied with \n    things that were more important, such as travelling in pursuit of knowledge, \n    or teaching people.\u00a0\nFinally, although the four \n    imams refused to be appointed as judges \u2013 as was narrated from them \u2013 the \n    noble Prophets (peace be upon them) and the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs did \n    take on this task, but those who want to err on the side of caution may do \n    so. \u00a0\nIn al-Mawsoo\u2019ah \n    al-Fiqhiyyah (33/290) it says:\u00a0\nAfter the time of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the Rightly-Guided \n    Caliphs also acted as judges; they were the leaders of the Muslims, and they \n    judged between people on the basis of truth and their involvement in it is \n    indicative of the high status of this post and the great reward that may be \n    attained thereby, because they are example for the Muslims to follow, and \n    after them many prominent Muslims and senior Taabi\u2019een also took on this \n    role. \nThe fact that some of the \n    scholars refused to become involved in it, despite the fact that they were \n    virtuous, qualified for the post and pious, may be understood as taking \n    extreme precautions in order to protect themselves and erring on the side of \n    caution. Perhaps they thought that they were lacking in some way or they \n    were afraid that it would distract them from acquiring more knowledge. End \n    quote.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Muslim should not be deceived by the so called western and European \u201chuman rights\u201d organizations, because although they outwardly appear to support the oppressed and to take a stance against torture and undermining of human dignity in prisons and detention centres \u2013 which in general terms are good ideas \u2013 they also play other roles, and support other principles which are aimed at destroying the family, and opening the door to slander against Islam and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and all his fellow-Prophets. They are opposed to the rule of sharee\u2019ah which enjoins hadd punishments such as stoning for the adulterer, execution for the apostate and cutting off the hand for the thief, becoming part of legislation and being implemented, which is in fact very rare. These organizations are also opposed to the shar\u2019i rulings that have to do with women, such as the necessity of her wali\u2019s consent for marriage, the command to observe hijab, and the prohibition on her mixing, in addition to other principles where they claim that they want to liberate man from religious obligations and to make man free in the way he conducts his affairs, not restricted by good morals or sublime shar\u2019i rulings. \u00a0\nTo sum up what these organizations promote: it is that man should be able to do whatever he wants, no matter how perverse. They support lesbians, homosexuals and bisexuals, and religious deviance. They regard it as a human right to disbelieve in whatever religions one wants and to express one\u2019s opinion \u2013 even about the Prophets \u2013 without any fear or shame, and they also support the liberation of woman from the control of her father, husband or religion.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThere follow some of the articles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which was approved by the United Nations on 10/12/1948 CE, which we are quoting from their website:\u00a0\nArticle 2.\nEveryone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\u00a0\nArticle 18.\nEveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.\u00a0\nArticle 19.\nEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\u00a0\nThese so called rights and freedoms which they call for all people to enjoy regardless of religion make the monotheist and the polytheist equally entitled to these rights and freedoms, so the slave of Allaah and the slave of the Shaytaan are placed on the same level, and every worshipper of rocks, idols or people is given the complete right and freedom to enjoy his kufr and heresy. This is contrary to the laws of Allaah in this world and the Hereafter.\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cShall We then treat the Muslims (believers of Islamic Monotheism, doers of righteous deeds) like the Mujrimoon (criminals, polytheists and disbelievers)?\n36.\u00a0What is the matter with you? How judge you?\u201d\n[al-Qalam 68:35, 36]\u00a0\n\u201cShall We treat those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds as Mufsidoon (those who associate partners in worship with Allaah and commit crimes) on earth? Or shall We treat the Muttaqoon (the pious) as the Fujjaar (criminals, disbelievers, the wicked)?\u201d\n[Saad 38:28]\u00a0\n\u201cIs then he who is a believer like him who is a Faasiq (disbeliever and disobedient to Allaah)? Not equal are they\u201d\n[al-Sajdah 32:18].\nIt is a call to abolish the ruling on apostasy, and to openly flaunt the principles of kufr and heresy. It is a call to open the door to everyone who wants to criticize Islam or the Prophet of Islam Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and to have the freedom to criticize and express oneself with no restrictions.\u00a0\nThese are corrupt principles. Even if they suit their lives, values and religion, they do not suit us and they are contrary to our pure sharee\u2019ah, which brought rulings that are suited to individuals and societies, and establish noble morals, and protect minds, honour, physical well being and wealth, and show people the religion which Allaah loves and is pleased with.\u00a0\nArticle 3.\nEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.\u00a0\nIt is from this Article that the calls of these organizations come to protect criminals against execution, and started to give bad publicity to the nations which carry out the hadd punishments of Allaah by stoning married adulterers and executing bandits and those who spread mischief in the land. Now these organizations proudly claim that they have convinced many nations to abolish the death penalty for killers, rapists and criminals. This is contrary to sound human nature, reason and sharee\u2019ah, and it is a message that gives peace of mind to those criminals that their lives will never be lost because of their deeds, which is a way of spreading mischief on earth.\u00a0\nThey claim that the individual has the right to life and liberty, even if it is a bestial life, and even if that freedom leads to corruption, sicknesses and loss of security for the family and society.\u00a0\nArticle 16.\nMen and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.\u00a0\nThis article annuls the role of the woman\u2019s guardian (wali) which is to protect the woman\u2019s rights in marriage, and to help his daughter or sister to make a good choice, and to ask about the religious commitment and character of the suitor. It is by His wisdom that Allaah has prescribed this. If marriage was left up to the woman without her guardian\u2019s consent, you would see most girls marrying those who enchant them of the wolves of men, who are eager to rob them of their chastity then throw them aside. \u00a0\nThey also give the wife the same rights of divorce as the husband has. This is something that causes women to turn against their husbands and leads to the break up of their families. The one who knows the nature of men and women will not be able to agree to such nonsense. Western families are not so intact that we can say: Look at how they were destroyed. The call for homosexual rights and the rights of women to form any relationship she wants and women\u2019s rights in marriage and divorce \u2013 what families can be built on such shaky foundations? \u00a0\nIt is worth noting that these organizations are used for political purposes to put pressure on the Muslim states that care about virtue, modesty and morals, or that apply all or some of the rulings of sharee\u2019ah. Some Muslim nations have abolished the death penalty, and they have introduced strict laws about marriage at an early age for both genders, but they pay attention to woman\u2019s rights to khula\u2019 and maintenance, etc, which causes widespread mischief and evil in many areas of life."

        "question": "Should he shave off his beard if he travels to a country where those who have beards are persecuted?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.First of all we should remember that it is forbidden to travel to the lands of the mushrikeen or lands where there is a great deal of corruption and promiscuity. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cI disavow myself of every Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen.\u201d They said: \u201cO Messenger of Allaah, why?\u201d He said: \u201cThey should not be able to see one another\u2019s fires.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1604; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\nPlease see also question no 21344 and 8919.\u00a0\nIf a person needs to travel to such countries and cannot avoid doing so, or if that will serve the public interest of the Muslims, then it is permissible to travel, but he has to learn enough of the rulings of Islam that he needs in this country, and he should avoid places of fitnah (temptation, tribulation) that may affect his religious commitment, as much as he can, whether that has to do with physical temptations that are available in the kaafir land or it has to do with doubts and specious arguments that the enemies of Islam throw at him, overtly or otherwise, to shake the faith that is in people\u2019s hearts. See question no. 6154. If this trip requires him to shave off his beard, such as if he needs to go to a place where wearing a beard is forbidden, or he will exposed to mistreatment because of his beard, and he cannot bear it, then Shaykh Ibn Jibreen tells us that:\u00a0\nIf he has no alternative but to go to that country, or if his going there will strengthen the Muslims, then there is nothing wrong with him shaving off his beard. But if he is going there only for some worldly gain or the mistreatment to which he will be exposed is something that he can bear, then it is not permissible for him to shave it off.\u00a0\nIt should also be noted that if trimming his beard a little will be sufficient to ward off harm from himself, then doing that will be less serious than shaving it off. And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "The situation of the Muslims in Palestine",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly what is happening to the Muslims \n    in the Holy Land of hardship, torture, expulsion, killing and harm is a matter which causes sorrow to every Muslim, and indeed to every non-Muslim \n    who is reasonable, fair-minded and compassionate, when they see the blatant persecution inflicted upon innocent people, with the intention of \n    driving them out of their homes so that the enemy can take their place, which is an enemy that possesses the most advanced weapons, with which \n    they attack unarmed people who are deprived of the means of defending themselves.\u00a0\nThis Muslim people has endured for more than \n    fifty years, facing unending Zionist arrogance and aggression, which pays no heed to human dignity or any covenant or treaty, or any law, except \n    that to which their own whims and desires make them inclined and in which their evil rabbis and warlords encourage them.\u00a0\nThe outcome of that is well known to Muslims \n    as well as Jews, which is that the consequences will be in favour of the pious and the party of God will be the victors. The wrongdoer will never \n    enjoy security, stability and prosperity, rather he will be faced with fear, anxiety, grief and shame, until the day comes when the Muslims come \n    back to their religion and are governed by the sharee\u2019ah of their Lord, then they will meet the Jews in battle, where the two sides will face one \n    another, and victory will go to the people of faith.\u00a0\nAl-Bukhaari (2926) and Muslim (2922) narrated \n    from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe Hour will not begin until the Muslims \n    fight the Jews and kill them, until a Jew will be hiding behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say, \u2018O Muslim, O slave of Allaah, \n    here is a Jew behind me, come and kill him!\u2019 except for the box-thorn (al-gharqad), for it is one of the trees of the Jews.\u201d\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to hasten the Muslims\u2019 return \n    to their religion and to grant them the means of victory. May He grant us the joy of seeing His religion prevail and His enemies humiliated, and \n    may He raise the status of those who are persecuted, tortured or killed for His sake.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "To whom should ba\u2019yah (allegiance) be given?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Bay\u2019ah can only be given to the leader of the Muslims, and bay\u2019ah \n    is given by the decision makers \u2013 i.e., the scholars and people of virtue and status. Once they give their allegiance to him, his position of \n    leadership is confirmed, and the common folk do not have to give allegiance to him themselves, rather they have to obey him so long as that does \n    not entail disobedience towards Allaah. \u00a0\nAl-Maaziri said: With regard to bay\u2019ah being given to the leader \n    of the Muslims, it is sufficient for the decision makers to give him their bay\u2019ah. It is not essential for each individual Muslim to come to him \n    and put his hand in his, rather it is sufficient to commit oneself to obeying him and submitting to him by not going against him or rebel against \n    him. \u00a0\nQuoted from Fath al-Baari.\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said \n    in Sharh Saheeh Muslim:\u00a0\nWith regard to bay\u2019ah (oath of allegiance): \n    the scholars are agreed that in order for it to be valid it is not essential for all the people or all the decision makers to give their bay\u2019ah. \n    Rather, if bay\u2019ah is given by those scholars and people of virtue and status who are present, that is sufficient. It is not obligatory for each \n    person to come to the leader and put his hand in his and give his oath of allegiance to him. Rather what is required of each individual is to \n    submit to him and not go against him or rebel against him.\u00a0\nWhat is narrated in the ahaadeeth narrated in \n    the books of Sunnah about bay\u2019ah refers to giving allegiance to the Muslim leader, such as when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cWhoever dies and did not make an oath of allegiance (to the Muslim leader) has died a death of jaahiliyyah.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, \n    1851).\u00a0\nAnd he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cWhoever gives his oath of allegiance to a leader and gives him his hand and his heart, let him obey him as much as he can. If \n    another one comes and disputes with him (for leadership), kill the second one.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 1844)\u00a0\nAnd he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: \u201cIf allegiance is given to two khaleefahs, then kill the second of them.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 1853).\u00a0\nAll of that undoubtedly has to do with giving \n    allegiance to the Muslim leader.\u00a0\nShaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve \n    him) said, answering a question about giving allegiance to the various groups: Bay\u2019ah only has to do with the leader of the Muslims; these various \n    bay\u2019ahs are innovated and they are among the causes of division. The Muslims who are living in one country or one kingdom should have one \n    allegiance to one leader; it is not permissible to have several kinds of bay\u2019ah. al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, 1/367\u00a0\nWith regard to how the allegiance should be given to the leader, \n    in the case of men it is done in word and in deed, namely with a handshake. In the case of women, it is done by word only. This is proven in the \n    ahaadeeth which speak of how allegiance was given to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\u00a0\nFor example, \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allaah be pleased \n    with her) said: \u201cNo, by Allaah, the hand of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never touched the hand of any \n    (non-mahram) woman. Rather he would accept their allegiance (bay\u2019ah) in words only.\u201d\n(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5288; Muslim, \n    1866)\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said \n    in his Sharh (commentary): \u201cThis indicates that for women, allegiance is given in words only, without taking the hand of the leader, and \n    for men it is done in words and by taking his hand.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Role of the khaleefah of the Muslims?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Al-Maawirdi said, describing the tasks that the imam or ruler is obliged to do:\n    There are ten things that he is obliged to do that have to do with public affairs:\n    1 \u2013 He must preserve the religion according to its established bases and that on which the salaf of the ummah was unanimously agreed. If an \n    innovator or deviant or one who is confused about some issue emerges, he has to explain the proof to him and tell him what is correct, and deal \n    with him according to the set rights and punishments so that the religion will be protected against being undermined and the ummah will be \n    prevented from deviance.\n    2 \u2013 He must judge between disputing parties and put an end to arguments so that justice and fairness will prevail, aggressors will not get carried \n    away and no person who is wronged will feel helpless.\n    3 \u2013 He must guarantee public safety and security and protect the women and children of the ummah so that people can go about their business and \n    travel around in safety, with no danger to their persons or their wealth.\n    4 \u2013 He must carry out hadd punishments so that the sacred limits of Allaah will not be transgressed and so that the rights of His slaves will be \n    protected.\n    5 \u2013 He must reinforce the borders with equipment and forces so that the enemy will not find any opportunity to violate the borders of the Muslims \n    or shed their blood or the blood of non-Muslims living under the protection of the Islamic state.\n    6 \u2013 He must strive in jihad against those who stubbornly reject Islam after being called to it, until they become Muslim or agree to live under \n    Muslim protection and pay jizyah, so that the rights of Allaah will be fulfilled and His religion will prevail over all others.\n    7 \u2013 He must collect zakaah and charity money in the manner enjoined by the texts and scholarly consensus, without causing fear or being unjust.\n    8 \u2013 He must work out what benefits etc are to be given to those who deserve them from the treasury of the Islamic state (bayt al-maal), without \n    being either extravagant or stingy; he must pay them on time, neither early nor late.\n    9 \u2013 He must appoint people who are honest and sincere to different positions, so that things will be done efficiently and wealth will be kept with \n    trustworthy people. \n    10 \u2013 He should supervise matters directly himself, and check on things so that the ummah will be led in a proper manner. He should not rely on \n    delegating to others because he is too busy indulging in physical pleasures or worship, for he may end up delegating to a supposedly trustworthy \n    person who then betrays him, or a supposedly sincere person who then cheats him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n    \u201cO Dawood (David)! Verily, We have placed you as a successor on the earth; so judge you between men in truth (and justice) and follow not your \n    desire * for it will mislead you from the path of Allaah\u201d\n    [Saad 38:26]\n    Allaah did not allow him to delegate to others without supervising them or excuse him from that; He even described that as misguidance. Even \n    though these are the duties of the khaleefah as stated in religion, these are also the duties of everyone who has anyone under his care. The \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cEach of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.\u201d\n    If the imam fulfils the rights of the ummah that we have mentioned above, then he has discharged his duty towards Allaah and to them, and so he is \n    owed the two duties of obedience and support, unless he changes."

        "question": "Solution to the Palestinian issue",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Muslim is deeply grieved and filled with sorrow as the Palestinian situation goes from bad to worse, and gets more complicated, until it has ended up in the state we have seen in recent days, because of differences among neighbouring nations and their failure to stand together as one against the enemy and their failure to adhere to the rule of Islam on which Allah has made victory dependent, and has promised those who adhere to it that they will gain power and become powerful in the land, and has warned of grave danger and a severe punishment, if the neighbouring nations do not hasten to unite once more and adhere to the Islamic ruling concerning this matter,\u00a0 which concerns them and the entire Islamic world.\u00a0\nIt is worth pointing out in this context that the Palestinian issue is an Islamic issue, first and last, but the enemies of Islam are striving their utmost to remove it from the Islamic map and make the non-Arab Muslims think that it is an Arab issue that does not concern the non-Arabs. It seems that they have succeeded in that to some extent.\u00a0\nHence I think that a solution cannot be reached in this matter unless it is regarded as an Islamic issue and the Muslims cooperate to find a solution, and wage an Islamic jihad against the Jews, until the land is given back to its people and the Jewish immigrants go back to the countries from which they came, and the original Jewish inhabitants stay in their towns under Islamic rule, not communist or secular rule. In this manner truth will prevail and falsehood will be defeated, and the people whose land it is will return to their land under Islamic rule and none other. And Allah is the source of strength."

        "question": "Muslim attitudes towards violence and how to react to kaafir aggression against the Muslim community",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah.\u00a0\nWhat we have heard about what our Muslim brothers are going through in kaafir countries in the north and the south, where they are being harassed and persecuted for something in which they did not take part and in which they played no role, is not strange, given the wrongdoing and hatred of the kuffaar, even though they claim to be the people of justice, fairness and freedom. What is the crime of a Muslim woman who walks down the street in her hijaab? What is the crime of a Muslim who leaves his home to go and pray, not to spread mischief in the land? What is the crime of a Muslim employee who goes to his company or a student who goes to his university or a schoolgirl who is walking to her school, not going out to bomb and destroy? If the western man in the street was fair-minded \u2013 at least with himself \u2013 he would go and take revenge on the people who plotted and took part in harming him. But one who does not fear God could do anything, and the very least that the Muslims will be faced with is curses and insults. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cand you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to Allaah; but if you persevere patiently, and become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious) then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs\u201d[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:186]\nOur attitude must be clear; we must explain to the kuffaar the ruling of Islamic sharee\u2019ah concerning harming and killing others. We should tell them that Islam forbids harming innocent people in any way, whether that involves harming their bodies, their wealth or their honour. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThere should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.\u201d It is not permissible to kill a kaafir who is not hostile or who has a legitimate peace treaty with the Muslims; rather treating a non-hostile kaafir with kindness is part of the Islamic religion, especially if that is done to call him to Islam and soften his heart (towards Islam). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAllaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who deal with equity\u201d[al-Mumtahinah 60:8]\nAt times of war against the kuffaar, it is not permissible for a Muslim to deliberately kill a kaafir child or woman who is not bearing arms against the Muslims or helping in the fight. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the Muslim army: \u201cGo out in the name of Allaah and by the help of Allaah, following the way of the Messenger of Allaah. Do not kill any old man, infant, child or woman\u2026 spread goodness and do good, for Allaah loves those who do good.\u201d (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2614; its isnaad includes Khaalid ibn al-Faraz, of whom Ibn Hajar said in al-Taqreeb, he is maqbool (acceptable) i.e., if there are corroborating reports)\u00a0\nThis is supported by the advice which Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him) gave to the commander of his army: \u201cI advise you of ten things: do not kill a woman, or a child, or any old person, or cut down any fruit trees\u2026\u201d (al-Muwatta\u2019, 982, Kitaab al-Jihaad).\u00a0\nThe kaafirs whom the Muslims fight and inflict harm and loss upon are the kaafirs who fight the Muslims and drive them out of their homes, or help to drive them out of their homes and punish and mistreat them, and who stand in the way of calling people to Islam and prevent people from following the path of Allaah, and prevent the spread of Islam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cIt is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allaah forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers those who disobey Allaah).\u201d[al-Mumtahinah 60:9]\nSuch people are to be fought against when [the Muslims] have the power to do so, and when fighting them and declaring jihad against them is more likely to serve a purpose. But when you can achieve your purpose with gentleness and kindness, it is not right to resort to violence and force. Muslims should only use force when they are compelled to, and as a last resort. They should not initiate fighting, unless there is some cause on the part of the kaafirs, such as their fighting the Muslims, or helping other enemies of the Muslims, or preventing them from following the path of Allaah and establishing the law of Allaah in the land.\u00a0\nWe should also remind these kaafirs of the massacres which have been carried out and are still being carried out against Muslims in all parts of the world, in Bosnia, Kosova, Chechnya, Palestine and Kashmir, which are being supported by Jews, Christians and others. Is the blood of the Muslims cheaper than the blood of others? Should there be mourners for non-Muslims who are killed and not for Muslims who are killed?\u00a0\nMoreover, when the Orthodox Christians carried out massacres in Bosnia and Kosova, in which the numbers of those killed exceeded 200,000, apart from those who were wounded or raped, and the economic losses that resulted, did the Muslims in the Arab and Islamic countries launch attacks against the Orthodox Christians who live in their countries, or kill any of them, or open fire against their churches and subject them to terror?! What does this tell you?\u00a0\nIt is very important for Muslims to explain these things to non-Muslims, in order to establish proof against the kuffaar. This is something that Allaah wants. Secondly, among the kuffaar there are intelligent and fair-minded people, and people who are receptive to the guidance of Islam; perhaps they will be affected by a clear explanation. Thirdly, no Muslim should permit himself to be accused without explaining his innocence. The distorted image of Muslims is one of the things that is keeping the kaafirs away from the truth and being affected by the Muslims; indeed it may make them treat the Muslims like outcasts, resulting in additional wrongdoing towards the Muslims.\u00a0\nWith regard to the question, it is permissible for a Muslim at times of tribulation, when they cannot walk safely through the streets or reach the mosque safe and sound, to pray at home and not attend prayers in jamaa\u2019ah. But we must examine the situation more carefully before deciding not to attend Jumu\u2019ah prayer because of its extreme importance. So we should not stop praying in jamaa\u2019ah or stop attending Jumu\u2019ah prayers on the grounds of mere speculation or an unlikely possibility of aggression. Rather if a person is certain or believes it to be most likely that he will be attacked if he goes to the mosque, then it is permissible for him not to go.\nAmong the opinions of the scholars concerning the permissibility of refraining from going to Jumu\u2019ah prayers or prayers in jamaa\u2019ah because of fear is the comment of Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) who said: \u201cThe one who is sick and the one who is afraid is excused from attending them \u2013 i.e., Jumu\u2019ah and prayers in jamaa\u2019ah \u2013 according to the view of most of the scholars. Ibn \u2018Abbaas narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u2018Whoever hears the call to prayer and is not prevented from responding by an excuse \u2013\u2019 They said, \u2018What is the excuse, O Messenger of Allaah?\u2019 He said, \u2018Fear or sickness, (otherwise) the prayer that he offers will not be accepted.\u2019\u201d (narrated by Abu Dawood, 1/130. Shaykh al-Albaani classed this version of the hadeeth as da\u2019eef (weak), but he classed as saheeh (sound) the version narrated by Ibn Maajah, 793, which says: \u201cWhoever hears the call and does not come, his prayer is not valid, except for one who has an excuse.\u201d Al-Irwaa\u2019 2/337). And Bilaal used to give the call to prayer; one day the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came when he was sick, and said, \u2018Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.\u2019\u201d (al-Bukhaari, 633; Muslim, 418)\u00a0\nFear is of three kinds: fear for oneself, fear for one\u2019s wealth, and fear for one\u2019s family. The first kind means fearing capture by an oppressive ruler, or an enemy, or a thief, or attack by wild animals, or a flood, etc., which may cause harm to oneself.\n\u00a0The second kind means fear for one\u2019s wealth if one leaves home, as we have mentioned, such as oppressive rulers, thieves and the like, or fear that one\u2019s house may be broken into or burned down or something like that; in such cases one is excused from attending Jumu\u2019ah and prayers in jamaa\u2019ah. \u00a0\nThe third kind means fear for one\u2019s child and family. In all such cases one is excused from attending Jumu\u2019ah and prayers in jamaa\u2019ah. This was the view of \u2018Ataa\u2019, al-Hasan, al-Oozaa\u2019i and al-Shaafa\u2019i, and we know of no difference of opinion concerning this matter.\u201d\n(summarized from al-Mughni, 2/376).\u00a0\nIn Fataawa al-Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez ibn Baaz, when a man asked him about refraining from attending prayers in jamaa\u2019ah because he was afraid for his wife, he said, \u201cIf there is some danger to your wife (at home) and she is not safe, and she is surrounded by things which give rise to fear, then he is excused for praying at home because of his fear for his wife\u2026\u201d Then he said: \u201cBut if your wife is not safe and the place is not safe, and danger is present, then it is o.k. for you to pray at home; this is a legitimate excuse\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 Fataawa Samaahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), 12/42\u00a0\nWith regard to Muslim women, they should stay in their homes and not go out \u2013 as much as they can \u2013 lest they be exposed to harm. Their relatives and neighbours should help them to meet their needs so that they will not be forced to go out. This is a means of earning great reward by helping those who are in desperate need.\u00a0\nWith regard to Muslim men giving up distinctive Islamic dress and wearing the clothes commonly found in the kaafir society in which he lives, that is o.k., especially at times of persecution and harassment. Imaam Ibn Taymiyah said:\u00a0\n\u201cThe Muslim in a kaafir country that is at war with the Muslims or otherwise is not commanded to differ from them in outward appearance, because of the harm that may result from that. Rather it is recommended or obligatory for men to resemble them sometimes in his outward appearance, if that serves a religious purpose such as calling them to Islam, or finding out about their true state of affairs in order to inform the Muslims of that, or warding off their harm from the Muslims, and other righteous goals.\u201d (Iqtidaa\u2019 al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, p. 176).\u00a0\nThe words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah must be understood correctly. He is speaking of special circumstances or cases of necessity; he does not mean at all that Muslims should become assimilated with the kaafirs and do evil things or drink alcohol with them or that Muslim children should go to churches and lose their Islamic identity. Rather what is meant is that it is permissible to forego distinctive Islamic dress \u2013 for example \u2013 and wear clothing of the type prevalent in the kaafir country, and to speak the language of the kaafirs, etc., in order to ward off the harm of the kaafirs, especially in an atmosphere that is charged with hostility, such as that mentioned in the question.\u00a0\nPerhaps these events will give the Muslims who are living in kaafir lands unnecessarily and for no shar\u2019i purpose the opportunity to review their situation and consider going back to the Muslim world and making hijrah from the land of the kaafirs.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to protect us and all our Muslim brothers from harm, wrongdoing and evil, and guide us to the right path. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and grant him peace."

        "question": "Reconciling the fact that the khaleefah should be from Quraysh with the hadeeth about obeying an Abyssinian slave",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth about the rulers being \n          from Quraysh is a saheeh hadeeth which was narrated through many isnaads. \n          The basic principle is that the leader should be from Quraysh. But in \n          the case where the khaleefah has seized power by force and is ruling \n          the people by force, the people have to obey him and it is haraam to \n          rebel against him, even if he is an Abyssinian slave as it says in the \n          hadeeth."

        "question": "Don\u2019t be such a fanatic!",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Whoever is advised concerning something that is haraam according to sharee\u2019ah, so that he can avoid it or give it up, or is told of an obligation so that he can fulfil it, then he says something like this, is doing wrong. What he should do, if he is advised, is to thank the person who has offered the advice, then he should look at himself and if the advice was justified, then he should avoid the haraam thing and do what is obligatory. As far as his comment \u201cyou are a fanatic\u201d is concerned, fanaticism, laxity and moderation are all to be understood in reference to sharee\u2019ah. Whatever is in accordance with sharee\u2019ah is moderate; whatever exceeds that is extreme and whatever falls short of that is laxity. The standard in all cases is sharee\u2019ah and the meaning of moderation is that which is in accordance with the sharee\u2019ah. Whatever is in accordance with sharee\u2019ah is moderate."

        "question": "Appointing an ameer (leader)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The reports that have been narrated concerning\n    appointing an ameer refer specifically to when people are travelling, because when people\n    are travelling they need to be able to refer their opinions to a leader or ameer. But when\n    people are not travelling, usually each individual is busy with his own affairs and they\n    do not need an ameer.\nBut they may appoint someone to be the head of their society or group,\n    so if for example they are living in a flat, they may say\u201d we need someone to\n    organize our affairs in this flat, so we will appoint So and so to be our head or\n    ameer.\u201d Then they can discuss with him the running of this household\u2019s affairs,\n    such as what kind of food to have, setting times of rest, deciding what needs to be\n    bought, and so on, so they discuss these things with him and agree to accept what he says.\n    This is correct, in sha Allaah."

They have to have an Ameerah to organize their affairs so that they\n    will not be disorganized. This is the case with every group of people, whether on a\n    journey, in the home, etc. If they appoint someone as an Ameerah, then they have to obey\n    her, because the point of making someone an Ameer is to obey him.

        "question": "Is it permissible    for Muslims to vote for kaafirs who seem to be less evil?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is a matter concerning which rulings may differ according to different circumstances in different times and places. There is no absolute ruling that covers all situations, both real and hypothetical.\nIn some cases it is wrong to vote, such as when the matter will have no effect on the Muslims, or when the Muslims have no effect on the outcome of the vote. In this case voting or not voting is all the same. The same applies in cases where all the candidates are equally evil or where they all have the same attitude towards Muslims\u2026\nIt may be the case that the interests of Islam require Muslims to vote so as to ward off the greater evil and to reduce harmful effects, such as where two candidates may be non-Muslims but one of them is less hostile towards Muslims than the other, and Muslims\u2019 votes will have an impact on the outcome of the election. In such cases there is nothing wrong with Muslims casting their votes in favour of the less evil candidate.\nIn any case, this is the matter of ijtihaad based on the principle of weighing up the pros and cons, what is in the interests of Islam and what is detrimental. With regard to this matter, we have to refer to the people of knowledge who understand this principle. We should put the question to them, explaining in detail the circumstances and laws in the country where the Muslim community is living, the state of the candidates, the importance of the vote, the likely benefits, and so on.\nNo one should imagine that anyone who says that it is OK to vote is thereby expressing approval or support for kufr. It is done in the interests of the Muslims, not out of love for kufr and its people. The Muslims rejoiced when the Romans defeated the Persians, as did the Muslims in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) when the Negus defeated those who had challenged his authority. This is well known from history. Whoever wants to be on the safe side and abstain from voting is allowed to do so. This response applies only to elections for influential positions. And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Proportional representation in Islamic centers",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nThere is no problem with this because it is a way of organizing things in order to reach the right \nor better opinion, by using points to represent groups according to their size or number of \nmembers. But you should know that a \"one man one vote\" system may be unfair if the people \ninvolved are not equal in trustworthiness, ability, knowledge and experience that are necessary \nfor the kind of decision-making that you want to undertake. If they are equal or close enough, \nthen \"one man one vote\" is fair and wise. The people of authority (ahl al-hall wa\u2019l-\u2019aqd) in this \nummah are those who have knowledge and virtue, who are rational and wise, and who are \nprominent and distinguished. These, not the ignorant masses whose opinion is worthless, are \nthe ones who select the khaleefah. May Allaah help you to do that which will please Him."
