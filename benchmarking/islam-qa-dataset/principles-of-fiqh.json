        "question": "Rulings on Conservatorship and Bankruptcy",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The bankrupt (Muflis) is the one who has debts that are greater than the wealth he owns.\nIf the creditors ask the court to establish conservatorship (Hajr) and divide among them the wealth that the debtor has, the judge must respond to that.\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said, explaining the rulings on conservatorship and bankruptcy:\n\u201c1.\u00a0What is meant by conservatorship in Shari`ah is preventing a person from disposing of his wealth.\nThe evidence for that in the Quran is the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not give the weak-minded your property, which Allah has made a means of sustenance for you, but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness.\nAnd test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age. Then if you perceive in them sound judgement, release their property to them.}\u00a0[An-Nisa\u2019 4:5-6]\nThese two verses indicate that conservatorship should be imposed in the case of one who is weak-minded and the orphan to prevent them having access to their wealth, lest they mishandle it and lose it. The wealth should not be given to such a person until after it is established that he is mature and competent. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) imposed conservatorship on some of the Companions for the purpose of ensuring that the debt they owed to people would be paid off .\n2.\u00a0Conservatorship is of two types:\n\nThe first type: conservatorship imposed on a person because he owes something to others, such as conservatorship imposed on a bankrupt person because of what he owes to his creditors.\nThe second type: conservatorship imposed on a person because that is in his best interests, lest he squander his wealth or mishandle it, such as conservatorship in the case of a minor, a weak-minded person and one who is insane.\n\nIn the first case, which is conservatorship imposed on a person because he owes something to others, what is meant in this case is conservatorship imposed on one who is bankrupt. The bankrupt person is one who owes a debt that has now become due, but the wealth that he has is not sufficient to pay it off. He should be prevented from disposing of his wealth, so that he does not harm the creditors.\nAs for the debtor who is in financial difficulty and is not able to pay off anything of his debt , he is not to be asked for it, and he should be given more time, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if someone is in hardship, then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease.}\u00a0[Al-Baqarah 2:280]\nAs for the one who is able to pay off his debt, it is not permissible to impose conservatorship on him, because there is no need for that. Rather he should be instructed to pay off his debt when the creditors ask him to do so, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cFor a rich man to delay repayment is wrongdoing.\u201d In other words, if one who can afford it is taking too long to pay off his debt, he is wronging the creditors, because he is withholding payment that he is obliged to make to people who are entitled to it. So if he refuses to pay off his debts, he should be imprisoned. Shaykh Taqiy Ad-Din Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever is able to pay off his debt but refuses to do so should be forced to pay it off by means of beating and imprisonment. This was stated by the leading scholars among the companions of Malik, Ahmad, Ash-Shafi`i and others. He said: And I do not know of any difference of scholarly opinion concerning that.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cFor a rich man to delay repayment is wrongdoing, and it is permissible to speak ill of him and punish him.\u201d (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and others)\nWhat is meant by speaking ill of him is complaining about him, and what is meant by punishing him is detaining him. The one who takes too long to pay off what he owes deserves to be punished by detention or otherwise, and that should be done repeatedly until he pays off what he owes. If he persists in taking too long to pay his debt, then the judge should intervene to sell his property and pay off his debts from the proceeds, because the judge will be playing the role of the one who is refusing to pay. That will also serve the purpose of alleviating harm from the creditors. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere should be neither harm nor reciprocating harm.\u201d\n3.\u00a0From the above, it becomes clear that in the case of debt, there are two scenarios:\n\nThe first scenario: the debt has not yet become due. In this case, the debtor is not to be asked to pay it back until it becomes due, and he does not have to pay it before it becomes due. If the wealth he has is less than what he owes that has not yet become due, then he is not to be subjected to conservatorship because of that, and he is not to be prevented from disposing of his wealth.\nThe second scenario: the debt is now due. In that case, there are two possibilities:\n\nThe first possibility is that the wealth he has is greater than the debt he owes. In this case, he is not to be subjected to conservatorship regarding his wealth, but he should be instructed to pay off the debt if the creditor asks for it. If he refuses to do that, then he should be detained and punished until he pays off what he owes. If he puts up with detention and punishment, and refuses to pay off the debt, then the judge should intervene to pay off his debt from his wealth, selling whatever he needs to sell in order to do that.\nThe second possibility is that the wealth he has is less than the debt he owes. In this case, he should be subjected to conservatorship and prevented from disposing of his wealth, if he has creditors who ask for that, lest he harm them. That is because of the Hadith of Ka\u2018b ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) imposed conservatorship on Mu\u2018adh (may Allah be pleased with him) and sold his property. Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni and by Al-Hakim, who classed it as authentic. Ibn As-Salah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is a proven Hadith. If he is subjected to conservatorship in this case, then that should be announced and it should be made known to people that conservatorship has been imposed on him, lest they be deceived by him and do business with him, then end up losing their wealth.\n4.\u00a0There are five rulings having to do with imposing conservatorship on someone.\n\nThe first ruling is that the rights of the creditors are connected to his wealth that existed before conservatorship was imposed and to any wealth that he acquired after it was imposed. So the wealth that he acquired later is subject to the conservatorship, just like the wealth that he owned before that. Thus he will have no authority to dispose of the wealth that he acquired after conservatorship was imposed in any way whatsoever. Even the wealth that he acquired before it was imposed cannot be disposed of in any way that harms his creditors.\n\nImam Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf what he owes of debts is equal to or more than what he has of wealth, then any donation he makes is not valid if he donates it in a way that harms his creditors, regardless of whether the judge has imposed conservatorship on him or not. This is the view of Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) and it is the view favoured by our Shaykh \u2013 meaning Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). He said: And it is the correct view, and no other view is appropriate according to the general guidelines of the [Hanbali] Madhhab. In fact, this is in accordance with the teachings and general guidelines of Shari`ah, because the rights of the creditors are connected to his wealth, therefore the judge has the right to impose conservatorship on him. Were it not for the fact that the creditors\u2019 rights are connected to his wealth, then the judge could not impose conservatorship on him. Therefore he is like one who is terminally ill; allowing this debtor to donate his wealth would mean that the creditors would lose what is rightfully theirs, and Shari`ah cannot approve of such a thing. Rather Shari`ah emphasises the importance of protecting the rights of those who have rights by all possible means, and bars any means that could lead to the loss of their rights. End quote.\n\nThe second ruling is that if someone finds his exact wealth with the debtor that he sold to him or loaned to him or rented to him before conservatorship was imposed on him, then he has the right to take it back from the one who is bankrupt, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever finds his own goods with one who has become bankrupt, has more right to them [than other creditors].\u201d (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). The jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) stipulated six conditions in order for the one who finds his property with one who is bankrupt and has had conservatorship imposed on him to take it back:\n\n\nThe bankrupt person should still be alive in order for him to take his property back from him, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud\u00a0 (may Allah have mercy on him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf [the debtor] has died, then the owner of the goods becomes equal to all other creditors.\u201d\nThe bankrupt person should still owe him the price in full. If the creditor has received anything of its price, he is not entitled to take back the goods.\nThe goods should be fully in the possession of the bankrupt person. If the creditor only finds some of them, he cannot take them back, because he has not found his exact property; rather he has only found some of it.\nThe goods should be in the same condition as when they were sold, and none of their characteristics should have changed.\nThe goods should not be connected to the rights of someone else, such as if the bankrupt person gave them in pledge as collateral, and the like.\nThe goods should not have increased in size, such as growing fat [in the case of livestock].\n\nIf all these conditions are fulfilled, then it is permissible for the owner of the goods to take them away, if it has become known that the one who has them has become bankrupt, because of the hadith quoted above.\n\nThe third ruling is that the creditors should stop demanding repayment from him after conservatorship is imposed on him, until after it is lifted. So whoever sells something to him or lends something to him during this period should ask him to pay him or return it after the conservatorship is lifted.\nThe fourth ruling is that the judge may sell his property and divide its price commensurate with the size of the debts that are currently due, because this is the purpose of imposing conservatorship on him. Delaying that is wronging the creditors. However, the judge should leave for the bankrupt person whatever he needs of shelter and sustenance, and so on.\n\nAs for any debt that is not yet due, it does not become due when the person declares bankruptcy, and that does not impact the currently-due debts, because the deferral of time for payment is the right of the bankrupt individual, and that right, like all others, cannot be waived. It remains something that the bankrupt person owes. Then after distributing his wealth to those creditors whose payment is currently due, once he has paid them off and none of those currently-due debts remain, the conservatorship should be lifted automatically, without any need for a judicial ruling, because the reason for it no longer applies. If he still owes anything of the debts that are currently due, then the conservatorship is not to be lifted from him except by a judicial ruling, because the judge is the one who ruled that he was to be subject to conservatorship, so he is the one who should rule that the conservatorship is to be lifted.\" (Al-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi\u00a0 2/89-95)\nIf any debts remain unpaid, then they are still owed by the one who is bankrupt, until Allah, may He be Exalted, blesses him with wealth, whereupon he must repay these outstanding debts.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Recommended Recitation In the Two Sunnah Rak\u2018ahs Of Fajr and Maghrib",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What to recite in Sunnahs of Fajr and Maghrib?\nYes, it is recommended to recite Surat al-Kafirun and Surat al-Ikhlas in the two Sunnah rak\u2018ahs of Fajr and Maghrib. This is proven in the sahih Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recited in the two Sunnah rak\u2018ahs of Fajr {Qul ya ayyuha\u2019l-kafirun (Say, \"O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] and {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah, [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112].\nIbn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I watched the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) twenty times reciting in the two rak\u2018ahs after Maghrib and in the two rak\u2018ahs before Fajr, {Qul ya ayyuha\u2019l-kafirun (Say, \"O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] and {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah, [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112]. (Narrated by al-Nasai, 992)\nAn-Nawawi said in al-Majmu\u2018 (3/385):\u00a0\n\u201cIts isnad is jayyid. It was classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (3328) and by Shaykh Ahmad Shakir in Tahqiq al-Musnad (8/89).\u201d\nAl-Mubarakfuri said in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (2/418):\n\u201cThat is, in the first rak\u2018ah of each of them he would recite {Qul ya ayyuha\u2019l-kafirun (Say, O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] and in the second {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah , [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112].\u201d\nThe scholars have stated that it is recommended to recite these two surahs in the Sunnah prayers of Fajr and Maghrib, in accordance with these hadiths. (See: al-Mughni (1/435); Mughni al-Muhtaj (1/464); al-Fatawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra (1/192); al-Mawsu\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah (27/159)\nWhy should we recite Surat al-Kafirun and Surat al-Ikhlas in Fajr and Maghrib Sunnah prayers?\nWith regard to the wisdom behind reciting these two surahs, that is because they include all three types of Tawhid . The surah {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah, [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112] refers to tawhid ar-rububiyyah (oneness of divine Lordship ) and tawhid al-asma wa\u2019s-sifat (oneness of the divine names and attributes ), for it affirms that Allah, may He be exalted, is one God and denies that He has any son, father or peer, and that in addition to that, He is as-Samad, in Whom are combined all attributes of perfection.\nAnd the surah {Qul ya ayyuhu\u2019l-kafirun (Say, O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] refers to tawhid al-\u2018ibadah (oneness of worship), which means that one should not worship anyone or anything except Allah, and should not associate anyone with Him in worship. Hence the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to start the day with them in the Sunnah prayer of Fajr , and he would end the day with them in the Sunnah prayer of Maghrib. In as-Sunan, it is narrated that he used to recite these surahs in Witr, so they were also a conclusion to the deeds of the night, just as they were a conclusion to the deeds of the day.\u201d (This was stated by Ibn al-Qayyim in Badai\u2018 al-Fawaid, 1/145-146)\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Difference between Shari\u2019ah, Fiqh and Usul Al-Fiqh",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is Shari`ah?\nIn linguistic terms, Shari`ah refers to a water source, which is the source to which people who want to drink come, so they drink from it and fill their buckets, and perhaps bring their animals to drink from it as well.\nThe Arabs do not call a water source Shari`ah unless the water is flowing without interruption, and is visible and can be seen. (Lisan al-\u2018Arab (8/175)\nIn Shar\u2018i terminology, Shari`ah refers to the entire religion (Islam), which Allah has chosen for His slaves to bring them forth thereby from the depths of darkness into the light. It is what He has prescribed for them and what He has explained to them of commands and prohibitions, halal and haram.\nWhoever follows the Shari`ah of Allah, regarding as permissible (halal) that which He has permitted and regarding as forbidden (haram) that which He has prohibited, will triumph.\nWhoever goes against the Shari`ah (laws) of Allah has exposed himself to divine vengeance, wrath and punishment.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThen We put you, [O Muhammad], on an ordained way [Shari`ah] concerning the matter [of religion]; so follow it and do not follow the inclinations of those who do not know.\u201d [al-Jathiyah 45:18]\nWhat does Fiqh mean?\nIn linguistic terms, fiqh means understanding. It may be said that so-and-so has been given fiqh fi\u2019d-din, meaning understanding of the religion. Another example is the du\u2018a of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for Ibn 'Abbas: \u201cAllahumma faqqihhu fi\u2019d-din (O Allah, give him understanding of the religion).\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhari (143) and Muslim (2477) \u00a0 (Tahdhib al-Lughah (5/263)\nIn Shar\u2018i terminology, fiqh refers to knowledge of the practical, minor Shar\u2018i rulings which are derived from detailed evidence and proof. Al-Mawsu\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah (1/13)\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cThe definition of fiqh is: knowledge of the rulings of Shari`ah as derived from the Quran and the words of the one who was sent with it (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), for these rulings can only be taken from him.\nWhat is implied by this definition is: knowledge of the rulings of the Quran, and what abrogates and what is abrogated of it (an-nasikh wa\u2019l-mansukh); and knowledge of the rulings in the hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), what abrogates and what is abrogated of it, and what is soundly narrated of it and what is not; and knowledge of the matters concerning which there was consensus among the scholars and what they differed about; and knowledge of how to refer differences of opinion to the Quran and Sunnah of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is what is meant by having knowledge of the rulings of Shari`ah.\u201d (Al-Ihkam fi Usul al-Ahkam (5/127)\nIbn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cFiqh is understanding of the texts, Quranic verses and hadiths, and knowing how to derive rulings from them.\u201d (Sharh Akhsar al-Mukhtasarat (1/2)\nWhat is Usul al-Fiqh?\nThe word asl (pl. usul) refers to the origin of a thing and what it is based on. Hence the father is the origin of the child, and the river is the origin of the channel. (Al-Misbah al-Munir (1/16)\nUsul al-Fiqh is knowledge of Shar\u2018i evidence and the way in which that evidence is interpreted in order to reach a ruling, in general terms or in detail. (Sharh Mukhtasar ar-Rawdah (1/106)\nIbn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cUsul al-Fiqh may be defined in two ways:\n\nFirstly, on the basis of the two words that make up the phrase, namely the word usul and the word fiqh.\n\nUsul is the plural of asl, which is the basis on which something else is built, such as the foundation of a wall (asl al-jidar), or the trunk of a tree (asl ash-shajarah) from which the branches stem. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cHave you not considered how Allah presents an example, [making] a good word like a good tree, whose root [asl] is firmly fixed and its branches [high] in the sky?\u201d\u00a0[Ibrahim 14:24].\nIn linguistic terms, fiqh means understanding; in Shar\u2018i terminology it refers to knowledge of the practical Shar\u2018i rulings, with detailed evidence.\nKnowledge may be definitive or speculative, because Shar\u2018i rulings may be either definitive (yaqini) or speculative (zanni), as is the case in many issues of fiqh.\nWhat we mean by the Shar\u2018i rulings (conclusions) is the rulings that are learned from the Shar\u2018i texts, such as the obligations and prohibitions. That excludes rulings (conclusions) derived by means of reasoning, such as knowing that the whole is greater than its parts, or regular rulings (conclusions), such as knowing that dew will come down on a winter\u2019s night if the sky is clear.\nWhat we mean by practical is that which does not have to do with beliefs, such as prayer and zakah. That excludes anything that has to do with beliefs (\u2018aqidah), such as the Oneness of Allah (Tawhid) and knowledge of the divine names and attributes. Such topics are not called fiqh in Shar\u2018i terminology.\nWhat we mean by detailed evidence is evidence of fiqh that has to do with detailed issues of fiqh. This excludes Usul al-Fiqh, because discussing issues of Usul al-Fiqh is done on the basis of the general evidence of fiqh.\n\nSecondly, on the basis of the phrase (the two words together, Usul al-Fiqh) that forms the name of this branch of knowledge, it is defined as the branch of knowledge that deals with the general evidence of fiqh and how to make use of it, and the situation of the one who engages in this process (which is called ijtihad).\n\nWhat we mean by general is the general principle, such as when the scholars said that a command means that something is obligatory, a prohibition means that something is haram, and the soundness of a report means that it has authority. This excludes detailed evidence, which is not discussed within the framework of Usul al-Fiqh except by way of explaining a general rule.\nWhat we mean by how to benefit from it is knowing how to derive rulings from the evidence by studying what the words of the text mean, and whether the meaning is general or specific, applicable with no restrictions or subject to some restrictions, what abrogates and what is abrogated, and so on. This is done by understanding all of the evidence of fiqh from which rulings are derived.\nWhat we mean by the situation of the one who engages in this process is trying to find out his situation (and whether he is qualified), because he is the one who is engaging in this process (ijtihad), as he himself derives rulings through his efforts based on the evidence, as he has reached the level of ijtihad (having the ability to work out rulings based on the evidence). Knowing the definition of the mujtahid, the conditions and rulings on ijtihad, and so on, are matters that are discussed in the field of Usul al-Fiqh.\nThe benefit of Usul al-Fiqh is that it enables a person to attain the ability to derive Shar\u2018i rulings from the evidence by means of a sound process.\nThe first one to write about Usul al-Fiqh as an independent branch of knowledge was Imam ash-Shafi\u2018i, Muhammad ibn Idris (may Allah have mercy on him); then he was followed in that by\u00a0 scholars who wrote various books on this topic.

        "question": "Scholarly consensus (ijmaa\u2018) as binding proof and the first consensus that occurred in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nConsensus (ijmaa\u2018) is one of the important sources of legislation that must be followed.\nThere are several definitions of consensus (ijmaa\u2018); the favoured view is that of as-Subki (may Allah have mercy on him), who defined it as follows: It is when there is unanimous agreement among the scholars of the ummah after the death of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), during any era, on some particular matter.\nEnd quote from Jam\u2018 al-Jaami\u2018, annotated by Wali ad-Deen al-\u2018Iraaqi, which is known also known as al-Ghayth al-Haami\u2018, p. 485\nThere is a great deal of definitive evidence from the Qur\u2019an and Sunnah for the fact that consensus constitutes binding proof. We have explained some of it previously in the answer to question no. 201682 .\nFor example, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination\u201d\n[an-Nisa\u2019 4:115].\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever goes against it \u2013 that is, consensus \u2013 after coming to know of it, or after proof has been established on the basis of consensus, is deserving of the warning mentioned in the verse.\nEnd quote from Maraatib al-Ijmaa\u2018 by Ibn Hazm, p. 7.\nAl-Qaadi Abu Ya\u2018la (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Consensus constitutes binding proof with which one should comply and it is haraam to go against it; it is not possible for the ummah to agree on error.\nEnd quote from al-\u2018Uddah fi Usool al-Fiqh (4/1058).\nSecondly:\nWe have not come across anyone who mentioned the first consensus that occurred in Islam, or the first one to narrate such a thing.\nWe have stated above that consensus is when the scholars agree on a particular issue after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nHowever, during his lifetime (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), consensus did not constitute proof.\nAl-Aamidi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The consensus of those who were alive at the time of revelation did not constitute proof at the time of revelation, according to consensus; rather consensus became binding proof after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nEnd quote from al-Ahkaam by al-Aamidi (1/109).\nBased on that, it may be said that the first consensus that occurred after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) on the necessity of appointing a caliph, after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Therefore the Muhaajireen and Ansaar met in the saqeefah of Banu Saa\u2018idah for that purpose, before the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was buried, then they agreed to appoint Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) as caliph.\nAmong the first examples of consensus after that was the agreement of the Sahaabah on fighting the apostates, after some initial objection on the part of \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), but then Allah opened his heart and caused him to feel at ease with the decision of Abu Bakr, and the Sahaabah agreed on that, without any dissent.\nImam Abu\u2019l-Hasan al-Ash\u2018ari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, praised the Muhaajireen and Ansaar, and the earliest Muslims; the Qur\u2019an speaks highly of the Muhaajireen and Ansaar in many places, and praises those who were present at Bay\u2018at ar-Ridwaan [when the Muslims affirmed their allegiance to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at al-Hudaybiyyah]. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cCertainly was Allah pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, [O Muhammad], under the tree\u201d\n[al-Fat-h 48:18].\nThese people whom Allah praised agreed to appoint Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) as their leader; they called him Khaleefat Rasool-Allah (the Successor to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), and swore allegiance to him, rallying behind him and affirming his virtue, for he was the best of the Sahaabah in the qualities that are required for a person to be a leader, such as knowledge, asceticism, wisdom, leadership abilities, and so on.\nEnd quote from al-Ibaanah fi Usool ad-Diyaanah, p. 66\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What confirms the fact that Abu Bakr\u2019s appointment as caliph was based on a strong foundation is the fact that all the Muslims rallied behind him and accepted his leadership.\u2026 Later on, we see that \u2018Ali and al-\u2018Abbaas swore allegiance to him and agreed to accept his leadership. Therefore his leadership, after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), was based on the consensus of the Muslims.\nIt is not appropriate for anyone to say that what was in the hearts of \u2018Ali and al-\u2018Abbaas [concerning the appointment of Abu Bakr as caliph] was something other than what they showed. If that argument was valid, then it would be almost impossible to establish consensus. The same argument could be used with regard to any consensus of the Muslims, but that would lead to the invalidation of the idea of consensus as binding proof, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has not obliged us to know what is hidden in people\u2019s minds when it comes to the matter of consensus; rather He has obliged us to go by what people appear to be. Therefore consensus and agreement on the appointment of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq as caliph did indeed occur.\nEnd quote from al-Ibaanah, p. 66\nImam Abu \u2018Uthmaan as-Saabooni (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars of hadith confirmed the validity of Abu Bakr\u2019s appointment as caliph after the death of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because he was chosen by the Sahaabah; they were unanimously agreed on that and they all said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was pleased that he should lead us in our religious matters (prayers), therefore we are pleased for him to lead us in our worldly matters. In other words, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed him to lead the people in the obligatory prayers when he was sick, which is their religious affairs, so we accept him as the successor of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to our worldly affairs.\nWhen they said, The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put you ahead of us, so how could we put you back? What they meant was: the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put you ahead to lead us in prayer when he was sick, and we prayed behind you on his orders, so how could we put you back after he put you forward?\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke highly of Abu Bakr when he was alive, which indicated to the Sahaabah that he was the most deserving of being appointed caliph after him. Hence they agreed to rally behind him, and that was to their own benefit, and they gained honour and victory through him.\nEnd quote from \u2018Aqeedat as-Salaf wa As-haab al-Hadith, p. 290.\nWe shall mention here the story of how \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) swore allegiance to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq on the first day.\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Haafiz Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi said: Abu\u2019l-Hasan \u2018Ali ibn Muhammad ibn \u2018Ali al-Haafiz al-Isfaraayeeni informed us: Abu \u2018Ali al-Husayn ibn \u2018Ali al-Haafiz told us: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Is-haaq ibn Khuzaymah and Ibraaheem ibn Abi Taalib told us: Bandaar ibn Bashaar told us: Abu Hishaam al-Makhzoomi told us: Wuhayb told us: Dawood ibn Abi Hind told us: Abu Nadrah told us, from Abu Sa\u2018eed al-Khudri, who said:\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed away and the people, including Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar, gathered in the house of Sa\u2018d ibn \u2018Ubaadah.\nThe spokesman of the Ansaar stood up and said: Do you know that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was one of the Muhaajireen, and his successor is one of the Muhaajireen, and we are the Ansaar (helpers) of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and we will be the Ansaar (helpers) of his successor as we were his helpers?\n\u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab stood up and said Your spokesman has spoken the truth. If you had said something other than this, we would not have accepted that. And he took the hand of Abu Bakr and said: This is the right man, so swear allegiance to him. \u2018Umar swore allegiance to him, and the Muhaajireen and Ansaar swore allegiance to him.\nThen Abu Bakr ascended the minbar and looked at the people, and he did not see az-Zubayr.\nSo he called for az-Zubayr, and he came.\nAbu Bakr said: (You are) the son of the paternal aunt of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his disciple; do you want to cause division among the Muslims?\nHe said: There is nothing to worry about, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. Then he stood up and swore allegiance to him.\nThen Abu Bakr looked at the people, and he did not see \u2018Ali, so he called \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib and he came.\nAbu Bakr said: (You are) the son of the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his son-in-law; do you want to cause division among the Muslims?\nHe said: There is nothing to worry about, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. Then he stood up and swore allegiance to him.\nAbu \u2018Ali al-Haafiz said: I heard Muhammad ibn Is-haaq ibn Khuzaymah say: Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj came to me and asked me about this hadith, so I wrote it down for him on a piece of paper and I read it to him. This hadith is worth a badanah (a valuable camel); indeed it is worth a badrah (sack of money)!\nEnd quote from al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah by Ibn Katheer (5/269).\nA badrah is a big sack full of money; it was said that it is one thousand or ten thousand dirhams, or seven thousand dinars.\nAl-Mu\u2018jam al-Waseet (p. 43); al-Qaamoos al-Muheet (p. 444).\nThen Ibn Katheer narrated a report about another oath of allegiance that \u2018Ali swore after the death of Faatimah (ma y Allah be pleased with her). He said: This oath of allegiance that was sworn by \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) after the death of Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) was in confirmation of the reconciliation between them and it was secondary to the oath of allegiance mentioned above, that was sworn on the day of as-saqeefah, as was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah and classed as saheeh by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj. \u2018Ali did not keep his distance from Abu Bakr, during these six months; rather he used to pray behind him, and he was present when Abu Bakr used to meet with some of the senior Sahaabah in order to seek their advice concerning some issues; he was also willing to ride with him on a campaign to Dhu\u2019l-Qassah.\nIn Saheeh al-Bukhaari it says that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed \u2018Asr a few days after the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, then he went out of the mosque and found al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali playing with some boys. He carried him on his shoulder and started saying: May my father be sacrificed for the one who looks like the Prophet and does not look like \u2018Ali! And \u2018Ali smiled (at this joke).\nBut when this second oath of allegiance occurred, some narrators thought that \u2018Ali had not sworn allegiance (to Abu Bakr) before that, so they denied that (the first oath of allegiance) had happened. But if someone confirms that something happens, that takes precedence over the report of someone who says that it did not happen, as we have mentioned and explained above.

        "question": "What Is Ijma` and What Are Its Types?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is ijma\u2019?\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cIn linguistic terms, ijma` means resolve and agreement.\u00a0\nIn Shar\u2018i terms, ijma` means the agreement of the mujtahids of this ummah after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a shar\u2018i ruling .\u00a0\nBy saying \u201cagreement\u201d we exclude differences of opinion; if there is a difference of opinion, even from one person, then we cannot say that there is ijma`.\u00a0\nBy saying \u201cthe mujtahids\u201d we exclude the common folk and those who follow or imitate scholars; it does not matter whether they agree or disagree.\u00a0\nBy saying \u201cthis ummah\u201d we exclude the consensus of others, which carries no weight.\u00a0\nBy saying \u201cafter the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)\u201d we exclude their agreement at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); ijma` or consensus at that time does not count as evidence, because evidence is established by the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), whether in word or deed or by approval. Hence if a Sahabi says \u201cWe used to do\u201d or that they (i.e., people) used to do such and such at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), this is indicative of the approval of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), according to consensus.\u00a0\nBy saying \u201con a shar\u2018i ruling\u201d, we exclude their agreement on a rational or human ruling, which has nothing to do with the matter under discussion, because we are talking about looking for ijma` as one of the kinds of shar\u2018i evidence.\u00a0\nEvidence for the authority of ijma`\nIjma` counts as evidence on the basis of a number of pieces of evidence, including the following:\u00a0\n\nThe verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThus We have made you (Muslims), a Wasat (just) (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:143].\u00a0 The words \u201cwitnesses over mankind\u201d include testifying about their deeds and judging their deeds, and the words of the witness may be accepted.\nThe verse in which Allah, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves\u201d [an-Nisa 4:59] indicate that whatever they agreed upon is sound and correct.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cMy ummah will not unanimously agree on misguidance.\u201d\nWe say: If the ummah unanimously agrees on something, it must be either true or false. If it is true, then it is proof. If it is false, how can this ummah, which is the dearest of nations to Allah since the time of its Prophet until the onset of the Hour, agree on something false with which Allah is not pleased? This is quite impossible.\n\nTypes of ijma` \u00a0\nIjma` is of two types: definitive and presumptive.\u00a0\n\nDefinitive is that which is well known and well established, such as consensus that the five daily prayers are obligatory and that zina (fornication, adultery) is haram. No one can deny that this type of ijma` is proven and established, or that it constitutes proof in and of itself, or that the one who rejects it becomes a kafir, unless he is ignorant and may be excused for his ignorance.\nPresumptive is that which can only be known by means of research and study, where the scholars may differ as to whether there is ijma` (on a particular issue) or not. The most correct scholarly opinion concerning that is the view of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, when he said in al-\u2018Aqidah al-Wasitiyyah: The type of ijma` that is to be accepted is that of the righteous early generations (as-salaf as-salih), because after their time there was a great deal of disagreement and the ummah spread far and wide. End quote.\n\nIt should be noted that the ummah cannot agree on something that is contrary to an unabrogated, clear, sahih text, because it can only agree on what is true. If you see consensus that you think is contrary to that, then it must be one of the following: either the evidence is not clear, or it is not sahih, or it is abrogated, or there is a difference of opinion concerning the matter of which you were not aware.\u00a0\nWhat are the conditions of ijma`?\u00a0\nThere are certain conditions for ijma`, such as:\u00a0\n\nIt should be soundly proven in the sense that it is either well known among the scholars or transmitted by a trustworthy narrator who has read widely.\nIt should not have been preceded by a well-known difference of opinion. If that was the case, then there is no ijma`, because scholarly opinions are not invalidated by the death of their authors.\n\nIjma` does not cancel out a previous difference of opinion; rather it prevents differences of opinion from arising.\u00a0\nThis is the most correct view, because of the strength of its argument.\u00a0\nAnd it was said that the second condition is not stipulated, so it is valid in a later period for there to be consensus on one of the previous opinions and for that to serve as proof for those who come afterwards.\u00a0\nAccording to the majority, it is not essential that those who unanimously agree all die when still holding this view for\u00a0 ijma` to be established; rather ijma` is established as soon as they (the scholars of a particular era) agree, and it is not permissible for them or anyone else to go against it after that, because the condition for the establishment of ijma` do not include any stipulation that the era (of the scholars who reached this consensus) should have come to an end with their passing. As ijma` is established at the moment they agree (on a particular issue), there is nothing that could cancel it out.\u00a0\nIf one of the mujtahids (scholars) says or does something and that becomes well known among the mujtahids, and they do not denounce it even though they are able to do so, then it is said that there is ijma`. It was said that this establishes that there is ijma`; others said that it may be regarded as proof but not ijma`; and others said that it is neither ijma` nor proof. And it was said that if they all passed away before denouncing it then it is ijma`, because their silence until the time of their death, even though they were able to denounce it, constitutes proof of their agreement. This is the view that is most likely to be correct.\u201d (Al-Usul min \u2018Ilm al-Usul, 62-64)\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is it mustahabb to wash the hands with soap?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nIslamic sharee\u2018ah is a flexible way that is based on general principles and holistic foundations governing human conduct. At the same time it allows room for new developments that occur with changes in time and place. For example, it does not put undue restrictions on people with regard to customs and purely worldly actions; rather it gives them the freedom to act in accordance with what is appropriate to their desires and interests, and what will benefit them, so long as any given custom is not contrary to the text of the Qur\u2019an or Sunnah. This is the meaning of what was affirmed by the fuqaha\u2019 and scholars of usool when they said: The basic principle with regard to customs is that they are permissible and are allowed.\u00a0\nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with the Muslim benefiting from what has been invented or discovered in modern times, such as cars, airplanes and electricity\u2026 and modern means of cleaning the body or clothes.\u00a0\nThe Muslim is not required to go back to riding camels or using the kind of cleaning agents that were used by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because these are not worship in which he is required to follow the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); rather these are customs and traditions.\u00a0\nAsh-Shaatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nWith regard to customs, the Lawgiver focused on the idea of achieving a given purpose, not on a literal following of a shar\u2018i text, unlike acts of worship which must be based on a shar\u2018i text.\nEnd quote from al-Muwaafaqaat, 2/523\u00a0\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) encouraged cleanliness and that which will protect good health in general terms, and for that purpose he used the means and things that were available at his time (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). If something new is introduced and it leads to the same purpose (i.e., cleanliness and maintenance of good health) without causing any harm, then there is nothing wrong with the Muslim using it and benefiting from it.\u00a0\nIn Islam there are many teachings that are indicative of paying attention to cleanliness of the body, clothing and place where one is. To confirm that, it is sufficient to note that wudoo\u2019 \u2013 which involves washing the hands, mouth, nose, and face \u2013 is one of the conditions of prayer, which is the foundation of the faith, being valid.\u00a0\nUsing cleaning agents with water was not widely practised at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) because of the scarcity of these cleaning agents and the scarcity of water itself.\u00a0\nYet despite that it is proven in the Sunnah that lote leaves may be used in some cases where ghusl is done that require extra attention to care and cleaning, such as washing the deceased prior to burial, ghusl for a woman whose period has ended, and ghusl for the kaafir who becomes Muslim. The fuqaha\u2019 also mentioned using saltwort as well for the purpose of cleaning and bathing.\u00a0\nSaltwort (salsola) is a plant that grows in sandy ground; it or its ash is used for washing clothes and hands.\nAl-Mu\u2018jam al-Waseet, 1/91\u00a0\nWith regard to lotus, this is a plant that grows on water. Its fruit is the lotus fruit (nabq) and its leaves are used for washing. See: Lisaan al-\u2018Arab, 4/354\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Umm \u2018Atiyyah al-Ansaariyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) entered upon us when his daughter died and said: \u201cWash her three times, or five, or more than that, if you see fit, with water and lotus leaves, and put camphor in the last time, or a little camphor\u201d.\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 1253; Muslim, 939\u00a0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThis indicates that it is mustahabb or encouraged to use lotus leaves when washing the deceased. There is unanimous agreement that it is mustahabb.\nEnd quote from Sharh Muslim, 7/3\u00a0\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAl-Maymooni said: I read to Ibn Hanbal: Is it acceptable for the woman whose menses has ended to do ghusl using only water?\u00a0\nHe dictated to me: If she cannot find anything but water on its own, then she should do ghusl with it. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cYour water and your lotus leaves,\u201d and this is more than ghusl in the case of janaabah.\u00a0\nI said: What if she did ghusl using water only, then she found (lotus leaves)?\u00a0\nHe said: I prefer that she should repeat it, because of what he said.\nEnd quote from Fath al-Baari, 1/471-472\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Qaasim ibn \u2018Aasim (may Allah be pleased with him) that he became Muslim, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed him to do ghusl using water and lotus leaves.\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi, 605. He said: It is hasan. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\nIt is obvious that using lotus leaves when doing ghusl does not come under the heading of acts of worship; rather it is the matter of customs that change with time and place. Whoever uses any cleansing material in the place of lotus leaves has fulfilled the spirit of the Sunnah and has fulfilled the purpose for which the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed people to do ghusl with lotus leaves.\u00a0\nOn our website, in a number of answers, we have explained that it is not mustahabb to imitate the actions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he did on the grounds that they were customs or personal habits or preferences, and doing so does not bring any greater reward than other customary matters. Rather reward is attained by adhering to Sunnahs of worship and related matters.\u00a0\nShaykh Dr. Muhammad al-Ashqar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe ruling on these matters of custom and similar issues is that they are indicative of something being permissible, and no more, except in two cases:\u00a0\n1.Where there is a report of words enjoining or encouraging something, in which case it seems that it is something prescribed in Islam\n2.Where it seems that it is connected to Islam by circumstantial evidence other than words, such as placing the deceased in his grave facing towards the qiblah. That is obviously connected to something that is prescribed in Islam.\nEnd quote from Af\u2018aal ar-Rasool, 1/237\u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 69822\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWith regard to what you mentioned about not owning a lot of clothes, what is required of the Muslim with regard to food, drink and clothing, and the house in which he lives and the furniture on which he sits, and other such matters, is that he should not go beyond what he needs. So what he has of clothing and furnishings should be in accordance with what he needs and no more than that. If it is more than what he needs, then he comes under the heading of extravagance which is condemned in Islam. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cand eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not Al-Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance)\u201d\n[al-An\u2018aam 6:141].\u00a0\nAs-Sa\u2018di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nExtravagance may mean having more than is sufficient and consuming too much of food that is harmful to the body; or it may mean going to excess in luxury in food, drink and clothing; or it may mean overlooking what is halaal and favouring what is haraam.\u00a0\n\u201ccertainly He (Allah) likes not Al-Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance)\u201d means that Allah hates extravagance and it is harmful to the individual\u2019s body and livelihood, because he may end up being unable to meet his financial obligations. This verse commands us to consume food and drink and it forbids us to neglect them or be extravagant with them. End quote.\u00a0\nTafseer as-Sa\u2018di, p. 311\u00a0\nIbn Maajah (3605) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cEat and drink, give charity and wear clothes, so long as that does not involve any extravagance or vanity.\u201d\nClassed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "If her guardian refuses to give her in marriage to a man who is already married and has children, is he unjustly preventing her from getting married?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If this man is good in terms of\nreligious commitment and character, and you want to marry him, then tell him to\napproach your guardian (wali), and tell your guardian\nabout his good qualities and that you accept him. If your father agrees to\naccept him as a husband for you, then praise be to\nAllah. If he refuses and gives an acceptable reason for that, then it is not\npermissible for you to try to marry him through the imam of the mosque or\nanyone else, because there is saheeh evidence that\nthe approval of the guardian is a condition of marriage being valid and that it\nis not permissible to overlook him so long as he is not unjustly preventing\nmarriage. Unjust prevention of marriage means preventing a woman from marrying\na compatible man of whom she approves.\nFor example, the Prophet (blessings and\npeace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere is no marriage except with a\nguardian.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2085; at-Tirmidhi, 1101; Ibn Maajah, 1881, from Abu Moosa al-Ash\u2018ari; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be\nupon him) said: \u201cAny woman who gets married without the permission of her\nguardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her\nmarriage is invalid.\u201d\nNarrated by Ahmad, 24417; Abu Dawood, 2083; at-Tirmidhi. 1102.\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani\nin Saheeh al-Jaami\u2018,\n2709\nIf it is proven that marriage has been\nunjustly prevented, guardianship passes to the next closest male relative (on\nthe father\u2019s side), such as the (paternal) grandfather, then the brother,\nbrother\u2019s son, paternal uncle and so on. If none of these relatives are present\nor they refuse to give the woman in marriage, then she may be given in marriage\nby the Muslim judge if there is one, otherwise the imam of the mosque or a\nMuslim of similar standing may give her in marriage.\nBut if the guardian refuses to give a\ngirl in marriage to a married man who has children, this is not regarded as\nunjustly preventing marriage, because he thinks that it is not appropriate for\nher or he fears that she may suffer in this marriage, or he fears that there\nmay be problems between her and the first wife, as happens in many cases of\nplural marriage, many of which end in failure and termination of married life.\nThe guardian has to look at what is in\nthe best interests of the female relative under his guardianship. In most cases\nhe is better able than she is to let reason and wisdom prevail over emotion,\nhence Islam has given him this duty.\nAn-Nasaa\u2019i\n(3221) narrated that Buraydah said: Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar both proposed\nmarriage to Faatimah, but the Messenger of Allah\n(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cShe is too young.\u201d Then \u2018Ali\nproposed to her and he gave her in marriage to him. This hadeeth\nwas classed as saheeh by al-Albaani\nin Saheeh an-Nasaa\u2019i.\nAs-Sindi said\nin his commentary on an-Nasaa\u2019i: The words \u201cThen \u2018Ali\nproposed to her\u201d indicate that happened straight afterwards without any delay,\nas is indicated by the word fa (translated\nhere as \u201cthen\u201d). Thus it is known that the Prophet (blessings and peaces of Allah be upon him) thought that she was too young\nfor them (i.e., Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar)\nbut that did not apply in \u2018Ali\u2019s case. This indicates that being of the same\nage or close in age is something to be paid attention to because it is more\nlikely to lead to harmony. End quote.\nThus it is known that it is possible to\nreject a man who is of good character and religiously committed, if the\nguardian thinks that his daughter is not suitable for him in terms of age or if\nhe fears that she may suffer in the marriage, or that she may have troubles\nwith the co-wife, or he hopes that she may receive a proposal from someone who\nis more suitable for her.\nIt says in Asna\u2019l-Mataalib\n(3/108): It says in al-Ihya\u2019: just as it is mustahabb to marry a virgin, it is mustahabb\nnot to give one\u2019s daughter in marriage except to a virgin who has never been\nmarried, because people usually feel more at ease with the first spouse. End\nquote.\nSo do not object to your parents if they\nreject this suitor, because they have more insight into married life than you\nand they are the keenest of people to get what is good for you. Their opinion\nis based on experience and reasoning, not emotion, and perhaps Allah will bless\nyou with something good by virtue of your obeying your parents.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Words and deeds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) before his mission began",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) before his mission began are outside of the legislative Sunnah, and that we are not required to follow him or take him as an example in that regard, except in cases where sharee\u2019ah \u2013 after his mission began \u2013 affirmed that something was prescribed or Islamically acceptable, either by way of being obligatory or mustahabb, such as fulfilling promises, helping the destitute, honouring guests, helping people when calamity strikes and so on. In that case we are obliged to follow his example, because it became a law for us after his Prophethood began, and not just because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did it before he was a Prophet. Based on this, there are some actions that he did before his mission began that we are not obliged to follow, either because there is no proof that it is prescribed for us or because there are reports to show that it was abrogated after his mission began.\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The things that happened before Prophethood are not mentioned as things to be followed or that are legislated, as is the case with his actions after Prophethood, because the Muslims are unanimously agreed that what is obligatory with regard to believing in him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and following what he brought, is that which has to do with what happened after he became the Prophet.\u00a0\nHence whoever stays away from Jumu\u2019ah prayer and prayers in congregation, and lives alone in caves and mountains, where there is no Jumu\u2019ah or prayer in congregation, and claims to be following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) because he was used to worship alone in the cave of Hira\u2019 before his Prophethood, thus forsaking the acts of worship that were prescribed and enjoined by Allah and His Messenger, and following the example of what he used to do before Prophethood, is wrong. That is because, after Allah honoured him with Prophethood, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) no longer did what he used to do before that, of worshipping alone in the cave of Hira and so on. \u00a0\nNone of his Sahaabah after him went to the Cave of Hira\u2019, and they did not stay away from Jumu\u2019ah prayer or prayers in congregation in isolated places, and none of them observed any kind of forty-day retreat, as some of the later Muslims did. Rather they worshipped Allah by means of the prescribed acts of worship that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordained for them. End quote from Majmoo\u2019 al-Fatawa (18/10).\u00a0\nWith regard to the muhaddithoon (scholars of hadeeth), they paid attention to what was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at all times, even if it was before his mission began. That is part of the Sunnah according to the definition of the muhaddithoon, who regard everything that was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as Sunnah, so they narrated it in their books on that basis.\u00a0\nSee: Af\u2019aal al-Rasool sall-Allahu \u2018alayhi wa sallam wa Dalaalatuhaa \u2018ala al-Ahkaam, by Dr. Muhammad al-\u2018Aroosi (149).\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Religious titles in Islam and Christianity",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The religion which Allaah has chosen is the religion of Tawheed, Islam, for which He sent the Messengers and revealed the Books. It is by His grace towards His slaves that He has preserved this religion and decreed that it will survive and continue and its basic principles will be preserved through the sincere and devout scholars who are entrusted with the Revelation and who bear that trust and deliver it as enjoined by their Lord. \u00a0\nAmong previous nations in history there has been distortion and changing of the contents of the messages of the Prophets to a great extent, because most of their scholars betrayed the trust and sold the covenant of Allaah for a small price. They were misled by their whims and desires and by the shaytaan, and they introduced into the religion things for which Allaah gave no permission. One of the most serious ways in which they distorted the message of the Prophets was by introducing the principle of al-waasitah (mediation) between Allaah and His creation, between the almighty Lord and His slaves, thus aiming to protect the thrones of the tyrants who oppressed the people thereby and held their destiny in their hands, through the body that spoke in the name of \u201cheaven\u201d. They invented names and titles for this organization and classified them in varying degrees and levels, where the clergyman could progress through the ranks that had been invented in the name of \u201cthe Lord\u201d until he reached the position of acting as the deputy of \u201cGod\u201d as the \u201chigh priest\u201d or \u201cpope\u201d.\u00a0\nThe English historian Wills said in his book, Milestones of Human History (3/270): \u00a0\nBut even though the fully-developed Christianity of the fourth century preserved the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels as its foundation, it was in essence a sacerdotal religion of the type that had been familiar to people for thousands of years. The altar was the focus of its elaborate rituals and the essential act of worship was the sacrifice consecrated by the priest for the Mass, and it had a structure that quickly formed, composed of the deacons, priests and bishops. End quote.\u00a0\nThis body developed its authority and its method of organization from the political hierarchy of the Roman Empire as Shaykh Safar al-Hawaali said in his book al-\u2018Ulmaaniyyah (79):\u00a0\nThe presence of priests and monks within the Roman Empire helped to support their position and reinforce it, because they copied from the political system and hierarchy of the state the idea of creating a priestly system and hierarchy. Just as the state system resembled a pyramid with the emperor at the top and the troops at the bottom, the church system also resembled a pyramid, with the pope at the top and the priests at the bottom. As a result of the principle of separating church and state, the empire took care of sponsoring the church hierarchy, and did not find anything in it that contradicted or opposed the state hierarchy. Thus it was settled and became strong. End quote.\u00a0\nBut in the sharee\u2019ah of Islam that was divinely protected, you do not find the kind of class system that could reinforce tyranny and oppression, and you can only find texts which speak of equality among all people and state that the best of them are those who are most pious and closest to Allaah and who follow His laws most closely.\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At\u2011Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]\u201d\n[al-Hujuraat 49:13]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd for all, there will be degrees according to that which they did, that He (Allaah) may recompense them in full for their deeds. And they will not be wronged\u201d\n[al-Ahqaaf 46:19]\nHence the essence of Islamic sharee\u2019ah is based on cancelling out the mediation of bandits who come between the people and Allaah in the name of \u201cmediation\u201d or \u201cintercession\u201d. Islam attributes this attitude to the mushrikeen who\u00a0fought the message of Tawheed, of whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd they worship besides Allaah things that harm them not, nor profit them, and they say: \u2018These are our intercessors with Allaah.\u2019 Say: \u2018Do you inform Allaah of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?\u2019 Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they associate as partners (with Him)!\u201d\n[Yoonus 10:18]\nThe guided French scholar Naasir al-Deen Dinet said:\u00a0\nThe issue of mediation was one of the major issues in which Islam superseded all other religions, because there is no intermediary between Allaah and His slave. There are no priests or monks in Islam; these intermediaries are the cause of all evil in other religions and that is indeed the case no matter what their beliefs and no matter how sincere they are and how good their intentions. The Messiah himself understood that. Did he not drive the sellers out of the temple? But his followers do not act as he did, and today if Jesus were to return how many like the sellers in the temple would he drive out?\u00a0 End quote from al-\u2018Ulmaaniyyah (p. 81).\u00a0\nAs for the status of the fuqaha\u2019 and scholars in Islam, it is purely academic, i.e., whether a person has enough knowledge to qualify him to talk about religion is based on his studies and academic qualifications and what he has learned from universities, study circles and books. It has nothing to do with any religious hierarchical body or priestly rituals that give them authority in the name of the Lord. Rather it is a level of specialized knowledge \u2013 as in any other field of knowledge studied by specialists. They may be correct or incorrect, and they are subject to criticism on the basis of evidence. None of them has any authority or power to declare things halaal or haraam, or to issue commands and prohibitions, except the Lord of the Worlds. They are no more than conveyors of His laws, and teachers who tell the people of what was revealed from the Lord of the Worlds. Moreover, as we have pointed out, they are not infallible in their understanding of the message brought by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or in the way they preserve it and convey it. Rather the infallible ruling, which Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it (cf. Fussilat 41:42), and which is to be referred to in the case of a dispute, is the Revelation of Allaah, may He be exalted: His Holy Book and what is narrated in saheeh reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then that on which there is consensus among the ummah, for his ummah cannot agree on misguidance.\u00a0\nThe titles and names that the scholars bestow on some of them, or that the people bestow on them, are only referring to the level of knowledge that a person acquires of the rulings of sharee\u2019ah. There may also be a kind of distinguishing the type of knowledge in which a person has specialized, such as faqeeh and mufti for those who have specialized in fiqh and issuing fatwas, respectively, or mufassir for the one who has specialized in tafseer or commentary on the Book of Allaah, or muhaddith and hafiz for those who have specialized in the study of hadeeth.\u00a0\nThe scholar may also be given titles of praise for his vast knowledge and learning, such as Shaykh al-Islam or \u2018Allaamah or Imam and other such titles which ascribe knowledge and learning to those who are entitled to them. In no way are they meant as indicators of priestly status that has been earned in a gradual manner through stages of devotion and monasticism. \u00a0\nEven describing the academic level by using these titles is not something precise, such that the one who reaches a certain level will be called by a different name than someone who has reached a lower level. Rather they are relative descriptions and do not refer to precise distinctions between one level and another, and they are not indicative of different levels of knowledge, rather they point to general praise or particular specializations.\u00a0\nThere is no precise difference between the titles of imam, \u2018aalim and Shaykh and it is not permissible for anyone to understand their usage in books or by scholars in terms of the innovations of other nations with regard to clergymen and priests.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Our attitude towards the differences of opinion among the imams with regard to covering the face",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nAt the time of the Revelation, the Muslims learned the rulings of Islam from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) through the verses of the Holy Qur\u2019aan and the ahaadeeth of his Sunnah. Hence there were no differences of opinion among them except with regard to some minor issues. If that happened, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would explain to them what was correct.\u00a0\nWhen the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died and the Sahaabah spread out to various regions to teach the people Islam, there appeared some differences with regard to some matters of fiqh which arose at different times and in different places. These differences were due to a number of reasons, which we will sum up here from the words of the scholars:\u00a0\n1-The evidence had not reached the one who held a different opinion, and he made a mistake in forming his opinion.\n2-The hadeeth had reached the scholar, but he did not regard the transmitter as trustworthy, and he thought that it went against something that was stronger, so he followed that which he thought was stronger than it.\n3-The hadeeth had reached him but he forgot it.\n4-The hadeeth had reached him but he understood it in a way other than the intended meaning.\n5-The hadeeth reached him but it was abrogated, and he did not know the abrogating text.\n6-He thought that it contradicted something that was stronger than it, whether that was a text or scholarly consensus (ijmaa\u2019)\n7-The scholar used a weak hadeeth as the basis for his ruling, or he derived the ruling by means of weak arguments.\nFor a detailed discussion of these reasons and others, see  Raf\u2019 al-Malaam \u2018an al-A\u2019immati\u2019l-A\u2019laam by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, and al-Khilaaf bayna al-\u2018Ulama\u2019: Asbaabuhu wa Mawqifuna minhu by Shaykh al-\u2018Uthaymeen.\u00a0\nWe think that what we have mentioned about the reasons for differences among the scholars i.e., with regard to matters of fiqh, will be clear to you, in sha Allaah.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWhat should the Muslim\u2019s attitude be towards differences that arise between the scholars? In other words, which scholarly opinion should the Muslim follow in matters where they differed? The answer depends:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 If the Muslim is one who has studied shar\u2019i knowledge and learned its basic principles and minor issues, and he can distinguish right from wrong with regard to scholarly views, then he has to follow that which he thinks is correct and ignore that which he thinks is wrong.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 If he is one of the rank and file, or has not studied shar\u2019i knowledge, and thus cannot distinguish between right and wrong with regard to scholarly views, then he must follow the fatwa of a scholar whose knowledge he trusts and who he believes to be trustworthy and religiously committed, whether he is from his own country or another country, and differences between scholars will not matter after that. He does not have to change what he is doing because he hears another scholar issuing a fatwa that differs from the one he is following, unless he realizes that what he learned later on is the correct view, on the basis of his confidence in the religious commitment and knowledge of the second Shaykh.\u00a0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe one who has knowledge of evidence is required to follow the evidence, even if it goes against some of the imams, if it does not go against the consensus of the ummah.\u00a0\nThe one who does not have any knowledge should ask the scholars, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  \u201cSo ask\u00a0 of those who know the Scripture, if you know not\u201d [al-Nahl 16:43]. He should ask one who he thinks has more knowledge and is more religiously committed, but that does not mean that doing so obligatory, because the one who is better may make a mistake with regard to a particular issue, and the one who is regarded as less knowledgeable may be right with regard to it. But priority should be given to following the one who is more knowledgeable and more religiously committed.\u00a0\nSee also the answers to questions no. 8294 and 10645.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nIf you ask about our view on the issue of covering the face, the most correct scholarly view in our opinion is that it is obligatory to cover the face in front of non-mahram men. There is a great deal of evidence and scholarly views concerning that, as among the Maalikis. Many of them said that it is not permissible for a woman to uncover her face in front of non-mahram men, not because it is \u2018awrah but because uncovering it runs the risk of fitnah. But some of them think that it is \u2018awrah. Hence women, in their view, are forbidden to go out in front of non-mahram men with their faces uncovered.\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen\u201d\n[al-Ahzaab 33:53]\nal-Qaadi Abu Bakr ibn al-\u2018Arabi al-Maaliki (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe entire woman is \u2018awrah, her body and her voice, so it is not permissible to uncover that except in cases of necessity, such as when testimony is given against her, or medical treatment, or asking her about her health issues. End quote.\u00a0\nAhkaam al-Qur\u2019aan by Ibn al-\u2018Arabi (3/1578, 1579).\u00a0\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him), who is also Maaliki, said:\u00a0\nThis verse indicates that Allaah has given permission to ask of them from behind a screen if there is some need, or when they ask a question about something. That includes all women. Because it is a basic shar\u2019i principle that the entire woman is \u2018awrah, her body and her voice \u2013 as stated above \u2013it is not permissible to uncover that except in cases of necessity such as when testimony is given against her, or medical treatment, or asking her about her health issues. End quote.\u00a0\nIn al-Jaami\u2019 li Ahkaam al-Qur\u2019aan (14/227) it says:\u00a0\nFor more information on the views of Maaliki fuqaha\u2019 concerning the obligation for women to cover their faces, see: al-Ma\u2019yaar al-Mu\u2019arrab by al-Wanshireesi (10/165 and 11/226 and 229), Mawaahib al-Jaleel by al-Hattaab (3/141), al-Dhakheerah by al-Quraafi (3/307) and Haashiyat al-Dasooqi \u2018ala al-Sharh al-Kabeer (2/55).\u00a0\nWe have discussed this issue and its evidence in more than one answer on this site. Please see the answers to questions no. 11774, 12525, 13998, 21134 and 21536.\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nWith regard to what you mention about the laws in your country forbidding women to cover their faces, that is something that makes us feel very sad, to hear that covering and chastity are being opposed and wanton display and unveiling are being encouraged everywhere, especially when that happens in a country that is supposed to be Muslim.\u00a0\nIf the laws forbid women to cover, and you fear persecution because of covering your faces, then there is no sin on you if you do not do it in that case, so long as that is based on necessity. So a woman should not go out of her house with her face uncovered except in cases of necessity. If she can break the law and put up with a little bit of hassle, let her do so for there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.\u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 2198 and 45672.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."
