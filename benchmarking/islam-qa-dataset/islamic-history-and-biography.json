        "question": "In what area of Makkah did the birds (Ababil) throw stones on the army of Abrahah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Abrahah made preparations to enter Makkah; he mobilised his army and prepared his elephant. Then when he was in Wadi Muhassir, between Muzdalifah and Mina, the elephant knelt down and would not get up to advance towards the Ka\u2018bah.\nIt was said that when they made the elephant face towards Makkah, Nufayl ibn Habib al-Khath\u2018ami came up to the elephant and stood beside it, then he took hold of its ear and said: Sit down, Mahmoud, for you are in the sacred land of Allah. Then he let go of its ear, and the elephant knelt down. Nufayl left, running up to the top of the mountain. They beat the elephant to make it stand up, but it refused. So they struck its head to make it stand up, and it refused. They turned it around as if to go back to Yemen, and it got up and ran in that direction. They turned it to face towards Syria, and it did the same thing; they turned it to face towards the east, and it did the same thing; but when they turned it to face towards Makkah, it knelt down.\nWhilst they were like that, Allah, may He be exalted, sent against them birds in flocks from the sea. Each bird was carrying three stones, one in its beak and one in each of its feet; the size of the stones was like the size of chickpeas or lentils. None of the army were struck but his limbs were cut off and he died, but not all of them were struck; those who were spared fled, rushing towards the road by which they had come.\nSee: al-Lu\u2019lu\u2019 al-Maknun by al-\u2018Azimi (1/61).\nAs-Salihi said: When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to the bottom of Wadi Muhassir, he made his she-camel speed up and run quickly. This was his habit in places where the punishment of Allah had come down upon His enemies, and that was the place where there happened to the people of the elephant that which Allah has told us about.\nHence that wadi was called Wadi Muhassir, because the elephant halted (hasara) there and did not proceed any further.\nMuhassir is an area between Mina and Muzdalifah; it does not belong to either of them.\"(Subul al-Huda wa\u2019r-Rashad\u00a0 8/474).\nAl-Fayyumi said: Wadi Muhassir is between Mina and Muzdalifah.\nIt is named thus because the elephant of Abrahah grew tired there and could not proceed any further, which caused sorrow (hasarat) to its owners.\"(Al-Misbah al-Munir\u00a0 1/135).\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "What Prophet Muhammad Said about Business",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Prophet Muhammad\u2019s advice on business\nWe can sum up the teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to doing business, buying and selling, as follows:\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) worked in business before his mission began, with his paternal uncle Abu Talib, and he also worked for Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her), and he travelled for that purpose to greater Syria. He also did business in the markets; Majannah and \u2018Ukath were markets during the Jahiliyyah [the pre-Islamic era] to which merchants would come to buy and sell.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to engage directly in transactions himself, as we shall see below in the Hadith about the camel of \u2018Umar and the camel of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with them both). He also used to appoint one of his companions to do that for him, as in the case of \u2018Urwah ibn Abu Al-Ja\u2018d Al-Bariqi (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave him a Dinar to buy a sacrificial animal or a sheep for him. He bought two sheep and sold one for a Dinar, and he came back with a sheep and a Dinar. He (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) prayed for blessing for him in his business dealings, and (after that) if he had bought dust he would have made a profit.\u00a0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1258; Abu Dawood, 3384; Ibn Majah, 2402; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi.)\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to enjoin traders to be righteous and honest and to give charity.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Hakim ibn Hizam (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe two parties to a transaction have the option (of cancelling it) until they part. If they are honest and disclose any defects, their transaction will be blessed, but if they lie and conceal defects the blessing of their transaction will be erased.\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1973 and Muslim, 1532)\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Isma`il ibn `Ubayd ibn Rifa`ah from his father from his grandfather that he went out with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to the prayer place, and he saw the people engaging in trade. He said:\u00a0 \u201cO merchants!\u201d and they responded to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), craning their necks and looking up at him. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him said, \u201cThe merchants will be raised on the Day of Resurrection as evildoers, apart from those who fear Allah and are sincere and honest.\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1210; Ibn Majah, 2146; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib, 1785).\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Qays ibn Abu Gharazah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say: \u201cO merchants, selling involves idle talk and oaths, so mix it with Sadaqah (charity).\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1208; Abu Dawood, 3326; An-Nasa\u2019i, 3797; Ibn Majah, 2145; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawood.)\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to enjoin people to be tolerant and easy-going in buying and selling .\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Jabir ibn \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cMay Allah have mercy upon a man who is easy-going when he sells and when he buys and when he asks for payment.\u201d\u00a0(Al-Bukhari, 1970)\u00a0\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cIn this Hadith it is encouraged to be easy-going in transactions, to have the most sublime of attitudes, and to avoid miserliness, and it is encouraged to avoid putting pressure on people when asking for payment, and to take from them what they can afford.\u201d (Fath Al-Bari, 4/307)\u00a0\nExamples of the tolerance and easy-going nature of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) include the following:\u00a0\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was narrated that Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey, and I was riding on a recalcitrant young camel belonging to \u2018Umar. It kept getting the better of me and kept going ahead of the people, so \u2018Umar kept checking and making it go back. Then it went on ahead and \u2018Umar checked it and made it go back. Then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cSell it to me.\u201d He said: It is yours, O Messenger of Allah. He said: \u201cSell it to me.\u201d So he sold it to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIt is yours, O \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar; do with it whatever you will.\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2610)\u00a0\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was narrated from Jabir ibn \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was riding on a camel of his that had become exhausted to the point that he wanted to let it go. He said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) caught up with me and offered supplication for me, and he hit it and the camel started moving (energetically) as I had never seen it move before. He said: \u201cSell it to me for one Uqiyah.\u201d I said: No. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cSell it to me.\u201d So I sold it to him for one Uqiyah and stipulated that I be allowed to ride it home. When I arrived I brought the camel to him, and he gave me its price, then I left. He sent someone after me and said: \u201cDid you think that I bargained with you in order to take away your camel? Take your camel and its price; they are both yours.\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1991 and Muslim, 715)\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to give people their rights and urge others to do likewise.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man was owed a camel of a certain age by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so he came to him to ask him to repay him, and he said: \u201cGive him.\u201d They looked, but they could not find anything but a camel that was older than his, so he said: \u201cGive him.\u201d He said: You have paid me back in full, may Allah reward you. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cVerily the best of you are those who are the best in paying off debts.\u201d (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2182 and Muslim, 1601)\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to urge people to let a buyer cancel the transaction if he regrets it.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever lets a Muslim off (a transaction), Allah will relieve him of his distress on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3460 and Ibn Majah, 2199; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\u00a0\nLetting someone off means being easy-going and agreeing to cancel a sale or purchase; it is indicative of generosity of spirit.\u00a0\nWhat is meant by letting someone off a sale is: if someone buys something from a man, then regrets his purchase, either because he feels that he did not get a good deal, or because he no longer has any need of it, or because he does not have the wherewithal to pay for it, so he returns the item to the seller and the seller agrees to take it back, Allah will remove his hardship and distress on the Day of Resurrection, because of his kindness towards the buyer, because the transaction has been finalised, so the purchaser could not cancel it.\" (`Awn Al-Ma`bud)\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to bargain with people when buying , but he would not go so far as to undermine the real value of the item, as we have seen above in the Hadith about the camel of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him).\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Suwayd ibn Qays (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Makhramah Al-`Abdi and I brought some garments from Hajar to Makkah. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to us on foot and bargained with us for some trousers, and we sold them to him. (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1305 \u2013 he said: it is authentic.

But what has been narrated of his Sunnah is sufficient, in sha Allah.\nFor more details, please see this category: Business and Financial Transactions\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Was the Temple of Sulayman (peace be upon him) real or a myth?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThis temple which is mentioned in the question is what the Jews call Solomon\u2019s Temple.\nThe Hebrew word for the temple means the House of God.\u00a0\nAccording to Jewish narrations, David (Dawud \u2013 peace be upon him) was the one who lay the foundations for the building of the temple, but he died before he could begin its construction. His son Solomon (Sulayman \u2013 peace be upon him) is the one who undertook the building of the temple atop Mount Moriah, which is known as the plateau of the sanctuary. This is the place where al-Masjid al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock are located.\nThe Temple has a special place in the hearts and minds of the Jews, and they claim that it is the most important place of worship, and that Solomon built it for them and for their religion.\nSecondly:\nAfter the death of Sulayman (peace be upon him), his children disputed and his kingdom was divided into two kingdoms, each of which was ruled by one of the sons of Sulayman.\nThe first kingdom was in the north, and it was called the Kingdom of Israel or the Kingdom of Samaria; its capital was Nablus.\nThe second kingdom was in the south, and it was called the Kingdom of Judah; its capital was Jerusalem (al-Quds).\nThe Northern Kingdom of Israel was destroyed in 721 BCE.\nApproximately 150 years after that, the other kingdom, the Kingdom of Judah, was destroyed and the Jews tried to restore their kingdom and rebuild the temple.\nIn the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1926 CE edn.) it says: \u201cThe Jews look forward to bringing the Jewish people together in Palestine, restoring the Jewish state, rebuilding the Temple and establishing the throne of David in Jerusalem once more, to be ruled by a descendant of David.\u201d End quote.\nThirdly:\nThere is no historical book or authentic source which proves that Sulayman (peace be upon him) built the temple, and there is no proven date for that. But we will give a brief history of the supposed temple, as it is narrated in the books of the Jews, then we will explain after that that the temple of Solomon is no more than a myth, and in fact never existed.\n\nThe one who lay the foundations for the building of the temple was David (Dawud \u2013 peace be upon him), and the one who actually built it was Solomon (Sulayman \u2013 peace be upon him).\nIts construction took seven years, and more than 180,000 men took part in its construction.\nThe temple was destroyed for the first time by the Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BCE.\nSeveral decades after that, the captive Jews in Babylon were allowed to return to Jerusalem, so they returned and rebuilt the temple circa 521 BCE.\nThen the temple was destroyed again at the hands of Titus, the son of the Roman emperor Vespasian. This was the second destruction of the temple.\nSo that the Jews would not forget the temple, and so that it would remain alive in their memories, their rabbis introduced rituals and ceremonies that every Jew performs in order to remember the Temple, at the time of birth, at the time of death, at the time of marriage, when painting the house, and so on.\nThe second destruction of the temple occurred on the ninth day of the Hebrew month of Ab. The Jews fast on this day every year, in commemoration of this event.\nIn 135 CE (at the time of the Emperor Hadrian) the city was destroyed completely and the Jews were expelled from it. A new city was built in its place, which was called Aelia Capitolina. It continued to be known by this name until the Muslims entered it during the caliphate of the second caliph, \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), when it became known as al-Quds or Bayt al-Maqdis.\nIn 313 CE, the Emperor Constantine embraced Christianity, and began to build churches. The Church of the Resurrection was the first church to be built during that period, and the site of the temple became a rubbish dump, to spite the Jews.\nThe Jews were scattered throughout the earth, because of their treachery, their killing of the prophets, and their disobedience toward God \u2013 as the Jews themselves say. So they went to Arabia, Iraq, Egypt and Europe, and the Jews forgot Jerusalem and forgot the temple, until the nineteenth century CE, when they began to leaf through the pages of history, looking for any Jewish claims that would justify their return to Jerusalem.\nThey began to hold conference after conference. The first Zionist conference was held in the city of Basle in Switzerland in 1897 CE, led by Theodore Herzl, with the aim of establishing a national homeland for the Jews in Palestine, so that they would be able to rebuild the Temple.\nThe Jews claim that the Wailing Wall [which is located on the western side of al-Masjid al-Aqsa] is part of the remains of the Temple of Solomon.\nThe Jews claim that the restoration of their kingdom can only be brought about by returning to Jerusalem and rebuilding the Temple. They also claim that al-Masjid al-Aqsa is built on the ruins of the Temple. This means that there is no alternative to destroying al-Masjid al-Aqsa in order to rebuild the Temple, and that the kingdom of the Jews cannot be established unless that happens.\nThey also claimed that the Temple is the holiest place on the face of the earth.\n\nThis in brief is the story of the Temple as the Jews believe in it.\nFourthly:\nThere is a great deal of evidence which indicates that it is incorrect to attribute the temple to Sulayman (peace be upon him), and that Solomon\u2019s building of the temple is just one of the lies of the Jews. The evidence for that is abundant, some of which may be deduced from what the Jews themselves have written about the temple!\nThis evidence includes the following:\n1.\nThere is no authentic source to prove that Solomon (Sulayman \u2013 peace be upon him) built this Temple. The Holy Quran tells us the story of Dawud and Sulayman in numerous places, and it tells us the story of Sulayman and Balqis, and the hoopoe and the ant, and the jinn; some of these events would appear to be of less importance than the temple, so why does the Quran not speak about the temple, if it was as holy and significant as the Jews say?\n2.\nThis temple is not mentioned anywhere except in the books of the Jews, the content of which cannot be trusted, even the Bible itself. Many Jewish and Christian scholars and historians have admitted that the Bible has been subjected to distortion, tampering, additions and subtractions, which means that it cannot be regarded as a reliable historical source. It has no chain of narration going back to Moses (Musa \u2013 peace be upon him) or to any of the prophets who came after him, and their history is written in that book.\nRegarding the First and Second Books of Kings \u2013 which are the books that speak about the Temple \u2013 the Jews say that their author was Jeremiah the prophet, but this is false, because the events described in the second book go beyond the era of Jeremiah, so it does not make sense that he could have been its author. See: al-Madkhil ila al-Kitab al-Muqaddas by Habib Sa\u2018id (p. 99).\nHence many scholars and historians expressed doubts about these two Books.\nThe French scholar Dr. Maurice Bucaille says that scholars doubt the historical value of the Books of Samuel and the Books of Kings, as they mix historical events with myths; they contain multiple errors, and a single event may may be recounted twice or even three times.\nDirasat al-Kitab al-Muqaddas fi Daw\u2019 al-Ma\u2018arif al-Hadithah (p. 34).\nMoreover, the scholars doubt the first and second Books of Chronicles, which also mention the building of Solomon\u2019s Temple.\nMany Jewish and Christian scholars also doubt the entire Old Testament and do not regard it as an authentic source. They include Will Durant, the author of the Story of Civilization, the Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza, the French doctor Maurice Bucaille, and others.\nThe author of Mawsu\u2018at Bayt al-Maqdis says: The building of the Temple is the matter of myth and imagination. The Jews attributed it to Sayyiduna Sulayman, but the story of the building of the temple is not recognized by history, and there is no source for it except the books of the Jews. End quote.\n3.\nThe books of the Bible which speak of the temple contradict one another, which indicates that it is not a holy book and was not revealed by Allah; rather it is the writings of human beings which is falsely attributed to Allah.\nOne of these contradictions is that the First Book of Kings states that the number of Solomon\u2019s chief officers or foremen, who supervised the workers, was 3300 men (1 Kings 5:14-16).\nIn the Second Book of Chronicles, it says that the number was 3600 (2 Chronicles 2:2, 18).\nThey claim that these books are a revelation from God to the prophets who came after Solomon, so it is impossible that there could be any difference or contradiction between them.\n4.\nThe one who studies the Bible texts having to do with the building of the temple will be astonished and shocked, and he will be certain that the story of its construction is a myth and fable that has no basis in reality.\nThat is because the texts describe an immense structure, perhaps one of the greatest buildings known to humanity. The materials used in its construction and the number of workers are imaginary, exaggerated beyond the bounds of logic.\nThe amount of gold used was one hundred thousand talents [a talent is equivalent to approximately 16 g], in other words, 1.6 tons of gold!\nThe amount of silver was one million talents; in other words, 16 tons of silver!\nThe amount of iron and copper is not mentioned, because it was a huge amount, and the amount of wood and stone used was even more than that.\nThe number of workers who took part in the construction was 180,000, of whom 30,000 Solomon sent to Lebanon to cut down trees there.\nThey were supervised by chief officers or foremen numbering 3600 or 3400, according to differences in the texts about their number.\nDespite all these materials and workers, how long, wide and tall was the temple?\nThe Bible says that the temple was sixty cubits long (approximately 30 metres); it was twenty cubits (10 metres) wide, and thirty cubits (15 metres) high. The porch (courtyard) in front of it was twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.\n1 Kings 6; 2 Chronicles 3.\nIn other words, the size of the temple was 30 metres x 10 metres x 15 metres, and the area it covered was 300 m\u00b2, with a height of four or five storeys.\nDoes it make sense to suggest that all these materials were used, and 180,000 workers participated in its construction for a period of seven years, for the sake of such a small building?\u00a0\nThese lies and exaggerations have no aim except to imbue this alleged structure with a kind of grandeur and majesty.\n5.\nThe Jews themselves are not agreed on one temple or one location. The Jews of the kingdom of Samaria (Samaritans) say that their temple was in the city of Nablus, not in Jerusalem; others say that it was in the village of Beitin, north of Jerusalem; a third group say that their temple was built on the hill of Dan (the judge), and so on. All of this confirms that the story of the temple is a myth, because none of these structures exist and no trace of them has ever been found.\n6.\nThose who mention these structures affirmed that they were completely destroyed. Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 CE and became ruins, including the temple. Searching for a building that was completely destroyed two thousand years ago is utterly pointless.\n7.\nThe historical evidence indicates that the one who built al-Masjid al-Aqsa was Ibrahim or his grandson Ya\u2018qub (peace be upon them both). That was hundreds of years before Sulayman. So it does not make sense to suggest that Sulayman would destroy a place that was built by a prophet like him for the worship of Allah, may He be exalted, for the sake of building a temple on it.\nAl-Bukhari (3366) and Muslim (520) narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, which mosque on earth was built first? He said: \u201cAl-Masjid al-Haram (in Makkah).\u201d I said: Then which? He said: \u201cAl-Masjid al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem).\u201d I said: How long was there between the two? He said: \u201cForty years.\u201d\nSee: al-Bidayah wa\u2019l-Nihayah (1/375); al-Tahrir wa\u2019l-Tanwir (4/15).\nSee also question no. 224401 .\n8.\nVeneration of the temple is an ancient pagan belief that existed in the ancient pagan countries in Iraq, Syria and Egypt. They believed that the gods resided in heaven, and that if they wanted to come down to earth, they could only reside in large houses [temples].\nOne researcher, Ahmad Sousa, who converted to Islam from Judaism, questioned the idea of the temple as it is described in the Jewish Bible. He was of the view that it was an idea that was alien to Judaism, and that it was a pagan Canaanite idea.\n9.\nThe Jews began to excavate underneath al-Masjid al-Aqsa to search for traces and remains of Solomon\u2019s Temple in 1968 CE.\nThe Jewish archaeologist Israel Flenkstein stated that archaeologists did not find any archaeological evidence indicating that the Temple actually existed, and he regarded the idea of the existence of the Temple as a mere myth that did not exist, and that the writers of the Torah in the third century added stories that did not happen.\nThis was also mentioned by other archaeologists who participated in the excavations beneath al-Masjid al-Aqsa. The American archaeologist Gordon Franz stated that there is no evidence of the presence of the Temple in this place (underneath al-Masjid al-Aqsa), and when he was asked: Where is the location of the Temple? He replied: I don't know, and no one knows.\nMoreover, archaeologists have unearthed some things from a time before that of David and Solomon, and others from later times; this is one of the strongest proofs that the Temple of Solomon is nothing but a myth, written by the writers of the Bible who falsely attributed it to God, and these are the ones of whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{ So woe to those who write the \"scripture\" with their own hands, then say, \"This is from Allah ,\" in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn}\u00a0[Al-Baqarah 2:79].\n10.\nThe Jews claim that the Buraq Wall (which they call the Wailing Wall) is part of their alleged temple. This claim was disproven and demonstrated to be false by modern scientific studies. An international committee was sent to investigate the events of al-Buraq that took place in 1930 CE. The committee\u2019s work was scientific and historical, and the committee proved in its report that the Buraq Wall belongs to the Arabs (Muslims).\n11.\nNo historian said that when the Muslims entered Jerusalem at the time of \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab, they found in it any Jewish place of worship and destroyed it, and built a mosque in its place.\n12.\nThe building which it is proven that Sulayman (peace be upon him) built to be a place of worship is al-Masjid al-Aqsa, which he (peace be upon him) rebuilt and refurbished. Sulayman\u2019s rebuilding of al-Masjid al-Aqsa was confirmed by the Christian historian Ibn al-\u2018Ibri (d. 1286 CE), who said: \u201cIn the fourth year of his reign, Solomon began to build Bayt al-Maqdis, which is known as al-Masjid al-Aqsa.\u201d End quote.\n13.\nIf we assume, for the sake of argument, that this temple existed, and that Dawud (peace be upon him) is the one who lay the foundations for the building of this temple, and that his son Sulayman is the one who completed it, then we \u2013 Muslims \u2013 are more entitled to this temple than the Jews, because this temple was built by Dawud and Sulayman to be a place of worship for those who believed in them and in all the prophets and messengers, so it is a temple for the monotheists who believed in the prophets and worshipped Allah, may He be exalted, and affirmed His oneness, and it is not a temple for the killers of the prophets or for those who disbelieved in Dawud and Sulayman and denied their prophethood, and claimed that they were merely two kings, and even attributed to them polytheism and idol worship. We \u2013 the Muslims \u2013 have a greater right to that temple, if it exists, because we believe in them as two of the noble prophets of Allah, may He be exalted.\n14.\nWhat is known to the Jews is that the Bible was written during the period of captivity in Babylon, and we have noted above that the Jews were allowed to return to Palestine after many years of captivity. Perhaps the writers added some fables about the temple so as to encourage the Jews to return to Jerusalem.\nAll this evidence \u2013 and more \u2013 indicates that the issue of the temple is mere lies that were written by the authors of the Bible and attributed to God, to connect the Jews to that city and encourage them to return to it, based on the argument that their kingdom could not be complete except by rebuilding this alleged temple.\nThere are many books and essays that have been written about the temple. For example, see: al-Haykal al-Maz\u2018um bayna al-Wahm wa\u2019l-Haqiqah by Dr. \u2018Abd al-Nasir Qasim al-Farra, and Naqd al-Maza\u2018im al-Suhyuniyyah fi Haykal Sulayman by Dr. Salih Husayn al-Raqab.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Al-Masjid al-Aqsa is not the Temple and was not built on its ruins",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nPreviously, in the answer to question no. 230200 , we noted that the Temple was a place of worship, and that what the Jews call the Temple of Solomon is not real; rather it is a myth and one of the lies of the Jews.\nThe temple which it is proven that Sulayman (peace be upon him) built is in fact al-Masjid al-Aqsa, and he actually rebuilt it; he did not build it for the first time.\nSecondly:\nThe first masjid to be built on the face of the earth for the worship of Allah, may He be exalted, alone, is al-Masjid al-Haram, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Makkah - blessed and a guidance for the worlds}\u00a0[Al \u2018Imran 3:96].\n\u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u201cThere were houses before it, but it was the first house that was built for the worship of Allah, may He be exalted.\u201d(Tafsir Ibn Kathir 2/77).\nThen forty years after that, Ibrahim or his grandson Ya\u2018qub (peace be upon them both) built al-Masjid al-Aqsa.\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us about that, in the report narrated by al-Bukhari (3366) and Muslim (520) from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, which mosque on earth was built first? He said: \u201cAl-Masjid al-Haram (in Makkah).\u201d I said: Then which? He said: \u201cAl-Masjid al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem).\u201d I said: How long was there between the two? He said: \u201cForty years.\u201d\nAl-\u2018Allamah al-Tahir ibn \u2018Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat appears to be the case is that when Ibrahim passed through the land of al-Sham (Greater Syria, including Palestine) and Allah promised him that his progeny would inherit this land, Allah showed him the place where the biggest masjid that his progeny would build would be. So he built a small masjid there, in gratitude to Allah, may He be exalted, and he built it on the rock that was allocated for the purpose of offering sacrifices. This is the rock on which Sulayman built the masjid. But as the people of that time were polytheists, that structure was neglected and disappeared, until Allah guided Sulayman to build al-Masjid al-Aqsa on it. This is knowledge that the Jewish books ignore and do not mention.\"(Al-Tahrir wa\u2019l-Tanwir\u00a0 4/15).\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAccording to the People of the Book, Jacob (Ya\u2018qub \u2013 peace be upon him) was the one who laid the foundations of al-Masjid al-Aqsa, which is the masjid of Aelia, the masjid of Bayt al-Maqdis, may Allah honour it.\nThis is valid, and is supported by the hadith that we have quoted above.\"(Al-Bidayah wa\u2019l-Nihayah\u00a0 1/375).\nIt is very clear that this masjid (al-Masjid al-Aqsa) was not built as a place of worship exclusively for the Jews; rather it was built as a masjid for the believers who affirm the oneness of Allah to worship Allah, may He be exalted, in it.\nThe believers are the followers of the prophets in all eras, and it is they who are most deserving of this masjid, until the divine message ended with our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), the last of the prophets and messengers. So he is the most deserving of this masjid, because no person\u2019s faith is valid or has any value, after he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent, unless he believes in Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as a prophet and messenger, and follows him.\nOur Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led all the Prophets in prayer in this masjid, on the night of the Isra\u2019 and Mi\u2018raj (night journey and ascent to heaven).\nThis indicates that the role of leading mankind in the path of monotheism and the true religion was passed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and that what is required of all people \u2013 including the followers of the earlier prophets \u2013 is to be among his followers, for he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is the most deserving of this mosque, and his followers inherited that right and it will be theirs until the onset of the Hour.\nThirdly:\nThe view that there was no masjid before Islam is undoubtedly false, because Islam (in the sense of affirming Allah\u2019s oneness and obeying Him) is the religion of all the prophets, and the structure that is built for the purpose of prostrating to Allah, may He be exalted, in it and worshipping Him in it is a masjid. This word was known before the sending of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThis blessed masjid [al-Masjid al-Aqsa] was not intended, when it was first built, to be only for the followers of the Jewish religion, and in all the texts of the Qur\u2019an and Sunnah, it was not referred to by the word which refers to Jewish houses of worship. This word is \u201csalawat\u201d, which appears in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, \u201cOur Lord is Allah.\u201d And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues [salawat], and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned}\u00a0[al-Hajj 22:40].\nIbn \u2018Abbas, \u2018Ikrimah, al-Dahhak and Qatadah said regarding the meaning of the word \u201csalawat\u201d here: It refers to the synagogues of the Jews.\nAl-\u2018Allamah al-Tahir ibn \u2018Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSalawat is the plural of salah; here it refers to the synagogues of the Jews. It is arabized from the word salutha; when it was arabized the \u2018th\u2019 was replaced with \u2018t\u2019, and it was made plural.\"(Al-Tahrir wa\u2019l-Tanwir\u00a0 17/278).\nWhat the Holy Qur\u2019an calls a masjid cannot be a Christian church or Jewish synagogue; rather it is a masjid in Islamic terminology from the earliest time, going back to the religion of Ibrahim al-Khalil (peace be upon him). When the Jews and Christians inherited it from their monotheist ancestors, it was still called a masjid, and was never regarded as a place of worship that was specifically for the worship of these two religions.\nEven during the eras of the noble prophets, Musa, Sulayman, \u2018Isa and others, it was called a masjid, so the followers of these prophets have no right to change the name by which it was originally called, which is a masjid.\nHence it says in the hadith of al-Harith al-Ash\u2018ari from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): \u201cYahya gathered the Children of Israel in Bayt al-Maqdis, until the masjid was full and people sat in the balconies.\u201d Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (28/404); classed as sahih by the commentators.\nThere is also the hadith of \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018As, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cSulayman ibn Dawud (peace be upon him) asked Allah for three things. He was granted two, and we hope that he will be granted the third. He asked Him for judgement that was in accordance with His judgement, and Allah granted him that; he asked Him for a kingdom such as would not belong to anyone after him, and He granted him that; and he asked Him that if any man went out of his house only wanting to pray in this masjid [al-Masjid al-Aqsa], that he would emerge free of sin as on the day his mother bore him. We hope that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has granted that to him.\u201d Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (11/220); classed as sahih by the commentators.\nAllah, may He be exalted, tells us about the People of the Cave (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThose who prevailed in the matter said: We will surely build a masjid over them\u201d\u00a0[al-Kahf 18:21].\nAl-Alusi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cWhat appears to be the case, based on the above, is that the masjid is a structure that is usually built for anyone who wants to worship Allah, may He be exalted, in it.\"(Ruh al-Ma\u2018ani\u00a0 8/225).\nThe People of the Cave \u2013 according to what was mentioned by some commentators \u2013 were Christians.\nIt says in al-Mufassal fi Tarikh al-\u2018Arab qabl al-Islam (11/177): \u201cMasjid\u201d is a word that was well known among the pre-Islamic Arabs. It refers to a house in which people prostrate, and any place of worship is a masjid. End quote.\nThis means that there is no error in calling al-Masjid al-Aqsa a masjid before the sending of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because this is the name by which Allah calls it in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Glory be to Him Who took His slave for a journey by night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, the environs of which We have blessed, so that We might show him some of Our signs. Verily, He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing}\u00a0[al-Isra\u2019 17:1].\nWhen this verse was revealed, the polytheists did not find this name strange and they did not say, \u201cWe do not know what al-Masjid al-Aqsa is.\u201d They did not reject this name, which indicates that this name was known to them.\nThus we know that al-Masjid al-Aqsa is the name which will endure until the Day of Resurrection, by Allah\u2019s leave. At the same time, it is the historical name by which the prophets called it.\nFourthly:\nAs for saying that everyone who existed at the time of Sulayman (peace be upon him) was Jewish, this statement is no less flawed than the previous one.\nThe Jewish system of law and religion is not for all people; rather it is a system of law that is only for one group of humans, namely the descendants of Jacob (Ya\u2018qub \u2013 peace be upon him).\nSince the time of Ya\u2018qub (peace be upon him) there have always been other groups of humans, Arabs and others, and the matter continued like that at all times, at the time of Yusuf, then Musa, then Dawud, then Sulayman\u2026 then \u2018Isa.\nBut at all those times, there were monotheists other than the Jews.\nAll of these matters are obvious and basic principles of the Jewish religion and system of laws, which confirm that this religion is exclusive and is not universal. This means that many of the nations and peoples around the Jews were monotheists who followed the way of Ibrahim, and Musa (peace be upon him) was not sent to them with the Jewish religion.\nBut arrogance makes people deny obvious facts and be unfair in ruling, so as to provide a cover for occupation, murder and confiscation of land, and to promote Zionist terrorist ideology in the name of religion or history.\nFifthly:\nAs for the Kingdom of Judah and Kingdom of Israel, after the death of Sulayman (peace be upon him), his children disputed and his kingdom was divided into two kingdoms, each of which was ruled by one of the sons of Sulayman.\nThe first kingdom was in the north, and it was called the Kingdom of Israel or the Kingdom of Samaria; its capital was Shechem (Nablus) and its king was Jeroboam. The Israelite tribes swore allegiance to him, except for Judah and Benjamin.\nThe second kingdom was in the south, and it was called the Kingdom of Judah; its capital was Jerusalem (al-Quds) and its king was Rehoboam. Two of the Israelite tribes swore allegiance to him, namely Judah and Benjamin.\nThe Northern Kingdom of Israel was destroyed in 721 BCE.\nIn 586 BCE, the Babylonian leader Nebuchadnezzar entered al-Quds and destroyed it, and he destroyed and burned the temple, and took thousands of Jews with him as captives to Babylon, in what is historically known as the first Babylonian captivity. Then he went back to the city and destroyed it again, in what is known as the second Babylonian captivity, which put an end to the Kingdom of Judah.\nThe Jews strove to regain their kingdom and rebuild the temple.\nIn the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1926 CE edn.) it says: \u201cThe Jews look forward to bringing the Jewish people together in Palestine, restoring the Jewish state, rebuilding the Temple and establishing the throne of David in Jerusalem once more, to be ruled by a descendant of David.\u201d End quote.\nSixthly:\nAs for the going astray of the Jews and their distortion of the Torah, despite the coming of many prophets to them, this is something that indeed happened and cannot be hidden. They turned away from monotheism to polytheism several times after the death of Musa (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, repeatedly sent prophets to them to revive the law of the Torah and guide them back to monotheism, but \u2013 in most cases \u2013 they rejected and fought these prophets and killed some of them. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with something that was not in accordance with your desires, you became arrogant; some you disbelieved, and others you killed?}\u00a0[Al-Baqarah 2:87].\nAnd they distorted their Book, adding to it and taking away from it.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "How did humans procreate after the death of Habil?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing in the Qur\u2019an or Sunnah to indicate that the progeny of Adam (peace be upon him) were limited to Qabil and Habil. Rather the scholars narrated that Adam (peace be upon him) had many children, from whom humanity are descended. This is what is indicated by the apparent meaning of the Qur\u2019an, in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. Fear Allah, in Whose name you demand your mutual [rights], and be mindful of your ties of kinship. Indeed Allah is ever, over you, an Observer}\u00a0[an-Nisa\u2019 4:1].\nIbn Jarir at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt was said that Hawwa\u2019 bore Adam one hundred and twenty sets of twins. The first of them were Qabil and his twin sister Qalima, and the last of them was \u2018Abd al-Mughith and his twin sister Amat al-Mughith. Ibn Ishaq was quoted as saying that all the children that Hawwa\u2019 bore Adam were forty children, male and female, from twenty twin pregnancies. And he said: The names of some of them have come down to us, and the names of others have not.\"(Tarikh al-Umam wa\u2019l-Muluk\u00a0 1/98).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe historians stated that Adam (peace be upon him) did not die until he had seen four hundred thousand of his progeny \u2013 his children and grandchildren.\"(Al-Bidayah wa\u2019n-Nihayah\u00a01/96).\nIn addition to that, Muhammad ibn Ishaq \u2013 who is one of the scholars who had knowledge of lineages and history \u2013 stated that the lineages of all humanity go back to Shith ibn Adam, and that the lineages of the children of Adam other than Shith disappeared and became extinct. This is mostly taken from the People of the Book.\nIbn Jarir at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAll the descendants of Adam today are descended from Shith. That is because the progeny of all the sons of Adam except for Shith have disappeared and became extinct, and not one of them remains. So the lineages of all people today go back to Shith (peace be upon him).\u00a0\"(Tarikh al-Umam wa\u2019l-Muluk (1/103). See also: at-Tabsirah by Ibn al-Jawzi (1/36, 24) and al-Bidayah wa\u2019n-Bihayah\u00a01/98).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the period between Adam and Nuh (peace be upon them both), this is stated in a hadith which was classed as sahih by some of the scholars:\nIt was narrated from Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said: O Messenger of Allah, was Adam a Prophet? He said: \u201cYes; he was spoken to.\u201d The man said: How long was there between him and Nuh? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cTen generations.\u201d\nNarrated by Ibn Hibban in his Sahih (14/69). It was also narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (2/262); he said: It is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim, and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him. Ibn Kathir said in al-Bidayah wa\u2019n-Nihayah (1/94): This is according to the conditions of Muslim, although he did not narrate it.

        "question": "Who are the Tabi\u2018in? And who are those who came after the Tabi\u2018in?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Tabi\u2018in are those who came after the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and did not meet the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); rather they met the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and learned from them.\nThose who came after of the Tabi\u2018in are those who did not meet the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); rather they met the Tabi\u2018in and learned from them.\nThe Tabi\u2018i, in hadith terminology, is the one who met the Companion, but it is not stipulated that he should have spent a long time with him, according to the correct view. Anyone who met the Companions and died as a Muslim is a Tabi\u2018i, and some of them are better than others.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Nukhbat al-Fikr (4/724): The Tabi\u2018i is the one who met the Companion. End quote.\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Khatib al-Baghdadi said: The Tabi\u2018i is the one who met the Companion. From the words of al-Hakim, it may be understood that the name Tabi\u2018i may be applied to the one who met the Companion and narrated from him, even if he did not spend time with him. End quote.\nAl-\u2018Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Alfiyah (p. 66):\nThe Tabi\u2018i is the one who met the one who accompanied [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)].\nThose who came after the Tabi\u2018in are those who met the Tabi\u2018in but did not meet the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).\nThe Tabi\u2019in include people such as: Sa\u2018id ibn al-Musayyib, \u2018Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, al-Hasan al-Basri, Muhajid ibn Jabr, Sa\u2018id ibn Jubayr, \u2018Ikrimah the freed slave of Ibn \u2018Abbas, and Nafi\u2018 the freed slave of Ibn \u2018Umar.\nThose who came after the Tabi\u2018in include people such as ath-Thawri, Malik, Rabi\u2018ah, Ibn Hormuz, al-Hasan ibn Salih, \u2018Abdullah ibn al-Hasan, Ibn Abi Layla, Ibn Shubrumah and al-Awza\u2018i.\nSecondly:\nAl-Bukhari (3651) and Muslim (2533) narrated from Ibn Mas\u2018ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe best of people are my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come people whose testimony will come before their oath, and their oath before their testimony.\u201d\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe correct view is that his generation were the Companions, the second generation were the Tabi\u2018in, and the third generation were those who came after the Tabi\u2018in.\"(Sharh an-Nawawi \u2018ala Muslim\u00a016/85).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words \u201cthen those who come after them\u201d mean the generation who followed them, namely the Tabi\u2018in, and \u201cthen those who come after them\u201d refers to the generation who came after the Tabi\u2018in.\"(Fath al-Bari\u00a0 7/6).\nAl-Qari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs-Suyuti said: The correct view is that this word \u2013 al-qarn (generation) \u2013 does not have a defined duration. The Prophet\u2019s generation, namely the Companions, lasted from the time his mission began until the last of the Companions died, approximately one hundred and twenty years. The generation of the Tabi\u2018in lasted until approximately 170 AH, and the generation of those who came after the Tabi\u2018in lasted until approximately 220 AH. During this time, innovations appeared and became widespread, the Mu\u2018tazilah began to preach their misguided notions, philosophers began to spread their misguided ideas, the scholars were put to trial and forced to say that the Qur\u2019an was created, and circumstances changed drastically, and things have only been getting worse until now.

        "question": "A brief biography of al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf ath-Thaqafi",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf ath-Thaqafi was the governor of Iraq for the caliph \u2018Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan. He was known for oppression and bloodshed, showing disrespect to the early generations [the Sahaabah and Taabi\u2018een] and transgressing all the sacred limits of Allah for the slightest reason. The historians and biographers are unanimously agreed that he was one of the worst oppressors and the quickest to shed to kill people unlawfully. He did not show respect to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in the way he treated his companions, and he showed no respect to the Prophet\u2019s instructions to show kindness and respect to the scholars and people of virtue and righteousness among the followers of his companions. He was a vile Naasibi who hated \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) and his family.\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHe was a Naasibi who hated \u2018Ali and his supporters so as to appease the family of Marwaan, namely Banu Umayyah. He was a stubborn tyrant, always ready to shed innocent blood for the slightest reason.\nSome ugly and abhorrent words were narrated from him, the apparent meaning of which sounds like disbelief (kufr). If he had repented from that and given it up, that would have been counted in his favour, otherwise he is responsible for what he said. But there is the fear that these reports may have been inaccurate, with things added to what he said, because the Shi\u2018ah hated him intensely for many reasons, and they may have distorted some of his words and added to what they narrated from him some abhorrent and ugly words.\" (Al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah\u00a09/153).\nIt was narrated from Asma\u2019 bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said to al-Hajjaaj: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that among Thaqeef there would be a liar and a shedder of blood. As for the liar, we have seen him; as for the shedder of blood, I do not think but that you are he.\nThe shedder of blood is the one who goes to extremes in killing people.\nFrom an early age al-Hajjaaj was known to be intelligent, well-spoken and eloquent, and a hafiz of Qur\u2019an. Some of the early generations said: al-Hajjaaj used to recite the entire Qur\u2019an every night. Abu \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018Ala\u2019 said: I have never seen anyone more eloquent [in Arabic] than him and al-Hasan al-Basri, but al-Hasan was more eloquent than him.\n\u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018Aamir said: I think that in terms of intelligence, people are close to one another, except al-Hajjaaj and Iyaas ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah, for their intelligence stood out in comparison to other people.\" (Al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah 9/138-139).\nIbn Katheer said:\nIt was narrated to us that he was a religious person with regard to keeping away from intoxicants. He recited Qur\u2019an a great deal and avoided other sins. It was not known that he ever committed fornication; however, he would not hesitate to shed the blood of innocent people. Allah, may He be exalted, knows best what is true and how matters really were, what is hidden of such matters and what is concealed in people\u2019s hearts.\nThe worst of his evil deeds that made people hate him and it is proven that he did it was shedding blood. That is sufficient to make him deserve punishment from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. However, he was very keen to engage in jihad and conquer many lands. He was very generous and gave gifts to the people of the Qur\u2019an; he would spend a great deal on the reciters of the Qur\u2019an and when he died, he did not leave behind anything except three hundred dirhams, or so it was said.\" (Al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah\u00a0 9/153).\nHe was a man of great chivalry, but he often hastened to use his sword unlawfully. He killed many people for the slightest reason\u00a0 whom he had no right to kill, and when he got angry he would act on his anger (and wreak vengeance, punishing people) as if he were a king.\u00a0\" (Al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah\u00a09/138).\nHe went to extremes in transgressing the limits and would hasten to do evil; he would bear grudges and was filled with envy.\nIt was narrated from \u2018Aasim ibn Abi\u2019n-Najood and al-A\u2018mash that they heard al-Hajjaaj say to the people: By Allah, if I ordered you to exit through this door and you exited through that door, it would become permissible for me to shed your blood. If I find anyone reciting Qur\u2019an according to the recitation of Ibn Umm \u2018Abd [\u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018ood], I will strike his neck and erase it from\u00a0 that Mus-haf, even if I have to use the rib of a pig.\nAl-Asma\u2018i said: \u2018Abd al-Malik said to al-Hajjaaj one day: There is no one but he knows his shortcomings, so tell me about your shortcomings. He said: Let me off, O Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen. But he insisted, so al-Hajjaaj said: I am very stubborn, and my heart is filled with grudges and envy. \u2018Abd al-Malik said: Then you must be descended from Iblees!\" (Al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah\u00a09/149-153).\nA number of leading scholars were of the view that he was a disbeliever (kaafir), although most of the scholars did not think that he was a disbeliever. Some of the Sahaabah, such as Anas and Ibn \u2018Umar, prayed behind him, and if they had regarded him as a disbeliever, they would not have prayed behind him.\nIt was narrated that Qataadah said: It was said to Sa\u2018eed ibn Jubayr: Did you rebel against al-Hajjaaj? He said: By Allah, I did not rebel against him until he became a disbeliever.\nAl-A\u2018mash said: They differed concerning al-Hajjaaj, so they asked Mujaahid and he said: Are you asking me about this disbelieving old man?\nAl-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah (9/157-156).\nAsh-Sha\u2018bi said: al-Hajjaaj was a believer in taaghoot (falsehood), and a disbeliever in Allah the Almighty.\nAl-Qaasim ibn Mukhaymarah said: al-Hajjaaj is undoing the knots of Islam.\nIt was narrated that \u2018Aasim ibn Abi\u2019n-Najood said: There is no sacred limit ordained by Allah, may He be exalted, but al-Hajjaaj transgressed it.\" (Taareekh Dimashq\u00a0 12/185-188).\nAt-Tirmidhi narrated in his Sunan (2220) that Hishaam ibn Hassaan said: They counted how many people al-Hajjaaj captured then killed, and the number reached one hundred and twenty thousand.\n\u2018Umar ibn \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez said: If the nations were to compete in evildoing when al-Hajjaaj is part of our community, we would surpass them in evil because of his evil deeds. He was not good for the people\u2019s affairs in this world or in the hereafter.\" (Taareekh Dimashq\u00a0 12/185).\nHe was careless and heedless about prayer, and did not pray on time:\n\u2018Umar ibn \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez wrote to \u2018Adiy ibn Artaat, saying: I have heard that you are following in the footsteps of al-Hajjaaj. Do not follow in his footsteps, for he used to offer the prayer after the time for it had ended and take people\u2019s wealth unlawfully, and he was even more negligent with regard to other matters.\" (\u00a0Taareekh Dimashq\u00a012/187).\nAdh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHe was an oppressor, a tyrant, a Naasibi, an evil man and a shedder of blood.\nHe was very courageous, brave, devious, crafty, well-spoken and eloquent, and he had a great deal of respect for the Qur\u2019an.\nI have mentioned his bad conduct in at-Taareekh al-Kabeer, including his siege of Ibn az-Zubayr when he holed up at the Ka\u2018bah, how he launched projectiles at it with the catapult, and how he humiliated the residents of the Haramayn (the two holy cities of Makkah and Madinah); then his governorship of Iraq and the entire East (i.e., Persia) for twenty years; the rebellion of Ibn al-Ash\u2018ath against him; and his delaying of prayers until Allah eradicated him.\nWe revile him and do not love him; rather we hate him for the sake of Allah, for that is one of the strongest bonds of faith.\nHe did some good deeds, but they are like drops in the ocean of his evil deeds, and his ultimate fate is subject to the will of Allah.\nHe affirmed Allah\u2019s oneness (Tawheed) in general, and there are other oppressive tyrants and governors of his ilk. End quote.\nSiyar A\u2018laam an-Nubala\u2019 (4/343).\nTo sum up, the man did a great deal of wrong and transgressed against the people, and he wronged himself a great deal.\nHe did some good deeds, but they are like drops in the ocean of his evil deeds. However, he strove hard in jihad, fought the enemies of Allah, conquered lands and spread Islam.\nAllah, may He be exalted, will judge him. We condemn before Allah his oppression and transgression, and we declare our love and support for those of the Muslim leaders among the Sahaabah and Taabi\u2018een against whom he transgressed. We regard him as an enemy because of his mistreatment of them, and we leave his final judgement to Allah, may He be exalted.\nIt is better not to focus on him and worry about him. How good are the words narrated by Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) in az-Zuhd (p. 332) from Bilaal ibn al-Mundhir, who said: A man said: If I do not ask ar-Rabee\u2018 ibn Khaytham today about what happened, I will never find out his view. I said: O Abu Yazeed, the son of Faatimah (peace be upon her) \u2013 meaning al-Husayn \u2013 was killed. He said: Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raaji\u2018oon (Indeed we belong to Allah , and indeed to Him we will return), then he recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Say, \u201cO Allah , Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, You will judge between your servants concerning that over which they used to differ\u201d} [az-Zumar 39:46].\nI said: What do you say? He said: What should I say? To Allah they will return and Allah will bring them to account.\nAnd Allah knows best.\nSee: Wafiyyaat al-A\u2018yaan (2/29-46); Taareekh Dimashq (12/113-123); Taareekh al-Islam (5/310-316; 6/314-327)."

        "question": "A brief biography of the scholar of the ummah and interpreter of the Quran, \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Sahabi \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him)\n\u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abbas ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib ibn Haashim, Abu\u2019l-\u2018Abbas, the paternal cousin of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nHis mother was Lubabah bint al-Harith ibn Hazan ibn Bajiyyah ibn al-Hazam ibn Rubiyyah ibn \u2018Abdillah ibn Hilal ibn \u2018Amir ibn Sa\u2018sa\u2018ah al-Hilali.\nHe was called the scholar (al-habr) and the ocean (al-bahr), because of his abundant knowledge and his deep understanding of subtle issues. He was the scholar and faqih of the ummah, the spokesman of the tribe, a brilliant reflection of prophethood, the one for whom the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed that he would have deep understanding of the faith and of the Quran, thus he was known as the interpreter of the Quran.\nHe was born when Banu Hashim were in the gully, three years before the Hijrah; it was also said that it was five years before that, but the former view is more sound, and it is closer to what is narrated from him in as-Sahihayn: I was going about some errands, riding a female donkey \u2013 and at that time I had just reached the age of puberty \u2013 and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was praying in Mina, not facing towards any wall. I passed in front of part of the row, then I let the donkey loose so that it could graze, and I joined the row, and he did not object to me doing that. Narrated by al-Bukhari (76) and Muslim (504).\nIn Sahih al-Bukhari (6299) it is narrated that Sa\u2018id ibn Jubayr said: Ibn \u2018Abbas was asked: What age were you when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died? He said: At that time I was circumcised. He (the narrator) said: They used not to circumcise a boy until he reached puberty.\nIn Musnad Ahmad (3125) it is narrated from Sa\u2018id ibn Jubayr, from Ibn \u2018Abbas, that he said: I learned al-Muhkam [surahs in which nothing is abrogated] at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, I was ten years old. He (the narrator) said: I said to him: What is al-Muhkam? He said: al-Mufassal [i.e., the surahs from al-Hujurat to the end of the Quran].\nAl-Arnaut said: Its isnad is sahih according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed for him, asking Allah to grant him deep understanding of religion and to teach him the interpretation of the Quran (tafsir). He said: \u201cO Allah, grant him deep understanding of the faith and teach him the interpretation of the Quran.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari (143), Muslim (2477), and Ahmad (2397).\nHe also asked Allah to teach him wisdom. It was narrated from \u2018Ikrimah that Ibn \u2018Abbas said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) embraced me and said: \u201cO Allah, teach him wisdom.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari (3756).\n\u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab word bring him close to him and ask him questions, and he would let him attend gatherings with the elders of the people of Badr, to show them his knowledge and understanding. He would always have a ready answer and a radiant, handsome face. He had long hair dyed with henna; he was fair skinned and tall, with a yellowish complexion and a big build. His knowledge was abundant and many reports were narrated from him. An ignorant person would learn knowledge and wisdom from him, and a hungry person would have his fill of food and bread from him.\nHe (may Allah be pleased with him) died in at-Taif in 68 AH. The scholars differed concerning his age; it was said that he was seventy-one years old, or seventy-two, or seventy-four. The first is the strongest view.\nFor more information on his virtues, please see: Fadail as-Sahabah by Imam Ahmad (2/949); Ma\u2018rifat as-Sahabah by Abu Nu\u2018aym (3/1699); and al-Isabah by Ibn Hajar (4/122).\nSecondly:\nThe impact of the Prophet\u2019s supplication for \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abbas\nUndoubtedly the supplication of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), asking Allah to teach him wisdom, understanding of the faith and the interpretation of the Quran, had a great impact on Ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) in forming his character, in terms of faith, knowledge and ethics, and his keenness to seek knowledge and develop good understanding of the knowledge he acquired.\nIbn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) did not rely only on the supplication of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for him; rather he strove hard to accumulate and attain knowledge and to understand the religion of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, with all that he had of strength, energy, patience and resolve.\nHe began by staying close to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) from a very early age, until the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died.\nWhen the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, he turned to his senior Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), to the extent that he would fold his rida\u00a0into a pillow and lie at the door of one of them, so as to have the opportunity to learn hadith from him.\nIt was narrated from \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him): When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, I said to one of the Ansar: Let us go and ask the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about the sayings of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for they are many [and this is an opportunity to learn].\nThe man said: I am astonished at you, O Ibn \u2018Abbas. Do you think that people will need you, when there are still on earth what you see of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah?\nSo he did not like the idea, but I devoted myself to acquiring knowledge and seeking out the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), one after another, in order to learn from them. Sometimes I would hear that a man had heard some saying from the Messenger of Allah, so I would go to his house to ask him, but he would be having a siesta. So I would turn my rida\u00a0(upper garment) into a pillow and rest at his door, with the wind blowing in my face, until he came out.\nHe would say: What brings you here, O cousin of the Messenger of Allah?\nI would say: I have heard that you narrate something from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and I wanted to hear it from you.\nHe would say: Why did you not send for me so that I could come to you? And I would say: It is more appropriate for me to come to you.\nThat [Ansari] man would pass by me later on, and would see the people asking me questions, and he would say: You were wiser than me.\nNarrated by Imam Ahmad in Fadail as-Sahabah (2/976) (1925); ad-Darimi (590); and by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (363) \u2013 he said: It is sahih according to the conditions of al-Bukhari, and this report is usually quoted in the context of seeking hadiths and showing respect to the muhaddith. And adh-Dhahabi agreed with him.\nHence if Ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked: How did you acquire this knowledge? He said: By asking questions and understanding the answers.\nNarrated by Imam Ahmad in Fadail as-Sahabah (2/970 (1903); al-Bayhaqi in al-Madkhil ila as-Sunan al-Kubra (427).\nHence the supplication of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for Ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) was fulfilled. Allah granted him wisdom, which means that he was able to do the right thing and be precise, and to put things in their appropriate places.\nAllah granted him deep understanding of the faith, and He taught him the interpretation of the Quran, to the extent that he was known as the interpreter of the Quran and the scholar of the ummah.\nUndoubtedly when someone is given knowledge, understanding and wisdom, that will have an impact on his entire life, his faith, his worship, his piety, his attitudes and manners, his bearing, his smartness, his wisdom, his integrity and his sound views.\nHence \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) would let Ibn \u2018Abbas attend his gatherings with the elders of the people of Badr; he would consult him and ask him questions in front of them, to show them his knowledge, wisdom and understanding of the faith.\nIt was narrated by Sa\u2018id ibn Jubayr that Ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u2018Umar would let me attend his gatherings with the elders of Badr. One of them said: Why do you let this young man join us, when we have sons like him? He said: He is one of those whom you know.\n[Ibn \u2018Abbas] said: One day, [\u2018Umar] called them, and he called me with them, and I thought that he only called me on that day to show them how much knowledge I had. He said: What do you say about the verse {When the victory of Allah has come and the conquest \u2026} [an-Nasr 110:1] until the end of the surah? Some of them said: It is commanding us to praise Allah and seek His forgiveness because He granted us victory and conquest. And some of them said: We do not know, and some of them did not say anything. He said to me: O Ibn \u2018Abbas, do you agree?\nI said: No. He said: Then what do you say? I said: This refers to the approaching death of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), of which Allah informed him (in this surah). Allah told him: When the victory of Allah has come and the conquest \u2013 the conquest of Makkah \u2013 that is a sign of your approaching death, so glorify and praise your Lord and seek His forgiveness, for He is ever accepting of repentance. \u2018Umar said: I do not know anything about its meaning except what you know.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (4294).\nIt was narrated that Tawus said: By Allah, I never saw anyone who respected the sacred limits of Allah more than Ibn \u2018Abbas. By Allah, if I wanted to weep every time I mention him, I could do so.\nNarrated by Imam Ahmad in Fadail as-Sahabah (2/950).\nThis is a brief glimpse of this great scholar. But his virtues are many, as are his stories with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. We do not have room here to mention them all.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "How was life in Arabia before Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Before Islam, Arabia was in a very bad state. When they were blessed with Islam and became followers of this faith, the people of Arabia found themselves in the best state, for they became leaders of nations and the best nation that was ever brought forth for humanity.\nThe evil that was present in Arabia before Islam was manifested in many ways; we cannot list them all in this answer because there were so many. But this does not prevent us from mentioning the most significant of them. They include:\n\nBeliefs\n\n\nThe Arabs were idol worshippers; they would seek to draw close to them, offer sacrifices before them and venerate them completely. The idols were made by other humans like them, and sometimes they made them themselves, from dates, clay and other things. The number of idols around the Holy Ka\u2018bah was approximately 360.\n\nAllah, may He be exalted, says, describing those ignorant people (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd they worship other than Allah that which neither harms them nor benefits them, and they say, \u2018These are our intercessors with Allah\u2019\u201d\n[Yoonus 10:18].\n\nThey used to seek omens, so if one of them wanted to get married, or travel, or engage in trade, he would throw a bird into the air, and if it flew right, he would go ahead with his plans and would believe that they were good and beneficial, but if the bird flew left, he would cancel his plans and not go ahead with them, and would believe that they were bad.\n\nThey believed in evil omens; if one of them heard the sound of an owl, or saw a crow, he would feel anxious and believe that some harm would befall him on that day. They would not get married in the month of Shawwaal, believing that marriage in that month would not succeed.\n\nThe loyalty of the people of Arabia was to different great powers of their time. Some of them were loyal to the Byzantines, others to the Persians, and others to the Ethiopians.\n\n\nMorals and manners, conduct, and customs\n\n\nDuring the Jaahiliyyah, the Arabs would attack and kill one another for the most trivial of reasons. Wars among them would continue for many years, in which the men would be killed and the women and children taken captive.\n\nOne example of that was the War of al-Basoos, which lasted for thirty years, because of a she-camel that stepped on the egg of a lark [a type of bird] and broke it. Another was the War of Daahis and al-Ghabraa\u2019, which lasted for forty years, because one horse beat another in a race.\n\nThey did not refrain from eating unclean things. For example, they used to eat the meat of animals that died of natural causes, and drink blood.\nTribes other than Quraysh used to circumambulate the Ka\u2018bah (tawaaf) naked, women and men alike, if the people of Quraysh did not do them the favour of giving them clothes to wear. They believed that a garment in which one had committed sin was not fit to be worn when doing tawaaf. A woman would say: \u201cToday all of it or some of it appears, and whatever of it appears, I do not permit it\u201d!\nZina (fornication, adultery) was widespread among them, along with its consequences, the worst of which was attributing a child to someone other than the husband.\n\nIt was narrated that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah, the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: There were four types of marriage during the Jaahiliyyah [period before Islam]:\nOne type was like the marriage of people today: one man would ask another for permission to marry a woman under his guardianship or his daughter, and he would give her a dowry, then marry her.\nThe second type was when a man would say to his wife, when she became pure following her menses: Send for So-and-so and have relations with him. Then her husband would stay away from her and not touch her until it became clear that she had got pregnant from that man with whom she was having relations. When her pregnancy became evident, her husband would have relations with her if he wanted to. He only did that so that he might have a child with good characteristics. This kind of marriage was called nikaah al-istibdaa\u2018.\nAnother kind of marriage was where a group of men, less than ten, would get together and go to a woman, and all have relations with her. Then if she became pregnant and gave birth, a few days after giving birth she would send for them, and not one of them would refuse to come. When they all gathered before her, she would say to them: You know what you have done, and now I have given birth. He is your son, O So-and-so \u2013 naming whoever she wanted, and her child would be attributed to him and he could not refuse to take him.\nThe fourth type of marriage was where many people would go to a woman and she never refused anyone who came to her. Those were the prostitutes, who used to put flags at their doors as a sign, so anyone who wanted to could go in (and have relations with them). If one of them got pregnant and gave birth, all those men would be brought together and they would call those who were skilled in recognizing the resemblance of a child to his father, then they would attribute the child to the one whom those skilled people thought that he resembled; the child would be called his son, and he could not refuse that.\nBut when Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent with the truth, he abolished all the kinds of marriage that were known during the Jaahiliyyah, except the kind of marriage that people know today.\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (4834).\n\nThey used to kill their children because of the poverty they were suffering, or because they feared falling into poverty. Some of them would bury their daughters alive for fear that they would be taken captive, thus bringing shame upon them. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\u201cand do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them\u201d\n[al-An\u2018aam 6:151].\n\u201cAnd do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Indeed, their killing is ever a great sin\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:31]\n\u201cAnd when one of them is informed of [the birth of] a female, his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief.\nHe hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he has been informed. Should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground? Unquestionably, evil is what they decide\u201d\n[an-Nahl 16:58-59].\n\n\u00a0They felt pride in their forefathers and lineage, to the extent that they would remember their forefathers and boast of them during Hajj season and when performing the rituals of Hajj.\n\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, has taken away your pride of Jaahiliyyah and your boasting about your forefathers. One is either a righteous believer or a doomed evildoer. You are the sons of Adam and Adam was created from dust. Men should stop boasting about people [their forefathers] who are no more than the coal of Hell, or they will certainly be more insignificant before Allah than the beetle that rolls dung with its nose.\u201d\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (3955) and Abu Dawood (5116); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.\n\nThey used to deal in riba (usury) in various forms.\n\nJa\u2018far ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) summed up their situation during the Jaahiliyyah when he said before the Negus (ruler) in Ethiopia, when he migrated there: \u201cWe were a people of ignorance, worshipping idols, eating dead meat, committing abominations, severing ties of kinship, treating neighbours badly, and the strong among us devoured the weak.\nNarrated by Ahmad (3/265); classed as hasan by the commentators on al-Musnad.\n\nWomen during the Jaahiliyyah\n\nWomen were vulnerable to the worst types of mistreatment, humiliation and degradation during the Jaahiliyyah. That took many forms, apart from being buried alive in infancy, as referred to above:\n\nWomen would be deprived of inheritance altogether, so a woman would have no share of whatever wealth her son, father or mother left behind, even if it was great; rather they would treat her as chattels to be inherited! That is referred to in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\u201cO you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion\u201d\n[an-Nisaa\u2019 4:19].\nAl-Bukhaari (4303) narrated that Ibn \u2018Abbaas said: When a man died, his heirs would have more right to his wife. If one of them wanted to marry her, he would do so, and if they wanted to they would give her in marriage to someone else, or if they wanted to they would not arrange a marriage for her, because they had more right to her than her own family. Then this verse was revealed concerning that.\n\nThey would force a woman to marry someone she did not like, or they would prevent her from getting married.\nSome husbands would leave their wives suspended, as it were, so a woman would not be treated with dignity as his wife, but she would not be able to marry anyone else. For example, a man would forbid his wife to himself, and make her like his mother or sister; or he would swear an oath not to have intercourse with her, so she would be left hanging, as it were. Then Islam came and prohibited zihaar [a jaahili form of divorce in which a man would say to his wife, \u201cYou are to me like my mother\u2019s back]; and it set a time limit for the one who swore that he would not have intercourse with his wife, namely four months, after which he must either offer expiation for his oath and have intercourse with her, or he would be compelled to divorce her. This is what is called eelaa\u2019, and it is mentioned in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\u201cFor those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives is a waiting time of four months, but if they return [to normal relations] - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\nAnd if they decide on divorce - then indeed, Allah is Hearing and Merciful\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:226-227].\n\nWe may read what a wife used to do after her husband died:\n\nZaynab bint Abi Salamah said: If a woman\u2019s husband died, she would go into a hut and wear her worst clothes, and she would not put on perfume until one year had passed. Then an animal would be brought \u2013 a donkey or a sheep or a bird \u2013 and she would rub her hands over it, and rarely did (such a woman) rub her hands over anything but it died, then she would come out and would be given a piece of dung which she would throw.\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (5024) and Muslim (1489).\nIslam, with its wise rulings, changed all these ignorant customs and rulings, and replaced them with something better. We do not have room here to list all the changes that were made to the ways of Jaahiliyyah; doing so would require a large volume. It is sufficient for us to mention some of the ways of Jaahiliyyah and some of the changes that Islam brought. For more information, please see Buloogh al-Arab fi Ma\u2018rifat Ahwaal al-\u2018Arab by Mahmoud Shukri al-Aloosi; al-Mufassal fi Taareekh al-\u2018Arab qabl al-Islam; and Taareekh al-\u2018Arab qabl al-Islam.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Doubts about the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) and a response to those doubts",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.I.\nThe Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) \u2013 even though they are the best of people \u2013 were also human, and there occurred among them that which usually occurs among people of disputes and differences of opinion. But they were the swiftest of people in doing good, and they were the foremost in knowledge of the truth, acting upon it and the swiftest to acknowledge and correct their mistakes, if one of them made a mistake, like any other human.\nWhat is required of anyone who is accountable is to refrain from discussing the differences that arose among the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) and to think positively of every one of them.\nWhere could you find any people who are better than those who accompanied the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), migrated with him, strove with him in jihad, and prayed behind him?\nSee the answer to question no. 127028.\nII.\nIt was narrated by \u2018Abdullah ibn Ahmad in as-Sunnah (1312), Ibn Abi \u2018Aasim in as-Sunnah (1219) and al-Bayhaqi in al-I\u2018tiqaad (p. 358) that \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib said: No one gives me precedence over Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) but I shall flog him with the hadd punishment of one who fabricates lies.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is proven via many isnads from \u2018Ali that he said: No man will be brought to me who gives me precedence over Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar but I shall flog him with the hadd punishment of one who fabricates lies.\nEnd quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (4/479).\nHe also said:\nIt was narrated from \u2018Ali via approximately eighty isnaads or more that he said on the minbar of Kufah: The best of this ummah after its Prophet are Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar.\nEnd quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (4/407).\nIII.\nIt is proven in as-Saheehayn that \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib swore allegiance to Abu Bakr, even though it was delayed by a few months.\n\u2018Ali did not show any disagreement towards Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) or express any disapproval of the caliphate of Abu Bakr, and never expressed any dissent. Rather he delayed giving his allegiance to Abu Bakr. The reason for that was that he objected to Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar and others among the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) deciding the matter of the caliphate without him, despite his virtue, honour and high status, for he had the right to be present and be consulted about the matter, and that no decision should be taken without him.\nThe excuse that the Sahaabah gave was that they had hastened to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr so as to ward off fitnah and turmoil in the Muslim community, because they feared that disputes and conflicts might arise if they delayed it.\nAnother reason for the delay [in \u2018Ali swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr] was the fact that Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) got angry with Abu Bakr\u2019s response to her when she asked him about her inheritance (from the Prophet(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)], and \u2018Ali thought that he should show sympathy to her by staying away from Abu Bakr, especially since she was going through sorrow, distress and grief at the passing of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\n\u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) did not refuse to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him); rather he delayed doing so for the reasons mentioned above. Then he came and swore allegiance to him without being forced to do so.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\nIt is known via tawaatur reports that no one held back from swearing allegiance to him \u2013 namely Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) \u2013 except Sa\u2018d ibn \u2018Ubaadah. As for \u2018Ali and Banu Haashim, all of them swore allegiance to him, according to consensus, and none of them died until after swearing allegiance to him. But it was said that \u2018Ali delayed swearing allegiance to him for six months, or that he swore allegiance to him on the second day. Whatever the case, they swore allegiance to him without being forced to do so.\nEnd quote from Minhaaj as-Sunnah (8/232).\nSee also the answer to question no. 147540.\nIV.\nIt is not proven that \u2018Uthmaan beat \u2018Ammaar (may Allah be pleased with them both), let alone that \u2018Ali saw that and did not object. All of the reports that have been narrated concerning that are not sound in their isnaads (chains of narration).\nIbn Shabbah said in Taareekh al-Madinah (3/1098):\nAl-Qaasim ibn al-Fudayl told us: \u2018Amr ibn Murrah told me, from Saalim ibn Abi\u2019l-Ja\u2018d, who said: \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) called some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), among whom was \u2018Ammar, and said: I am going to ask you something; I adjure you by Allah, do you know that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to give precedence to Quraysh over all other people, and he used to give precedence to Banu Haashim over the rest of Quraysh? The people remained silent, so he said: If the keys of Paradise were in my hand, I would give them to Banu Umayyah so that all of them, to the last man, would enter it. By Allah, I would surely give to them and appoint them (to positions of authority), in spite of you. \u2018Ammar said: Inspite of me? \u2018Uthmaan said: In spite of you. \u2018Ammaar said: And in spite of Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar? \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) got angry and leapt up, and started to beat him severely, and the people intervened and pushed him away from \u2018Ammaar.\n\u00a0This is a da\u2018eef (weak) isnad. Saalim ibn Abi\u2019l-Ja\u2018d did not hear [reports] from \u2018Uthmaan. Al-Haafiz al-\u2018Alaa\u2019i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Saalim ibn Abi\u2019l-Ja\u2018d al-Kufi is well known; he narrated many mursal reports from the senior Sahaabah such as \u2018Umar, \u2018Ali, \u2018Aa\u2019ishah, Ibn Mas\u2018ood and others (may Allah be pleased with them). Abu Zar\u2018ah said: [Reports narrated by] Saalim ibn Abi\u2019l-Ja\u2018d from \u2018Umar, \u2018Uthmaan and \u2018Ali are mursal.\nEnd quote from Jaami\u2018 at-Tahseel (p. 179)\nIbn \u2018Abd Rabbihi said in al-\u2018Aqd al-Fareed (5/57):\nIn a hadith narrated by al-A\u2018mash from Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah, he said: The companions of \u2018Uthmaan wrote down his mistakes on a page and wrote down people\u2019s criticisms of him. They said: Who will take this to him? \u2018Ammaar said: I will. So he took it to him, and when he read it he [\u2018Uthmaan] said: May Allah cause your disgrace. \u2018Ammaar said: And Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar too? \u2018Uthmaan stood up and beat him until he fell unconscious. Then \u2018Uthmaan regretted it, and he sent Talhah and az-Zubayr to him to say to him: Choose one of three: either forgive me, or accept compensation for the injury, or retaliate in kind [qisas]. \u2018Ammaar said: By Allah, I will not accept any of them until I meet Allah! Abu Bakr [ibn Abi Shaybah, the narrator of this report] said: I mentioned this hadith to al-Hasan ibn Saalih, and he said: \u2018Uthmaan could not have done more than he did (to seek reconciliation).\nThis is a da\u2018eef (weak) isnad, like the previous report. Al-A\u2018mash is regarded as being among the junior Taabi\u2018een; he was born too late to have met \u2018Uthmaan or \u2018Ali or \u2018Ammaar.\nSee: Mizaan al-I\u2018tidaal (2/224) and at-Tahdheeb (4/196).\nIn fact, Ibn \u2018Abd Rabbihi, who quoted this report in his book, did not trace its isnad back to al-A\u2018mash. As it is possible that this report may be traced to someone who comes before al-A\u2018mash [in the chain of narration], it is also possible that it may be traced to someone who comes after him,\u00a0 whom Ibn \u2018Abd Rabbihi omitted between Ibn Abi Shaybah and al-A\u2018mash.\nIbn Abi Bakr al-Maaliqi said: If it is said that \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) beat \u2018Ammaar, it should be pointed out that this is not proven. Even if it could be proven, the imam (ruler) has the right to discipline some of his subjects, as he sees fit, even if he is mistaken.\nDo you not see that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) allowed people to settle scores with him. Similarly, Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) disciplined some of their subjects slapping and hitting with a stick, and they allowed others to settle the score with them.\nIf someone says that \u2018Uthmaan did not allow anyone to settle a score with him,\nIt should be said to him: How can that be true, when he made offers to that effect in an unprecedented manner, especially when he was under siege in his house, when he said: O people, if you find in the Book of Allah that you should put my feet in fetters, then do so.\u201d\nEnd quote from Shubuhaat hawla as-Sahaabah: Dhu\u2019n-Noorayn \u2018Uthmaan (p. 144).\nThere are sounder reports which contradict that. It was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in his Musannaf (7/521) and Ibn Shabbah in Taareekh al-Madinah (3/1101), via Husayn ibn \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan who said: Juhaym, a man from Banu Fihr, told me: I witnessed this event. He said: Sa\u2018d and \u2018Ammaar came and sent word to \u2018Uthmaan, saying: Please come; we want to remind you of something novel that you introduced, or things that you did. He sent word to them telling them: Leave for today, because I am busy; your appointment is on such and such a day.\nSo Sa\u2018d left, but \u2018Ammaar refused to leave.\nSo \u2018Uthmaan\u2019s messenger grabbed him and beat him.\nWhen they and those who were with them gathered at the appointed time, \u2018Uthmaan said to them: What grievances do you have against me?\nThey said: Our grievance is your beating of \u2018Ammaar.\n\u2018Uthmaan said: Sa\u2018d and \u2018Ammaar came, and I sent word to them, then Sa\u2018d left but \u2018Ammaar refused to leave, so a messenger grabbed him and beat without me instructing him to do that. By Allah, I did not give any instruction to that effect and I am not pleased with it. This is my hand for \u2018Ammaar; let him retaliate.\nThere is nothing wrong with this isnad, and its men are thiqaat (trustworthy). Juhaym is a Taabi\u2018i from whom two trustworthy narrators narrated, and he was classed as trustworthy by Ibn Hibbaan, so his hadith may reach the level of hasan.\nThis report is the soundest of those that were narrated about \u2018Uthmaan beating \u2018Ammaar.\nConclusion:\nIt is not proven that \u2018Uthmaan beat \u2018Ammaar in the first place, let alone any notion that he beat him in the presence of \u2018Ali and that \u2018Ali remained silent and did not defend him. What is required of us is to acknowledge the high status of the companions of our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), to love them and defend them.\nIt is not permissible to rely on everything that has been narrated in the books of history, except for that which is proven to be sound. How good are the words of Ibn Khaldoon:\nHow often the historians, mufassireen and narrators of reports make mistakes in the stories they narrate, because their method is mere transmission of reports, whether sound or unsound, without examining these reports and their chains of narration, and comparing them to other, similar reports, and without examining them in the light of reason and in the light of human nature. Thus they drifted away from the path of truth and fell into grievous mistakes and errors.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Prophet Zakariyya\u2019s sponsorship of Maryam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly:\n\n\tThe scholars differed concerning the relationship between \n\tZakariyya and Maryam (peace be upon them both). There are two views:\n\n\t\n\t\n\tThat \n\the was the husband of her sister\n\n\t\n\t\n\tThat \n\the was the husband of her maternal aunt.\n\n\tSee the answer to question no. 82569.\n\n\tIt was narrated that Zakariyya (peace be upon him) was also \n\tone of the paternal cousins of Maryam (peace be upon her), in addition to \n\tbeing the husband of her maternal aunt or sister. See: al-Hidaayah by \n\tMakki (2/999).\n\n\tSecondly:\n\n\tAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, has told us about \n\tZakariyya\u2019s sponsorship (kafaalah) of Maryam, as He said (interpretation of \n\tthe meaning):\n\n\t\u201cSo her Lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her \n\tto grow in a good manner and put her in the care \n\t[kaffalaha] of Zechariah [Zakariyya]\u201d\n\n\t[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:37].\n\t\n\n\tWhat is meant by kafaalah [sponsorship or taking care] is \n\tthat he looked after her affairs and needs. Kafaalah includes taking care of \n\tthe interests of the person under one\u2019s care, spending on him, and looking \n\tafter his needs.\n\n\tIbn \u2018Atiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What it means \n\tis that he took her into his care and spent on her. The kaafil (sponsor) is \n\tthe one who takes care of another.\n\n\tEnd quote from al-Muharrar al-Wajeez (1/425).\n\n\tAl-Waahidi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He took her \n\tinto his care and looked after her affairs.\n\n\tAz- Zajjaaj said: What is meant is that he took care of her \n\taffairs. \u2026 The kaafil is the one who sponsors a person, looks after him and \n\tspends on him..\n\n\tEnd quote from at-Tafseer al-Baseet (5/203).\n\n\tIbn Katheer said: Here our Lord is telling us that He \n\taccepted the vow of her mother, and that He \u201ccaused her to grow in a good \n\tmanner\u201d that is, He made her good-looking and endeared her to peopler, \n\tand caused her to be in the company of the righteous among His slaves, so \n\tthat she could learn goodness, knowledge and religion from them.\n\n\tHence Allah says: \u201cand put her in \n\tthe care [kaffalaha] of Zechariah \n\t[Zakariyya]\u201d; the grammatical \n\tstructure of this phrase in the original Arabic indicates that Zakariyya was \n\tmade to be her sponsor or carer.\n\n\tIbn Ishaaq said: That was only because she was an orphan.\n\n\tOther scholars stated that the Children of Israel were \n\tstricken by a famine, so Zakariyya sponsored Maryam and took care of her \n\tbecause of that.\n\n\tThere is no contradiction between the two views. And Allah \n\tknows best.\n\n\tThe reason why Allah decreed that Zakariyya should be her \n\tsponsor was because this would be in her best interests, so that she might \n\tlearn a great deal of beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds from him, and \n\tbecause he was the husband of her maternal aunt, according to what was \n\tmentioned by Ibn Ishaaq, Ibn Jareer, and others.\n\n\tIt was also said that he was the husband of her sister.\n\n\tAt-Tafseer \n\t(2/35).\n\n\tIbn \u2018Ashoor said: When Maryam was born, her father had died, \n\tand a number of the rabbis of the Children of Israel disputed over who was \n\tto sponsor her, for they were all keen to sponsor the daughter of their \n\tsenior rabbi. They drew lots for that, and the lot fell to Zakariyya. What \n\tappears to be the case is that the matter of her sponsorship was delegated \n\tto the rabbis because she was dedicated to the service of the place of \n\tworship, so it was essential that she be given a righteous upbringing for \n\tthat reason.\n\n\tAt-Tahreer wa\u2019t-Tahreer \n\t(2/235).\n\n\tConclusion:\n\n\tIt was narrated that Zakariyya was one of the paternal \n\tcousins of Maryam, and he was the husband of her sister or maternal aunt. He \n\twas her sponsor (kaafil), meaning that he used to take care of her needs and \n\tlook after her."

        "question": "Did the Prophet of Allah Sulaymaan (peace be upon him) force the queen of Saba\u2019 to become Muslim?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tThe Prophet of Allah Sulaymaan (peace be upon him) did not \n\tforce Balqees the queen of Saba\u2019 (Sheba) to become Muslim; rather she became \n\tMuslim voluntarily, as Allah, may He be exalted, tells us in the verse in \n\twhich He, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the \n\tmeaning):\n\n\t\u201cShe said: \u2018My Lord! Verily, I \n\thave wronged myself, and I submit (in Islam, together with Sulaymaan \n\t(Solomon), to Allah, the Lord of the \u2018Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that \n\texists)\u201d\n\n\t[an-Naml 27:44].\n\n\tShe stated that she had wronged herself by worshipping the \n\tsun instead of Allah, then she voluntarily affirmed Islam and submitted with \n\tSulaymaan to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. If she had been forced to become \n\tMuslim, she would not have said that.\n\n\tWith regard to the words of the Prophet of Allah Sulaymaan \n\t(peace be upon him), \u201cGo \n\tback to them. We verily shall come to them with hosts that they cannot \n\tresist, and we shall drive them out from there in disgrace, and they will be \n\tabased\u201d [an-Naml 27:37],\n\n\tthis comes under the heading of jihad which is necessary to \n\tspread the religion of Allah; it does not have anything to do with forcing \n\tanyone to enter Islam. Jihad was only prescribed so that the word of Allah \n\tmight be supreme, and so as to take away authority of kingdoms that stand \n\tbetween the people and the religion of Allah.\n\n\tMoreover, Sulaymaan was a king, to whom Allah had granted \n\tsovereignty on earth, as more than one of the early generations stated, so \n\tno one had the right to decide any of the affairs of his kingdom without his \n\tconsent, especially with regard to the greatest matter concerning which \n\tjihad was prescribed and for which kingdoms were established. \n\t\n\n\tShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tJihad of the Muslims against the disbelievers is not for the \n\tpurpose of making them become Muslim. Allah, may He be glorified, says \n\t(interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThere \n\tis no compulsion in religion\u201d [al-Baqarah \n\t2:256]. Rather jihad is \n\tso that the word of Allah may be supreme, and so that dominance may belong \n\tto the religion of Islam.\n\n\tEnd quote from Majmoo\u2018 Fataawa wa Rasaa\u2019il al-\u2018Uthaymeen \n\t(25/303).\n\n\tShaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said:\n\n\tIt is not possible to force anyone to enter Islam, for \n\tentering Islam is something that comes from the heart, based on conviction \n\tin the heart, and it is not possible for us to control hearts or make them \n\tbelieve. That is in the hand of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, for \n\tHe is the Controller of the hearts, and it is He Who guides whomever He \n\twills and leaves astray whomever He wills. But our duty is to call people to \n\tAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, and to explain the truth, and to \n\tstrive in jihad for the sake of Allah against those who are stubborn and \n\trecognise the truth but obstinately reject it after coming to know it. This \n\tis the one against whom we must strive in jihad, but as for the idea of \n\tforcing him to enter Islam and instilling faith in his heart by force, this \n\tis not for us to do, rather that is up to Allah, may He be glorified and \n\texalted.\n\n\tEnd quote from Majmoo\u2018 Fataawa ash-Shaykh Saalih ibn \n\tFawzaan (1/209)\n\n\tThe fact that the queen of Saba\u2019 became Muslim and admitted \n\thaving wronged her self when she disbelieved clearly indicates that she was \n\tcontent with faith and became Muslim voluntarily, and was not forced to do \n\tso.\n\n\tPlease see also the answers to questions no.\n\t178756 and 82613.\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Imam Ja\u2018far as-Saadiq",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly:\n\n\tHis full name is Imam Abu \u2018Abdullah Ja\u2018far as-Saadiq ibn \n\tMuhammad al-Baaqir ibn \u2018Ali Zayn al-\u2018Aabideen ibn al-Husayn ibn \u2018Ali ibn Abi \n\tTaalib (may Allah be pleased with him and be pleased with them).\n\n\tHis mother was Umm Farwah bint al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi \n\tBakr at-Taymi. Her mother was Asmaa\u2019 bint \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Abi Bakr. So \n\this mother was descended from Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq on her mother\u2019s side and \n\talso on her father\u2019s side.\n\n\tHence he used to say: Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq was my ancestor \n\ttwice over.\n\n\tHe was born in 80 AH, and met some of the Sahaabah. \n\tAdh-Dhahabi said: I think he met Anas ibn Maalik and Sahl ibn Sa\u2018d.\n\n\tSee: Siyar A\u2018laam an-Nubala\u2019 (6/255-270).\n\n\tSecondly:\n\n\tHis shaykhs and students:\n\n\tHe narrated from his father, Abu Ja\u2018far al-Baaqir, and from \n\t\u2018Ubaydullah ibn Abi Raafi\u2018, \u2018Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, \u2018Ata\u2019 ibn Abi Rabaah \u2013 and \n\this reports from him are narrated in Muslim, his grandfather al-Qaasim ibn \n\tMuhammad ibn Abi Bakr, Naafi\u2018 al-\u2018Umari, Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir, az-Zuhri, \n\tMuslim ibn Abi Maryam, and others.

See: as-Siyar.\n\n\tThirdly:\n\n\tHis status in terms of knowledge, virtue and adherence to the \n\tSunnah, and his disavowal of the Raafidis and other extremists, and the \n\tseriousness of their fabrications against him:\n\n\tAbu Ahmad ibn \u2018Adiyy said: He narrated many hadiths from his \n\tfather, from Jaabir and from his forefathers. The leading scholars narrated \n\tfrom him. And he was one of the trustworthy people, as Ibn Ma\u2018een said.\n\n\tIt was narrated that \u2018Amr ibn Abi\u2019l-Miqdaam said: When I \n\tlooked at Ja\u2018far ibn Muhammad, I realised that he was descended from \n\tProphets. I saw him standing at the Jamrah, saying: Ask me, ask me.\n\n\t\u2018Ali ibn al-Ja\u2018d narrated that Zuhayr ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah said: My \n\tfather said to Ja\u2018far ibn Muhammad: I have a neighbour who claims that you \n\tdisavowed Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar. Ja\u2018far said: May Allah disavow your neighbour. \n\tBy Allah, I hope that Allah will benefit me through my ties of blood with \n\tAbu Bakr, for I fell ill one time and\u00a0 I left my will with my maternal uncle \n\t\u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn al-Qaasim (which means that he was very close to him).\n\t\n\n\tIbn \u2018Uyaynah said: They narrated to me from Ja\u2018far ibn \n\tMuhammad \u2013 although I did not hear it (directly) from him \u2013 that he said: At \n\tthe time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n\thim), the family of Abu Bakr were called the family of the Messenger of \n\tAllah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\n\n\tMuhammad ibn Fudayl said, narrating from Saalim ibn Abi \n\tHafsah, that he said: I asked Abu Ja\u2018far and his son Ja\u2018far about Abu Bakr \n\tand \u2018Umar. He said: O Saalim, regard them as allies and disavow anyone who \n\tregards them as enemies, for they are both imams of guidance.\n\n\tThen Ja\u2018far said: O Saalim, would a man revile his \n\tgrandfather? Abu Bakr is my grandfather, and I will not attain the \n\tintercession of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the \n\tDay of Resurrection if I do not regard them both (Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar) as \n\tallies and disavow those who regard them as enemies.\n\n\tAdh-Dhahabi said: These words were narrated via mutawaatir \n\treports from Ja\u2018far as-Saadiq. I bear witness by Allah that he was sincere \n\tin his words, and was not being hypocritical towards anyone or trying to \n\tappease anyone. May Allah doom the Raafidis.\n\n\tAdh-Dhahabi commented on the above report by saying: \n\t\n\n\tSaalim had an obvious inclination towards Shi\u2018ism, yet \n\tdespite that he transmitted these true words. It is only people of virtue \n\twho recognise the virtue of people of virtue. Similarly the one who narrated \n\tit, Ibn Fudayl, was also a Shi\u2018i but trustworthy in narrating hadith. May \n\tAllah doom the Shi\u2018ah of our times; how deeply they are immersed in \n\tignorance and lies! They impugn the two shaykhs (Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar), the \n\ttwo close companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n\thim), and interpret these words of al-Baaqir and as-Saadiq as having been \n\tsaid by way of taqiyyah (dissimulation).\n\n\tEnd quote from Siyar A\u2018laam an-Nubala\u2019, 4/402\n\n\tShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid:\u00a0 \n\n\tAs for telling lies about Ja\u2018far and what they narrate from \n\thim of what he (allegedly) said in private (impugning Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar), \n\tit is among the gravest of lies, to the extent that it is said that no one \n\twas lied about as Ja\u2018far (may Allah be pleased with him) was lied about.\n\n\tEnd quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa, 4/78.\n\n\tHe also said:\n\n\tThe Raafidis are the most ignorant of sects, the most \n\tmendacious and the furthest removed from knowledge of religious texts and \n\treason. They regard taqiyyah (dissimulation) as one of the fundamental \n\tprinciples of their religion, and they tell many lies about Ahl al-Bayt, the \n\textent of which no one knows except Allah. They even narrate from Ja\u2018far as-Saadiq \n\tthat he said: \u201cTaqiyyah is my religion and the religion of my forefathers\u201d!\n\n\tTaqiyyah is the symbol of hypocrisy, because in reality it \n\tmeans that they say something that is not in their hearts, and this is the \n\tvery essence of hypocrisy. Therefore because this is one of the fundamental \n\tprinciples of their religion, whatever they transmit from \u2018Ali or anyone \n\telse of Ahl al-Bayt that is in harmony with the teachings of Ahl as-Sunnah \n\twa\u2019l-Jamaa\u2018ah, they describe it as having been said by way of taqiyyah. Thus \n\tthey opened wide the doors of hypocrisy to the baatini Qaraamitah [an \n\textreme esoteric sect].\n\n\tEnd quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (13/263).\n\n\tHe also said:\n\n\tThe problem is with those who lied about Ja\u2018far, not with \n\tJa\u2018far himself\u2026 to the extent that everyone who wanted to make his lies \n\tacceptable to people attributed them to Ja\u2018far.\n\n\tEnd quote from Minhaaj as-Sunnah (4/54).\n\n\tImam Ja\u2018far as-Saadiq\u2019s disavowal of the Raafidis and their \n\tilk is too well known to need a list of all the reports, and their \n\tfabrications against him are too many to be counted. \n\n\tA quick glance at the names of his shaykhs, such as \u2018Ata\u2019 ibn \n\tAbi Rabaah, az-Zuhri, \u2018Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad and \n\tothers, and a quick glance at the names of his students who narrated from \n\thim, such as Abu Haneefah, Sufyaan ath-Thawri, Ibn \u2018Uyaynah, and Maalik, and \n\tthe high esteem in which they held him and the pride they felt in being his \n\tstudents, will expose the lies of the baatinis (esoteric sects) concerning \n\thim. How come his shaykhs from whom he acquired knowledge and his students \n\twho learned from him, were the prominent figures among Ahl as-Sunnah in his \n\tera, then he became the imam of their enemies among the Raafidis and their \n\tilk?\n\n\tThis is not the case of Ahl as-Sunnah vis-\u00e0-vis the Raafidis \n\tconcerning as-Saadiq only; rather it is also the case with regard to his son \n\tand his forefathers.\n\n\tSee the answer to question no. 101272.\n\n\tFourthly:\n\n\tAs for books that give the biography of Ja\u2018far as-Saadiq, \n\tthere is hardly any book of biography (seerah) and prominent figures \n\t(a\u2018laam) that does not mention his biography, such as Siyar al-A\u2018laam \n\tby adh-Dhahabi, al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah by Ibn Katheer, \n\tWafiyyaat al-A\u2018yaan by Ibn Khallikaan, and others.\n\n\tThere are also books that deal exclusively with his \n\tbiography, such as al-Imam as-Saadiq: Hayaatuhu wa \u2018Asruhu wa Aaraa\u2019uhu \n\twa Fiqhuhu by Shaykh Muhammad Abu Zahrah.\n\n\tThere is a brief essay entitled al-Imam Ja\u2018far as-Saadiq \n\tby Shaykh Saalih ad-Darweesh, at the end of which he mentions some other \n\twritings that give his biography, including the following:\n\n\t\u00b7\n\tal-Imam Ja\u2018far as-Saadiq wa Aaraa\u2019uhu f\u2019il-Imaamah: Diraasah \n\tNaqdiyyah lima nasabahu ilayhi ash-Shi\u2018ah min al-Abaateel \n\tby Muhammad Mahfooz Abu \u2018Akkaaz, Master\u2019s thesis in Sharee\u2018ah and Usool ad-Deen \n\tat Umm al-Qura University in Makkah.\n\n\t\u00b7\n\tMarwiyaat al-Imam Ja\u2018far as-Saadiq fi\u2019s-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah \n\twa Ahwaal ar-Ruwwaat \u2018anhu wa Namaadhij mimma nusiba ilayhi \n\tby Lateefah Ibraaheem al-Haadi, PhD thesis in Sharee\u2018ah and Usool ad-Deen at \n\tUmm al-Qura University in Makkah.\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best."

Jahm ibn Abi Jahm is unknown. Adh-Dhahabi mentioned him in \n\tal-Mizaan (1/426) and said: He is not known; he narrated the report from \n\tHaleemah as-Sa\u2018diyyah. End quote.\n\n\tHe did not hear \n\tthis story directly from \u2018Abdullah ibn Ja\u2018far, because he said: someone who \n\theard \u2018Abdullah ibn Ja\u2018far ibn Abi Taalib told me that he said.\n\n\tAnd \u2018Abdullah \n\tibn Ja\u2018far did not hear it from Haleemah as-Sa\u2018diyyah, because he said: I \n\twas told, from Haleemah bint al-Haarith.\n\n\tBut this last \n\tproblem is minor, because \u2018Abdullah ibn Ja\u2018far was a Sahaabi, but he was one \n\tof the younger Sahaabah.\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Ibn Sa\u2018d in at-Tabaqaat (1/81, 120) via his shaykh al-Waaqidi, via \n\tvarious isnaads, but al-Waaqidi is dubious. He was regarded as a liar by \n\tImam Ahmad and others. Abu Dawood said: I do not write down his hadith and I \n\tdo not narrate from him; I have no doubt that he made up hadith. Bandaar \n\tsaid: I have not seen anyone who tells more lies than him.\n\n\tIshaaq ibn \n\tRaahawayh said: In my view, he is one of those who fabricate hadith.\n\n\tSee: Tahdheeb \n\tat-Tahdheeb (9/323-326).\n\n\tSo what he \n\tnarrates is of no value.\n\n\tThe hadith was \n\tclassed as da\u2018eef by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him), who \n\tsaid in his commentary on al-Booti\u2019s Fiqh as-Seerah:\n\n\tThis story was \n\tnot narrated via any isnaad which may be taken as evidence. The most \n\twell-known of its versions is that which was narrated by Muhammad ibn Ishaaq \n\tfrom Jahm ibn Abi Jahm from \u2018Abdullah ibn Ja\u2018far from Haleemah bint \n\tal-Haarith as-Sa\u2018diyyah.\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Abu Ya\u2018la (1/128) and from him by Ibn Hibbaan in Mawaarid (1094) \n\tand by Abu Nu\u2018aym in Dalaa\u2019il an-Nubuwwah (1/47) from Ibn Ishaaq.\n\t\n\n\tIt was also \n\tnarrated from him by al-Bayhaqi in Dalaa\u2019il an-Nubuwwah (1/108), \n\texcept that he said: Jahm ibn Abi Jahm \u2013 the freed slave of a woman from \n\tBanu Tameem who was married to al-Haarith ibn Haatib; it was also said that \n\the was the freed slave of al-Haarith ibn Haatib \u2013 told us: someone who heard \n\t\u2018Abdullah ibn Ja\u2018far ibn Abi Taalib told us that he said: I was told, from \n\tHaleemah bint al-Haarith.\n\n\tI say: This is a \n\tda\u2018eef isnaad; there are two problems with it:\n\n\tFirstly: there \n\tis some problem with the isnaad, as is quite clear. In the first report, Ibn \n\tIshaaq narrates it by saying \u2018an (from) with regard to all of its narrators. \n\tIn the second report, it is narrated with a clear statement of it having \n\tbeen told from one narrator to another, even though al-Jahm says that he did \n\tnot hear it directly from \u2018Abdullah ibn Ja\u2018far, and he says that \u2018Abdullah \n\tibn Ja\u2018far did not hear it directly from Haleemah. \n\n\tIn the first \n\treport, there is an interruption between Ibn Ishaaq and al-Jahm, because Ibn \n\tIshaaq is known for tadlees (saying \u2018an (from) to give the impression that \n\tit was heard directly from one narrator to another). In the second report \n\tthere is an interruption in two places in the isnaad.\n\n\tThus you may \n\tlearn that al-Haafiz was mistaken in his book al-Isaabah, where he \n\tsaid (4/266): Ibn Hibbaan stated in his Saheeh that it was stated \n\tthat Haleemah told \u2018Abdullah, because there is no basis for this idea \n\taccording to Ibn Hibbaan or anyone else whom we have mentioned.\n\n\tIt is very \n\tunlikely that \u2018Abdullah ibn Ja\u2018far could have met Haleemah, the wet-nurse of \n\tthe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because \n\twhen the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, \u2018Abdullah \n\twas ten years old; even though no one mentioned when Haleemah died, one \n\twould expect her to have died before the Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n\tpeace of Allah be upon him). And Allah knows best.\n\n\tRegardless of \n\twhether the first or second report is more sound, in both cases there is an \n\tinterruption in the isnaad. \n\n\tThe other \n\tproblem with the hadith is that its main narrator, Jahm ibn Abi\u2019l-Jahm, is \n\tunknown. Adh-Dhahabi said in al-Mizaan: The story of Haleemah \n\tas-Sa\u2018diyyah is not known to be his.\n\n\tAs for Ibn \n\tHibbaan, he mentioned him in ath-Thiqaat (1/31), according to his \n\tmethod of verifying unknown narrators.\n\n\tAccording to Abu \n\tNu\u2018aym, the story has two other isnaads, both of which are connected to \n\tal-Waaqidi, who was a liar. One of the isnaads is from his shaykh, Moosa ibn \n\tShayba, who is layyin al-hadith (not strong in hadith), as al-Haafiz said in\n\tat-Taqreeb. The other is from \u2018Abd as-Samad ibn Muhammad as-Sa\u2018di, \n\tfrom his father, from his grandfather, who said: Someone who used to tend \n\tthe sheep of Haleemah told me\u2026 These narrators are unknown.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tDifaa\u2018 \u2018an al-Hadith an-Nabawi (39).\n\n\tHe also said in \n\this commentary on Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan (9/128):\n\n\t\u2026 Ibn Ishaaq \n\tstated in Seerat Ibn Hishaam (1/172) that the report was told from \n\tone narrator to another, but he was not sure. He said: From \u2018Abdullah ibn \n\tJa\u2018far ibn Abi Taalib, or from someone who narrated from him\u2026\n\n\tSo we cannot be \n\tsure that the isnaad is complete, especially since this Jahm is unknown and \n\tno one regarded him as trustworthy except Ibn Hibbaan (4/113). Adh-Dhahabi \n\tsaid in al-Mizaan and elsewhere: He is not known. End quote.\n\n\tSee: al-Mataalib \n\tal-\u2018Aaliyah by Ibn Hajar, and the comment of the commentators \n\t(17/180-182).\n\n\tThis hadith, \n\twith its isnaads, is well known to the scholars of Seerah (the Prophet\u2019s \n\tbiography), as Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadith \n\twas narrated via other isnaads, and it is one of the well-known hadiths that \n\twere mentioned by the scholars of Seerah and Maghaazi (reports of military \n\tcampaigns).\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tal-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah (2/275).\n\n\tPerhaps because \n\tit is well-known, adh-Dhahabi classed it as qawiy (strong) and said \n\tconcerning this hadith of Ibn Ishaaq that is mentioned above:\n\n\tThis is a hadith \n\twith a jayyid (good) isnaad.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tTareekh al-Islam (1/48).\n\n\tAnd Allah knows \n\tbest."

(So Allah made the brothers to bind themselves with \n\ttheir way of \u2018punishment, i.e. enslaving of a thief.\u2019) We raise to degrees \n\twhom We please, but over each one who is possessed of knowledge is one more \n\tknowing.\nThey ((Yoosuf\u2019s \n\t(Joseph) brothers) said: \u2018If he steals, there was a brother of his (Yoosuf \n\t(Joseph)) who did steal before (him).\u2019 But these things did Yoosuf (Joseph) \n\tkeep in himself, revealing not the secrets to them. He said (within \n\thimself): \u2018You are in worst case, and Allah knows best the truth of what you \n\tassert!\u2019\u201d\n\n\t[Yoosuf 12:70-77].\n\n\tShaykh as-Sa\u2018di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\t\u201cSo when he had furnished them forth with their provisions\u201d \n\tthat is, when he had weighed out provisions for each of his brothers, \n\tincluding this brother,\n\n\t\u201che put the (golden) bowl\u201d which was a vessel from \n\twhich he drank, and also used for measuring \u201cinto his brother\u2019s bag, \n\tthen\u201d they loaded up their luggage, but when they set out, \u201cthen a crier \n\tcried: \u2018O you (in) the caravan! Surely, you are thieves!\u2019\u201d Perhaps this \n\tcaller did not know what was really going on.\u00a0\n\nThey namely the brothers of Yoosuf \u201cturning towards them\u201d \n\t\u2013 they had no concern except to dispel the accusation that had been made \n\tagainst them, so they said: \u201cWhat is it that you have missed?\u2019\u201d And \n\tthey did not say, \u201cWhat have we stolen?\u201d because they were certain that they \n\twere innocent of theft.\u00a0\n\n\t\u201cThey said: \u2018We have missed the (golden) bowl of the king \n\tand for him who produces it is (the reward of) a camel load\u201d that is, as \n\ta reward for finding it\n\n\t\u201cI will be bound by it\u201d that is, I guarantee it \u2013 this \n\twas said by the caller who was looking for it.\u00a0\n\n\t\u201cThey said: \u2018By Allah! Indeed you know that we came not to \n\tmake mischief in the land\u201d by committing all kinds of sins\n\n\t\u201cand we are no thieves\u201d, for stealing is one of the \n\tworst kinds of making mischief in the land. They only swore because they \n\twere confident that the Egyptians were aware that they were not making \n\tmischief and were not thieves, as they knew them very well and were aware \n\tthat they were people of dignity and piety, who could not have committed \n\tthis theft; those who accused them knew that they could not have done that. \n\tThis is a more eloquent way of refuting the accusation than saying \u201cBy Allah \n\twe did not make mischief in the land and we did not steal anything.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\t\u201cThey (Yoosuf\u2019s (Joseph) men) said: \u2018What then shall be \n\tthe penalty, if you are (proved to be) liars?\u201d\n\n\t\u00a0\u201cThey (Yoosuf\u2019s (Joseph) brothers) said: \u2018The penalty \n\tshould be that he, in whose bag it is found, should be held for the \n\tpunishment (of the crime)\u201d that is, the one in whose saddle-bag it is \n\tfound should become the slave of the owner of the stolen item. According to \n\ttheir religion, if the thief was proven to be guilty, he would become the \n\tproperty of the owner of the stolen wealth. Hence they said: \u201cThus we \n\tpunish the Zalimoon (wrong-doers, etc.)!\u2019\u201d\n\n\t\u201cSo he\u201d the inspector \u201cbegan (the search) in their \n\tbags before the bag of his brother\u201d, so that there would be no suspicion \n\tthat it had been done deliberately. When he did not find anything in their \n\tbaggage,\n\n\t\u201cThen he brought it out of his brother\u2019s bag\u201d. It does \n\tnot say \u201che found it\u201d or \u201chis brother stole it\u201d, so as to reflect the \n\treality of the situation.\n\n\tThus Yoosuf accomplished what he wanted to do of keeping his \n\tbrother with him in such a way that his other brothers would not realise it, \n\tAllah says (sa): \u201cThus did We plan for Yoosuf (Joseph)\u201d that is, We \n\tmade easy for him this plan which enabled him to achieve something that was \n\tnot blameworthy\n\n\t\u201cHe could not take his brother by the law of the king (as \n\ta slave)\u201d because there was nothing in that law that allowed enslavement \n\tof the thief; rather they had some other penalty in such cases. Therefore if \n\tthe ruling had been referred to the king\u2019s law, Yoosuf would not have been \n\table to keep his brother with him. But he made the ruling come from them, so \n\tthat he might achieve his aim.\n\n\t\u201cWe raise to degrees whom We please\u201d by means of \n\tbeneficial knowledge and knowledge of ways and means of achieving desired \n\tgoals, as We raised Yoosuf in status\n\n\t\u201cbut over each one who is possessed of knowledge is one \n\tmore knowing.\u201d Above each one who has knowledge is one who is more \n\tknowledgeable than him, until knowledge ends with the Knower of the unseen \n\tand the seen.\n\n\tWhen the brothers of Yoosuf saw what happened, \u201cThey said: \n\t\u2018If he\u201d \u2013 namely this brother \u2013 \u201csteals\u201d, there is nothing surprising about \n\tthat, because \u201cthere was a brother of his (Yoosuf (Joseph)) who did steal \n\tbefore (him).\u201d\u00a0 They were referring to Yoosuf (as); what they meant by \n\tsaying this was to declare their own innocence. In other words: this one and \n\this brother may commit acts of theft, but they are not our full brothers.\n\n\tThese words implied a great deal of disparagement, but Yoosuf \n\tkept his thoughts to himself \u201crevealing not the secrets to them\u201d that \n\tis, he did not respond to their words in a way that would be displeasing to \n\tthem; rather he restrained his anger and kept it to himself.\n\n\t\u201cHe said (within himself): \u2018You are in worst case\u201d \n\tbecause you blamed us when you are worse than us in that regard\n\n\t\u201cand Allah knows best the truth of what you assert\u201d \n\tagainst us, that is, He knows better than others, as you are accusing us of \n\ttheft when Allah knows that we are innocent.\nTafseer \n\tas-Sa\u2018di (p. 402)\nThis was not \n\tany kind of lying or prohibited deceit on the part of Yoosuf (peace be upon \n\thim); rather it was good planning that Allah planned for him so as to \n\tcomplete His blessing upon him and reunite him with his parents and family, \n\tand so that his brothers might repent, and so that He might highlight to \n\tthem the wrong that they had done towards their father and their two \n\tbrothers, and so that Allah might complete His blessing upon their father \n\tYa\u2018qoob (peace be upon him) and restore to him his son after a lengthy \n\tabsence and great suffering. So Allah, may He be exalted, ordained this good \n\tand blessed plan for His Prophet, so that these blessings might be attained \n\tby all concerned. This does not come under the heading of wrongdoing, enmity \n\tand prohibited deceit \u2013 Allah forbid.\nThe caller \n\twho cried out \u201c\u2018O you (in) the caravan! Surely, you are thieves!\u2019\u201d \n\tthought that they were the ones who had stolen the king\u2019s bowl, so he cried \n\tout on the basis of what he knew; so he was not lying.\nWhat Yoosuf \n\t(peace be upon him) meant was that they had stolen from his father, and he \n\tspoke the truth. This comes under the heading of double entendres by means \n\tof which the truth may be found out and proof established. \nIbn al-Jawzi \n\t(may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf it is \n\tsaid: How could it have been permissible for Yoosuf to accuse of theft \n\tsomeone who had not stolen anything? There are four answers to this \n\tquestion:\n\n\t1.\n\tThat what is meant is: You stole Yoosuf when you cut him off from his father \n\tand threw him into the well. This was the view of az-Zajjaaj.\n\n\t2.\n\tThat when the caller said this, he did not know that Yoosuf had issued \n\tinstructions that the bowl be placed in his brother\u2019s bag, so he was not \n\tlying when he said it. This was the view of Ibn Jareer.\n\n\t3.\n\tThat the caller cried out, accusing them of theft, without any instructions \n\tfrom Yoosuf to do so.\n\n\t4.\n\tThat what is meant is: You are thieves as it appears to one who is not aware \n\tof the reality of your situation; this is like the verse in which Allah says \n\t(interpretation of the meaning): \u201cTaste you (this)! Verily, you were \n\t(pretending to be) the mighty, the generous\u201d [ad-Dukhaan 44:49] \u2013 i.e., \n\tin your own mind you were mighty and generous, but not in Our view. And the \n\tProphet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIbraaheem told \n\tthree untruths\u201d i.e., he said words that seemed to be lies, but they were \n\tnot really lies.\u00a0\u00a0 \nEnd quote \n\tfrom Zaad al-Maseer (2/457)\nShaykh \n\tal-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat Yoosuf \n\t(peace be upon him) meant was: You stole Yoosuf from his father, and he was \n\ttelling the truth when he said that.\nWhat the \n\tcaller meant was: You stole the bowl; he thought that they had stolen it, \n\tand he did not deliberately intend to lie, even though what he said was \n\tuntrue.

See also: al-Fataawa \n\tal-Kubra (6/127)\nIbn al-Qayyim \n\t(may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ighaathat al-Lahfaan (2/118):\nAllah, may He \n\tbe exalted, inspired the brothers of Yoosuf (peace be upon him) to say: \u201cThe \n\tpenalty should be that he, in whose bag it is found, should be held for the \n\tpunishment (of the crime)\u201d \u2013 this was a plan from Allah, may He be \n\texalted, in support of Yoosuf (peace be upon him) that He caused to be \n\tuttered by his brothers. It was beyond Yoosuf\u2019s control.\nThey could \n\thave avoided that by saying \u201cThere is no penalty for him unless it is proven \n\tthat he is the one who stole it\u201d, because the mere fact that it was found in \n\this bag did not necessarily mean that he was a thief. But Yoosuf (peace be \n\tupon him) was just and would not have held them responsible without proof.\nThey could \n\talso have avoided that by saying \u201cHis penalty should be the same as whatever \n\tyou do to thieves according to your law.\u201d The custom according to the law of \n\tthe king of Egypt \u2013 as was narrated \u2013 was that the thief would be beaten and \n\tfined double the value of the stolen property. If they had said that, he \n\tcould not have imposed upon them what he did not impose upon others; \n\ttherefore Allah, may He be glorified, says: \u201cThus did We plan for Yoosuf \n\t(Joseph). He could not take his brother by the law of the king (as a slave), \n\texcept that Allah willed it.\u201d \nIn other \n\twords, he could not have taken him according to the law of the king of \n\tEgypt, because in his law there was no way for him to take him.\nThe words \u201cexcept \n\tthat Allah willed it\u201d may mean: except that Allah willed that he should \n\ttake him by some other means. Or it may be that what is meant is: except \n\tthat Allah brought about some other means for him to take him according to \n\tthe law of the king, other than theft.

End quote.\nTafseer \n\tIbn Katheer (4/401)\nThe point is \n\tthat none of that comes under the heading of lying whatsoever; rather it \n\tcomes under the heading of good double entendres which, among other things, \n\tlead to: the truth becoming manifest; the wrongdoers acknowledging their \n\tmistake and repenting from it and seeking forgiveness from the one who was \n\twronged; bringing about reunion of the family; fulfilling the promise of \n\tAllah to Ya\u2018qoob and Yoosuf (peace be upon them both); bringing about \n\tAllah\u2019s support to the one who had been wronged and fulfilling His plan for \n\thim.

        "question": "The reason why the Hijri months are called by their well-known names",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Before Islam, the Arabs used different names for the lunar months that were known at that time, until those names changed and became standardised throughout Arabia, and took their final forms at the end of the fifth century CE, during the era of Kilaab, who was the great-great-great-great-great-grandfather of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThe naming of these lunar months with the names that are known today is based on certain reasons and meanings from which the names of the months were derived, as was mentioned by the scholars. Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nShaykh \u2018Alam ad-Deen as-Sakhaawi stated in a book that he compiled, entitled al-Mashhoor fi Asma\u2019 al-Ayyaam wa\u2019sh-Shuhoor, that Muharram is so called because it is a sacred (muharram) month. I think that it was so called to affirm its sanctity, because the Arabs used to change it, making it not sacred one year and making it sacred another year. He said: The plural form of Muharram is Muharramaat or Mahaarim or Mahaareem.\nSafar is so called because their houses would be devoid of them when they went out to fight or to travel, and it would be said \u201csafira al-makaan (the place has become empty)\u201d when people left. The plural form of Safar is Asfaar.\nRabee\u2018 al-Awwal is so called because they did not travel during that month (the word irtibaa\u2018, derived from the same root, means \u201cnot travelling\u201d). The plural form is Arbi\u2018aa\u2019, like the word naseeb (pl. ansibaa\u2019), or Arbu\u2018ah like the word ragheef (pl. arghufah). The same may be said concerning Rabee\u2018 al-Aakhir as was said concerning Rabee\u2018 al-Awwal.\nJumaada is so called because water froze during that month (jumood means freezing).\nAnd he said: In their calculations, the months did not rotate through the seasons, although there is some doubt concerning that, because their months were connected to lunar cycle, so they would inevitably rotate through the seasons. Perhaps they called Jumaada by this name the first time, when water froze because of the cold. The plural form of Jumaada is Jumaadiyyaat, like the word hubaara (pl. hubaariyyaat). The word may be either masculine or feminine, so one may say Jumaada al-Oola or al-Awwal, and Jumaada al-Aakhir or al-Aakhirah.\nThe name of Rajab comes from the word tarjeeb, which means veneration. The plural form is Arjaab or Rijaab or Rajabaat.\nThe name of Sha\u2018baan comes from the word tasha\u2018\u2018ub (scattering), as the tribes would scatter and disperse to raid others. The plural form is Sha\u2018aabeen or Sha\u2018baanaat.\nThe name of Ramadan comes from the word ramda\u2019, which refers to intense heat. Another word from the same root is used to refer to the thirst of camels when they become thirsty. The plural form is Ramadaanaat or Ramaadeen or Armidah.\nThe name of Shawwaal comes from a word referring to camels raising their tails for the purpose of copulation. The plural form is Shawaawil or Shawaaweel or Shawwaalaat.\nThe month of Dhu\u2019l-Qa\u2018dah \u2013 or, in my view, Dhu\u2019l-Qi\u2018dah \u2013 is derived from the word qu\u2018ood (rest), as during this month they would rest from fighting and travelling. The plural form is Dhawaat al-Qa\u2018dah.\nDhu\u2019l-Hijjah \u2013 or, in my view, Dhu\u2019l-Hajjah \u2013 is so called because they performed Hajj during this month. The plural form is Dhawaat al-Hijjah.\nEnd quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer (4/128-129)\nSee also: al-Mufassal fi Tareekh al-\u2018Arab qabl al-Islam by the historian Jawaad \u2018Ali (16/91ff)\nThere is nothing wrong with mentioning the names of the months, explaining their meanings and the sources from which they were derived, and the reasons why they are so called, as explained by the historians and linguists, especially if there is an educational purpose behind that, even though the origin may have been forgotten and no longer has anything to do with the names of the months, because they rotate through the seasons, as is well known, and therefore the meaning has nothing to do with the well-known shar\u2018i rulings on the months.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no.  170242\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Did Yazeed ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah issue orders that al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) be killed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly:\u00a0\n\n\tThe Muslims are still faced with troubles and challenges \n\tbecause of the narration of fabricated reports in historical books. If the \n\twise person reflects upon the words of Allah, may He be exalted \n\t(interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThat \n\twas a nation who has passed away. They shall receive the reward of what they \n\tearned and you of what you earn. And you will not be asked of what they used \n\tto do\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:134], \n\tthen holds his tongue and refrains from discussing the hadiths that speak of \n\ttribulation, disavows wrongdoing before his Lord, and believes that he \n\tshould love the family of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n\thim) and hate those who show enmity towards them, that will be better for \n\thim before his Lord and will be safer in terms of protecting his religious \n\tcommitment.\u00a0\n\n\tMany of the reports which have been narrated about \n\ttribulations that occurred among the Muslims were narrated via single \n\tnarrators (as opposed to a large number of narrators at each stage of the \n\tchain of transmission) who were either dubious, liars or unknown. It is not \n\tpermissible for anyone to rely upon any of the reports narrated by such \n\tpeople, because they do not meet the standards of good character (that are \n\trequired of narrators). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of \n\tthe meaning): \u201cO \n\tyou who believe! If a rebellious evil person comes to you with a news, \n\tverify it, lest you harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become \n\tregretful to what you have done\u201d \n\t[al-Hujuraat 49:6].\n\n\tAmong these false reports is that which was narrated by at-Tabari \n\tin his Tareekh (5/461) and Ibn \u2018Asaakir in Tareekh Dimashq \n\t(69/176), via Abu Makhnaf, from al-Haarith ibn Ka\u2018b, from Faatimah bint \n\t\u2018Ali, who said:\u00a0\n\n\tWhen we were brought before Yazeed ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah, he felt \n\tsorry for us, issued instructions that something (food) be brought to us, \n\tand spoke gently to us. Then a ruddy-faced man from Syria stood up and said \n\tto Yazeed: O Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen, give me this one \u2013 meaning me, for I was a \n\tpretty young girl. I got scared, because I thought that they would not \n\trefrain from such a thing, and I held onto the garment of my sister Zaynab. \n\tMy sister Zaynab was older and wiser than me, and she knew that that would \n\tnot happen, so she said (to that man): \n\n\tYou are lying by Allah, you vile man! That is not for you or \n\thim. Yazeed got angry and said (to her): You are lying, by Allah! I may do \n\tthat, and if I want to do it, I will do it. She said: No, by Allah. Allah \n\thas forbidden that for you, unless you leave our religion and follow some \n\treligion other than ours. Yazeed got angry and lost his temper, and he said: \n\tAre you speaking to me like that? Rather it is your father and your brother \n\twho have left the religion!\u00a0\n\n\tZaynab said: Rather you, your father and your grandfather \n\twere guided by virtue of the religion of Allah, the religion of my father, \n\tthe religion of my brother, the religion of my grandfather. He said: You are \n\tlying, O enemy of Allah! She said: You are a tyrant, who slanders people \n\twrongfully and suppress them. By Allah, it was as if he felt ashamed, so he \n\tfell silent. Then the Syrian said again: O Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen, give me this \n\tgirl. He said: Get out; may Allah strike you dead!\u00a0\n\n\tThis was also narrated by Ibn Katheer in al-Bidaayah \n\twa\u2019n-Nihaayah (11/562) via Abu Makhnaf.\u00a0\n\n\tAbu Makhnaf\u2019s full name is Loot ibn Yahya. Adh-Dhahabi said: \n\tHe is a worthless narrator of stories; he is not to be trusted; he was \n\tignored by Abu Haatim and others. Ad-Daaraqutni said: He is weak. Ibn Ma\u2018een \n\tsaid: He is not trustworthy. And he said, on one occasion: He is nothing. \n\tIbn \u2018Adiyy said: He is a fanatical Shi\u2018i, a narrator of their reports.\u00a0\n\n\tMizaan al-I\u2018tidaal.\u00a0\n\n\tSo this report is a lie and is not sound.\u00a0\n\n\tThe same applies to what they say about Yazeed ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah \n\tpoking the teeth of al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) with a stick \n\t[after he had been killed and beheaded].\u00a0\n\n\tZaynab said to him:\u00a0\n\n\tDo you think, O Yazeed, after you have gained control over us \n\tand we have ended up being driven as slave women are driven, that we are \n\tinsignificant to Allah and that you are honoured by Him, and that this was \n\tbecause you are of high status before Him, so you began to behave in an \n\tinsolent manner and began to look at yourself with jubilant self-admiration? \n\tIs it fair, O son of the freed ones [people of Quraysh who were let off by \n\tthe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when they surrendered \n\tfollowing the conquest of Makkah, despite their years of enmity towards \n\thim], to keep your womenfolk and slave women out of sight and to drive the \n\tdaughters of the Messenger of Allah like prisoners of war, after you have \n\ttorn their veils and forced them to show their faces, and their enemies \n\tdrive them from one land to another?\u00a0\n\n\tThis is something for which there is no basis in the books of \n\tthe scholars; rather it is something that was narrated only by the Raafidis \n\twho are known for lying.\u00a0\n\n\tShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid:\n\n\tWhat is proven in Saheeh al-Bukhaari is that the head \n\tof al-Husayn was brought and placed in front of \u2018Ubaydullah ibn Ziyaad, who \n\tstarted poking at the teeth with a stick in the presence of Anas ibn Maalik.\u00a0\n\n\tIn al-Musnad it says that this happened in the \n\tpresence of Abu Barzah al-Aslami.\u00a0\n\n\tBut some people narrated with an interrupted isnaad that this \n\tpoking of the teeth happened in the presence of Yazeed ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah. This \n\tis false. End quote.\u00a0\n\n\tMajmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa \n\t(27/469)\u00a0\n\n\tHe also said:\u00a0\n\n\tYazeed ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah was in Syria, and was not in Iraq at \n\tthe time of the killing of al-Husayn. Whoever narrated that he poked his \n\tteeth with a stick in the presence of Anas and Abu Barzah, in front of \n\tYazeed, is definitely lying, and his lie is well known on the basis of \n\tmutawaatir reports. End quote.\u00a0\n\n\tMajmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa \n\t(27/4 70)\u00a0\n\n\tSecondly:\u00a0\n\n\tThe well-known view is that Yazeed ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah did not \n\tissue orders for the killing of al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) \n\tand did not approve of it. He cursed Ibn Ziyaad for killing him, and he \n\thonoured the family of al-Husayn who had been with him during that march of \n\this, and during their march back to Madinah. He did not detain them and keep \n\tthem with him. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid:\u00a0\n\n\tYazeed ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah was born during the caliphate of \n\t\u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan (may Allah be pleased with him) and was not one of \n\tthose who were well-known for religious commitment and righteousness. He was \n\tone of the Muslim youth, and he became caliph after his father\u2019s death \n\tdespite the objections of some of the Muslims and with the approval of \n\tothers. He was courageous and generous, and he did not openly commit \n\tshameful deeds as his opponents said concerning him. During his reign \n\tseveral significant events occurred, one of which was the killing of al-Husayn \n\t(may Allah be pleased with him).\u00a0\n\n\tHe did not issue orders that al-Husayn be killed, and he did \n\tnot express joy at his killing, and he did not poke the teeth of al-Husayn \n\t(may Allah be pleased with him) with a stick or carry the head of al-Husayn \n\t(may Allah be pleased with him) to Syria. But he did issue orders that al-Husayn \n\t(may Allah be pleased with him) be resisted and his efforts to become caliph \n\twere to be hindered, even if that meant fighting him.\u00a0\n\n\tHis deputies went too far in following his commands, and ash-Shamar \n\tibn Dhi\u2019l-Jawshan incited \u2018Ubaydullah ibn Ziyaad to kill him, so \u2018Ubaydullah \n\tibn Ziyaad attacked him. Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) asked \n\tthem to let him come to Yazeed, or go and guard the Muslim border, or to go \n\tback to Makkah.\u00a0\n\n\tBut they did not allow him (may Allah be pleased with him) to \n\tdo any of these things, and the only choice they gave him was to surrender \n\tto them, and Ziyaad ordered \u2018Umar ibn Sa\u2018d to fight him, and they killed him \n\tunlawfully, him and a number of his family members (may Allah be pleased \n\twith them).\u00a0\n\n\tThe killing of al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) was \n\ta great calamity, for the killing of al-Husayn and of \u2018Uthmaan before him \n\twere two of the greatest causes of tribulation in this ummah. They were \n\tkilled by the worst of people before Allah.\u00a0\n\n\tWhen his family (may Allah be pleased with them) came to \n\tYazeed ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah, he honoured them and let them go to Madinah. It was \n\tnarrated that he cursed Ibn Ziyaad for killing him and said: I would have \n\tbeen content with the obedience of the people of Iraq, without the killing \n\tof al-Husayn. Yet despite that, he did not take any action to show \n\tdisapproval of his killing or to avenge him, when he should have done that. \n\tSo the Muslims criticised him for not doing what he should have done, in \n\taddition to other things.\u00a0\n\n\tAs for his opponents, they added other lies and fabrications \n\tabout him. End quote.\u00a0\n\n\tMajmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa \n\t(3/410)\u00a0\n\n\tIt was narrated that after that he regretted the killing of \n\tal-Husayn and he used to say: What could have happened if I had put up with \n\tsome annoyance and let him come to my house, and let him have what he \n\twanted, even if that led to weakening of my power and authority, for the \n\tsake of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n\tand in showing due respect to him and to the members of his household?\u00a0\n\n\tThen he would say: May Allah curse Ibn Marjaanah [i.e., \n\t\u2018Ubaydullah ibn Ziyaad], for he attacked him and forced him to fight, when \n\the had asked him to let him go and let him come to me, or to go and guard \n\tone of the borders of the Muslims until Allah, may He be exalted, took his \n\tsoul in death. But he did not do that, and he refused to let him do (any of \n\tthose things), and he killed him, and by killing him he made me hateful to \n\tthe Muslims and instilled enmity in their hearts against me, so that both \n\trighteous and evildoers hate me, because of what people think of the \n\tseriousness of my having killed Husayn.

        "question": "How did the Islamic conquest of Iran happen?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tBefore the Islamic conquest, Iran was under the rule of the \n\tSasanids, and suffered from a great deal of injustice, corruption and \n\toppression. Zoroastrianism was the official religion of Iran until the \n\tIslamic conquest.\u00a0\n\n\tThe Islamic conquest of Iran began during the caliphate of \n\tAbu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him), when al-Muthanna ibn \n\tHaarithah conquered some of the neighbouring lands in the region of \n\tMesopotamia in 13 AH.\u00a0\n\n\tDuring the caliphate of \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with \n\thim), Abu \u2018Ubayd ath-Thaqafi (may Allah be pleased with him) tried to invade \n\tIran from the south-west, and faced the Persians in the Battle of the Bridge \n\tin 13 AH. He met Jaabaan in battle, and Allah defeated the Magians and \n\tenabled the Muslims to capture Jaabaan. Then Abu \u2018Ubayd marched to Kaskar \n\twhen he and Nursi met in battle and he defeated him. Then he met Jalinus in \n\tbattle and defeated him. Then the tide of fortune turned against the \n\tMuslims, and many of them were killed and drowned, and Abu \u2018Ubayd (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with him) was killed.\u00a0\n\n\tSiyar A\u2018laam an-Nubala\u2019 \n\t(2/421)\u00a0\n\n\tThen the Muslims completed the conquest of Iran under the \n\tleadership of Sa\u2018d ibn Abi Waqqaas in 14 AH, when the Muslim army in Persia \n\tinflicted a mighty defeat (on the Persians) in the Battle of al-Qaadisiyyah, \n\twhich was one of the major battles of the Muslims.\u00a0\n\n\tThe historians stated that the Muslims were between seven and \n\teight thousand strong, and that Rostom, the Persian commander, had sixty \n\tthousand troops.\u00a0\n\n\tOn a Monday in Muharram 14 AH, a strong wind blew and lifted \n\tthe tents of the Persians from their places, and the couch of Rostom, that \n\thad been set up for him, was overturned. He hastened to ride his mule and \n\tflee, but the Muslims overtook him and killed him. They also killed al-Jalinus, \n\tthe commander of the Persian vanguard, and the Persians were defeated \u2013 \n\tpraise be to Allah \u2013 to the last man and the Muslims pursued them. On that \n\tday those who were chained were killed in their entirety, of whom there were \n\tthirty thousand. Ten thousand were killed in the battle, and before that a \n\tsimilar number had also been killed. On that day and on the previous days, \n\ttwo thousand five hundred Muslims were killed, may Allah have mercy on \n\tthem.\u00a0\n\n\tThe Muslims pursued those who fled until they entered the \n\tcapital city behind them, namely al-Madaa\u2019in (Ctesiphon), which was the seat \n\tof the court of Chosroes.\u00a0\n\n\tFrom the battle of al-Qaadisiyyah the Muslims seized an \n\tindescribably huge amount of wealth and weapons. The booty was gathered \n\tafter giving the troops their shares, and the khums and glad tidings of the \n\tvictory were sent to Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be \n\tpleased with him).\u00a0\n\n\tAl-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah \n\t(9/630)\u00a0\n\n\tThen the Muslims continued their advance into Persian \n\tterritory, and were enabled to conquer the southern part of Iran, whilst the \n\truler Yazdegerd III retreated to the region of Isfahan in central Iran, \n\twhere he began to assemble troops in an attempt to retake what he had lost. \n\tThe Muslims and the troops of Yazdegerd met in the Battle of Jalula in 18 \n\tAH, which ended with the defeat of Yazdegerd and his army, and his retreat \n\ttowards Isfahan.\u00a0\n\n\tAt-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n\tOn that day Allah killed one hundred thousand of them, and \n\tthe slain covered [jallalat] the ground in all directions. It was called \n\tJalula because it was covered with the bodies of their slain.\u00a0\n\n\tTareekh at-Tabari \n\t(4/26)\u00a0\n\n\tThen Yazdegerd met the Muslims in the decisive Battle of \n\tNahawand in 21 AH, where the Muslims won a clear victory, after which the \n\tSasanids no longer had any power. The Muslims seized a great deal of booty, \n\twhich led to them dubbing this battle \u201cthe conquest of conquests\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\tIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was a \n\tmighty battle of great significance and wondrous events, and the Muslims \n\tused to call it the conquest of conquests.

        "question": "He is asking about the origin of the Jews",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tThe Jews did not originate in Egypt; rather they originated \n\tin Palestine, but Egypt was one of the significant stages in the history of \n\tthe Jews. That is because the Jewish religion began at the time of the \n\tProphet of Allah Ya\u2018qoob (peace be upon him), who was born and lived in the \n\tholy land, and was granted the honour of Prophethood there. Allah blessed \n\thim with many children, and part of his story is what Allah, may He be \n\tglorified and exalted, tells us of in detail in Soorah Yoosuf, when the \n\tbrothers of Yoosuf (peace be upon him) plotted against their brother. The \n\tstory led to him becoming a governor in Egypt, and ended with Ya\u2018qoob (peace \n\tbe upon him) and his sons coming to Egypt and settling there under the \n\tauspices of Yoosuf (peace be upon him), as Allah, may He be glorified and \n\texalted, tells us (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t\u201cThen, when \n\tthey entered unto Yoosuf (Joseph), he betook his parents to himself and \n\tsaid: \u2018Enter Egypt, if Allah wills, in security\u2019\u201d\n\n\t[Yoosuf 12:99].\u00a0\n\n\tThey did not leave Egypt until they left with the Prophet of \n\tAllah Moosa, and after wandering in the wilderness for forty years, until \n\tthey entered the holy land of Palestine, where they were ruled by Sulaymaan \n\t(peace be upon him) and where they had a glorious history.\u00a0\n\n\tThe Muslims and Jews do not differ concerning this general \n\thistory. In fact the Torah \u2013 as it exists in the print editions today \u2013 \n\tclearly states the connection of Ya\u2018qoob (Jacob \u2013 peace be upon him) \u2013 also \n\tknown as Israa\u2019eel or Israel \u2013 to the land of Kan\u2018aan (Canaan), the land of \n\tPalestine, as it says in the Torah: \n\n\t\u201cAnd Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in \n\tthe land of Canaan\u201d\n\n\tGenesis 31:1.\u00a0\n\n\tWe referred to a number of historical books that deal with \n\tthe history of the Jews or the Children of Israel, and we found that they \n\tare unanimously agreed on this historical summary, despite the fact that \n\tthese books based their information on so many sources. But this overview is \n\tproven and confirmed.\u00a0\n\n\tSee:\n\n\tAl-\u2018Arab wa\u2019l-Yahood fi\u2019t-Tareekh \n\tby Dr Ahmad as-Soosah, Dar al-\u2018Arabi\n\n\tAl-\u2018Arab wa\u2019-s-Saamiyyoon wa\u2019l-\u2018Ibraaniyyoon wa Bani \n\tIsraa\u2019eel wa\u2019l-Yahood by \n\tDr Ahmad Dawood, Dar al-Mustaqbal\n\n\tTareekh Filasteen al-Qadeem \n\tby Zafar Islam Khan, Dar an-Naqqaash\n\n\tWe will quote here a medium-length overview of Jewish \n\thistory, by Dr Mahmoud Qadah, who said:\u00a0\n\n\tOur history begins with Israa\u2019eel (Israel) \u2013 namely Ya\u2018qoob \n\tibn Is-haaq ibn Ibraaheem al-Khaleel (Jacob son of Isaac son of Abraham the \n\tClose Friend of Allah \u2013 peace be upon them all) \u2013 who grew up and lived in \n\tthe land of the Canaanites (Palestine), who had twelve sons from four wives, \n\tas follows:\n\n\tReuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun \u2013 their \n\tmother was Leah\u00a0\n\n\tJoseph (Yoosuf \u2013 peace be upon him) and Benjamin (Binyameen) \n\t\u2013 their mother was Rachel (Raaheel)\u00a0\n\n\tDan and Naphtali \u2013 their mother was Bilhah, the handmaid of \n\tRachel\n\n\tGad and Asher \u2013 their mother was Zilpah, the handmaid of \n\tLeah\u00a0\n\n\tThe twelve sons were the origin of the Israelite tribes.\u00a0\n\n\tThen comes the famous story of Joseph (Yoosuf \u2013 peace be upon \n\thim) with his brothers and their father Jacob (Ya\u2018qoob \u2013 peace be upon him), \n\tand how Israel (Jacob) and his sons moved to live in the land of Egypt, \n\twhere they were honoured and respected under the auspices of Joseph (peace \n\tbe upon him).\u00a0\n\n\tAfter the deaths of Jacob and Joseph (peace be upon them), \n\twith the passage of time and the succession of kings, the situation of the \n\tChildren of Israel in Egypt changed from one of honour and respect to one of \n\thumiliation and ignominy, because the Pharaoh of Egypt persecuted and \n\tenslaved the Israelites. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of \n\tthe meaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd \n\t(remember) when We rescued you from Firauns (Pharaoh) people, who were \n\tafflicting you with the worst torment, killing your sons and letting your \n\twomen live. And in that was a great trial from your Lord\u201d\n\n\t[al-A\u2018raaf 7:141]\n\n\tThen Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sent Moses and \n\tAaron (peace be upon them), the two sons of Amram son of Kohath son of Levi \n\tson of Jacob (\u2018Imraan ibn Qahaat ibn Laawi ibn Ya\u2018qoob \u2013 peace be upon him) \n\tto Pharaoh and his people, supported with miracles, to call them to believe \n\tin Allah alone, and to stop persecuting the Children of Israel. But Pharaoh \n\tand his people rejected the message, disobeyed Allah and disbelieved in Him \n\tand his signs. So Allah commanded His Messenger Moses to depart from Egypt \n\twith the Children of Israel. Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, and Allah \n\tdrowned them in the sea, but He delivered Moses and his people into the land \n\tof Sinai.\u00a0\n\n\tThe people of Moses (peace be upon him), the Children of \n\tIsrael \u2013 with whom he departed from Egypt \u2013 had lived in a state of \n\tservitude, humiliation and idolatry for many years. Their beliefs had become \n\tcorrupted, their souls had been tainted with evil, and their resolve have \n\tweakened. Their stubbornness, laziness, fatalism, carelessness and \n\tdisobedience to the command of Allah and His Messenger became obvious\u2026 \n\tDespite the many signs and miracles that Allah, may He be glorified and \n\texalted, bestowed upon the people of Moses, they showed an attitude of \n\tstubbornness and arrogance, and refused to believe unless they saw Allah \n\twith their own eyes. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n\tmeaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd \n\t(remember) when you said: \u2018O Moosa (Moses)! We shall never believe in you \n\ttill we see Allah plainly.\u2019 But you were seized with a thunderbolt \n\t(lightning) while you were looking.\n\n\tThen We raised you up after your death, so that you might be \n\tgrateful\u201d\n\n\t[al-Baqarah 2:55]\n\n\t\u201cThe people \n\tof the Scripture (Jews) ask you to cause a book to descend upon them from \n\theaven. Indeed they asked Moosa (Moses) for even greater than that, when \n\tthey said: \u2018Show us Allah in public,\u2019 but they were struck with thunder clap \n\tand lightning for their wickedness. Then they worshipped the calf even after \n\tclear proofs, evidences, and signs had come to them. (Even) so We forgave \n\tthem. And We gave Moosa (Moses) a clear proof of authority\u201d\n\n\t[an-Nisa\u2019 4:153].\u00a0\n\n\tAfter these miracles and clear signs that Allah bestowed upon \n\tthe Children of Israel, when Moses (peace be upon him) went to meet his Lord \n\tand receive the Torah on Mount Sinai, and they thought that he was taking \n\ttoo long to return to them, they reverted to what they were familiar with of \n\tidolatry in Egypt, and they took the calf for worship.\u00a0\n\n\tThey continued to be impatient lazy, demanding, stubborn and \n\trebellious, until they said what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, \n\ttells us about in the Holy Qur\u2019an, where He says (interpretation of the \n\tmeaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd \n\t(remember) when you said, \u2018O Moosa (Moses)! We cannot endure one kind of \n\tfood. So invoke your Lord for us to bring forth for us of what the earth \n\tgrows, its herbs, its cucumbers, its Foom (wheat or garlic), its lentils and \n\tits onions.\u2019 He said, \u2018Would you exchange that which is better for that \n\twhich is lower? Go you down to any town and you shall find what you want!\u2019 \n\tAnd they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on \n\tthemselves the Wrath of Allah. That was because they used to disbelieve the \n\tAyat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah \n\tand killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used \n\tto transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allah, i.e. commit crimes \n\tand sins)\u201d\n\n\t[al-Baqarah 2:61].\u00a0\n\n\tAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, instructed them to \n\tenter the holy land (Bayt al-Maqdis \u2013 Jerusalem \u2013 and the land of goodness) \n\tand promised them victory, and Moses asked his people to do that. Allah, may \n\tHe be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd \n\t(remember) when Moosa (Moses) said to his people: \u2018O my people! Remember the \n\tFavour of Allah to you, when He made Prophets among you, made you kings, and \n\tgave you what He had not given to any other among the Alameen (mankind and \n\tjinns, in the past).\n\n\t\u2018O my people! Enter the holy land (Palestine) which Allah has \n\tassigned to you, and turn not back (in flight) for then you will be returned \n\tas losers.\u2019\n\n\tThey said: \u2018O Moosa (Moses)! In it (this holy land) are a \n\tpeople of great strength, and we shall never enter it, till they leave it; \n\twhen they leave, then we will enter.\u2019\n\n\tTwo men of those who feared (Allah and) on whom Allah had \n\tbestowed His Grace (they were Yoosha (Joshua) and Kalab (Caleb)) said: \n\t\u2018Assault them through the gate, for when you are in, victory will be yours, \n\tand put your trust in Allah if you are believers indeed.\u2019\n\n\tThey said: \u2018O Moosa (Moses)! We shall never enter it as long \n\tas they are there. So go you and your Lord and fight you two, we are sitting \n\tright here.\u2019\n\n\tHe (Moosa (Moses)) said: \u2018O my Lord! I have power only over \n\tmyself and my brother, so separate us from the people who are the Fasiqoon \n\t(rebellious and disobedient to Allah)!\u2019\n\n\t(Allah) said: \u2018Therefore it (this holy land) is forbidden to \n\tthem for forty years; in distraction they will wander through the land. So \n\tbe not sorrowful over the people who are the Fasiqoon (rebellious and \n\tdisobedient to Allah).\u2019\u201d\n\n\t[al-Maa\u2019idah 5:21-26].\u00a0\n\n\tTherefore Allah decreed that they should wander in the \n\twilderness of Sinai for forty years, constantly travelling and not finding \n\ttheir way out of it, until that disobedient, careless generation that had \n\tleft Egypt with Moses died, from whom he had encountered indescribable \n\toffence and disobedience. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says, \n\tdescribing the offence they caused to Moses (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd (remember) when Moosa (Moses) said to his people: \u2018O my \n\tpeople! Why do you hurt me while you know certainly that I am the Messenger \n\tof Allah to you?\u2019 So when they turned away (from the Path of Allah), Allah \n\tturned their hearts away (from the Right Path). And Allah guides not the \n\tpeople who are Fasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)\u201d\n\n\t[as-Saff 61:5].\u00a0\n\n\tAaron died, followed by Moses (peace be upon them both) in \n\tthe wilderness, and Allah brought forth among the Children of Israel Yoosha\u2018 \n\tibn Noon (Joshua son of Nun), the servant of Moses (peace be upon them \n\tboth), as a Prophet and successor to Moses (peace be upon him).\u00a0\n\n\tWhen their sojourn in the wilderness ended, Joshua (peace be \n\tupon him) brought the Children of Israel out to Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), \n\twhich they besieged and Allah granted them the conquest thereof. Allah, may \n\tHe be glorified and exalted, commanded them, when they entered the holy land \n\t(interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd \n\t(remember) when We said: \u2018Enter this town (Jerusalem) and eat bountifully \n\ttherein with pleasure and delight wherever you wish, and enter the gate in \n\tprostration (or bowing with humility) and say: Forgive us, and We shall \n\tforgive you your sins and shall increase (reward) for the good-doers.\u2019\n\n\tBut those who did wrong changed the word from that which had \n\tbeen told to them for another, so We sent upon the wrong-doers Rijzan (a \n\tpunishment) from the heaven because of their rebelling against Allah\u2019s \n\tObedience.\u201d\n\n\t[al-Baqarah 2:58].\u00a0\n\n\tAfter they entered the holy land, Joshua (peace be upon him) \n\tbegan to complete the conquest thereof, and he divided the conquered lands \n\tamong the twelve Israelite tribes.\u00a0\n\n\tAfter the death of Joshua (peace be upon him), leadership of \n\tthe Children of Israel was taken over by their judges.\u00a0\n\n\tEnd quote from Majallat al-Jaami\u2018ah al-Islamiyyah \n\t(issue no. 107, p. 246-253)\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "What\u2019s So Special about the Month of Safar?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The month of Safar is one of the twelve months of the Hijri calendar ; it is the month that comes after Muharram . Some of them say that it was so called because Makkah was emptied of its inhabitants [the verb used in Arabic to describe this comes from the same root as the name of the month Safar], when they travelled during this month.\u00a0\nIt was also suggested that they called it Safar because they used to fight other tribes during this month, and they would leave whoever they met with zero (sifr) goods (i.e., they would plunder his goods, leaving him with nothing).) Lisaan al-\u2018Arab by Ibn Manzoor (vol. 4, p. 462-463)\nWe will discuss this month under the following points:\nWhat was narrated concerning it from the Arabs of the Jahiliyyah.\nWhat was narrated in Islamic teaching that is contrary to what the people of the Jaahiliyyah believed.\nInnovations and false beliefs concerning this month that are found among some followers of Islam.\nWhat happened during this month of battles and important events in the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nWhat has been narrated of false hadiths about Safar.\nWhat was narrated concerning the month of Safar from the Arabs of the Jahiliyyah\nThe Arabs had two grave objectionable practices with regard to the month of Safar:\u00a0\n\nThey used to tamper with it, bringing it forward and putting it back from its place in the calendar\nThey regarded it as unlucky\n\nWith regard to tampering with the month of Safar, it is well-known that Allah, may He be exalted, created the year and the number of its months as twelve months, four of which Allah, may He be exalted, made sacred, during which it was prohibited to fight, out of respect for the sanctity of the month. These months are: Dhu\u2019l-Qa\u2018dah, Dhu\u2019l-Hijjah, Muharram and Rajab .\u00a0\nThe confirmation of that in the book of Allah is the verse in which He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cVerily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year), so was it ordained by Allah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are Sacred. That is the right religion, so wrong not yourselves therein\u201d [at-Tawbah 9:36].\u00a0\nThe mushrikeen were aware of that, but they used to postpone them or bring them forward, according to their whims and desires. As part of that, they used to put the month of Safar in the place of Muharram!\nThey believed that \u2018umrah during the months of Hajj was one of the worst of evils. There follow some scholarly comments on that:\u00a0\n\nIt was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: They used to think that \u2018umrah during the months of Hajj was one of the worst evils on earth. They would make Muharram Safar and say: They would say: when the backs of the camels have healed and the tracks of the pilgrims have become erased and Safar is over, \u2018Umrah becomes permissible for those who want to do \u2018Umrah. (Narrated by al-Bukhari (1489) and Muslim (1240))\nIbn al-\u2018Arabi said:\u00a0\n\n\u201cManner of postponing sacred months:\u00a0\nThere are three views concerning the manner in which the sacred months were postponed:\n1- It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that Junadah ibn \u2018Awf ibn Umayyah al-Kinani used to attend the Hajj season every year and call out: Verily Abu Thumama is never rejected or refuted. Verily Safar last year was not sacred; we make it sacred one year and not sacred the next year. And they were with Hawazin, Ghatafan and Banu Sulaym (regarding this matter).\u00a0\nAccording to another version, he used to say: We will bring Muharram forward and delay Safar. Then the next year he would say: We will regard Safar as sacred and delay Muharram. That is what delaying the sacred month means.\n2- Adding to the sacred months. Qatadah said: Some of the misguided people decided to add Safar to the sacred months, so their spokesman would stand up during the Hajj season and say: Your gods have decided that Muharram is to be regarded as sacred this year. So they would regard it as sacred that year. Then the following year he would stand up and say: Your gods have decided to regard Safar as sacred. So they would regard it as sacred that year, and would say: There are two Safars.\u00a0\nIbn Wahb and Ibn Qasim narrated something similar from Malik, who said: The people of the Jahiliyyah used to regard them as two Safars. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere is no Safar.\u201d That is how Ashhab narrated it from him.\u00a0\n3- Changing the time of Hajj. Mujaahid said, with a different isnaad: \u201cThe postponement (of a Sacred Month) is indeed an addition to disbelief\u201d [at-Tawbah 9:37]. He said: They used to do Hajj in Dhu\u2019l-Hijjah for two years, then they would do Hajj in Muharram for two years, then they would do Hajj in Safar for two years. They would do Hajj in each month for two years, until the Hajj of Abu Bakr, which was in Dhu\u2019l-Qa\u2018dah, then the Hajj of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was in Dhu\u2019l-Hijjah. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said in his Farewell Sermon, according to the saheeh hadith: \u201cTime has returned to its original order as it was on the day when Allah created the heavens and the earth.\u201d Narrated by Ibn 'Abbas and others.\u00a0\nHe said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cO people, listen to my words, for I do not know whether I will meet you again after this day of mine in this place. O people, verily your blood and your wealth are sacred, until the Day you meet your Lord, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Verily you will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. I have conveyed the message. Whoever has a trust, let him render it back to the one who entrusted it to him. All riba is abolished, but you may keep your capital, so that you will not wrong others and you will not be wronged. Allah has decreed that there should be no riba, and the riba of \u2018Abbas ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib is all abolished. Verily every blood feud of the Jaahiliyyah is abolished, and the first of your blood feuds that I abolish is the blood feud of Ibn Rabee\u2018ah ibn al-Harith ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib. He was breastfed among Banu Layth and killed by Hudhayl. This is the first step in abolishing the blood feuds of the Jahiliyyah.\u00a0\n\u201cTo proceed: O people, verily the Shaytan has despaired of ever being worshipped in your land, but if he is obeyed in other matters, that you think of as insignificant of your misdeeds, he will be content. So beware, O people, lest he undermine your religious commitment. \u2018The postponing (of a Sacred Month) is indeed an addition to disbelief: thereby the disbelievers are led astray, for they make it lawful one year and forbid it another year in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by Allah\u2019 [at-Tawbah 9:37]. Time has returned to its original order as it was on the day when Allah created the heavens and the earth. Verily the number of months with Allah is twelve months, of which four are sacred: three consecutive months, and Rajab of Mudar, which comes between Jumada and Sha\u2018ban.\u201d Then he quoted the rest of the hadith. (Ahkam al-Quran (2/503-504))\nWith regard to regarding the month of Safar as unlucky , that was well known among the people of the Jahiliyyah and continued among some followers of Islam.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cNo \u2018adwa [transmission of infectious disease without the permission of Allah], no tiyarah [superstitious belief in bird omens], no haamah [refers to a Jahili Arab tradition described variously as: a worm that infests the grave of a murder victim until he is avenged; an owl; or the bones of a dead person turned into a bird that could fly], and no Safar [the month of Safar was regarded as unlucky in the Jahiliyyah]. But flee from the leper as you would flee from a lion.\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by al-Bukhari (5387) and Muslim (2220)\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cSeveral explanations were given for the word \u201cSafar\u201d [in this hadith]:\u00a0\n1. that it was the well-known month of Safar, which the Arabs regarded as unlucky;\n2. that it was an internal disease affecting camels, that may be transmitted from one camel to another, and it was mentioned after \u2018adwa [contagion or transmission of infectious disease] by way of mentioning a specific type of contagion after mentioning something general;\n3. that it referred to the month of Safar, but what was meant was postponing the sacred months, by which the disbelievers were led astray. Hence they would delay regarding the month of Muharram as sacred, and defer it until Safar, regarding it as not sacred one year, and regarding it as sacred the following year.\nWhat is most likely to be the case is that what is meant here is the month of Safar, as they used to regard it as unlucky during the Jahiliyyah.\u00a0\nBut time and months have no impact on people or on the decrees of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Therefore time in Safar is like time in any other month, when good or bad may be decreed.\u00a0\nSome people, if they finish some work on, say, the twenty fifth of Safar, will give the date by saying \u201cIt was completed on the twenty fifth of the good month of Safar.\u201d This comes under the heading of fighting bid\u2018ah with bid\u2018ah. Safar is neither a good month nor a bad month. Therefore some of the early generation would denounce a person who said, upon hearing the call of the owl [which was regarded as inauspicious during the Jahiliyyah], \u201cIt is good, in sha Allah,\u201d by stating that it should not be described as either good or bad; rather it calls like any other bird.\u00a0\nThe fact that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that these four things have no impact indicates that it is obligatory to put one\u2019s trust in Allah alone and to be steadfast, and not to feel weak when faced with these things.\u00a0\nIf the Muslim pays attention to such superstitious matters, it must be one of two scenarios:\u00a0\n1. Either he responds to these superstitions by going ahead with his plans or refraining (according to superstition), in which case he has connected his deeds to something that has no reality or substance,\n2. or he does not respond, by going ahead with his plans and not paying any attention (to the superstitious matter), but there remains in his mind some kind of worry and distress. Even though this is not as bad as the first case, he should not pay any attention at all to these matters, and he should put his truth solely in Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nDenying that these four matters do not have any impact does not mean denying that they exist \u2013 because they do in fact exist; rather it is denying that they have any influence, because the only one with influence is Allah. Whatever is a real cause is a valid and sound cause, and whatever is an imaginary cause is a false cause, and we deny that it has any influence in and of itself.\u201d\u00a0(Majmoo\u2018 Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen, 2/113-115)\nWhat was narrated in Islamic teaching that is contrary to what the people of the Jaahiliyyah believed\nThis was referred to in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah in as-Saheehayn, where it says that the belief of the people of the Jaahiliyyah concerning Safar was blameworthy, because it is one of the months of Allah and has no will of its own: rather it is subject to the will of Allah.\nInnovations and false beliefs concerning this month that are found among some followers of Islam\n1. The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked:\nSome of the scholars in our country claim that in the religion of Islam there is a naafil (supererogatory) prayer to be offered on the last Wednesday of the month of Safar, at the time of Duha prayer; it is four rak\u2018ahs with one tasleem, and in each rak\u2018ah one should recite the Opening of the Book (i.e., Surah al-Faatihah), Surah al-Kawthar seventeen times, Surah al-Ikhlas fifty times, and al-Mu'awwidhatayn [the last two surahs of the Quran] one time each, and that is to be done in each rak\u2018ah, then the tasleem is to be said [at the end]. After saying the tasleem, one should start to recite \u201cAnd Allah has full power and control over His Affairs, but most of men know not\u201d [Yoosuf 12:21] three hundred and sixty times, and Jawhar al-Kamal three times, and conclude by saying \u201cGlorified be your Lord, the Lord of Honour and Power! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him! And peace be on the Messengers! And all the praise and thanks be to Allah, Lord of the \u2018Alameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists)\u201d [as-Saffat 37:180-182].\u00a0\nThen one should give some bread in charity to the poor. This verse is chosen to ward off calamities that may occur on the last Wednesday of the month of Safar.\u00a0\nThey say that every year, three hundred and twenty thousand calamities befall people, and all of that happens on the last Wednesday of the month of Safar. So that day is the most difficult of all the days of the year, but whoever offers this prayer in the manner described, Allah will protect him by His kindness from all calamities that come down on that day. Is this the case?\u00a0\nThe scholars of the Committee replied:\u00a0\nWith regard to this supererogatory prayer mentioned in the question, we do not know of any basis for it in the Quran or Sunnah. In our view it is not proven that any one of the early generations of this ummah or the righteous among its later generations did this supererogatory prayer. Rather it is a reprehensible innovation (bid\u2018ah).\nIt is proven from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: \u201cWhoever does a deed that is not part of this matter of ours, it will be rejected.\u201d And he said: \u201cWhoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it, it will be rejected.\u201d\u00a0\nWhoever attributes this prayer and the other things mentioned with it to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or to any of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) has uttered a grave lie, and he will have from Allah what he deserves of the punishment of those who tell lies.\u00a0(Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daimah, 2/354)\u00a0\n2. Shaykh Muhammad \u2018Abd as-Salam ash-Shuqayri said:\nThe ignorant have the custom of writing the verses of salaam, such as \u201cSalamun (peace) be upon Nooh (Noah) (from Us) among the Alameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists)\u201d [as-Saffat 37:79] and so on, on the last Wednesday of the month of Safar, then they put them in vessels and drink (water that has been poured on them), and seek barakah (blessing) thereby, and exchange them as gifts, because they believe that this will remove evil. This is a corrupt belief and is blameworthy superstition and an abhorrent innovation; everyone who sees it must denounce the one who does it.\u00a0(As-Sunan wa\u2019l-Mubtada\u2018at, pp. 111, 112)\u00a0\nWhat happened during this month of battles and important events in the life of the Prophet\u00a0\nThere were many such events, of which we will mention a few:\u00a0\n1. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cThen he himself led the campaign of al-Abwa\u2019, which is also known as Waddan. This was the first campaign that he led himself. It took place in Safar, twelve months after his migration (to Madinah). His banner, which was white, was carried by Hamzah ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib. He left Sa\u2018d ibn 'Ubadah in charge of Madinah during his absence, and he set out with the Muhajireen only to intercept a caravan belonging to Quraysh, and did not engage in any fighting.\nDuring this campaign, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) made a peace deal with Makhshi ibn \u2018Amr ad-Damri, who was the leader of Banu Damrah at that time, agreeing that he would not attack Banu Damrah, and they would not attack him, and that they would not join others against him or help any enemy against him, and a document to that effect was written between him and them. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was absent for fifteen days.\u201d\u00a0(Zad al-Ma'ad, 3/164-165)\u00a0\n2. He [Ibn al-Qayyim] also said:\n\u201cIn Safar 3 AH, some people came to him from (the tribes of) \u2018Adal and al-Qarah and said that some of them had already accepted Islam, and they asked him to send with them someone to teach them the religion and teach them Qur\u2019an. So he sent six people with them \u2013 according to the report of Ibn Ishaaq; al-Bukhari said that they were ten. He appointed as their leader Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghinawi, and among them was Khubayb ibn \u2018Adiyy. They went with them, but when they were in ar-Rajee\u2018 \u2013 which was a watering place belonging to Hudhayl in a district of al-Hijaz \u2013 they betrayed them and sought the help of Hudhayl against them, who came and surrounded them, and killed most of them, but they took Khubayb ibn \u2018Adiyy and Zayd ibn ad-Dathinah captive. They brought them to Makkah and sold them there; they had killed some of the leaders of Makkah on the day of Badr.\u201d\u00a0(Zad al-Ma'ad, 3/244)\u00a0\n3. And he [Ibn al-Qayyim] said:\n\u201cDuring this same month, namely Safar 4 AH, there occurred the battle of Bi\u2019r Ma\u2018oonah. To sum up:\nAbu Bara\u2019 \u2018Aamir ibn Maalik, who was known as Mala\u2018ib al-Asinnah [the Player with the Spears] came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Madinah. He called him to Islam but he did not become Muslim, yet he was not far from it. He said: O Messenger of Allah, if you were to send some of your companions to the people of Najd to invite them to your religion, I hope that they would respond to them. He said to him: \u201cI fear that the people of Najd may kill them.'' Abu Bara said: I will be their protector. So he sent forty men with him, according to the report of Ibn Ishaaq. In as-Saheeh it says that they were seventy; the report in as-Saheeh is the correct report. He appointed as their leader al-Mundhir ibn \u2018Amr, one of Banu Saa\u2018idah, who was known as \u201cThe Quick to Seek Death\u201d. They were among the best of the Muslims, the most virtuous of them, their leaders, those who had knowledge of the Qur\u2019an. They travelled until they halted in Bi\u2019r Ma\u2018oonah, which is between the land of Banu \u2018Aamir and the harrah of Banu Sulaym. They halted there, then they sent Haram ibn Milhan, the brother of Umm Sulaym, with the letter of the Messenger of Allah to the enemy of Allah 'Amir ibn at-Tufayl. He did not even look at it, and he ordered a man to stab him with a spear in his back. When Haram ibn Milhan was stabbed and saw the blood, he said: I have attained a victory, by the Lord of the Ka\u2018bah! Then the enemy of Allah tried to mobilise Banu \u2018Amir to fight the others, but they did not respond to him because of the protection of Abu Bara. Then he mobilised Banu Sulaym and [the tribes of] \u2018Usayyah, Ri\u2018l and Dhakwan responded. They came and surrounded the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, and they fought until they were all killed, except Ka\u2018b ibn Zayd ibn an-Najjar. He was wounded and was picked up from among the slain, and lived until he was killed on the Day of al-Khandaq. \u2018Amr ibn Umayyah ad-Damri and al-Mundhir ibn \u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018Amir were with the camels of the Muslims out at pasture, and they saw the birds flying over the location of the battle. Al-Mundhir ibn \u2018Uqbah came and fought the polytheists until he was killed with his companions, and \u2018Amr ibn Umayyah ad-Damri was taken captive, but when he told them that he was from Mudar, \u2018Amir cur off his forelock and released him on behalf of his mother, who had taken an oath to release a slave. \u2018Amr ibn Umayyah headed back [to Madinah] and when he came to al-Qarqarah at the beginning of Qanat [a place name], he stopped in the shade of a tree, and two men from Banu Kilab came and stopped with him. When they fell asleep, \u2018Amr killed them, thinking that he had taken revenge on them for the killing of his Companions, but they had a covenant with the Messenger of Allah of which he was not aware. When he came and told the Messenger of Allah about what he had done, he said: \u201cYou have killed two men whose diyah (blood money) I must pay.\u201d (Zad al-Ma'ad, 3/246-248)\u00a0\n4. Ibn al-Qayyim said:\n\u201cHis going out to Khaybar occurred at the end of Muharram and not at the beginning, and its conquest could only have taken place in Safar.\u201d\u00a0(Zad al-Ma'ad, 3/339-340)\u00a0\n5. And he [Ibn al-Qayyim] said:\n\u201cChapter on the expedition of Qatbah ibn 'Amir ibn Hadeedah to Khath\u2018am\u00a0\nThis happened in Safar 9 AH. Ibn Sa\u2018d said: They said: The Messenger of Allah sent Qatbah ibn 'Amir with twenty men to a tribe of Khath\u2018am in the region of Tabalah, and ordered him to launch a raid. They set out on ten camels, taking it in turns to ride them. They caught a man and questioned him, and he refused to talk, but then he cried out to the tribe, to warn them, so they struck his neck. Then they waited until the tribe had gone to sleep, then they launched the raid on them and the fighting grew fierce, until there were many wounded on both sides, and Qutbah ibn 'Amir killed whoever he killed,\u00a0 and they brought the camels, women and sheep to Madinah. According to the story, the tribe gathered together and pursued them, but Allah, may He be exalted, sent a great flood against them that came between them and the Muslims. The Muslim drove off the camels, sheep and captives as they were looking on, but they could not cross [the flood waters] to reach them, until they disappeared from sight.\u201d (Zad al-Ma'ad, 3/514)\u00a0\n6. And he [Ibn al-Qayyim] said:\n\u201cThe delegation of \u2018Udhrah came to the Messenger of Allah in Safar 9 AH, with twelve men, among whom was Jamrah ibn an-Nu\u2018maan. The Messenger of Allah said: Who are the people? Their spokesman said: We are not strangers to you; we are Banu \u2018Udhrah, the brother of Qusayy through his mother. We are the people who supported Qusayy and removed Khuza'ah and Banu Bakr from the valley of Makkah, and we have ties of kinship. The Messenger of Allah said: \u201cWelcome to you; I know you very well.\u201d They became Muslim, and the Messenger of Allah gave them the glad tidings of the conquest of Greater Syria and the flight of Heraclius to a fortified place in his own land. The Messenger of Allah forbade them to ask questions of soothsayers and offer sacrifices (that they used to offer during the Jahiliyyah), and he told them that they did not have to offer anything but the udhiyah. They stayed for several days in the house of Ramlah, then they left.\u201d (Zad al-Ma'ad, 3/657)\u00a0\nWhat has been narrated of false hadiths about Safar\nIbn al-Qayyim said:\u00a0\n\u201cSection on hadiths that mention dates in the future\u00a0\nWhere the hadith mentions certain dates, such as saying \u201cIn such and such a year, such and such will happen; or, in such and such a month, such and such will happen.\u201d\nOr as when the arch liar said: \u201cIf the moon is eclipsed in Muharram, prices will rise, there will be fighting and people in authority will be distracted, and if it is eclipsed in Safar, such and such will happen.\u201d\nAnd the liar went on to say something about all the months.\nAll such hadiths are false and fabricated. (Al-Manaar al-Muneef, p. 64)\nAnd Allah knows best"

        "question": "The calendar used by the Arabs before Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly:\n\n\tWith regard to the postponement of the months mentioned in \n\tthe verse (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThe \n\tpostponing (of a Sacred Month) is indeed an addition to disbelief: thereby \n\tthe disbelievers are led astray, for they make it lawful one year and forbid \n\tit another year in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by Allah, \n\tand make such forbidden ones lawful. The evil of their deeds seems pleasing \n\tto them. And Allah guides not the people, who disbelieve\u201d \n\t[at-Tawbah 9:37], this \n\trefers to their practice whereby they would decide that the sacred month of \n\tMuharram was not to be held sacred, and they would declare Safar as sacred \n\tinstead, if they needed to do that. \n\n\tThis has been discussed previously in the answer to question \n\tno. 165970.\n\n\tSecondly:\n\n\tTo sum up what has been mentioned in some books of history:\n\n\tBefore Islam, the Arabs used to use the lunar calendar, in \n\twhich there were twelve months that were determined by the sighting of the \n\tnew moon from one month to the next.\n\n\tAmong them there were four sacred months, during which they \n\twould refrain from fighting; they would hold their markets, such as \u2018Ukaaz \n\tand others; they would go on pilgrimage to the Ka\u2018bah; and they would be \n\tsafe on the road and at home from raids, plunder and banditry.\n\n\tBut despite the fact that they used the lunar calendar, they \n\tdid not have any particular system for dating important events, in most \n\tcases. Rather, when it came to dating important life events, they would \n\tconnect them to certain historical events, as follows:\n\n\t\u00b7The construction of the \n\tKa\u2018bah by Ibraaheem al-Khaleel and his son Ismaa\u2018eel (peace be upon them \n\tboth) \u2013 approximately 1855 BCE\n\n\t\u00b7The Year of Treason, which \n\twas the year in which Banu Yarboo\u2018 stole the goods that some of the kings of \n\tBanu Himyar had sent to the Ka\u2018bah \u2013 461 BCE\n\n\t\u00b7The collapse of the Ma\u2019rib \n\tDam in Yemen \u2013 120 BCE approx.\n\n\t\u00b7The death of Ka\u2018b ibn Lu\u2018ayy, \n\tthe seventh great-grandfather of the Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace \n\tof Allah be upon him) \u2013 59 BCE\n\n\t\u00b7The Year of the Elephant, \n\twhich is the year in which the great Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace \n\tof Allah be upon him) was born \u2013 571 CE\n\n\t\u00b7The Sacrilegious War, which \n\twas so called because the Arabs committed a grave act of sacrilege in it, \n\twhen their tribes fought amongst themselves during the sacred months. This \n\twar lasted for four years, beginning in 586 CE.\n\n\t\u00b7The reconstruction of the \n\tKa\u2018bah, which occurred at the time of \u2018Abd al-Muttalib, the grandfather of \n\tthe Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). At that \n\ttime, the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was 35 years \n\told. This means that it occurred in 605 CE, i.e., five years before the \n\tmission of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) began.\n\n\tThroughout their long history before Islam, the Arabs used \n\tthe names of the lunar months that were known at that time, until these \n\tnames changed and throughout the Arab land began to take on the forms by \n\twhich they are known now, from the end of the fifth century CE \u2013 during the \n\tera of Kilaab, the fifth great-grandfather of the Messenger Muhammad \n\t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as was stated by al-Biruni in \n\t412 CE. During the Jaahiliyyah, the Arabs also used the solar months during \n\tsome periods and in some places.\n\n\tFor more information, please see: al-Mufassal fi Tareekh \n\tal-\u2018Arab qabl al-Islam (1/5014); Murooj adh-Dhahab by al-Mas\u2018oodi \n\t(1/249)\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Who Is the Prophet Daniel?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Who is Prophet Daniel?\u00a0\nMore than one of the scholars of history and biography have stated that Daniel was one of the Israelite Prophets. He lived at the time of Nebuchadnezzar who destroyed Bayt al-Maqdis (the Temple in Jerusalem), killed many of the Children of Israel, and burned the Torah.\nDid Prophet Daniel foretell the coming of Prophet Muhammad?\nScholars said that Prophet Daniel foretold the coming of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nDaniel (peace be upon him) mentioned Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) by name, and said: \u201cArrows will be departing from bows and arrows will be stained with blood at your command, O Muhammad.\u201d\nThis is a clear, unambiguous statement.\nThen Shaykh al-Islam mentioned two cases in which Daniel foretold the coming of the Messiah and of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them both), then he said:\n\u201cThis is a prophecy in which Daniyal foretold the coming of the Messiah and the coming of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in which there is a detailed description of Muhammad and his ummah, which would take too long to quote here. The Muslims read it when they conquered Iraq, as was mentioned by the scholars, including Abu\u2019l-\u2018Aliyah.\u201d (Al-Jawab as-Sahih (5/275-281)\nDid \u2018Umar instruct the Companions to rebury Prophet Daniel?\nIt is well known that when the Muslims conquered Tastar, they came across the grave of Prophet Daniel (peace be upon him), and Amir al-Muminin \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) instructed the Companions to rebury him and conceal from the people the location of his grave, lest that be a cause of fitnah and confusion.\nIbn Abi\u2019d-Dunya narrated with a hasan isnad \u2013 as it says in al-Bidayah wa'an-Nihayah \u2013 from Abu\u2019z-Zinad that he said:\n\u201cI saw a ring on the hand of Abu Burdah ibn Abi Musa al-Ash\u2018ari, on the bezel of which there was an engraving of two lions, between whom was a man, and they were licking that man. Abu Burdah said: This is the ring of that dead man whom the people of this city claim is Daniel. Abu Musa took it on the day they reburied him. Abu Burdah said: Abu Musa asked the scholars of that city about the engraving on that ring, and they said: The astrologers and scholars came to the king under whose rule Daniel lived and told him: On such and such a night, a boy will be born who will undermine your sovereignty. The king said: By Allah, no boy will survive that night but I will kill him. But they took Daniel and threw him into the lions\u2019 den, where the lion and lioness licked him but did not harm him, then his mother came and found the lions licking him. Thus Allah saved him until he grew up and achieved what he achieved. Abu Burdah said: Abu Musa said: The scholars of that city said: Therefore Daniel engraved his image and the image of the two lions licking him on the bezel of his ring, lest he forget that blessing that Allah had bestowed upon him.\u201d\nIbn Abi Shaybah (7/4) narrated with a sahih isnad from Anas that when they conquered Tastar, they found a man whose nose was one cubit long in a coffin, and they used to pray for victory and for rain by virtue of him. Abu Musa wrote to \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab about that, and \u2018Umar wrote back, saying: This man is one of the prophets; fire does not consume (the bodies of) the prophets and the earth does not consume (the bodies of) the prophets. And he wrote instructions saying: You and your companions (meaning the companions of Abu Musa) should discuss the matter and rebury him in a place that no one knows except you two. He said: So Abu Musa and I went and reburied him.\nIbn Abi Shaybah (7/4) narrated with a sahih isnad from Mutarrif ibn Malik that he said: I was present at the conquest of Tastar with al-Ash\u2018ari. We came across (the body of) Daniel in as-Sus. When the people of as-Sus were faced with drought, they would bring him out and pray for rain by virtue of him. We found with him sixty sealed jars\u2026\nAl-Bayhaqi said in Dalail al-Nubuwwah (1/381):\n\u201cIt was narrated from Khalid ibn Dinar that Abu\u2019l-\u2018Aliyah said: When we conquered Tastar, we found in the treasury of al-Hormuzan a bier on which was the body of a dead man, and by his head was a scripture of his. We seized the scripture and took it to \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), and he summoned Ka\u2018b, who translated it into Arabic. I was the first man among the Arabs to read it, and I read it as I read this Quran.\nI said to Abu\u2019l-\u2018Aliyah: What was in it? He said: It was about you, your affairs, your religion, your talk, and what will happen after that. I said: What did you do with the man? He said: We dug thirteen different graves during the day, then at night we buried him and we levelled all the graves, so as to conceal its location from the people, so that they would not exhume him. I said: Why would people do that? He said: If rain was withheld from them, they would take his bier out and they would receive rain. I said: Who do you think the man was? He said: A man called Daniel. I said: How long ago do you think he died? He said: Three hundred years ago. I said: Had anything of him changed? He said: No, except a few hairs at the back of his head, for the earth does not consume (the bodies of) the prophets, and wild animals cannot devour them.\u201d\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cThis is a sahih isnad going back to Abu\u2019l-\u2018Aliyah, but if the date of this man\u2019s death was recorded as having been three hundred years earlier, then he cannot have been a prophet; rather he was a righteous man. That is because there was no prophet between \u2018Isa ibn Maryam and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), according to the text of the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari, and the period between them was four hundred years, or six hundred, or six hundred and twenty years. Or the date of his death may have been eight hundred years earlier, which is close to the time of Daniel, if this was the Daniel who once lived. Or he may have been some other man, either one of the prophets or one of the righteous. But it is most likely that he was Daniel, because Daniel was taken captive by the king of Persia, and remained with him as a prisoner, as we have seen above. It was narrated with a sahih isnad going back to Abu\u2019l-\u2018Aliyah that the length of his nose was a handspan, and it was narrated with a sahih isnad going back to Anas ibn Malik that the length of his nose was a cubit. Therefore it is possible that this was one of the earlier prophets, before the period mentioned above. And Allah knows best.\u201d (Al-Bidayah wa'an-Nihayah, 2/40)\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cWhen the grave of Daniel was discovered in Tastar, Abu Musa wrote to \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) about it, and \u2018Umar wrote back to him, saying: During the day, dig thirteen graves, and bury him by night in one of them, and conceal the location of his grave, lest his grave be a cause of fitnah and confusion for people.\u201d (Majmu\u2018 al-Fatawa, 15/154)\nReferences:\n\nSirat Ibn Ishaq (p. 66);\u00a0\nTarikh Baghdad (1/361);\u00a0\nTarikh Dimashq (8/32);\u00a0\nal-Masalik wa\u2019l-Mamalik (p. 92);\u00a0\nA\u2018lam an-Nubuwwah (p. 66);\u00a0\nAhsan at-Taqasim (p. 417);\u00a0\nal-Jawab as-Sahih (5/276);\u00a0\nHidayat al-Hayara (2/375);\u00a0\nal-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah (2/374);\u00a0\nSiyar A\u2018lam an-Nubala (2/312)\n\nFor more about prophets, please see this category: Belief in Messengers.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "What is narrated in the Sunnah about the invasion of India",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the first hadith, which is the hadith of \n    Thawbaan, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \n    Allah be upon him), it is a saheeh hadith.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated by an-Nasaa\u2019i in his Sunan (3175) and \n    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh an-Nasaa\u2019i. It was also \n    narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (37/81), and classed as hasan by the \n    commentators.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the second hadith, which is the hadith of Abu \n    Hurayrah, it is a da\u2018eef (weak) hadith.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated by an-Nasaa\u2019i (3173) and classed as da\u2018eef by \n    al-Albaani in Da\u2018eef an-Nasaa\u2019i. it was also narrated by Ahmad in his\n    Musnad (12/28 \u2013 ar-Risaalah edition), and classed as da\u2018eef by the \n    commentators. There are other isnaads for the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, all of \n    which are da\u2018eef, and there are other hadiths on this topic that are not \n    free of problems. What has been proven and established to be saheeh is the \n    hadith of Thawbaan.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    India was indeed invaded and taken over by the Muslims, and \n    they destroyed its idols, on several occasions. That began at the time of \n    al-Waleed ibn \u2018Abd al-Malik, under the leadership of al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad \n    ath-Thaqafi. It was also invaded and taken over at the time of the \n    \u2018Abbasids, under the leadership of the commander Mahmoud ibn \n    Sabuktigin \n    (may Allah have mercy on him). He took it upon himself to invade India once \n    every year. Shaykh Siddeeq Hasan Khan (d. 1307 AH \u2013 may Allah have mercy on \n    him) said: \n\n    With regard to India, it was conquered during the reign of \n    al-Waleed ibn \u2018Abd al-Malik, at the hands of Muhammad ibn Qaasim ath-Thaqafi \n    in 92 AH, and his banners reached from the borders of Sindh to Kannauj in 95 \n    AH. After he returned, the rulers of India returned to their places and the \n    rulers among the Marwanid and \u2018Abbasid caliphs remained in Sindh. \u2026 The \n    author of al-Mughni said: \u2026 At the end of the fourth century\u00a0 AH, \n    Sultan Mahmoud al-Ghaznawi set out to invade India, and he came several \n    times; he was victorious and he captured war booty, and he wrested Sindh \n    from the governors of the \u2018Abbasid caliph al-Qaadir Billah ibn al-Muqtadir. \n    But Sultan Mahmoud did not stay in India. His sons controlled a region \n    stretching from Ghazneen to Lahore until the Sultan Mu\u2018izz ad-Deen Saam al-Ghuri \n    took over Ghazneen, and came to Lahore and captured Khusrau Malik, who was \n    the last ruler the Ghaznawi dynasty. He seized control of India and made \n    Delhi the seat of government in 589 AH. From that date until the end of the \n    twelfth century, the kingdoms of India were in the hands of Muslim Sultans.\n    \n\n    Abjad al-\u2018Uloom \n    (1/344-345).\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the \n    events of the year 94 AH: In that year, al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad ath-Thaqafi \n    conquered India and captured booty that cannot be enumerated or described.\n    Al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah (9/113)\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the \n    events of 96 AH: In that year, Yameen ad-Dawlah \u2013 Mahmoud ibn \n    Sabuktigin \u2013 invaded India, conquering \n    major cities and seizing a large amount of booty. He took captive one of \n    their kings \u2013 namely the king of Karachi \u2013 who fled when he conquered it, \n    and he broke their idols.\n\n    Al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah \n    (11/358).\u00a0\n\n    He also (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the \n    events of 149 AH: in that year, Mahmoud ibn Sabuktigin invaded India, and \n    met the king of India in battle. There was a great deal of fighting among \n    the people, then the fighting ended with a great defeat for India, and the \n    Muslims killed many of them and captured a great deal of booty from them, \n    including gemstones, gold and silver. They also took from them two hundred \n    elephants and they tried to pursue those who fled the battlefield, and \n    destroyed many temples. Al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah (12/8)\u00a0\n\n    What happened of the invasion of India is one of the signs of \n    Prophethood, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    foretold its happening. This was knowledge of the unseen that Allah revealed \n    to him. Ustadh Muhammad \u2018Abd al-Wahhaab Buhayri (may Allah have mercy on \n    him) said: It should be noted: the hadith mentioned \u2013 i.e., the hadith of \n    Thawbaan \u2013 is one of the signs of Prophethood. The Muslims invaded India and \n    Sindh at the time of the Umayyads \u2013 then he mentioned some incidents that \n    occurred during the invasion and conquest of India. Buloogh al-Amaani min \n    Asraar al-Fath ar-Rabbaani (22/411)\u00a0\n\n    There is nothing to indicate that there will be another \n    invasion of India that will occur at the end of time, close to the onset of \n    the Hour or during the time of \u2018Eesaa (peace be upon him), as was suggested \n    by some scholars. Rather what appears to be the case is that what is \n    referred to in the hadith is what actually happened. The hadith of Thawbaan \n    does not mention the connection between the two groups; rather each group \n    has its own time, although both of them may share the same virtue.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "Why did Mu\u2018aawiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) appoint his son Yazeed as his successor to the caliphate?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\t\tFirstly:\u00a0\n\n\tThe noble Sahaabi Mu\u2018aawiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) \n\twas one of the scribes who wrote down the Revelation; he was well known for \n\tforbearance, knowledge and virtue, and his achievements and good \n\tcharacteristics were many. And it is not permissible to cast aspersions upon \n\thim at all. He was one of the leaders of the Muslims who ruled on the basis \n\tof justice as much as he could. With regard to what happened during his time \n\tof turmoil and internal conflict, we should refrain from discussing it and \n\tshould not talk about it on the basis of falsehood. We testify that all the \n\tCompanions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n\thim) were good and virtuous; whoever among them tried to work things out and \n\tgot it right will have a twofold reward, and whoever among them tried to \n\twork things out and got it wrong will have one reward.\u00a0\n\n\tPlease see the answer to question no. \n\t140984\u00a0\n\n\tSecondly:\u00a0\n\n\tWhen \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) died, and his son \n\tal-Hasan (may Allah be pleased with him) offered the funeral prayer for him, \n\tthe people swore allegiance to him as caliph, and they urged him to mobilise \n\tto fight the people of Syria. He had no intention of fighting anyone, but \n\tthey prevailed upon him and gathered a huge number of men, the like of which \n\thad never been seen before. He marched with the army, heading towards Syria, \n\tthen turmoil, differences of opinion and division arose in the army. When \n\tal-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali realised that the army was not all united behind him, he \n\tresented them and at that point he wrote to Mu\u2018aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan (may \n\tAllah be pleased with him), offering to come to terms for a peace deal \n\tbetween them. Mu\u2018aawiyah sent \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Aamir and \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn \n\tSamurah to him and a peace deal was concluded. Al-Hasan swore allegiance to \n\tMu\u2018aawiyah as caliph, and yielded the caliphate to him. That occurred in 40 \n\tAH, which was called the year of unity (\u2018aam al-jamaa\u2018ah) because the \n\tpeople united under Mu\u2018aawiyah in that year.\n\n\tThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n\thim) foretold this action and praised al-Hasan for it, namely giving up \n\tleadership and no longer seeking it, thus sparing the Muslims from bloodshed \n\tand seeking that which is with Allah. So al-Hasan gave up the caliphate and \n\tpassed the reins to Mu\u2018aawiyah in order to unite the Muslims behind one \n\truler.\u00a0\n\n\tAl-Bukhaari (2704) narrated that Abu Bakrah said: I saw the \n\tMessenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the minbar, \n\twith al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali beside him, and he turned to the people sometimes and \n\tturned to al-Hasan sometimes, and said: \u201cThis son of mine will be a leader, \n\tand perhaps Allah will bring about reconciliation through him between two \n\tgreat groups of Muslims.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\tWhen Mu\u2018aawiyah seized power and entered Kufah, he gave a \n\tspeech there and all the people throughout the regions were united behind \n\thim. al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali, along with his brother al-Husayn, the rest of their \n\tsiblings and their cousin \u2018Abdullah ibn Ja\u2018far, travelled from Iraq to al-Madinah \n\tal-Munawwarah \u2013 blessings and peace be upon the best of its inhabitants.\u00a0\n\n\tWhen Mu\u2018aawiyah was dying, he summoned Yazeed and gave his \n\tfinal instructions to him, and the people swore allegiance to Yazeed. Among \n\tthem were many of the Sahaabah, including Ibn \u2018Umar and Ibn \u2018Abbaas (may \n\tAllah be pleased with them). al-Husayn ibn \u2018Ali and \u2018Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr \n\t(may Allah be pleased with them) refused to swear allegiance to him.\u00a0\n\n\tSee: al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah (8/16-21 and 8/175).\u00a0\n\n\tIbn Battaal (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n\tAl-Hasan handed over the reins of power to Mu\u2018aawiyah, \n\treconciled with him and swore allegiance to him, pledging to listen and obey \n\tso long as he ruled according to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His \n\tProphet. Then they entered Kufah and Mu\u2018aawiyah received the oath of \n\tallegiance from the people of Iraq. That was the year of unity, when the \n\tpeople united and came to an agreement, and war ceased. All the Sahaabah who \n\thad stayed away from civil war swore allegiance to Mu\u2018aawiyah. Sa\u2018d ibn Abi \n\tWaqqaas, \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar and Muhammad ibn Muslimah swore allegiance to \n\thim, and the people were very happy about that. Mu\u2018aawiyah bestowed upon al-Hasan \n\tibn \u2018Ali three hundred thousand dinars, a thousand garments, thirty slaves \n\tand one hundred camels, and al-Hasan ibn Ali left for Madinah. Mu\u2018aawiyah \n\tappointed al-Mugheerah ibn Shu\u2018bah as governor of Kufah, and he appointed \n\t\u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Aamir as governor of Basrah, and he left for Damascus, which \n\the took as the capital of his kingdom.\u00a0\n\n\tEnd quote from Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari (8/97)\u00a0\n\n\tThirdly:\u00a0\n\n\tThe scholars stated that al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali stipulated that \n\tMu\u2018aawiyah should not appoint anyone as his successor; rather the matter was \n\tto be decided by consultation among the Muslims.\u00a0\n\n\tIbn Hajar al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n\tWhen they reconciled, al-Hasan wrote it in a document to \n\tMu\u2018aawiyah, as follows:\u00a0\n\n\tIn the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. \n\tThis is what has been agreed upon by al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased \n\twith him) and Mu\u2018aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan. He has made a peace deal with him \n\ton the basis that al-Hasan will hand to him the reins of power to rule the \n\tMuslims, provided that he rule according to the Book of Allah, may He be \n\texalted, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah \n\tbe upon him) and the way of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs. Mu\u2018aawiyah ibn Abi \n\tSufyaan has no right to appoint anyone to succeed him; rather the matter is \n\tto be decided by the Muslims on the basis of consultation and shoora. [This \n\tagreement is also] provided that the people should be safe wherever they may \n\tbe on Allah\u2019s earth, whether they be in Syria, Iraq, the Hijaz or Yemen; and \n\tprovided that the companions and party of \u2018Ali should be safe, and their \n\tlives, property, womenfolk and children should be safe wherever they may be. \n\tMu\u2018aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan gives his solemn promise and oath before Allah to \n\tthat effect, and that he intends no ill towards al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali or towards \n\this brother al-Husayn, or any of the members of the family of the Messenger \n\tof Allah, either secretly or openly, and he will never disturb any of them, \n\tno matter where they may be.\u00a0\n\n\tThis was witnessed by So-and-so, and by So-and-so the son of \n\tSo-and-so, and sufficient is Allah as witness.\u00a0\n\n\tWhen the peace deal was done, Mu\u2018aawiyah requested al-Hasan \n\tto speak before a gathering of people and tell them that he had sworn \n\tallegiance to Mu\u2018aawiyah and handed over the reins of power to him, and he \n\tagreed to do that.\u00a0\n\n\tEnd quote from as-Sawaa\u2019iq al-Muhriqah \u2018ala Ahl ar-Rafd \n\twa\u2019d-Dalaal wa\u2019z-Zandaqah (2/399)\u00a0\n\n\tSee also the book al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali (may Allah be \n\tpleased with him) by Dr as-Sallaabi (p. 253) [This book is available in \n\tEnglish under the title Al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali ibn Abi T\u00e2lib: His Life and \n\tTimes].\u00a0\n\n\tFourthly:\u00a0\n\n\tWhen Mu\u2018aawiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) saw the \n\textent of the dissent, division and turmoil among the people, and the extent \n\tto which they were prone to internal conflict, he feared that their division \n\tmight become worse after he died, and that dissent and turmoil would \n\tincrease. So he decided that the best solution was to take allegiance for \n\this son after him. He consulted the senior Sahaabah, the leaders of the \n\tpeople and the governors of the regions, and they all give their consent to \n\tthat. Delegations came agreeing to swear allegiance to Yazeed, and many of \n\tthe Sahaabah also swore allegiance to him, to the extent that al-Haafiz \u2018Abd \n\tal-Ghani al-Maqdisi said: His caliphate was valid; sixty of the companions \n\tof the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n\tincluding Ibn \u2018Umar, swore allegiance to him. It is proven in Saheeh al-Bukhaari \n\t(7111) that Ibn \u2018Umar swore allegiance to Yazeed. It was narrated that Naafi\u2018 \n\tsaid: When the people of Madinah announced that they no longer accepted \n\tYazeed ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah as caliph, Ibn \u2018Umar gathered his close friends and \n\tchildren and said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n\thim) say: \u201cA banner will be set up for every betrayer on the Day of \n\tResurrection.\u201d We swore allegiance to this man in accordance with the \n\tconditions enjoined by Allah and His Messenger, and I do not know of any \n\tbetrayal greater than that of one who swears allegiance to a man according \n\tto the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Messenger, then begins to fight \n\thim. If I ever learn that any of you withdrew his allegiance or gave \n\tallegiance to someone else, then that will mark the end of the relationship \n\tbetween me and him.\u00a0\n\n\tPerhaps the reason why Mu\u2018aawiyah told the people to swear \n\tallegiance to Yazeed was that he thought that this would prevent division \n\tand would unite the people at that critical stage through which the ummah \n\twas going, as he was aware that many people were claiming the right to be \n\tthe caliph. So he (may Allah be pleased with him) thought that appointing \n\tYazeed as caliph was in the best interests of the ummah and was a precaution \n\tthat would prevent turmoil, if the decision-makers agreed on him.\u00a0\n\n\tSee: al-Mufassal fi\u2019r-Radd \u2018ala Shubahaat A\u2018da\u2019 al-Islam \n\t(13/228)\u00a0\n\n\tIbn Khaldoon (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n\tWhat prompted Mu\u2018aawiyah to give precedence to his son Yazeed \n\tand appoint him as caliph, rather than anyone else, was the belief that this \n\twould serve the interests of the Muslims by uniting them and bringing them \n\ttogether behind one man, with the approval of the decision-makers at that \n\ttime, who were from Banu Umayyah, because at that time Banu Umayyah would \n\tnot accept anyone (as caliph) except one of their own number. They were the \n\tstrongest clan of Quraysh and the ones who had the greatest influence. So \n\tMu\u2018aawiyah preferred Yazeed, over others who may have been thought more \n\tqualified than him, for that reason, and he overlooked others who were more \n\tvirtuous in favour of one who was less virtuous, because he was keen to keep \n\tthe Muslims united behind one leader, which is a matter of great importance \n\tin Islamic teachings. It is not possible to think of any other motive for \n\tMu\u2018aawiyah than that, because his good character and the fact that he was a \n\tSahaabi would rule out any other motive.\u00a0\n\n\tThe fact that some of the senior Sahaabah were present and \n\tkept quiet indicates that there was nothing suspicious in what Mu\u2018aawiyah \n\tdid, because such people would not be deterred from speaking out against \n\tsomething wrong, and Mu\u2018aawiyah was not one of those who would be too \n\tarrogant to accept the word of truth. All of them were too noble to do that, \n\tand their good character would rule it out.\u00a0\n\n\tEnd quote from Muqaddimat Ibn Khaldoon (p. 109)\u00a0\n\n\tHe also said:\u00a0\n\n\tMu\u2018aawiyah issued instructions for Yazeed to become caliph \n\tfor fear of the Muslims becoming divided.\u00a0\n\n\tEnd quote from Muqaddimat Ibn Khaldoon (p. 106)\u00a0\n\n\tMuhibb ad-Deen al-Khateeb (may Allah have mercy on him) said \n\tin his commentary on al-\u2018Awaasim min al-Qawaasim (p. 229):\u00a0\n\n\tMu\u2018aawiyah did not choose the best option because he was \n\tafraid of turmoil and bloodshed if he left the matter to shoora (mutual \n\tconsultation). He thought that strength, obedience, order and stability \n\twould be on the side of those who supported his son (i.e., they had more \n\tpower and would be more able to maintain order). End quote.\u00a0\n\n\tIn conclusion, Mu\u2018aawiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) did \n\twhat he thought best served the interests of the ummah at a time of \n\tdivision, when there was turmoil in its ranks, and he thought that keeping \n\tthe Muslims united and warding off turmoil was more important than \n\tfulfilling the condition stipulated by al-Hasan (may Allah be pleased with \n\thim), when he gave up his claim to the caliphate and swore allegiance to \n\thim. Sharee\u2018ah seeks to attain and perfect that which serves the people\u2019s \n\tbest interests and to ward off and reduce that which causes harm.\u00a0\n\n\tMoreover, the most that can be said concerning this matter is \n\tthat Mu\u2018aawiyah (may Allah be pleased with him), who was the caliph of the \n\tMuslims, tried to work out what was the best option concerning this issue. \n\tHe would have two rewards if he got it right, and he would have one reward \n\tif he got it wrong, in sha Allah. What happened in this case or others of \n\timperfection or shortcomings on his part may well be overlooked and forgiven \n\tby the Most Gracious, Most Merciful, and the Companions of the Prophet \n\t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are more deserving of being \n\texcused and pardoned by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\u00a0\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Dhuth-Thudayyah\u2019s full name was Hurqoos ibn Zuhayr al-Bajali. He was one \n      of the Khawaarij (Khaarijites) who rebelled against Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen \n      \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), spread mischief in the land and shed \n      blood that it was forbidden to shed. \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) \n      fought them at the battle of an-Nahrawand and killed them; none of them \n      escaped except a few.\u00a0\nThe \n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) urged the \n    believers to fight them. The first of them was Dhu\u2019l-Khuwaysirah at-Tameemi, \n    who told the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): \n    Be fair! And Dhu\u2019th-Thudayyah was the last of them. \n\u00a0He was a \n    very dark black man, who had a foul odour and a deformed arm; there was only \n    an upper arm, with no forearm, and at the end of his upper arm there was \n    something like a nipple on which there were some white hairs.\u00a0\nThey (the \n    Khawaarij) are the ones concerning whom the Messenger of Allah (blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cAmong the progeny of this man will be people who will recite \n    the Qur\u2019an, but it will not go any further than their throats. They will \n    pass through Islam as an arrow passes through the prey. They will kill the \n    people of Islam and leave the idol-worshippers alone. If I live to see them, \n    then I will certainly kill them like \u2018Aad (i.e., as \u2018Aad were destroyed).\u201d.\u00a0\n\n    Dhu\u2019th-Thudayyah was the sign of these people; he was the sign of fitnah \n    (turmoil) and a symbol of mischief and evil.\u00a0\nWhen \u2018Ali \n    (may Allah be pleased with him) and the believers who were with him fought \n    them, he asked them to look for this man among the slain, and they found \n    him. \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and those who were with him \n    rejoiced greatly at that, and \u2018Ali prostrated to Allah in gratitude.\u00a0\nal-Bukhaari \n    (3610) and Muslim (1064) narrated that Abu Sa\u2019eed al-Khudri (may Allah be \n    pleased with him) said: Whilst we were with the Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he was sharing out some \n    wealth, Dhu\u2019l-Khuwaysirah, a man from Banu Tameem, came to him and said: O \n    Messenger of Allah, be fair! The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \n    Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWoe to you! Who will be fair if I am not fair? You \n    will be doomed and lost if I am not fair.\u201d \u2018Umar said: O Messenger of Allah, \n    give me permission to strike his neck. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cLet him be, for he has companions, in \n    comparison to whose prayer one of you would regard his prayer as \n    insignificant, and he would regard his fasting as insignificant in \n    comparison to their fasting. They recite the Qur\u2019an but it does not go any \n    further than their collarbones. They will pass out of the faith as an arrow \n    passes out of the prey. Their sign will be a black man, one of whose upper \n    arms will be like a woman\u2019s breast, or like a piece of quivering flesh. They \n    will emerge when there is division among the people.\u201d\u00a0\nAbu Sa\u2019eed \n    said: I bear witness that I heard this hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and I bear witness that \u2018Ali ibn \n    Abi Taalib fought them when I was with him. He ordered that that man be \n    sought, and he was found and brought; I looked at him and saw that he was \n    just as the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    had described him.\u00a0\nAccording to \n    another report narrated by them (al-Bukhaari and Muslim): \n    \u201cAmong the progeny of this man will be \n    people who will recite the Qur\u2019an, but it will not go any further than their \n    throats. They will pass through Islam as an arrow passes \n    through the prey. They will kill the people of Islam and \n    leave the idol-worshippers alone. If I live to see them, then I will \n    certainly kill them like \u2018Aad (i.e., as \u2018Aad were destroyed).\u201d\u00a0\nIt was \n    narrated that Naafi\u2018 ibn Maslamah al-Akhnasi said: Dhu\u2019th-Thudayyah was a\n    man \n    from (the clan of) \u2018Arnah from (the tribe of) Bajeelah. He was a very dark \n    black man who had a foul odour. He was well-known among the troops, and \n    before that he used to accompany us.\u00a0\nAl-Bidaayah \n    wa\u2019n-Nihaayah, 7/289\u00a0\nIbn al-Atheer \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Dhu\u2019th-Thudayyah \u2013 thudayyah \n    is the diminutive of thadiy (breast nipple) And may be taken as meaning a \n    piece of a breast.\u00a0\nAn-Nihaayah, \n    1/592\u00a0\nMuslim \n    (1066) narrated from \u2018Ubaydah as-Salmaani, from \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased \n    with him) that he mentioned the Khawaarij and said: and said: Among them is \n    a man with a defective arm, or a small arm. I would tell you what Allah \n    promised on the lips of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    to those who kill them. I said: Did you hear that from Muhammad (blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him)? He said: Yes, by the Lord of the Ka\u2018bah; \n    yes, by the Lord of the Ka\u2018bah; yes, by the Lord of the Ka\u2018bah.\nMuslim \n    (1066) and Abu Dawood (4768) narrated that Salamah ibn Kuhayl said: Zayd ibn \n    Wahb al-Juhani told me that he was\u00a0\nHe was in \n    the army that was with \u2018Ali and went out to fight the Khawaarij. \u2018Ali said: \n    O people, I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him) say: \u201cThere will appear some people among my ummah who will recite \n    the Qur\u2019an and your recitation will not compare to theirs, and your prayer \n    will not compare to theirs, and your fasting will not compare to theirs. \n    They will recite the Qur\u2019an and you will think that it is to their credit \n    but in fact it will count against them. Their prayer will not go any deeper \n    than their collar bones and they will pass out of Islam as an arrow passes \n    out of the prey. If the army that attacks them knew what has been decreed \n    for them on the lips of their Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him), they would have relied on their deeds. The sign of that is that among \n    them there is a man who has an upper arm but no forearm, and on his upper \n    arm there is something like a nipple with white hairs on it. Would you go to \n    Mu\u2019aawiyah and the people of Syria, and leave these people in charge of your \n    families and wealth in your absence?\u00a0 By Allah, I hope that they are the \n    same people, for they have shed blood unlawfully and attacked the people\u2019s \n    cattle. March in the name of Allah.\u00a0\nSalamah ibn \n    Kuhayl said: Zayd ibn Wahb described to me the stops (made by the army) \n    until he said: then we crossed a bridge, and when we met (the Khawaarij), \n    who were being led that day by \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Wahb al-Raasibi, he (\u2018Abd-Allah) \n    said to (his men): Throw your spears and draw your swords from their \n    sheaths, for I am afraid that they may urge you to negotiate as they did on \n    the day of Haroora\u2019. So they threw their spears and unsheathed their swords, \n    and (the companions of \u2018Ali) fought back with their spears, and they (the \n    Khawaarij) were killed and piled up one on top of another, but only two of \n    the people (i.e., the companions of \u2018Ali) were killed that day. \u2018Ali said: \n    Search among them for the one with the deformed hand. But they did not find \n    him. Then \u2018Ali himself went to some people who had been killed and were \n    lying on top of one another. They took them out and found him among those \n    who were closest to the ground (at the bottom of the pile). He said takbeer \n    and said: Allah spoke the truth and His Messenger conveyed it. \u2018Ubaydah al-Salmaani \n    stood up and said: O Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen, by Allah besides Whom there is no \n    other god, did you hear this from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him)? He said: Yes, by Allah besides Whom there is no \n    other god \u2013 until he asked him to swear three times and he did so.\u00a0\nThen Abu \n    Dawood narrated that Abu\u2019l-Wadee\u2019 said: It is as if I can see him, an \n    Abyssinian wearing a shirt, one of his hands like a woman\u2019s nipple with \n    hairs on it like the hairs on the tail of a jerboa.\u00a0\nClassed as \n    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\nAhmad (850) \n    narrated that Taariq ibn Ziyaad said: We went out with \u2018Ali to fight the \n    Khawaarij, and he killed them then he said: Look, for the Prophet of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said that there would emerge \n    people who would speak of the truth but it would not go past their throats; \n    they will pass out of the truth as the arrow passes out of the prey. The \n    sign is that one of them will be a black man with a deformed arm, with some \n    black hairs on his arm. If it is him, then you have killed the worst of \n    people, and if it is not him, then you have killed the best of people. And \n    we wept, then he said: Look. So we looked and we found the deformed man, and \n    we fell down in prostration and \u2018Ali fell down in prostration with us.\u00a0\nThis hadeeth \n    has several isnaads; see al-Irwa\u2019, 2/231\u00a0\nAl-Haafiz \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIt was \n    narrated that Abu Maryam said: Indeed that deformed man was with us in the \n    mosque, and he was a poor man. I gave him a burnous of mine to wear and I \n    saw him attending meals with \u2018Ali. He had on his arm something like the \n    breast of a woman, with a nipple on its end like the nipple of a breast, \n    with something on it like the whiskers of a cat. Both reports were narrated \n    by Abu Dawood.\u00a0\nAt-Tabari \n    narrated it at length via Abu Maryam. In it, it says: Before that, \u2018Ali used \n    to tell us that some people would appear and the sign would be a man with a \n    deformed arm. I heard that from him many times until I saw him \u2013 meaning the \n    deformed man \u2013 not wanting to eat with \u2018Ali because he often heard that from \n    him. And in it, it says: Then he instructed his companions to look for the \n    deformed man, so they looked for him but they could not find him until a man \n    came and told him: We have found him beneath two slain men in a ditch.\u00a0\nAccording to \n    the report of Aflah: \u2018Ali said: Which of you recognises this man? One of the \n    people said: We recognise him; this is Hurqoos.\u00a0\nAccording to \n    the report of \u2018Aasim ibn Shamkh, Abu Sa\u2018eed said: Ten of the Companions of \n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told me that \u2018Ali \n    said: Look for the sign that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \n    Allah be upon him) spoke of, for I have never told lies and I will never \n    tell lies. He (that man) was brought, and \u2018Ali praised and thanked Allah \n    when he recognised the sign. In the report of Abu Bakr, the freed slave of \n    the Ansaar, from \u2018Ali, there were seven nipples around it. In that report it \n    states that the people were upset after the killing of the people of the \n    river, but \u2018Ali said: I do not think but he was one of them. They found him \n    on the bank of the river, beneath the slain. \u2018Ali said: Allah and His \n    Messenger spoke the truth. The people rejoiced when they saw his body, and \n    what they had been feeling disappeared.\u00a0\nEnd quote \n    from Fath al-Baari, 12/298\u00a0\nFor more \n    information on the sect of the Khawaarij (Kharijites), please see the answer \n    to question no. 182237.\u00a0\nAnd Allah \n    knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    What is required is to think positively of those whom Allah chose to \n    accompany His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): for they \n    are the best companions of the best Prophet, and it is not permissible to \n    say anything of them but the highest words of praise; if anyone criticises \n    them, then this gives rise to suspicion about the sincerity of his religious \n    commitment.\u00a0\n\n    Abu Zar\u2018ah ar-Raazi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If you see a man \n    criticising any of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him), then know that he is a heretic. That is because \n    in our view, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) is true, and the Qur\u2019an is true. No one transmitted this Qur\u2019an and the \n    Sunnah to us except the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him). They only seek to undermine our witnesses (to \n    the authenticity of the texts) in order to declare the Qur\u2019an and Sunnah \n    false, but these people are more deserving of criticism, for they are \n    heretics.\n\n    End quote from al-Kifaayah fi \u2018Ilm ar-Riwaayah by al-Khateeb \n    al-Baghdadi (p. 49).\u00a0\n\n    See also the answer to question no. \n    187689\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    The Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    fought one another ,and each party had a reason to fight, which was based on \n    their own understanding of the texts and on their own ijtihaad, whereby each \n    party believed it was in the right. Hence when it became clear to some of \n    them that they were mistaken, they regretted going out and fighting, and \n    regret is repentance, and repentance erases what comes before it, especially \n    in the case of the noblest of mankind, and the highest in status and most \n    respected of them after the Prophets and Messengers of Allah.\u00a0\n\n    Whoever examines this matter properly will realise that this fighting was \n    caused by those who sought to spread discord by spreading rumours and false \n    ideas. \u00a0\n\n    Many of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) went out during this \n    fighting seeking to reconcile between the people. Fighting was the most \n    hateful thing to them, but the decree of Allah inevitably came to pass.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    Al-Bukhaari (447) narrated from Abu Sa \u2018eed al-Khudri, in the report about \n    the building of the mosque (in Madinah), that he said: We would carry one \n    brick at a time, but\u00a0 \u2018Ammaar would carry two bricks at a time. The Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw him and brushed the dust from \n    him, saying: \u201cWoe to \u2018Ammaar; he will be killed by the transgressing group; \n    he will be calling them to Paradise and they will be calling him to Hell\u201d. \n    \u2018Ammaar said: I seek refuge with Allah from tribulation.\u00a0\n\n    What is meant by calling to Paradise in this hadith is calling to the means \n    of attaining it, which is obedience to the caliph (Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen), and \n    what is meant by calling to Hell is calling to that which leads to it, which \n    is opposing the caliph and rebelling against him.\u00a0\n\n    But whoever did that on the basis of ijtihaad and valid interpretation is \n    excused.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    This hadith is one of the signs of Prophethood, as the Prophet (blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him) foretold to \u2018Ammaar that he would be killed \n    by the transgressing group, and he was killed by the people of ash-Shaam \n    (greater Syria) in the battle of Siffeen, when \u2018Ammaar was with \u2018Ali\u00a0 and \n    the people of Iraq, as will be explained in detail below. \u2018Ali had more \n    right to rulership than Mu\u2018aawiyah did.\u00a0\n\n    The fact that the companions of Mu\u2018aawiyah are described as transgressors \n    does not imply that they were disbelievers, as the ignorant followers of the \n    misguided sects, such as the Shi\u2018ah\u00a0 and others, try to claim. That is \n    because their decision to fight was based on their own ijtihaad and \n    interpretation of the texts, and not everyone who engages in ijtihaad gets \n    its right; rather the one who gets it right will have a twofold reward and \n    the one who gets it wrong will have a single reward.\u00a0\n\n    Those who added to this hadith after the phrase \u201cyou will be killed by the \n    transgressing group\u201d the words \u201cAllah will not grant them my intercession on \n    the Day of Resurrection\u201d fabricated this additional material, falsely \n    attributing it to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him), for he did not say it, as it was not narrated via any acceptable \n    chain of narration. And Allah knows best.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the words \u201che will be calling them to Paradise and they will \n    be calling him to Hell\u201d, \u2018Ammaar and his companions were calling the people \n    of greater Syria to reconciliation and unity, whereas the people of greater \n    Syria wanted to seize power from one who was more entitled to it, and they \n    wanted the people to be divided, with each part of the Muslim lands having \n    its own ruler, which would lead to disunity and division of the ummah, for \n    this was the implication of their view and the consequences to which it \n    would lead, even if they did not intend that. And Allah knows best.\n\n    End quote from al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah (4/538)\u00a0\n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIf \n    it is said: \u201cHe was killed at Siffeen, when he was with \u2018Ali, and those who \n    killed him were with Mu\u2018aawiyah, with whom were some of the Sahaabah, so how \n    can it be said that they were calling to Hell?\u201d \n\n    The answer to that is that they thought that they were calling to Paradise, \n    and their action was based on ijtihaad, so there is no blame on them for \n    following what they thought was best. What is meant by calling people to \n    Paradise is calling them to that which leads to it, which is obeying the \n    ruler. This was the stance of \u2018Ammaar, who was calling them to obey \u2018Ali, \n    who was the ruler whom it was obligatory to obey at that time, whereas they \n    (Mu\u2018aawiyah and his followers) were calling people to something other than \n    that, but they are excused for the wrong conclusion they reached, which was \n    based on misinterpretation of the texts.\u00a0\n\n    End quote from Fath al-Baari (1/542). See also: Majmoo\u2018 Fataawa \n    Shaykh al-Islam (4/437)\u00a0\nSo \n    it is essential to differentiate between the one who tries to work it out \n    but reaches a wrong conclusion, and the one who deliberately causes mischief \n    and turmoil.\u00a0\n\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cAnd if two \n    parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace \n    between them both, but if one of them rebels against the other, then fight \n    you (all) against the one that which rebels till it complies with the \n    Command of Allah; then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them \n    justly, and be equitable. Verily! Allah loves those who are equitable.\n\n    The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic \n    religion). So make reconciliation between your brothers, and fear Allah, \n    that you may receive mercy\u201d\n\n    [al-Hujuraat 49:9-10].\u00a0\n\n    This indicates that it is possible for fighting to occur among the \n    believers, without that meaning that one of the groups is regarded as no \n    longer being believers because of their fighting the other group. Then \n    Allah, may He be exalted, says: \u201cThe \n    believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic religion). So make \n    reconciliation between your brothers\u201d \n    [al-Hujuraat 49:9-10].\u00a0\nSo \n    Allah described them as being brothers, despite their fighting, and He \n    commanded the Muslims to reconcile between them.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, explains that despite their fighting \n    and transgression against one another, they are still believers and \n    brothers, and He enjoined reconciling between them. But if one of them \n    transgresses after that, then the transgressing group is to be fought, but \n    He did not enjoin fighting from the outset.\u00a0\n\n    The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that the \n    groups that would pass out of the faith [the Khawaarij or Khaarijis] would \n    be killed by the closer of the two groups to the truth, and \u2018Ali ibn Abi \n    Taalib and those who were with him were the ones who fought \n    them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n    The words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicate \n    that they were closer to the truth than Mu\u2018aawiyah and those who were with \n    him, although both groups were believers.\n\n    End quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (25/305-306)\u00a0\nIt \n    was narrated that Abu Sa\u2018eed al-Khudri said: The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cA group will secede from \n    my ummah at a time of division among the Muslims, and they will be killed by \n    the group that is closer to the truth.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by Muslim (1064).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n    This saheeh hadeeth indicates that both of the groups who engaged in \n    fighting \u2013 \u2018Ali and his companions, and Mu\u2018aawiyah and his companions \u2013 were \n    following the truth, and that \u2018Ali and his companions were closer to the \n    truth than Mu\u2018aawiyah and his companions.\n\n    End quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (4/467).

        "question": "Oath of allegiance (bay\u2018ah) of \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with them both)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe swearing of allegiance (bay\u2018ah) by \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) [to Abu Bakr] is proven in as-Saheehayn (al-Bukhaari and Muslim), even though it happened a few months late.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that her father Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) entered upon \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) after he requested a meeting with him:\n\u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib recited the Tashahhud, then he said: O Abu Bakr, we acknowledge your virtue and what Allah has given you. We do not envy you for any favour that Allah has bestowed upon you, but you did it without consulting us and we thought that we had the right (to be consulted) because of our kinship with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He kept speaking to Abu Bakr until Abu Bakr\u2019s eyes filled with tears. When Abu Bakr spoke, he said: By the One in Whose hand is my soul, kinship with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is dearer to me than kinship with my own people. As for this dispute that occurred between me and you concerning these properties, I have not deviated from the right path with regard to them, and I have not given up something that I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do with them, rather I have done it too.\n\u2018Ali said to Abu Bakr: Your appointment for my oath of allegiance is this afternoon. When Abu Bakr had prayed Zuhr, he ascended the minbar and recited the tashahhud, and he spoke of \u2018Ali and his delay in swearing allegiance, and the excuse that he had given, then he prayed for his forgiveness. And \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib recited the tashahhud and spoke highly of Abu Bakr, and said that what he had done was not due to jealousy of Abu Bakr, or a refusal to accept the favour that Allah had bestowed upon him, but we thought that we should have had a share in the matter, but it had been decided without consulting us, and we were upset with that. The Muslims were pleased with this and said: You have done the right thing. Then the Muslims became closer to \u2018Ali, when he did the right thing.\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (3998) and Muslim (1759).\u00a0\nAccording to another version narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh:\nThen \u2018Ali stood up and spoke highly of Abu Bakr, and he mentioned his virtue and the fact that he had been one of the first to enter Islam. Then he went to Abu Bakr and swore allegiance to him, and the people came to \u2018Ali and said: You have done the right thing, you have done well. And the people became close to \u2018Ali when he did the right thing.\u00a0\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nWith regard to \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) delaying swearing of allegiance (to Abu Bakr), \u2018Ali mentioned it in this hadith and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) apologised to him.\u00a0\u00a0\nMoreover, this delay on \u2018Ali\u2019s part did not undermine the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr and it did not undermine \u2018Ali himself.\u00a0\nWith regard to swearing allegiance, the scholars are unanimously agreed that for an oath of allegiance to be valid, it is not essential that all the people, or even all the decision-makers and prominent people, should swear allegiance. Rather there should be a group of scholars, leaders and prominent figures who do so.\u00a0\nWith regard to it not undermining \u2018Ali or his character, that is because it was not essential for everyone to come to the leader, put his hand in his and swear allegiance to him; rather once the decision-makers and prominent figures have sworn allegiance to the leader, the individual is required to accept his leadership, not show dissent and not rebel against him.\u00a0\nThat was the case with \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) during that period, before he swore allegiance, because he did not show dissent towards Abu Bakr or rebel against him. But he was held back from coming to him for the reason mentioned in the hadith. In order for swearing allegiance to be valid and proper, that did not depend on him being present, and neither he nor anyone else was required to attend for that purpose. As it was not required, he did not come.\u00a0\nNothing has been narrated from him to suggest that he thought that the oath of allegiance was not valid, and he never expressed any objection (to Abu Bakr being appointed caliph). However he did have some misgivings in his mind, hence his coming was delayed until that matter had been dealt with.\u00a0\nThe reason for his misgivings was that, because of his high status and the fact that he himself was a person of virtue in all aspects, and was closely related to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and so on, he thought that no decision should be made without him being consulted and being present. But the excuse given by Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar and the rest of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them all) was quite clear: it was because they thought that hastening to swear allegiance was in the greater interest of the Muslims, and they were afraid that if they delayed it, that could lead to problems and disputes that would in turn lead to serious negative consequences. Therefore they delayed burying the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) until they had sworn allegiance, because that was the most important matter, so as to ensure that no dispute would arise concerning his burial, shrouding, ghusl, funeral prayer and so on, without having anyone who could have the final say on such matters. Hence they thought that giving precedence to swearing allegiance was the most important issue at that time. End quote.\u00a0\nSharh Muslim (12/77-78)\u00a0\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIt was as if they excused him for not coming to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr whilst Faatimah was still alive, because he was preoccupied with caring for her during her illness, and consoling her for the grief she felt at the loss of her father (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Moreover, when she got upset with Abu Bakr\u2019s response when she asked him about inheritance, \u2018Ali decided to go along with her in keeping away from him.\nEnd quite. Fath al-Baari (7/494)\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThere is also a report which says that \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) swore allegiance to Abu Bakr at the very beginning, and he did not delay doing so, but there is some doubt as to whether the report which mentions that can be confirmed.\nThe hadith was narrated via Wuhayb ibn Khaalid, from Dawood ibn Abi Hind, from Abu Nadrah, from Abu Sa\u2018eed.\u00a0\nThe hadith was taken from Wuhayb ibn Khaalid by four of his companions, three of whom narrated a brief version which does not mention \u2018Ali and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) at the beginning of his caliphate. These three are:\u00a0\n1.\u2018Affaan ibn Muslim\nas we shall see the report narrated from him, and we will explain that anyone who narrated from \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim concerning the issue of the oath of allegiance ( bay\u2018ah) was mistaken\u00a0\n2.Abu Dawood at-Tayaalisi in al-Musnad (1/495, no. 603)\nAnd it was narrated via him by Ibn \u2018Asaakir in Tareekh Dimashq (19/314)\u00a0\n3.Zuhayr ibn Ishaaq\nwho is a da\u2018eef narrator, as it says in Mizaan al-I\u2018tidaal (2/82). He narrated it via Ibn \u2018Adiyy in al-Kaamil (3/223) and said: I do not know that anyone narrated it from Dawood apart from Zuhayr ibn Ishaaq and Wuhayb. Zuhayr has some strong hadiths, and the one who narrated the most from him among the Basris was Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr al-Maqdimi. I hope that there is nothing wrong with him. Ibn Ma\u2018een only objected to him for an interrupted hadith, as I have mentioned. As for his hadiths that have isnaads, most of them are sound. End quote.\u00a0\nAs for the fourth narrator from Wuhayb ibn Khaalid, he narrated a lengthy version which mentions \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them all).\nThis narrator was al-Mugheerah ibn Salamah Abu Hishaam al-Makhzoomi, who was trustworthy, as it says in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (10/261). Imam al-Bayhaqi narrated it from him in as-Sunan al-Kubra (8/143) and said:\u00a0\nAbu\u2019l-Hasan \u2018Ali ibn Muhammad ibn \u2018Ali al-Haafiz al-Isfaraa\u2019eeni said:\u00a0 Abu \u2018Ali al-Husayn ibn \u2018Ali al-Haafiz told us: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ishaaq ibn Khuzaymah and Ibraaheem ibn Abi Taalib informed us: Bandaar ibn Bashaar told us: Abu Hishaam al-Makhzoomi told us: Wuhayb told us: and he mentioned a similar report.\u00a0\nAbu \u2018Ali al-Haafiz said: I heard Muhammad ibn Ishaaq ibn Khuzaymah say:\u00a0\nMuslim ibn al-Hajjaaj came to me and asked me about this hadith, and I wrote it for him in a document, and read it to him, and he said: This hadith is worth a camel. I said: Worth a camel? It is worth a pearl the size of the full moon! End quote.\u00a0\nThe words \u201cand he mentioned a similar report\u201d refer to the report which mentions the oath of allegiance, as was clearly stated in the report of Ibn \u2018Asaakir in Tareekh Dimashq (30/277), via Imam al-Bayhaqi himself.\u00a0\nImam adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after quoting the report which mentions the oath of allegiance:\nAlthough its isnaad is good, it contains some objectionable matters, so think about it. End quote.\u00a0\nAl-Muhadhdhab (6/3239)\u00a0\nWith regard to the difference of opinion concerning \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim, there follow some details concerning this matter:\u00a0\nThe difference of opinion concerning \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim was due to two reasons:\u00a0\n-1-\nthe first reason was that it was narrated by senior imams who had learned the brief version of the report from \u2018Affaan, in which there is no mention of \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them all). The wording of this report is as follows:\u00a0\nWhen the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, the spokesmen of the Ansaar stood up and some of them said: O Muhaajireen, when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent a man from among you, he would pair him with a man from among us, so we think that two men should take charge of this matter, one man from among you and one man from among us.\u00a0\nZayd ibn Thaabit stood up and said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was one of the Muhaajireen, and we were the helpers of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). So the leader should only be from among the Muhaajireen, and we will be his helpers as we were the helpers of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)).\u00a0\nAbu Bakr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: May Allah reward you with good, O Ansaar, and may He keep your spokesman steadfast. By Allah, if you had said something other than this, we would not have accepted it from you.\u00a0\nNarrated from him by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (7/430)\u00a0\nAnd by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (35/489) \u2013 Mu\u2019sasat ar-Risaalah edn.\u00a0\nAnd by Ibn Sa \u2018d in at-Tabaqaat (3/212)\u00a0\nAnd by al-Balaadhuri in Ansaab al-Ashraaf (3/318)\u00a0\nAhmad ibn al-Qaasim ibn al-Musaawir al-Jawaahiri, as narrated by at-Tabaraani in al-Mu\u2018jam al-Kabeer (5/114)\u00a0\nJa\u2018far as-Saayigh, as narrated by Ibn \u2018Adiyy in al-Kaamil (3/223). He said: \u2018Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Marwaan narrated it to us: Abu\u2019s-Saqr al-Warraaq, who is Yahya ibn Dawood al-Baghdaadi, narrated it to us, and Muhammad ibn Muneer ibn Sagheer told us: Ja\u2018far as-Saayigh told us: \u2018Affaan told us.\u00a0\nAdh-Dhahabi said concerning this report:\u00a0\nThis is a saheeh isnaad. End quote.\u00a0\nSiyar A\u2018laam an-Nubala\u2019 (2/433)\u00a0\nAl-Haythami said concerning this report:\u00a0\nIt was narrated by at-Tabaraani and Ahmad, and its men are the men of as-Saheeh. End quote.\u00a0\nMajma\u2018 az-Zawaa\u2019id (5/183)\u00a0\n-2-\nthe second reason is that it was narrated by one of the companions of \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim, who narrated the longer report which mentions \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with them all). The wording is as follows:\u00a0\nWhen the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, the spokesmen of the Ansaar stood up and one of them said: O Muhaajireen, when the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed a man from among you, he would pair him with a man from among us, so we think that two men should take charge of this matter, one of them from among you and the other from among us.\u00a0\nAnd the spokesman of the Ansaar began to speak, one after another, along the same lines.\u00a0\nThen Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allah be pleased with him) stood up and said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was one of the Muhaajireen; the leader should only be from among the Muhaajireen, and we will be his helpers as we were the helpers of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\u00a0\nAbu Bakr (may Allah have mercy on him) stood up and said: May Allah reward you with good, O Ansaar, and may He keep your spokesman steadfast. Then he said: If you had done something other than this, we would not have accepted it from you.\u00a0\nThen Zayd ibn Thaabit took Abu Bakr\u2019s hand and said: This is your leader, so swear allegiance to him; so they began to swear allegiance to him.\u00a0\nWhen Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) sat on the minbar, he looked at the faces of the people, and he did not see \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), so he asked about him, and some of the Ansaar got up and brought him. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: O son of the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his son-in-law, do you want to cause division among the Muslims?\u00a0\n\u2018Ali said: Not at all, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. And he swore allegiance to him.\u00a0\nThen he did not see az-Zubayr ibn al-\u2018Awwaam (may Allah be pleased with him), so he asked about him and they brought him, and he said: O son of the paternal aunt of the Messenger of Allah and his disciple, do you want to cause division among the Muslims? He said the same as \u2018Ali had said: Not at all, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. And they both swore allegiance to him.\u00a0\nNarrated by Ja\u2018far ibn Muhammad ibn Shaakir from \u2018Affaan in this lengthy version. It was also narrated thus by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak (3/80), and from him and from his shaykh Abu Muhammad al-Muqri\u2019, by al-Bayhaqi in as-Sunan al-Kubra (8/143). Al-Haakim said: This hadith is saheeh according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, although they did not narrate it. End quote. Adh-Dhahabi did not say anything about it in at-Talkhees.\u00a0\nAlthough Ja\u2018far ibn Muhammad ibn Shaakir was classed as thiqah (trustworthy) by al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi, Ibn Manaadi and Maslamah ibn Qaasim \u2013 as it says in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (2/102) \u2013 he differed from the senior imams who had memorised the hadith of \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim better than he did. The correct version of the hadith from \u2018Affaan ibn Muslim is the shorter version, in which there is no mention of \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) at that time.\u00a0\nSa\u2018d ibn Iyaas al-Jareeri followed Dawood ibn Abi Hind in narrating from Abu Nadrah, and his version mentions \u2018Ali and az-Zubayr swearing allegiance to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them all), as it says in Tareekh Dimashq (30/278). But its isnaad includes \u2018Ali ibn \u2018Aasim ibn Suhayb al-Waasiti, who made a lot of mistakes in narration. \u2018Ali ibn al-Madeeni said concerning him: \u2018Ali ibn \u2018Aasim made a lot of mistakes, but if he made a mistake and someone pointed it out, he would not repeat it. This was the verdict of all the critics concerning him.\nEnd quote from Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (7/348)\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nConclusion: the oath of allegiance of \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) which is proven is that which is mentioned in the Saheehs of al-Bukhaari and Muslim. As for the earlier oath of allegiance which is mentioned in the hadith of Abu Sa\u2018eed al-Khudri, there is some doubt as to whether it is proven.\u00a0\nWith regard to the claim of the Raafidi liars, that the oath of allegiance given by \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) was sworn under compulsion, this is a false and fabricated claim that stems from obvious stubbornness and wilful blindness to the facts narrated with sound isnaads. If someone is like this, you cannot debate with him, because he is ignoring all rational, logical principles that you should both agree on as a reference point. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cand turn away from the ignorant\u201d [al-A \u2018raaf 7:199]. And Allah knows best.\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIt is known from mutawaatir reports that no one refrained from swearing allegiance to him \u2013 namely Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) \u2013 except Sa\u2018d ibn \u2018Ubaadah. As for \u2018Ali and Banu Haashim, all of them swore allegiance to him, according to scholarly consensus, and none of them died without having sworn allegiance to him. However it was said that \u2018Ali delayed his oath of allegiance for six months; it was also said that in fact he swore allegiance to him on the second day. Whatever the case, they swore allegiance to him without being forced to do so. End quote.\u00a0\nMinhaaj as-Sunnah (8/232)\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is it permissible to marry a Yazidi woman?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    The Yazidis are a deviant sect that began in 132 AH following the demise of \n    the Umayyad state. In the beginning, it was a political movement to restore \n    the glory of the Umayyads, but ignorance continued to prevail among them, \n    and their innovations and misguidance developed until they went beyond the \n    pale of Islam altogether.\u00a0\n\n    The roots of this sect go back to the time after the battle of Karbala\u2019, \n    during the reign of Yazid ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah and the martyrdom of al-Husayn ibn \n    \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and many of Aal al-Bayt (may Allah be \n    pleased with them).\u00a0\n\n    The Shi\u2018ah began to curse Yazid and accuse him of heresy and drinking \n    alcohol.\u00a0\n\n    After the demise of the Umayyad state, the Yazidis began in the form of a \n    political movement. They loved Yazid and objected to the cursing of him in \n    particular, then they objected to cursing in general, to the extent that \n    they objected to the cursing of Iblees. They turned their attention to the \n    Book of Allah, and erased every mention in it of curses or devils or seeking \n    refuge, on the grounds that these words had not existed in the original \n    Qur\u2019an, and that that was something that had been added to it by the \n    Muslims. Then they began to venerate Iblees who is cursed in the Qur\u2019an.\u00a0\n\n    Their beliefs:\n\n    -Their belief that Iblees is the peacock of the angels lead them to venerate \n    statues of peacocks made of copper in the form of a rooster the size of a \n    clenched fist. They take these statues around the villages to collect \n    money.\u00a0\n\n    -In their declaration of faith they say: \u201cI bear witness that One is Allah \n    and Sultan Yazid is the beloved of Allah.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    -Fasting: they fast three days of every year in December, which coincides \n    with the birthday of Yazid ibn Mu\u2018aawiyah.\u00a0\n\n    -Alms are collected by means of the peacock and that is done by chanting and \n    given to the leaders of the sect.\u00a0\n\n    -Pilgrimage: on the tenth day of Dhu\u2019l-Hijjah, they stand on a mountain in \n    al-Marjah an-Nooraaniyyah in Lalish in Iraq.\u00a0\n\n    -Prayer: they pray on the night of the fifteenth of Sha\u2018baan, and claim that \n    it makes up for the prayers of an entire year.\u00a0\n\n    -Resurrection and gathering after death: this will occur in the village of \n    Baatat on Mount Sinjar, where the balance will be set up in front of Shaykh \n    \u2018Adiyy ibn Musaafir, who will bring the people to account and he will take \n    his followers and admit them to Paradise.\u00a0\n\n    They frequent graves and shrines like those of Shaykh \u2018Adiyy, Shaykh Shams \n    ad-Deen, Shaykh Hasan and \u2018Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilaani. Each shrine has \n    servants who use oil and candles to light it.\u00a0\n\n    They regard it as prohibited to marry between classes, and it is permissible \n    for a Yazidi to marry up to six wives.\u00a0\n\n    They prohibit the colour blue because it is one of the most prominent \n    colours of the peacock.\u00a0\n\n    They regard it as prohibited to eat lettuce, cabbage, squash, beans, and \n    turkey, as well as the flesh of the peacock which is regarded by them as \n    holy, because it is a reminder of Iblees, who is the angel peacock, \n    according to their views. They also prohibit chicken, fish, venison and \n    pork.\u00a0\n\n    The Yazidi prays facing towards the sun when it rises and when it sets, then \n    he kisses the ground and rubs his face on it. There is also a supplication \n    that is recited before sleeping.\u00a0\n\n    They have their own festivals, such as the Gregorian New Year, and the \n    festivals of Marba\u2018aaniyyah, Qurbaan and Jamaa\u2018ah, the festival of Yazid, \n    the festival of Khadr Ilyaas, and the festival of Balandah. They have a \n    night that they call the \u201cblack night\u201d, when they extinguish all lights and \n    regard it as permissible during that night to do prohibited actions and \n    drink alcohol.\u00a0\nIn \n    their book it says: \u201cObey and listen to my servants in what they tell you to \n    do and do not speak of that in front of strangers, such as the Jews and \n    Christians and people of Islam, because they do not understand what it is, \n    and do not give them any of your books lest they change them without you \n    realising.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    They respect the Christians, to the extent that they kiss the hands of \n    priests and share communion with them, and they believe that the wine is \n    truly the blood of Christ.\u00a0\n\n    They took from the Christians the practice of baptism, whereby they take the \n    infant to a spring called \u2018Ayn al-Bayda\u2019 and immerse him in it. When the \n    child reaches the age of one week, they bring him to the shrine of Shaykh \n    \u2018Adiyy, where he is immersed in water and they shout his name out loud, \n    asking him to make the child a Yazidi and a believer (in the angel peacock), \n    i.e., Iblees.\u00a0\n\n    When Islam entered the Kurdistan region, most of the inhabitants followed \n    the religion of Zoroastrianism; some of the teachings of this religion were \n    passed down to the Yazidis.\u00a0\n\n    Their beliefs are mixed with Magian and idolatrous teachings, and they \n    raised Yazid to the level of divinity. In their view the hierarchy is: Allah \n    \u2013 Yazid \u2013 \u2018Adiyy.\u00a0\n\n    See: al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Muyassarah fi\u2019l-Adyaan wa\u2019l-Madhaahib wa\u2019l-Ahzaab \n    al-Mu\u2018aasirah (1/371-376).\u00a0\n\n    For more information on their beliefs and misguidance, see the following:\u00a0\n\n    Al-Yazeediyyoona fi Haadirihim wa Maadeehim \n    by \u2018Abd ar-Razzaaq al-Hasani\u00a0\n\n    Al-Yazeediyyah: Ahwaaluhum wa Mu\u2018taqadaatuhum \n    by Dr Saami Sa\u2018eed al-Ahmad\u00a0\n\n    Al-Yazeediyyah wa Asl \u2018Aqeedatihim \n    by \u2018Abbaas al-Ghazzaawi\u00a0\n\n    Ma Hiya al-Yazeediyyah? Wa Man Hum al-Yazeediyyoon \n    by Mahmoud al-Jundi\u00a0\n\n    From the above it is clear that the Yazidis are a deviant and misguided sect \n    who are beyond the pale of Islam. If this is a person\u2019s religion, there is \n    no doubt that he is a disbeliever whose religion is contrary to the religion \n    of Islam that was brought by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him).\u00a0\n\n    Based on that, it is not permissible for a Muslim to marry a Yazidi woman, \n    just as it is not permissible to marry a mushrik (polytheist) or Magian \n    woman, and the like. No exception is made regarding disbelievers who are \n    outside the pale of Islam, with regard to marriage, except in the case of \n    the Jews and Christians, because they are originally People of the Book. As \n    for the Yazidis and others, they have no Book in the first place; rather \n    they are an apostate sect who combine all kinds of disbelief in one \n    religion. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n    \u201cAnd \n    do not marry Al-Mushrikat (idolatresses, etc.) till they believe (worship \n    Allah Alone)\u201d [al-Baqarah \n    2:221].\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni \n    (7/102):\u00a0\n\n    With regard to all the disbelievers, apart from the People of the Book, \n    there is no dispute among the scholars concerning the prohibition on \n    marrying their women or eating meat slaughtered by them. With regard to an \n    apostate woman, it is prohibited to marry her no matter what religion she \n    follows.

        "question": "Is there any report to suggest that the astrologers knew about the birth of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) and warned Nimrood about him?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    \n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    The \n    scholars have divided knowledge of the stars into two categories:\u00a0\n\n    1.Astronomy \n\n    this \n    refers to knowledge of the names of stars, when and where they rise and set, \n    and how they may be used for the purposes of measuring time and for \n    navigation, and other visible things which observation and experience have \n    proven what each star could be used for (working out directions, measuring \n    the passage of time and so on).\u00a0\n\n    There \n    is nothing wrong with learning and teaching this type of knowledge, and \n    there is no evidence to suggest that it is forbidden or makrooh to study it. \n    In fact, in the Holy Qur\u2019an there is evidence to suggest that it is \n    permissible and this knowledge is a blessing that Allah, may He be glorified \n    and exalted, has bestowed upon people, as Allah, may He be glorified and \n    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cIt is He Who has set the stars \n    for you, so that you may guide your course with their help through the \n    darkness of the land and the sea. We have (indeed) explained in detail Our \n    Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, Revelations, etc.) for \n    people who know\u201d\n\n    \n    [al-An\u2018aam 6:97]\n\n    \u201cIt is He Who made the sun a \n    shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out its (their) stages, \n    that you might know the number of years and the reckoning. Allah did not \n    create this but in truth. He explains the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, \n    lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail for people who have knowledge\u201d\n\n    \n    [Yoonus 10:5].\u00a0\n\n    2.Astrology\n\n    this \n    refers to interpreting the locations and movements of the stars and the\u00a0 \n    (supposed) influence they have on worldly developments and events such as \n    death, birth, epidemics, disasters, attaining happiness and other matters \n    for which there is no rational, empirical basis for connecting these \n    developments to the movements of heavenly bodies. Rather this is mere \n    conjecture and speculation for which there is no proof or evidence.\u00a0\n\n    This \n    is what the shar\u2018i evidence definitively forbids; it is haraam to learn it, \n    teach it or study it.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The \n    craft of astrology which seeks to establish the influence and impact of \n    heavenly bodies, and to find out about future earthly events or developments \n    on the basis of celestial events, and to make a connection between celestial \n    movements and earthly influence, is a prohibited craft according to the \n    Qur\u2019an and Sunnah, and the consensus of the ummah. In fact it is forbidden \n    by all the Messengers to their communities.\n\n    Allah, \n    may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cand the magician will never be \n    successful, no matter whatever amount (of skill) he may attain\u201d\n    \n\n    \n    [Ta-Ha 20:69]\n\n    \u201cHave \n    you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They believe \n    in Jibt [sorcery] and Taghoot [evil]\u201d\n\n    \n    [an-Nisa\u2019 4:51].\n\n    \u2018Umar \n    and others said that Jibt (sorcery) refers to magic or witchcraft.\u00a0\n\n    Abu \n    Dawood narrated in his Sunan with a hasan isnaad from Qubaysah ibn \n    Mukhaariq that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cAugury (observing omens in birds etc.), superstition and geomancy come \n    under the heading of jibt (magic).\u201d\u00a0\n\n    If \n    geomancy, which is akin to astrology, comes under the heading of jibt \n    (magic), then how about astrology itself? That is because in geomancy they \n    refer to shapes on earth, because astrology is based on shapes in the \n    heavens.\n\n    \n    \u00a0Ahmad, Abu Dawood, Ibn Maajah and others narrated with a saheeh isnaad from \n    Ibn \u2018Abbaas that he said: \u201cWhoever learns astrology learns a branch of \n    magic; the more he learns (of the former) the more he learns (of the \n    latter).\u201d The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    clearly stated that astrology comes under the same heading as magic. Allah, \n    may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cand the magician will never be \n    successful, no matter whatever amount (of skill) he may attain\u201d\n    \n\n    \n    [Ta-Ha 20:69].\n\n    And \n    this is how it really is. From studying the situation of astrologers, we see \n    that they never prosper either in this world or in the hereafter.\u00a0\n\n    Ahmad, \n    and Muslim in his Saheeh, narrated from Safiyyah bint \u2018Ubayd, from \n    one of the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), \n    from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: \n    \u201cWhoever goes to a fortune teller and asks him about something, no prayer \n    will be accepted from him for forty days.\u201d The astrologer is the same as the \n    fortune teller according to some of the scholars; according to others he \n    comes under the same category. If this is the case with regard to the one \n    who asks, then how about the one who is asked?\u00a0\n\n    He \n    also narrated in his Saheeh that Mu\u2018aawiyah ibn al-Hakam as-Sulami \n    said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, there are some men among us who go to \n    soothsayers. He said: \u201cDo not go to them.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    The \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade going to \n    soothsayers, and astrologers are the same as soothsayers according to \n    al-Khattaabi and other scholars, and this was also narrated from the Arabs. \n    According to others, they come under the same category as soothsayers and \n    are worse than them.\u00a0\n\n    More \n    than one of the scholars has narrated that there is consensus on the \n    prohibition of astrology, such as al-Baghawi, al-Qaadi \u2018Iyaad and others.\u00a0\n\n    In \n    as-Saheehayn it is narrated from Zayd ibn Khaalid al-Juhani that he \n    said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led \n    us in praying Fajr at al-Hudaybiyah, after it had rained at night. When he \n    finished, he turned to the people and said: \u201cDo you know what your Lord \n    said?\u201d They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: \u201cHe said: \n    \u2018This morning some of My slaves believe in Me and some disbelieve. As for \n    the one who said, we got rain by the bounty and mercy of Allah, he is a \n    believer in Me and a disbeliever in the stars. But as for the one who said, \n    We got rain by virtue of such and such a star, he is a disbeliever in Me and \n    a believer in the stars.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n\n    \n    Leading astrologers of the earlier and later generations have admitted that \n    in the case of the believers who worship Allah and turn to Him in \n    supplication, Allah removed from them \u2013 by virtue of the blessing of their \n    worship, supplication and trust in Allah \u2013 that which the astrologers said \n    on the basis of their astrological calculations would inevitably befall \n    them. They have also admitted that those who worship Allah, call upon Him \n    and put their trust in Him will be given reward in this world and in the \n    hereafter that no astrological power could ever bring them.\u00a0\nWho has made the best of this world and the Hereafter in \n    following the Messengers, and has made the best nation those who enjoin what \n    is good and forbid what is evil. \n    \n    End \n    quote from Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa, 35/192-196\u00a0\n\n    \n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    \n    However, we do not deny that some of what the astrologer says about future \n    events may sometimes be correct and may sometimes happen as he foretold; but \n    that does not mean that the path he is following is valid. Rather what he \n    happens to get right is baseless and comes about by pure coincidence. What \n    he gets right is very little in comparison to the lies that accompany it.\u00a0\n\n    Do you \n    not see that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has told \n    us that the jinn who eavesdrop (on the angels) may hear something of what \n    the angels talk about of future events, and the jinni may send down what he \n    has heard to the soothsayer on earth, or the jinni may be burned before he \n    can do that? Yet despite that, soothsaying is a major sin, because it deals \n    with matters of the unseen without any shar\u2018i basis.\u00a0\n\n    It was \n    narrated from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that she heard the \n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say:\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThe \n    angels come down in the clouds and discuss matters that have been decreed in \n    heaven, and the devils may eavesdrop and hear it, then they convey it to the \n    soothsayers, and they tell along with it one hundred lies that they have \n    fabricated by themselves.\u201d\n\n    \n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 3210\u00a0\n\n    Hence \n    al-Qaadi \u2018Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Allah \n    may create in this type \u2013 meaning the astrologers \u2013 some kind of power, but \n    their lies are what predominates. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Quoted \n    from Sharh an-Nawawi \u2018ala Muslim, 14/223\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \n    Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    It may \n    so happen that the divine decree is in accordance with a person\u2019s need, so \n    the poor man thinks that it is because of this astrologer, or because of \n    this soothsayer, that this thing happened. Or it may be that a person \n    prescribes a regular remedy other than what the astrologer claims, and that \n    the person who prescribes it knows that it is good for this sickness, but \n    the sick person thinks that healing comes about only because of the \n    astrologers looking at the stars, and so on. The point is that if healing \n    occurs sometimes after going to soothsayers or astrologers or geomancers and \n    their ilk, that does not prove that their way is sound. The mushrikeen \n    themselves \u2013 who worship idols \u2013 may come to an idol and ask of it, then \n    what they wanted happens by Allah\u2019s leave, as a coincidence and for reasons \n    known to Allah in His wisdom, or it may come about by means of the devils, \n    and thus becomes a trial and test. But it does not come from the idol, \n    because the idol did not do anything, and the jinni who is with him did not \n    do anything. Rather the divine decree may dictate that this sickness should \n    go away or this calamity should be alleviated after this poor man went to \n    the idol and asked of it or offered a sacrifice to it. Thus that comes about \n    as a test and trial in itself, without that being the result of any action \n    on the part of the magician, the idol, the jinn and so on.

        "question": "Who are Banu Qurayzah? What happened to them?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    When the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) migrated from Makkah to Madinah, there were \n    three Jewish tribes in Madinah: Banu Qaynuqaa\u2018, Banu an-Nadeer and Banu \n    Qurayzah. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) invited \n    them to Islam, but most of them insisted on disbelieving. He drew up a \n    covenant with them (i.e., a binding contract) then they waged war against \n    him. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n    All three (Jewish tribes) waged \n    war against him. He let off Banu Qaynuqaa\u2018, expelled Banu an-Nadeer, and \n    killed Banu Qurazah and took their women and children captive. Soorat al-Hashr \n    was revealed concerning Banu an-Nadeer, and Soorat al-Ahzaab was revealed \n    concerning Banu Qurayzah.\n\n    Zaad al-Ma\u2018aad \n    (3/59)\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    To sum up what the scholars of \n    seerah and maghaazi (Prophet\u2019s biography and military campaigns) said about \n    Banu Qurayzah:\u00a0\n\n    When the Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) finished digging the trench, \n    Quraysh came with ten thousand of their ahaabeesh (a group of people \n    who did not belong to any one tribe) and those who followed them of Banu \n    Kinaanah and the people of Tihaamah, and Ghatafaan came with those who \n    followed them of the people of Najd. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) and the Muslims came out until they put their \n    backs towards Sal\u2018 \u2013 a mountain in Madinah \u2013 with three thousand Muslims. He \n    set up his camp there, and the trench was between him and the enemy. He \n    issued orders that the children and women be taken up into the forts, and he \n    appointed Ibn Umm Maktoom in charge of Madinah.\u00a0\n\n    Huyayy ibn Akhtab al-Nadari set \n    out and went to Ka\u2018b ibn Asad al-Qurazi, who was the one who had made a \n    treaty and covenant (with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him)) on behalf of Banu Qurayzah. When Ka\u2018b heard about that, he shut the \n    door of his fort in Huyayy\u2019s face. He asked permission to enter, but he \n    refused to open the door to him, so he called out to him: Woe to you, O Ka\u2018b! \n    Open the door! Ka\u2018b said: Woe to you, O Huyayy! You are a man of ill omen \n    and I have made a treaty with Muhammad; I will not break the treaty between \n    me and him, for I have not seen anything from him but faithfulness and \n    truthfulness. Huyayy said: Woe to you! Open the door so that I may speak to \n    you. And he kept on him until he opened the door, then he kept pleading with \n    him until he agreed to break his treaty with the Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), on condition that Huyayy give \n    him a solemn pledge by Allah that if Quraysh and Ghatafaan went back without \n    having killed Muhammad, he would enter his fort with him and share his fate. \n    Thus Ka\u2018b ibn Asad broke his treaty and freed himself from the covenant that \n    had been between him and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of \n    Allah be upon him).\u00a0\n\n    When the news reached the \n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the \n    Muslims, he sent Sa\u2018d ibn Mu\u2018aadh, who was the chief of al-Aws at that time, \n    and Sa\u2018d ibn \u2018Ubaadah, who was the chief of al-Khazraj, along with \u2018Abdullah \n    ibn Rawaahah and Khawwaat ibn Jubayr, who went to them, to call them to make \n    peace and renew the alliance. They said: Now after you have weakened us and \n    has expelled them, meaning Banu an-Nadeer?! And they spoke disparagingly of \n    the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him. Sa\u2018d ibn \n    \u2018Ubaadah began to trade insults with them, then Sa\u2018d ibn Mu\u2018aadh called out \n    to them: You know what there is between us and you, O Banu Qurayzah, and I \n    fear for you a fate like that of Banu an-Nadeer or even worse. But they \n    reviled him and spoke disparagingly of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him). They said: Who is the Messenger of Allah? There \n    is no covenant or agreement between us and Muhammad. So Sa\u2018d ibn Mu\u2018aadh \n    traded insults with them, and he was a hot tempered man.\u00a0\n\n    They went back to the Messenger \n    of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and told him what had \n    happened, and the situation became serious and fear was everywhere. Their \n    enemy came at them from above and below until the believers thought all \n    sorts of things and hypocrisy rose to the surface.\u00a0\n\n    The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stood on guard, and the \n    mushrikeen continued to besiege him for twenty-odd days, nearly a month, but \n    there was no fighting between them apart from some shooting with arrows.\u00a0\n\n    The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions remained as \n    Allah described it, in a state of hardship and fear, because their enemy \n    gathered together against them and came at them from above and below.\u00a0\n\n    Then Nu\u2018aym ibn Mas\u2018ood came to \n    the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: \n    O Messenger of Allah, I have become Muslim and my people do not know that I \n    have become Muslim; instruct me as you wish. The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cYou are just one man among \n    us; try to stir up division among them so as to weaken their resolve if you \n    can, for war is deceit.\u201d Nu\u2018aym ibn Mas\u2018ood went out and came to Banu \n    Qurayzah, as he had been a friend of theirs during the Jaahiliyyah. He said \n    to them: Quraysh and Ghatafaan have come to fight Muhammad and his \n    Companions, and you have supported them against him, and their land, their \n    women and their wealth are elsewhere, so they are not like you. If they see \n    an opportunity, they will take it, otherwise they will go back to their own \n    country and leave you alone with the man in your country, and you will not \n    be able to stand up to him if you are left alone. So do not fight with these \n    people until you take hostages from among their leaders, who will be in your \n    hands as a guarantee so that you will fight Muhammad with them until you \n    defeat him. And they said: You have given good advice.\u00a0\n\n    Then he went to Quraysh and said \n    to Abu Sufyaan ibn Harb and the men of Quraysh who were with him: You should \n    know that the Jews regret what has happened between them and Muhammad, and \n    they have sent word telling him: We regret what we did; will it please you \n    if we capture some of the leaders of the two tribes, Quraysh and Ghatafaan, \n    and give them to you so that you may strike their necks, then we will be \n    with you against whoever among them is left until we eradicate them? And he \n    has sent word to them agreeing to that. So if the Jews send anyone to you, \n    asking you for hostages from among your men, do not give them even one man.\u00a0\n\n    Then he went out and came to \n    Ghatafaan and said something similar to them as he had said to Quraysh, and \n    issued a similar warning to them.\u00a0\n\n    Then Allah created dissent among \n    them. And Allah sent a wind on an intensely cold winter\u2019s night, which \n    overturned their cooking pots and tents.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah, may He be exalted, \n    revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cO you who believe! Remember \n    Allah's Favour to you, when there came against you hosts, and We sent \n    against them a wind and forces that you saw not [i.e. troops of angels \n    during the battle of AlAhzab (the Confederates)]. And Allah is Ever All-Seer \n    of what you do\u2026 .\n\n    And Allah drove back those who \n    disbelieved in their rage, they gained no advantage (booty, etc.). Allah \n    sufficed for the believers in the fighting (by sending against the \n    disbelievers a severe wind and troops of angels). And Allah is Ever \n    All-Strong, All-Mighty. \n\n    And those of the people of the \n    Scripture who backed them (the disbelievers) Allah brought them down from \n    their forts and cast terror into their hearts, (so that) a group (of them) \n    you killed, and a group (of them) you made captives. \n\n    And He caused you to inherit \n    their lands, and their houses, and their riches, and a land which you had \n    not trodden (before). And Allah is Able to do all things.\u201d\n\n    [al-Ahzaab 33:9-27].\u00a0\n\n    That is, Allah diverted their \n    enemy from them by means of the wind that He sent against them and the \n    troops of angels and others whom Allah sent to them. \u201cAllah sufficed for \n    the believers in the fighting\u201d means: they did not need to engage in \n    fighting with them; rather the Most Strong, the Almighty, diverted them by \n    His might and power.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Bukhaari (4114) and Muslim \n    (2724) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere is no god but Allah alone, He \n    granted victory to His troops, supported His slave and defeated the \n    confederates alone, and there is nothing after Him.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    When the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) returned from the battle of the Trench, and laid \n    down his weapon and did ghusl \u2013 as narrated by al-Bukhaari (4117) \u2013 Jibreel \n    (peace be upon him) came to him and said: Have you laid down your arms? For \n    by Allah, we (angels) have not laid down ours; go out to them. He said: \n    \u201cWhere to?\u201d He said: Over there \u2013 and he pointed in the direction of Banu \n    Qurayzah. So the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went out \n    to them, and besieged them with detachments of Muslims for umpteen days. \n    Allah cast fear into their hearts and the siege became intense, until they \n    agreed to accept the ruling of Sa\u2018d ibn Mu\u2018aadh, as they had been his \n    allies. His verdict concerning them was in accordance with the ruling of \n    Allah: their fighters were to be killed and their women and children taken \n    captive.\u00a0\n\n    The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) detained them in Madinah, then he \n    went out to the marketplace of Madinah and dug trenches in it, then he sent \n    for them and struck their necks in those trenches as they were brought out \n    to him in batches. They said to Ka\u2018b ibn Asad as they were being taken to \n    the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in \n    batches: O Ka\u2018b, what do you think will be done to us? He said: Will you \n    never understand? Don\u2019t you see that the caller does not stop and that \n    whoever among you is taken away does not return? By Allah it is death. And \n    this went on until they were finished with.\u00a0\n\n    The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) issued instructions to execute \n    every one of them who had grown pubic hair, and whoever had not grown pubic \n    hair was left alone. Abu Dawood (4404) narrated with a saheeh isnaad from \n    \u2018Atiyyah al-Qurazi (may Allah be pleased with him) he said: I was among the \n    captives of Banu Qurayzah, and they examined (us). Those whose pubes had \n    started to grow were executed and those whose pubes had not started to grow \n    were not executed. I was among those whose pubes had not started to grow.\u00a0\n\n    According to another report: \n    They uncovered my private part and saw that my pubes had not yet started to \n    grow, so they put me with the captive women and children.\u00a0\n\n    See: al-Bidaayah \n    wa\u2019n-Nihaayah (6/34-94); Siyar A\u2018laam an-Nubala\u2019 (1/470-480); \n    Tareekh al-Islam (2/307-318); ar-Rawd al-Unuf (6/262-294)\u00a0\n\n    Thus the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) put an end to the Jews of Banu Qurayzah who \n    broke the treaty and formed an alliance with the mushrikeen to eradicate \n    Islam and its people. So their plot backfired and they themselves were \n    eradicated to the last man.

        "question": "Dhu\u2019l-Khuwaysirah at-Tameemi was a hypocrite",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhaari (3610) and Muslim (1064) narrated that Abu Sa\u2018eed al-Khudri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: whilst we were with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he was sharing out some wealth, Dhu\u2019l-Khuwaysirah, a man from Banu Tameem, came and said: O Messenger of Allah, be fair!

They will pass out of Islam as an arrow passes out of the prey\u00a0\nThis Dhu\u2019l-Khuwaysirah was the leader of the Khawaarij. See the answer to question no. 191140\u00a0\nAccording to another report narrated by Abu Sa\u2018eed: \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib sent to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) some gold from Yemen in a tanned leather bag, that had not been purified of the earth clinging to it. He shared it out among four men: \u2018Uyaynah ibn Badr, al-Aqra\u2019 ibn Haabis, Zayd al-Khayl and the fourth, who was either \u2018Alqamah ibn \u2018Ulaathah or \u2018Aamir ibn al-Tufayl. One of his companions said: We had more right to it than these men. News of that reached the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he said: \u201cDo you not trust me, when I am the trustee of the One Who is above the heaven and the news of heaven comes to me morning and evening?\u201d A man with sunken eyes, prominent cheeks, a high forehead, a thick beard and shaven head stood up, tucking up his izaar, and said: O Messenger of Allah, fear Allah! He said: \u201cWoe to you! Am I not the one who should fear Allah the most among the people of earth?\u201d Then the man turned and left, and Khaalid ibn al-Waleed said: O Messenger of Allah, should I not strike his neck (kill him)?\u00a0 He said: \u201cNo, perhaps he prays.\u201d Khaalid said: How many of those who pray say with their tongues what is not in their hearts? The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI have not been commanded to check people\u2019s hearts or split open their bellies (meaning checking what is in their hidden thoughts).\u201d Then he looked at him as he was going back and said: \u201cFrom among the progeny of this man will emerge people who recite the Book of Allah fluently, but it will not go any further than their throats. They will pass out of the faith as an arrow passes out of the prey.\u201d\u00a0\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This man was Dhu\u2019l-Khuwaysirah at-Tameemi. End quote.\u00a0\nThis man was a hypocrite.\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe Qur\u2019an stated that this man was a hypocrite: \u201cAnd of them are some who accuse you (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms\u201d [at-Tawbah 9:58], i.e., he will criticise and cast aspersions upon you. By telling the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to be just and fear Allah, after he had given that wealth only to those four people, he was accusing the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of being unjust and not fearing Allah. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAm I not the one who should fear Allah the most among the people of earth? Do you not trust me, when I am the trustee of the One Who is above the heaven?\u201d\u00a0\nSuch words would undoubtedly deserve execution, if anyone were to say them today. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only refrained from executing him because he outwardly appeared to be a Muslim, by regularly praying, which is what people are to be fought for until they do it. His hypocrisy was because of what he caused the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of offence, but the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had the right to pardon him and overlook his misdeed. He used to pardon them and overlook their misdeeds in order to soften their hearts towards Islam, lest the people said that Muhammad was killing his companions.\nEnd quote from as-Saarim al-Maslool (pp. 228-229)\u00a0\nThis is also indicated by the report narrated by Muslim (1063) from Jaabir ibn \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in al-Ji\u2018raanah, when he was on his way back from Hunayn. In the cloak of Bilaal there was some silver and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was giving handfuls of it to the people. He said: O Muhammad, be fair! He said: \u201cWoe to you! Who will be fair if I am not fair? I will be doomed and lost if I am not fair.\u201d \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u201cO Messenger of Allah, let me kill this hypocrite! He said: \u201cAllah forbid that the people should say that I kill my companions. This man and his ilk read the Qur\u2019an, but it does not go any further than their throats, and they pass through it like an arrow passing through the prey.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not rebuke \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) for calling him a hypocrite.\u00a0\nIt is also indicated by the report narrated by al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of Abu Sa\u2018eed mentioned above (6933), in which Abu Sa\u2018eed said: I bear witness that I heard it from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and I bear witness that \u2018Ali killed them, and I was with him.

        "question": "Is Ibraaheem\u2019s building of the Ka\u2018bah mentioned in the Bible?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We Muslims do not believe that there is any contradiction between the Holy Qur\u2019an and the original Torah and Gospel, because we believe that they are all divinely revealed books that were sent down from Allah, may He be glorified. Thus they came from the same source, and as that is the case there cannot be any contradiction or conflict between them, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cDo they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions\u201d\n[an-Nisa\u2019 4:82].\u00a0\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, describes the Holy Qur\u2019an as \u201cconfirming\u201d the Books that came before it, and that which confirms something cannot contradict or conflict with it. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cIt is He Who has sent down the Book (the Quran) to you (Muhammad SAW) with truth, confirming what came before it. And he sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel).\nAforetime, as a guidance to mankind, And He sent down the criterion (of judgement between right and wrong (this Quran)).\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:3-4]\n\u201cAnd We have sent down to you (O Muhammad SAW) the Book (this Quran) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Mohayminan (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures)\u201d\n[al-Maa\u2019idah 5:48].\u00a0\nAs for what we see nowadays of contradictions in the copies of the Torah and Gospel that are extant today, the reason for that is clear and obvious. It is because these two Books have fallen prey to distortion and alteration, with things being taken away, added and changed. That is in addition to the fact that the sources and manuscripts that have come down to us today cannot be trusted. This is what explains any differences that researchers or students find between these two Books and the Holy Qur\u2019an which has been transmitted to us in a mutawaatir fashion (i.e., narrated by so many from so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a lie), as is attested by both believers and nonbelievers.\u00a0\nFor more discussion on this matter, please see fatwa no. 186196\u00a0\nNevertheless we say that Ibraaheem\u2019s arrival in the land of Makkah al-Mukarramah \u2013 and indeed his building of the Sacred House \u2013 are historical events that are attested to in the Torah and other ancient historical books. We cannot deny the fact that there are different interpretations of these texts of the Torah and so on, and that the context is open to different interpretations. Our aim here here is to confirm that such indications exist. However, the matter should be left to scholars to examine the story in the Old Testament, in order to reach a definitive conclusion.\nThese references include the following:\u00a0\n1.\nIn the book of Genesis 16:7 it says, after mentioning the story of Ibraaheem (Abraham) going in unto Haajar (Hagar) and her becoming pregnant, then Sarai\u2019s [Sarah\u2019s] complaint to Ibraaheem about her:\u00a0\n[Biblical quotations in English are taken from the King James Version (KJV); some place names have been changed, followed by the place name, in brackets, that is mentioned in the KJV. This is done in line with the point the author is making \u2013 see below]\u00a0\nAnd when Sarai [Sarah] dealt hardly [harshly] with her, she fled from her face.\n7\u00a0And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain [spring] of water in the wilderness, by the fountain [spring] in the way to the Hijaz (Shur).\n8\u00a0And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.\n\u2026\n13\u00a0And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?\n14\u00a0Wherefore the well was called Be\u2019er lahai roi (Well of the Living One Who sees me); behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.\nSee how the name of the Hijaz is mentioned, and Hajar\u2019s departure to that place, after which the blessing of the \u201cWell of the Living One Who sees me\u201d is bestowed by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted; this is the Well of Zamzam.\u00a0\n2.\nIn Genesis 13:1-18 it says:\u00a0\nAnd Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, towards the qiblah (into the south).\n2\u00a0And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\n3\u00a0And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;\n4\u00a0Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.\n\u2026\n18\u00a0Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.\nIn Genesis 20:1 it also says:\u00a0\nAnd Abraham journeyed from thence towards the land of the qiblah (the south country), and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\nWe have quoted these texts [in the original Arabic of this article] from the Torah as translated into Arabic by Sa\u2018eed al-Fayyoomi, (d. 943 AH); the King James Version of the Bible has been used here]. He was the first one to translate the Old Testament into Arabic. He also wrote a commentary for most of its books. We have not found this Torah anywhere else except in the book of Idrees \u2018Abayzah entitled Madhkal ila Diraasat at-Tawraat wa Naqdiha ma\u2018a Tarjumatihi al-\u2018Arabiyyah li Sa\u2018diyyaa Ka\u2019oon al-Fayyoomi (Introduction to the Study and Critique of the Torah, accompanied by its Translation into Arabic by Sa\u2018diyyaa Ka\u2019oon al-Fayyoomi).\u00a0\nIn other well-known translations of the Torah [into Arabic], instead of the Hijaz it mentions \u201cby a fountain [spring] of water in the wilderness, by the fountain [spring] in the way to Shur\u201d (Genesis 16:7), and instead of the qiblah it mentions \u201cthe south\u201d (Genesis 13:1).\n[Translator\u2019s note: some English translations say \u201cNegev\u201d instead of \u201cthe south\u2019; in the Bible, this word is used for the direction \u201csouth\u201d]\u00a0\nFor more information please see (in Arabic): Nabi Ard al-Janoob (Prophet of the Southern Land) by Jamaal ad-Deen ash-Sharqaawi (p. 18-109)\u00a0\n3.\nIn Genesis 21:21 it says of Ismaa\u2018eel (peace be upon him):\u00a0\n21\u00a0And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.\nThis is how it appears in the Samaritan Torah (also known as the Samaritan Pentateuch), and in al-Fayyoomi\u2019s translation of the Torah.\nAlthough many passages in the Torah suggest that Paran is in Palestine, Imam al-Qarraafi said in his book al-Ajwibah al-Faakhirah (p. 165): Paran is Makkah, according to the consensus of the People of the Book. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in al-Jawaab as-Saheeh liman baddala Deen al-Maseeh (5/200):\u00a0\nThere is no difference of opinion between the Muslims and the People of the Book concerning the fact that Paran is Makkah. But if they say that it is not Makkah, there is nothing strange in that, because they are known for their distortions and fabrications.\u00a0\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said concerning the region around Mount Hira\u2019 in Makkah:\nThat place is called Faaraan (Paran) to this day. End quote.\u00a0\n\u2018Abd al-Haqq Vidyarthi (d. 1978 CE) stated in his famous book Muhammad in World Scriptures:\nIn the Arabic translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch (Torah), which was published in 1851 CE, it says that Paran is located in the Hijaz, as follows:\n\u201cAnd he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt\u201d (Genesis 21:21).\nThis translation remained in circulation for a long time, but when the Muslims alerted the Christian world to this prophecy, and that it constituted testimony to the truth of this Noble Prophet, the translation was changed. End quote\u00a0\n4.\nIn the Old Testament, in Psalms 84:5-6, 10, there is mention of the valley of Baca. This passage, in the King James Version (KJV), reads as follows:\u00a0\n5\u00a0Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.\n6\u00a0Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.\n\u2026\n10\u00a0For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand (elsewhere).\nThere is no valley on earth called Baca (or Bakkah) that contains a house of worship and a spring of water (Zamzam), in which one prayer is better than a thousand prayers offered anywhere else, other than Makkah al-Mukarramah.\u00a0\nBaca (Bakkah) is one of the names of Makkah. This name is mentioned in the Holy Qur\u2019an, where Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning)\u201d\n\u201cVerily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-Alameen (the mankind and jinns)\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:96].\u00a0\nBut the translators and commentators of the Old Testament distorted the word Baca to buka\u2019 [weeping or crying; the Hebrew cognate denotes the same meaning], even though the meanings of place names should not be translated; rather the name should be transliterated, and even though the meaning of the (original) name has nothing to do with crying or weeping, as a result of their desire to eliminate all references to anything that is proven in the Holy Qur\u2019an, such distortions occurred.\u00a0\nIn conclusion, we say:\u00a0\nEven if nothing was mentioned in the Old Testament concerning Ibraaheem\u2019s journey to the Hijaz, that does not indicate that this journey did not happen at all. The well known academic principle says that the fact that a thing is not mentioned does not mean that it did not happen. In other words, denying that something happened should take the form of a negative statement. The fact that no mention is made of its happening does not necessarily mean that it did not happen; rather the reason why it was not mentioned may be that it was omitted, forgotten, summarized in brief, and the like. If you find news of something in one newspaper, then you find that it is not mentioned at all in another newspaper, the fact that it is not mentioned in the latter does not mean that it did not happen. Whoever thinks in such terms is lacking in reason and is making no sense. This is also applicable in the case under discussion here.\u00a0\nFurthermore, if we were to quote the words of non-Muslims who have investigated the story of the Ka\u2018bah and who really built it, and have determined that Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) is the one who built it, this article would become far too long. But we will limit ourselves to quoting one of the most famous of contemporary history books, The Story of Civilization, by Will Durant. This book is composed of forty-two volumes in which the author discusses the history of most civilizations, including the history of the Arabian Peninsula, concerning which he says: \u201cIt (the Ka\u2018bah) was built the fourth time by Abraham and Ishmael, his son from Hagar.\nSee Qissat al-Hadaarah, 13/18 (The Story of Civilization).\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Did everyone on earth drown at the great Flood at the time of Nooh (peace be upon him)?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The clear text of the Qur\u2019an indicates that everyone who was \n    on earth drowned in the flood, and no humans or animals were saved except \n    those whom Nooh took with him on board the ark.\u00a0\n\n    Allah, may He be exalted, said (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\n\n    \u201cAnd We saved him and those with him in \n    the laden ship.\n\n    Then We drowned the rest (disbelievers) \n    thereafter\u201d\n\n    [ash-Shu\u2018ara\u2019 26:119-120].\n\n    \u201c(So it was) till \n    then there came Our Command and the oven gushed forth (water like fountains \n    from the earth). We said: \u2018Embark therein, of each kind two (male and \n    female), and your family, except him against whom the Word has already gone \n    forth, and those who believe. And none believed with him, except a few.\u2019\u201d\n\n    [Hood 11:40].\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThey denied him, \n    but We delivered him, and those with him in the ship, and We made them \n    generations replacing one after another, while We drowned those who belied \n    Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). Then see \n    what was the end of those who were warned\u201d\n\n    [Yoonus 10:73].\u00a0\n\n    The Qur\u2019anic text also indicates that the earth was only \n    populated after that by the descendants of Nooh (peace be upon him). As for \n    the believers who were saved with him in the ark, none of their descendants \n    were left. So all the people on earth now are descended from Nooh (peace be \n    upon him).\u00a0\n\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd indeed Nooh \n    (Noah) invoked Us, and We are the Best of those who answer (the request).\n\n    And We rescued him and his family from \n    the great distress (i.e. drowning),\n\n    And, his progeny, them We made the \n    survivors (i.e. Shem, Ham and Japheth).\n\n    And left for him (a goodly remembrance) \n    among generations to come in later times.\n\n    Salamun (peace) be upon Nooh (Noah) \n    (from Us) among the Alameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists)!\"\n\n    Verily, thus We reward the Muhsinoon \n    (good-doers)\n\n    Verily, he (Nooh (Noah) ) was one of \n    Our believing slaves.\n\n    Then We drowned the other (disbelievers \n    and polytheists, etc.)\u201d\n\n    [as-Saaffaat 37:75-82].\u00a0\n\n    \u2018Ali ibn Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn \u2018Abbaas: There was no \n    one left except the progeny of Nooh (peace be upon him).\u00a0\n\n    Qataadah said concerning the words \u201cAnd, \n    his progeny, them We made the survivors\u201d: \n    All people are among the progeny of Nooh (peace be upon him).\u00a0\n\n    Tafseer al-Qur\u2019an al-\u2018Azeem by \n    Ibn Katheer, 7/22\u00a0\n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The scholars differed concerning the number of people who \n    were with him on board the Ark.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated from Ibn \u2018Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with \n    him): There were eighty men, accompanied by their wives. It was narrated \n    from Ka\u2018b al-Ahbaar that there were seventy-two people. It was also said \n    that there were ten people.\u00a0\n\n    A number of the commentators said: The water rose until it \n    was fifteen cubits above the top of the highest mountain on earth. This is \n    the view of the People of the Book. It was also suggested that it was eighty \n    cubits, and that it covered the length and breadth of the earth, plains, \n    rugged terrain, mountains, desolate regions and sandy deserts, and there was \n    no one left of those who had been living on earth at all, neither young nor \n    old.\u00a0\n\n    Imam Maalik said, narrating from Zayd ibn Aslam: The \n    population at that time filled the plains and mountains\u2026\u00a0\n\n    Allah did not give any of those believers who were with him \n    children or descendants, apart from Nooh (peace be upon him). Allah, may He \n    be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd, \n    his progeny, them We made the survivors\u201d \n    [as-Saaffaat 37:77]. So everyone on the face of the earth today, of all \n    races, are the sons of Adam who are descended from the three sons of Nooh, \n    namely Saam, Haam and Yaafith (Shem, Ham and Japeth). End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah, \n    1/111-114\u00a0\n\n    Al-\u2018Allaamah at-Taahir ibn \u2018Ashoor (may Allah have mercy on \n    him) said: The fact that the phrase \u201cthem \n    We made the survivors\u201d begins with the \n    pronoun is to indicate exclusivity. In other words: There was no one left of \n    mankind except those whom Allah saved with Nooh in the ark, of his \n    offspring, then those who were descended from them. There was no one left of \n    the sons of Adam apart from the progeny of Nooh. So all nations are among \n    the progeny of the three sons of Nooh. The apparent meaning of this is that \n    those who believed with Nooh apart from his sons did not have any offspring. \n    Ibn \u2018Abbaas said: When Nooh came out of the ark, the men and women who were \n    with him died, except for his sons and his wives. Thus we may respond to the \n    apparent contradiction between this verse and the verse in Soorat Hood (\u201cWe \n    said: \u2018Embark therein, of each kind two (male and female), and your family, \n    except him against whom the Word has already gone forth, and those who \n    believe. And none believed with him, except a few.\u2019\u201d \n    [Hood 11:40]).

        "question": "Why did Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, test Ayyoob (peace be upon him)?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe apparent meaning of the Holy Qur\u2019an indicates that Allah\u2019s trial of His Prophet Ayyoob (peace be upon him) was not by way of punishment for a sin or act of disobedience; rather it was for reasons known to Him, may He be glorified and exalted. Perhaps one of those reasons is that it was in order to raise him to high status by virtue of his patience, so that he might attain thereby a lofty status on the Day of Judgement.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, praises him for his patience, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cTruly! We found him patient. How excellent (a) slave! Verily, he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)\u201d [Saad 38:44]. This is the context of praise and commendation, and raising in status, which is different from the context of rebuke that is mentioned in the story of Yoonus (peace be upon him), where Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThen a (big) fish swallowed him and he had done an act worthy of blame.\nHad he not been of them who glorify Allah,\nHe would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) till the Day of Resurrection.\nBut We cast him forth on the naked shore while he was sick\u201d\n[as-Saaffaat 37:142-145].\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nIn the Prophet\u2019s Sunnah there is a report which indicates that Ayyoob (peace be upon him) was innocent of any sin that could have been a cause for the sickness that befell him.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n\u201cVerily Ayyoob, the Prophet of Allah, suffered his trials for eighteen years, when he was shunned by relatives and strangers alike, except for two of his brothers who were among the closest of his brothers. They used to come to him in the morning and in the evening. One of them said to his companion: Do you know, by Allah, that Ayyoob must have committed a sin that no one else ever committed? His companion said: Why is that? He said: For eighteen years, Allah has not shown mercy to him or granted him relief.\u00a0\nWhen they went to him in the evening, the man could not keep from telling him about that. Ayyoob said: I do not know what he is talking about, but Allah knows that I passed by two men who were arguing, and they mentioned Allah, I would go back to my house and offer expiation on their behalf, because I did not want Allah to be mentioned except in a proper manner\u2026\u00a0\nNarrated by Abu Ya\u2018la in al-Musnad, 6/299; Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, 7/159; al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak, 2/635\u00a0\nThis hadeeth was classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan. Al-Haakim said: (It is saheeh) according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, although they did not narrate it. This was also stated by adh-Dhahabi in at-Talkhees. In Fath al-Baari, 6/421, Ibn Hajar described it as being the soundest report on this topic. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah, no 17. Some of the scholars thought it was flawed. See: Ahaadeeth Mu\u2018allah Zaahiruha as-Sihhah, p. 54. See also: al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah, 1/254-259\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nThe scholars stated that the wisdom behind the trials of the Prophets is to raise them in status and enhance their image and reputation.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, tests His slaves with good times and bad, hardship and ease. He may test them thereby to raise them in status and enhance their image and reputation, and multiply the reward for their good deeds, as He did with the Prophets and Messengers (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) and the righteous among His slaves. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe most sorely tested of people are the Prophets, then the next best and the next best.\u201d Narrated by at-Tirmidhi, 2398. So if any of the righteous slaves of Allah is tested with sickness and the like, this is akin to the tests of the Prophets and Messengers, and serves to raise one in status and increase the reward, so let him be an example to others of patience and seeking reward with Allah.\nEnd quote from Majmoo\u2018 Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 4/370-371\u00a0\nOn our website we have previously discussed in detail the various reasons behind the trials of the Prophets, and we have quoted the explanation of this issue given by al-\u2018Allaamah Ibn al-Qayyim.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It is not fair for anyone who wants to examine the causes of \n    any nation\u2019s decline to focus only on some outward aspects of its decline \n    that everyone can see, because achieving cultural advancement is a huge \n    process in which innumerable interrelated factors play a role; these factors \n    are accumulated throughout the years and penetrate deeply in all aspects of \n    life, which leads to raising the level of communities little by little. \n    Humans can hardly feel this progress because it is like the light of dawn; \n    it keeps coming out until its light spreads over the horizon.\u00a0\n\n    The Holy Qur\u2019an tells us some of the aspects of material \n    advancement that were \u2013 and still are \u2013 a means of trials and tests, of \n    which no one understands the great wisdom behind it and the great impact it \n    has on historical dynamics except Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\u00a0\n\n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cOn the Day when those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of \n    Allah Islamic Monotheism) will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said): \n    \"You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your \n    pleasure therein.

They were superior to them in strength, and they \n    tilled the earth and populated it in greater numbers than these (pagans) \n    have done, and there came to them their Messengers with clear proofs. \n    Surely, Allah wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves.\n\n    Then evil was the end of those who did evil, because they \n    belied the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, \n    Messengers, etc.) of Allah and made mock of them.\u201d\n\n    [ar-Room 30:9-10].\u00a0\n\n    Al-\u2018Allaamah Muhammad Rasheed Rida (may Allah have mercy on \n    him) said:\n\n    The first Muslims\u2019 belief in the Oneness of Allah (Tawheed), \n    their knowledge of Him, their love for Him and their reliance on Him are \n    what purified their souls, honed their ambitions and gave them a sense of \n    pride and power; that enabled them to establish truth and justice, and \n    motivated them to conquer lands, rule nations, ransom them from spiritual \n    and intellectual slavery to soothsayers, rabbis, monks and clergy, liberate \n    them from the injustice and tyranny of kings, establish the foundations of \n    civilisation, and revive and develop different branches of science and \n    technology. They were able to achieve all of that in an unprecedented manner \n    that no other nation on earth had ever achieved or even come close. Gustave \n    le Bon, the famous sociologist, said: Mastery of different branches of \n    science and technology was not possible for any rising nation in less than \n    three generations: the first generation clings to the past; the second \n    generation started the process of freeing themselves from blind following; \n    and the third generation is the generation of independence and hard work. \n    (He said that this applies to all nations) except the Arabs; they are the \n    only ones who were able to lay the foundation of science and technology in \n    the first generation.\u00a0\n\n    I say: The cause of that was the teachings of the Qur\u2019an, \n    which taught them to be independent in thinking and to avoid blind \n    imitation. It taught them to be prepared to lead mankind in spiritual and \n    worldly matters alike. But all of that disappeared for subsequent \n    generations, after the demise of the Islamic caliphate and after Arabic \n    civilisation ceased to flourish, when power shifted to the non-Arabs who had \n    nothing of Islam except superficial traditions and were not strongly \n    connected to the guidance of the Qur\u2019an.\n\n    Tafseer al-Manaar, 11/173\u00a0\n\n    We cannot ignore the impact of conspiracies, both internal \n    and external, against our ummah throughout the ages, which led to its \n    enemies getting ahead of it in material matters. But our thought and the \n    thought of our ummah is far above feelings of defeatism, relying on others \n    in order to achieve revival, and feeling overwhelmed in the face of great \n    responsibility, the responsibility of being in a leading position in \n    relation to other nations. As for our enemies among the Israelites, they \n    excelled at making the most of every opportunity and they strove hard in \n    engineering events that had a global impact. They strove persistently for \n    decades until they achieved what they wanted and reached a position of power \n    in our times. But that has nothing to do with the verse (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \u201cO Children of Israel! Remember My \n    Favour which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you to the Alameen \n    (mankind and jinns)\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:47], because \n    this verse speaks of previous blessings that Allah had granted to the \n    Children of Israel throughout history, and is meant to remind them of that. \n    Among these blessings are what is mentioned in the Holy Qur\u2019an, where Allah, \n    may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \n    \u201cAnd (remember) when Moosa (Moses) said to his people: \u2018O my people! \n    Remember the Favour of Allah to you, when He made Prophets among you, made \n    you kings, and gave you what He had not given to any other among the Alameen \n    (mankind and jinns, in the past)\u2019\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:20].\u00a0\n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Here Allah, may He be exalted, reminds them of previous \n    blessings that He bestowed upon their fathers and forebears, and the favour \n    He bestowed upon them by sending the Messengers from among them, revealing \n    the Books to them and favouring them above all other nations at that time. \n    End quote.\n\n    Tafseer al-Qur\u2019an al-\u2018Azeem, \n    1/255\u00a0\n\n    However, we regard our current situation with optimism that \n    motivates us to advance further and succeed by striving harder to use all \n    possible means, both spiritual and worldly. The foundation of that is the \n    righteous individual who always remembers that Allah, may He be glorified \n    and exalted, is watching him in all situations. Such individuals are a \n    constructive factor in the reform of communities and families; they do not \n    wait for the revival to be presented to them on a golden platter or hope \n    that programs will be set up for them to achieve that. Rather they hasten to \n    take the initiative and strive hard to do all that is good and beneficial, \n    putting their trust in Allah in the hope that He will bless their deeds, no \n    matter how small, and reward those who do good for their good deeds. Allah, \n    may He be exalted, knows who is trying to spread mischief and who is \n    striving to do good, and the followers of His Messengers will prevail and be \n    victorious if they take the measures that lead to victory and advancement. \n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \n\n    \u201cIndeed, they planned their plot, and their plot was with \n    Allah, though their plot was a great (one, still) it would never be able to \n    remove the mountains (real mountains or the Islamic law) from their places \n    (as it is of no importance).\n\n    So think not that Allah will fail to keep His Promise to \n    His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is All-Mighty, - All-Able of Retribution\u201d\n\n    [Ibraaheem 14:46-47].\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "She is asking about the best book on the stories of the Prophets",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, you will find the truest, most beautiful and most trustworthy of stories, because it is the word of Allah, may He be exalted, which illuminated the world with its lessons and rulings. Reading the stories of the Messengers and Prophets in the verses of the Qur\u2019aan is one of the greatest ways of bringing benefits and good to the Muslim, let alone the immense reward that is attained by the one who ponders the Book of Allah, may He be exalted. Hence we advise you to be keen to pursue this way of goodness, for the Muslim can never do without the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, no matter what other books he reads.\nWith regard to the books of the scholars about the stories of the Prophets, the best of them \u2013 as it appears to us \u2013 are the following:\n1.\nQasas al-Anbiya\u2019 (Stories of the Prophets) by al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) (d. 774 AH). This is perhaps the best of the books of the early scholars on this topic, as it is distinguished by compiling all of the verses having to do with the story of each Prophet in one place, and making connections between them by commenting on them and quoting hadeeths and reports that have to do with them. It is an encyclopaedic and well organised book that discusses the lives of the Prophets, although it quotes rather too many reports that are not proven and some reports from Jewish sources (Israa\u2019eeliyyaat). However for the most part he points out the origin of these reports, and he states that he only quotes for the purpose of studying them and highlighting their status. So we recommend you to read this book and study it. The one who wants to study these stories with the best annotation should read the book al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah (Dar Hajar edn., published under the supervision of Dr. \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abd al-Muhsin at-Turki), because Qasas al-Anbiya\u2019 is taken from the first chapters of al-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah.\n2.\nal-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah min Akhbaar wa Qasas al-Anbiya\u2019 (The saheeh hadeeths that speak of the lives and stories of the Prophets) was compiled and their isnaads evaluated by Ibraaheem Muhammad al-\u2018Ali (publ. by Dar al-Qalam in Damascus and Dar ash-Shaamiyyah in Beirut, 276 pages). It is a very useful book that is distinguished by the fact that it includes many hadeeths that speak of the stories of the Messengers and Prophets, and the material is organised with comments in a manner that complements these stories. The author (may Allah have mercy on him) put a great deal of effort into selecting saheeh and hasan hadeeths and reports, and avoiding weak and fabricated material. This may be the best contemporary book on this topic.\n3.\nQasas al-Anbiya\u2019 by al-\u2018Allaamah \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa\u2018di (d. 1376 AH). This is a short book that is taken from his book Tayseer al-Lateef al-Mannaan fi Khilaasat Tafseer al-Qur\u2019an, in which he recounts the stories of the Prophets as they were narrated in the Holy Qur\u2019aan, in sequence, and he follows each story with a brief discussion of what we learn from it.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is it proven that \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) wrote a letter to the Nile in Egypt so that its water would flow by Allah\u2019s leave?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Ibn \n    Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    It was \n    narrated to us via Ibn Luhay\u2018ah from Qays ibn al-Hajjaj from someone who \n    told him: When Egypt was conquered, its people came to \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018As (may \n    Allah be pleased with him) and said to him: O Ameer, this Nile of ours is \n    used to something and cannot flow unless it is done. He said: What is that? \n    They said: On the twelfth night of this month, we take a young girl from her \n    parents, and we placate her parents, then we dress her in jewellery and the \n    finest garments there can be, then we throw her into this Nile.\u00a0\n\n    \u2018Amr (may \n    Allah be pleased with him) said to them: This is something that cannot \n    happen in Islam; Islam erases that which came before it (of bad customs).\u00a0\n\n    So they \n    stayed for a while, during which the Nile did not flow at all, neither a \n    little nor a lot, until they thought of leaving. Then \u2018Amr (may Allah be \n    pleased with him) wrote to \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with \n    him), telling him about this. He wrote to him, saying: You did the right \n    thing. I am sending you a piece of paper with my letter; throw it into the \n    Nile.\u00a0\n\n    When his \n    letter came, \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) took the piece of paper on \n    which was written:\u00a0\n\n    \u201cFrom the \n    slave of Allah \u2018Umar, Ameer al-Mumineen, to the Nile of the people of Egypt.\n\n    To \n    proceed: If you only flow on your own initiative, then do not flow, for we \n    have no need of you. But if you only flow on the command of Allah, the One, \n    the Subduer, and He is the One Who causes you to flow, then we ask Allah, \n    may He be exalted, to make you flow.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    He threw \n    the paper in the Nile and by Saturday morning, Allah had caused the Nile to \n    flow (to a depth or width of) sixteen cubits in one night, and Allah put an \n    end to this particular custom of the people of Egypt until today.\n\n    End quote \n    from al-Bidayah wa\u2019n-Nihayah, 7/114-115\u00a0\n\n    Similar \n    reports were also narrated by Ibn \u2018Abd al-Hakam in Futooh Misr, p. 165; \n    al-Lalkai in Sharh I\u2018tiqad Ahl as-Sunnah, 6/463; Ibn \u2018Asakir in Tareekh \n    Dimashq, 44/336; Abu\u2019sh-Shaykh in al-\u2018Azamah, 4/1424, via Ibn Luhay\u2018ah.\u00a0\n\n    This is a \n    da\u2018eef isnad (weak chain of narration) that is not saheeh, and this report \n    cannot be proven with such an isnad. Ibn Luhay\u2018ah \u2013 whose full name was \n    \u2018Abdullah ibn Luhay\u2018ah ibn \u2018Uqbah \u2013 is da \u2018eef as he used to get mixed up, \n    and in addition to that he is mudallis (one \n    who \n    narrates from someone he met something he did not hear). \n    See at-Tahdheeb, 5/327-33; Mizan al-I\u2018tidaal, 2/475-484\u00a0\n\n    Qays ibn \n    al-Hajjaj is sadooq (trustworthy), from the sixth level of hadeeth narrators \n    (tabaqah) according to al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar; they are the ones who it is not \n    proven that they met any of the Sahabah/Companions (may Allah be pleased \n    with them). See: Taqreeb at-Tahdheeb, 1/25\u00a0\n\n    Sometimes \n    he narrated it as a mursal (the \n    link between the Successor and the Prophet is missing) \n    report and \n    sometimes he narrated it from the one who told him, but the one who told him \n    is majhool and not known.\u00a0\n\n    So the \n    report is da\u2018eef (weak) and is not saheeh (sound)\u00a0\n\n    If this \n    story were true, everyone would know about it and it would be well known, \n    and it would have been widely narrated through confirmed isnads, because it \n    is an important and significant event, the like of which should not be \n    ignored; rather an incident less significant than this would not be \n    overlooked by historians and narrators.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah \n    knows best."

        "question": "Discussion of numerical miracles in the Qur\u2019aan and use of the solar calendar",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    Many people are infatuated by the different types of miracles \n    in the Qur\u2019aan, including the \u201cnumerical miracles\u201d. In newspapers and \n    magazines and on the internet they publish lists of words that are repeated \n    a number of times that corresponds to their structure, and words that are \n    repeated the same number of times as their opposites. They also claim that \n    the word yawm (day) is repeated 365 times and the word shahr (month) is \n    repeated 12 times, and they do this with other words too, such as \n    al-malaa\u2019ikah (angels) and al-shayaateen (devils), and al-dunya (this world) \n    and al-aakhirah (the Hereafter), etc. \u00a0\n\n    Many people think that these numbers are true and that this \n    is one of the miracles of the Qur\u2019aan, but they do not distinguish between \n    subtleties and miracles. Writing a book which contains a specific number of \n    certain words is something that anyone can do; what is so miraculous about \n    that? The miracle that appears in the Book of Allaah is not like these \n    subtleties, rather it is far deeper and greater than that. It is the fact \n    that the most eloquent and well-spoken of the Arabs could not produce \n    anything like the Qur\u2019aan, or ten soorahs of it, or even one soorah. It is \n    not like these subtleties that any writer could produce in any book that he \n    writes, or more. \u00a0\n\n    It should be noted that some people have taken this beyond \n    mere statistics. Some of them have used these numbers to foretell when the \n    state of Israel will fall, and others have used them to say when the Day of \n    Judgement will be. One of the latest fabrications against the Book of Allaah \n    is that which they have published saying that the Qur\u2019aan foretold the \n    explosions in the towers in New York! Based on the number of the verse in \n    al-Tawbah, and the number of the soorah and juz\u2019. All of that is toying with \n    the Book of Allaah which is caused by ignorance of the true nature of the \n    miracle of the Book of Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    By examining the statistics presented by those who have \n    published these numbers, we find that they did not get the numbers of some \n    phrases right, and some of them have been selective in the way they counted \n    the words, and that is so that they might reach the conclusion they want and \n    that they think is in the Book of Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Dr. Khaalid al-Sabt said: \u00a0\n\n    Dr. Ashraf \u2018Abd al-Razzaaq Qatanah presented a \u201cstudy of the \n    numerical miracles in the Holy Qur\u2019aan\u201d which he published in a book \n    entitled: \u201cThe Qur\u2019aan and the Numerical Miracles, a critical study of the \n    numerical miracles of the Holy Qur\u2019aan.\u201d In the conclusion to this book he \n    reviews three other books: (1) I\u2019jaaz al-Raqm 19 (The miracle of the \n    number 19) by Baasim Jaraar; (2) al-I\u2019jaaz al-\u2018Adadi fi\u2019l-Qur\u2019aan \n    (the numerical miracle in the Qur\u2019aan) by \u2018Abd al-Razzaaq Nawfal; and (3) \n    al-Mu\u2019jizah (the miracle) by \u2018Adnaan al-Rifaa\u2019i. The author reached a \n    conclusion which he describes as follows:\u00a0\n\n    As the result of my study I reached the idea that the \n    \u201cnumerical miracle\u201d as presented in these books is not real at all, and \n    these books are based on conditions that are sometimes selective , in order \n    to prove the validity of this view in a way that will make the reader accept \n    these preconceived results referred to above.\u00a0 These selective conditions \n    sometimes lead the author to go against that which is proven according to \n    the consensus of the ummah, such as going against the spelling of the \n    \u2018Uthmaani Mus-haf, which is not permissible at all; or adopting the spelling \n    of some words which appears in some Mus-hafs and without paying attention to \n    the spellings in other Mus-hafs. It also goes against basic principles of \n    the Arabic language with regard to synonyms and antonyms.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n    p. 197, Damascus, Manaar li\u2019l-Nashr wa\u2019l-Tawzee\u2019, first \n    edition, 1420 AH/1999 CE.\u00a0\n\n    Dr. Fahd al-Roomi said something similar about the selective \n    way in which Dr \u2018Abd al-Razzaaq Nawfal chose words in order to reach this \n    numerical balance, such as when he said: The word yawm (day) is mentioned \n    365 times in the Qur\u2019aan, the number of days in a year. In order to prove \n    this he counted the words \u201cal-yawm\u201d and \u201cyawman\u201d but he \n    ignored words such as \u201cyawmukum\u201d (your day) and \u201cyawmuhum\u201d \n    (their day) and yawma\u2019idhin (on that day), because if he had done \n    that, he would have got a different number. The same applies to the word \n    al-isti\u2019aadhah which refers to seeking refuge from the shaytaan. He says \n    that it is repeated 11 times, but he includes in that the words \u201ca\u2019oodhu\u201d \n    (I seek refuge) and \u201cfasta\u2019idh\u201d (seek refuge) but not \u201c \u2018udhtu\u201d \n    (I sought refuge) or \u201cya\u2019oodhoona\u201d (they seek refuge) or \u201cu\u2019eedhuha\u201d \n    (I seek refuge for her) or \u201cma\u2019aadh Allaah\u201d (Allaah forbid).\u00a0\n\n    See: Ittijaahaat al-Tafseer fi\u2019l-Qarn al-Raabi\u2019 \u2018Ashara \n    (2/699, 700), Beirut, Mu\u2019sasat al-Risaalah, second edition, 1414 AH.\u00a0\n\n    From this well-founded discussion, the answer to the issue of \n    the word \u201cyawm\u201d and the number of times it appears in the Qur\u2019aan, which is \n    mentioned in the question, is clear.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the count (of time) (al-hisaab, mentioned in \n    Yoonus 10:5) that Allaah has mentioned in His holy Book, it is the precise \n    count (of time) that does not differ as the years pass, which is the lunar \n    count (of time).\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd they stayed in their Cave three hundred years, adding \n    nine\u201d\n\n    [al-Kahf 18:25], \u00a0\n\n    some of the scholars have stated that the number 300 refers \n    to solar years, and that the number 309 refers to lunar years. This view was \n    refuted by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen, who explained in his \n    refutation that the count (of time) with Allaah is lunar, not solar.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    \u201cadding nine\u201d means that they added nine years to \n    three hundred, so they stayed there for three hundred and nine years. It may \n    be said: Why doesn\u2019t it just say three hundred and nine?\u00a0\n\n    The answer is that this is what is meant, but the Qur\u2019aan is \n    the most eloquent of books, and in order for the ends of the verses to match \n    (in Arabic) it says: \u201cAnd they stayed in their Cave three hundred (solar) \n    years, adding nine (for lunar years)\u201d. It is not as some people think, \n    that the three hundred refers to solar years and the nine was added for \n    lunar years, because we cannot testify that Allaah meant that. Who can \n    testify that this is what Allaah meant? Even if it so happens that three \n    hundred solar years are equal to three hundred and nine lunar years, we \n    cannot testify about Allaah in this way, because the count (of time)\u00a0 with \n    Allaah is one.\u00a0\n\n    What are the signs by which the count (of time) is reckoned \n    with Allaah?\u00a0\n\n    The answer is that they are the new moons; hence we say that \n    the view that \u201cthree hundred years\u201d refers to solar years and \u201cadding nine\u201d \n    refers to lunar years, is a weak view.\u00a0\n\n    Firstly: because we cannot testify that Allaah meant this.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly: because the number of months and years with Allaah \n    is based on the new moons. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cIt is He Who made the sun to be a shining glory and the \n    moon to be a light (of beauty), and measured out stages for it; that ye \n    might know the number of years and the count (of time)\u201d\n\n    [Yoonus 10:5]\u00a0\n\n    \u201cThey ask you (O Muhammad (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the new \n    moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and \n    for the pilgrimage\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:189]\n\n    Tafseer Soorat al-Kahf.\u00a0\n\n    Reckoning time by the moon and the new moons was well known \n    to the Prophets and their peoples, and reckoning time by the sun was only \n    known to the ignorant followers of false religions, but unfortunately many \n    Muslims follow them nowadays.\u00a0\n\n    Dr Khaalid al-Sabt says, in his refutation of those who say \n    that the verse \u201cThe building which they built\u201d \n    [al-Tawbah 9:11] in al-Tawbah refers to the \n    explosions in America:\u00a0\n\n    5 (the fifth point) \u2013 These connections are based on the \n    solar calendar, which is a calendar that was inherited from idolatrous \n    nations, and which was of no significance to the Prophets (blessing and \n    peace be upon them). Rather the calendar that counts in sharee\u2019ah is the \n    calendar that is based on the moon and new moons, which is more precise.\u00a0 \n    This indicates that what was known to the Prophets was the lunar calendar. \n    In the hadeeth of Waathilah ibn al-Asqa\u2019 (may Allaah be pleased with him) it \n    says that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cThe Suhuf of Ibraaheem were revealed to him on the first night of Ramadaan, \n    and the Tawrat (Torah) was revealed on the sixth of Ramadaan, and the Injeel \n    (Gospel) on the thirteenth of Ramadaan, and the Furqaan (Qur\u2019aan) was \n    revealed on the twenty-fourth of Ramadaan.\u201d Narrated by Ahmad (4/107) and by \n    al-Bayhaqi in al-Sunan (9/188). Its isnaad is hasan. It was also \n    mentioned by al-Albaani in al-Saheehah (1575). This could not be \n    known unless the calendar was based on the moon and new moons. This is also \n    indicated by the hadeeth which was narrated in al-Saheehayn from Ibn \n    \u2018Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: When the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah, he found the \n    Jews fasting on the day of \u2018Ashoora\u2019. He said: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d They said: \n    This is a good day, this is the day on which Allaah saved the Children of \n    Israel from their enemies. So Moosa fasted on that day \u2026 Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari (2004) and Muslim (1130). And al-Haafiz (may Allaah have mercy \n    on him) stated clearly that they did not base their count (of time) on the \n    sun. See: al-Fath (4/291 and 7/323).\u00a0\n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting \n    on the verses \u201cIt is He Who made the sun a shining \n    thing and the moon as a light and measured out for it stages\u201d [Yoonus 10:5]\n    and \u201cAnd the moon, We \n    have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old \n    dried curved date stalk\u201d [Yaa Seen 36:38, 39]: \n    Hence the lunar calendar was better known among the nations and was less \n    likely to involve errors, and it is more precise than the solar calendar, \n    and all people can follow it easily. Hence Allaah says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \u201cand measured out for it stages that \n    you might know the number of years and the reckoning\u201d [Yoonus 10:5]. \n    But He did not say that about the sun, hence the months of Hajj, fasting, \n    Eid and other Islamic occasions are based on the lunar calendar. This is by \n    the wisdom of Allaah and His mercy, and so as to protect His religion, as \n    the people may all be able to figure out this count of time easily and avoid \n    mistakes, and so that no differences or confusion would happen to the \n    religion as happened to the people of the Book. \u00a0\n\n    End quote from Miftaah Daar al-Sa\u2019aadah, p. 538, 539.\u00a0\n\n    It may be understood from the last comment of Ibn al-Qayyim \n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) that the people of the Book used to follow a \n    solar calendar, and this was stated clearly by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) in his response after he attributed this view to \n    Ibn al-Qayyim. See al-Fath (7/323).\u00a0\n\n    But in fact it played no role in their religion, rather it \n    was introduced after that by the ignorant among them. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Concerning the things we learn from the verse \u201cThey ask \n    you (O Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the \n    new moons\u2026\u201d, Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \n    \u00a0\n\n    \u2026 and we learn that the fixed periods of time for all nations \n    are the fixed periods of time that were established by Allaah for them \u2013 \n    which are the new moons \u2013 so these are global fixed periods of time, because \n    Allaah says \u201cfixed periods of time for mankind\u201d. As for what has \n    happened recently, namely the adoption of the European calendar, there it \n    has no tangible basis and it makes no sense and is not prescribed in \n    sharee\u2019ah. Hence you find that one month has twenty-eight days and some have \n    thirty days and some have thirty one, without any known reason for this \n    discrepancy. Moreover these months have no physical sign that the people can \n    refer to in order to work out time, unlike the lunar months which have a \n    physical sign that is known to everyone. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Tafseer al-Baqarah (2/371). \u00a0\n\n    Al-Qurtubi said, commenting on the verse \u201cVerily, the \n    number of months with Allaah is twelve months (in a year), so was it \n    ordained by Allaah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth\u201d \n    [al-Tawbah 9:36]: This verse indicates that rulings on acts of worship \n    and other matters must be connected to the months and years that were known \n    to the Arabs, and not those that were used by the Persians, Byzantines or \n    Copts, and they should not be more than twelve months, because they vary in \n    the number of days; some of them being thirty days and some of them being \n    more or less. But the months of the Arabs never exceed thirty days, although \n    some of them may be less; the ones that are less are not any specific \n    months, rather that varies according to variations in the moon\u2019s movement \n    through the sky.

        "question": "Where Did Prophet Adam Land on Earth?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Where did Prophet Adam land on earth?\nWhat is proven definitively in the Noble Quran is that Adam and Hawwa\u2019 (peace be upon them) came down from Paradise to earth after they ate from the tree.\u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThen the Shaytan (Satan) made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: `Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.\u2019\u201d [Al-Baqarah 2:36]\nWith regard to the place where they came down on earth, the Quran does not say anything about it, and there is no authentic, marfu` hadith in the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which explains that, although there are some weak hadiths, such as the hadith that says: \u201cAdam came down in India and felt lonely\u2026\u201d. This was narrated by Ibn `Asakir in Tarikh Dimashq (7/437) and classed as weak by Shaykh Al-Albani in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah, no. 403. There are also other hadiths which speak of this matter, but their isnads are very weak.\u00a0\nThe only sahih reports about this matter are the words of some of the Salaf, most of which are taken from the knowledge of the people of the Book which were transmitted during their time. Such reports cannot be relied upon or trusted, and it is not permissible to believe in what they mention of things concerning which our religion is silent. Rather they may be narrated for the purpose of story-telling only.\u00a0\nScholarly opinions concerning where Prophet Adam landed on earth\nDespite that, the scholarly opinions concerning this matter differ.\u00a0\n\nSome of them said: Adam came down in India and Hawwa\u2019 came down in Jeddah.\u00a0\nSome of them said that they both came down in India.\u00a0\nSome of them said that Adam came down in a land between Makkah and At-Ta\u2019if called Dahna.\u00a0\nSome of them said that Adam came down on As-Safa and Hawwa\u2019 came down on Al-Marwah.\u00a0\n\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\u201cAs-Suddi said: Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cGet you down, all\u201d [Al-Baqarah 2:36]. So they came down; Adam came down in India and the Black Stone and a handful of leaves from Paradise came down with him, and he scattered them in India, and a perfume tree grew, which is the origin of what comes from India of perfume from the handful of leaves that Adam brought down. Adam only took them because of his sorrow at leaving Paradise when he was expelled from it.\u00a0\n`Imran ibn `Uyaynah said, (narrating) from `Ata\u2019 ibn As-Sa`ib, from Sa`id ibn Jubayr, from Ibn `Abbas, who said: Adam came down from Paradise in Dahna, in the land of India. \u00a0\nIbn Abi Hatim said: Abu Zar`ah told us: Uthman ibn Abi Shaybah told us: Jarir told us: from `Ata\u2019, from Sa`id, from Ibn `Abbas who said: Adam (peace be upon him) came down in a land called Dahna, between Makkah and At-Ta\u2019if.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that al-Hasan Al-Basri said: Adam came down in India and Hawwa\u2019 in Jeddah, and Iblis in Dastumisan a few miles from Basrah, and the serpent came down in Asbahan. This was narrated by Ibn Abi Hatim. \u00a0\nIbn Abi Hatim said: Muhamamd ibn `Ammar ibn Al-Harith told us: Muhammad ibn Sa`id ibn Sabiq told us: `Amr ibn Abi Qays told us, from Ibn `Adiyy, from Ibn `Umar, who said: Adam came down on As-Safa and Hawwa\u2019 on Al-Marwah.\u201d (Tafsir Al-Quran Al-`Azim, 1/237)\u00a0\nBut all of these are words for which there is no evidence.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      There is no proof in the books of Sunnah and reports with \n      an uninterrupted, saheeh isnaad, to suggest that there was any earthquake \n      in Madeenah at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n      upon him). The only reports that speak of that have da\u2018eef, mursal isnaads \n      (i.e., they are weak). There follows further explanation:\u00a0\n\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan \n    said: The ground shook at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) and he put his hand on it then he said: \u201cBe \n    still, for it is not yet time for that.\u201d Then he turned to face his \n    Companions and said: \u201cYour Lord is asking you to seek forgiveness, so seek \n    forgiveness.\u201d Narrated by Ibn Abi\u2019l-Dunya in al-\u2018Uqoobaat (no. 18). : \n    \u2018Abd-Allaah told us, \u2018Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem told me, Abu Maryam \n    informed us, al-\u2018Attaar ibn Khaalid al-Harami informed us, Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd \n    al-Malik ibn Marwaan told me.\u00a0\n\n    This isnaad is da\u2018eef (weak) and has a number of faults, \n    including:\u00a0\n\n    1.\n\n    It is a mu\u2018dal mursal report. Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Malik ibn \n    Marwaan died in 266 AH, so how he could tell of something that happened at \n    the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which no \n    one else narrated?\u00a0\n\n    2.\n\n    al-\u2018Attaar ibn Khaalid al-Harami - I did not find any \n    biography of him.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Shahr ibn Hawshab said: \u201cThere was an \n    earthquake in Madeenah at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of \n    Allah be upon him) and he said: \u201cYour Lord is asking you to seek \n    forgiveness, so seek forgiveness.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (2/357). He \n    said: Hafs told us, from Layth, from Shahr.\u00a0\n\n    This isnaad is da\u2018eef and has a number of faults:\u00a0\n\n    1.\n\n    It is mursal. Shahr ibn Hawshab died in 112 AH, and did not \n    witness the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\u00a0\n\n    2.\n\n    Moreover he (Shahr ibn Hawshab) is da\u2018eef (weak) in and of \n    himself, according to some scholars. Shu\u2018bah said: I do not pay any \n    attention to his reports. Al-Nasaa\u2019i said: He is not strong. Ibn Hibbaan \n    said: He is one of those who narrated from trustworthy narrators problematic \n    reports. al-Bayhaqi said: He is da\u2018eef. Others regarded him as trustworthy. \n    Hence al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said concerning him: He is sadooq but he narrates \n    many mursal reports and is confused. See Tahdheeb al-Tahdheeb, 4/371\u00a0\n\n    3.\n\n    Layth ibn Abi Sulaym - he is confused a great deal and we \n    cannot be certain about his hadeeth, so he was rejected. See Tahdheeb \n    al-Tahdheeb, 8/468\u00a0\n\n    Hence al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhees al-Habeer \n    (2/222): This is mursal da\u2018eef. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    This report was also narrated from Ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be \n    pleased with him), as reported in Tafseer al-Tabari (17/478): Bishr \n    narrated to us, Yazeed narrated to us, Sa\u2018eed narrated to us, from Qataadah, \n    that he said: \u201cAnd We sent not the signs except to warn, and to make them \n    afraid (of destruction)\u201d [al-Isra\u201917:59]. Allah causes people to fear Him by \n    whatever signs He wills, so that they might learn a lesson or be reminded or \n    come back (to Him). It was said to us that the ground shook in Kufah at the \n    time of Ibn Mas\u2018ood, and he said: O people, your Lord is asking you to seek \n    forgiveness, so seek forgiveness. \u00a0\n\n    To sum up, there is no proof that an earthquake took place at \n    the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); rather \n    it happened after his time, at the time of \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah \n    be pleased with him). That was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf \n    (2/358) and by others from Naafi\u2018 from Safiyyah who said: The earth shook at \n    the time of \u2018Umar, and he addressed the people and said: \u201cIf it happens \n    again, I shall definitely abandon you and leave.\u201d That was mentioned by Ibn \n    al-Jawzi in al-Muntazam, among the events of the year 20 AH.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is there anything in the Qur\u2019aan or Sunnah about global warming?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The problem of global warming is regarded as one of the most serious environmental problems of our time, concerning which experts have held many conferences and published many articles about its dire consequences. These experts attribute this rise in temperature to the accumulation of gases in the atmosphere that is caused by factories, power stations and car emissions, which has led to a rise in air temperature and ocean temperature, which threatens to melt the ice-caps and cause flooding of land, which is expected to change the features of some countries completely and to change the climate of vast areas on earth. \u00a0\nWe could not find anything about this in the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah, apart from one hadeeth which some scholars who are specialized in sharee\u2019ah and environmental sciences say has to do with this topic, and some of the most prominent specialists in the world agreed with them, which is that the Arabian Peninsula will again become meadows and rivers. They attribute that to a complete change in the earth\u2019s climate and the melting of the Arctic ice cap due to global warming.\u00a0\nWhat we think is that Arabia becoming meadows and rivers again is something concerning which there is no doubt, but we cannot be certain that it will happen because of the melting of the ice cap, because that is known only to Allaah. But we mention this view because it is relevant and because it has been said by some specialists, both Muslims and kaafirs.\u00a0\nThe hadeeth is:\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe Hour will not begin until the land of the Arabs once again becomes meadows and rivers.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (157). Meadows refers to spacious land with a great deal of vegetation.\u00a0\n1.\nDr. Zaghloul al-Najjaar says:\u00a0\nThis hadeeth is a scientific miracle that describes a natural fact that was not understood by scientists until the late twentieth century, when it was proven by definitive evidence that the Arabian Peninsula was meadows and rivers in ancient times. Climate studies have also indicated that the arid desert is now on its way to becoming meadows and rivers again, because the earth throughout its long history passes through climatic changes that take place gradually over long periods of time, or they may be sudden and swift.\u00a0\nClimate studies indicate that we are coming into a new rainy period, the evidence of which is the shift of the ice-cap in the northern hemisphere towards the south, and a noticeable fall in winter temperatures.\u00a0\nThe fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) referred to this ice age in his hadeeth \u201cuntil the land of the Arabs once again becomes meadows and rivers\u201d is proof of his Prophethood, and shows that he was always connected to divine revelation, and was taught by the Creator of the heavens and the earth. End quote.\u00a0\nSee:  https://bit.ly/2J76pX9\n2.\nShaykh \u2018Abd al-Majeed al-Zandaani said:\u00a0\nProfessor Alfred Kroner, one of the most famous geologists in the world, attended a geological conference in the College of Earth Sciences in the King \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez University. I said to him: Do you have any proof that Arabia was once gardens and rivers? He said: Yes, this is well known to us and it is a scientific fact. Geologists know this because if you dig in any area you will find signs that tell you that this land used to be meadows and rivers. There is a lot of evidence.\nI said to him: Do you have any evidence that Arabia will once again become meadows and rivers? He said: This is something real and proven. We geologists know it and measure it and calculate it. We can say approximately when it will happen, and it is not far off, it is quite close. I said: Why? He said: Because we have studied the history of the earth in the past, and we have found that it passes through many stages, one of which is the ice ages. What does ice age mean? It means that a certain amount of sea water turns into ice and collects at the North Pole, then it begins to shift towards the south, and when it shifts towards the south it covers whatever is beneath it, and the climate on earth changes. Among the climatic changes is the change that takes place in Arabia, where the weather becomes cold and Arabia becomes one of the lands which has the most rain and rivers on earth.\nI said: Can you confirm that for us? \u00a0\nHe said: Yes, this is an undeniable fact.\u00a0\nI said to him: Listen, who told Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of that? This is all mentioned in a hadeeth that was narrated by Muslim; he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe Hour will not begin until the land of the Arabs once again becomes meadows and rivers.\u201d Who told Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that Arabia was once meadows and rivers? He thought, then he said: The Romans. I said to him: And who told him that Arabia would once again become meadows and rivers? He thought for a moment and said: The One Who is above! Then I said to him: Write it down. So he wrote in his own hand: I am astonished at the scientific facts that I have seen in the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah, which we could not prove until recently by modern scientific methods. This indicates that the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not attain this knowledge except by revelation from above.\u00a0\nBy Allaah, I spent only two and a half hours with this German until he said all of that. This giant among scientists wrote that and approved of it, which indicates that there is one science, one truth, One God. \u00a0\nEnd quote from https://bit.ly/2xZKfUp\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.History of the Green Dome\u00a0\nThe dome over the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dates back to the seventh century AH. It was built during the reign of Sultan Qalawun, and at first it was the colour of wood, then it became white, then blue, then green, and it has remained green until the present.\u00a0\nProfessor \u2018Ali Hafiz (may Allah preserve him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cThere was no dome over the sacred chamber. There was in the roof of the mosque above the chamber a waist-high enclosure of brick to distinguish the location of the chamber from the rest of the mosque\u2019s roof.\u00a0\nSultaan Qalawun al-Salihi was the first one to build a dome over the chamber. He did that in 678 AH. It was square at the bottom and octagonal at the top, made of wood, and built on top of the pillars that surrounded the chamber. Planks of wood were nailed to it, over which plates of lead were placed, and the brick enclosure was replaced with one made of wood.\u00a0\nThe dome was refurbished at the time of al-Nasir Hasan ibn Muhammad Qalawun, then the leaden plates slipped, but they were fixed and refurbished at the time of al-Ashraf Sha\u2019ban ibn Husayn ibn Muhammad in 765 AH. It fell into disrepair and was renovated at the time of Sultan Qayit Bey in 881 AH.\u00a0\nThe chamber and dome were burned in the fire that swept through the Prophet\u2019s mosque in 886 AH. During the reign of Sultan Qayit Bey the dome was rebuilt, in 887 AH, and strong pillars to support it were built in the floor of the mosque, and they were built of bricks to the correct height. After the dome had been built in the manner described above, cracks appeared in its upper part.\u00a0 When it proved impossible to refurbish it,\u00a0 the Sultan Qayit Bey ordered that the upper part be demolished and rebuilt strongly using white plaster. So it was built solidly in 892 AH.\u00a0\nIn 1253 AH, an order was issued by the Ottoman Sultan \u2018Abd al-Hamid to paint the dome green. He was the first one to colour it green, and the colour has been renewed whenever necessary until the present.\u00a0\nIt became known as the green dome after it was painted green. It was previously known as the white dome or the fragrant dome or the blue dome.\u201d (Fusul min Tarikh al-Madinah al-Munawwarah by \u2018Ali Hafiz (p. 127, 128)\nThe ruling on building the Green Dome\nThe scholars, both in the past and in modern times, criticized the building of this dome and its being given a colour. All of that is because of what they know of shari\u2019ah closing many doors for fear of falling into shirk.\u00a0\nThese scholars include the following:\u00a0\n\nAl-San\u2019ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ta-thir al-I\u2019tiqad:\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you say: A great dome has been built over the grave of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), costing a great deal of money, I say: This is in fact great ignorance of the situation, because this dome was not built by him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or by his Companions or by those who followed them, or by those who followed the Tabi'in, or by the scholars and imams of the ummah. Rather this dome was built over his grave (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the orders of one of the later kings of Egypt, namely the Sultan Qalawun al-Salihi who is known as King Mansur, in 678 AH, and was mentioned in Tahqiq al-Nasrah bi Talkhis Ma\u2019alim Dar al-Hijrah. These are things that were done on the orders of the state and not on the basis of shar\u2019i evidence.\u201d\n\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:\u00a0\n\nThere are those who take the building of the green dome over the Prophet\u2019s grave in the Prophet\u2019s Mosque as evidence that it is permissible to build domes over other graves, such as those of the righteous and others. Is this argument correct or what should our response to them be?\u00a0\nThey replied:\u00a0\n\u201cIt is not correct to quote the fact that people built a dome over the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as evidence that it is permissible to build domes over the graves of the righteous dead and others, because those people\u2019s building a dome over his grave (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was haram and those who did it sinned thereby, because they went against what is proven in a report from Abu\u2019l-Hayyaj al-Asadi who said: \u2018Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said to me: Shall I not send you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any image without erasing it or any high grave without levelling it.\u00a0\nAnd it was narrated that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade plastering over graves, or sitting on them or building over them. Both reports were narrated by Muslim in his Sahih. So it is not correct for anyone to quote the haram action of some people as evidence that it is permissible to do similar haram actions, because it is not permissible to go against the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by citing the words or actions of anyone else. And because he is the one who conveyed the command from Allah, and he is the one who is to be obeyed, and we must beware of going against his commands, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd whatsoever the Messenger ((peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)\u201d [al-Hashr 59:7].\u00a0\nAnd there are other verses which enjoin obedience to Allah and to His Messenger. And because building up graves and erecting domes over them are means that lead to associating their occupants with Allah, and the means that lead to shirk must be blocked.\u201d (Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh \u2018Abd al-Razzaq \u2018Afifi, Shaykh \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Qa\u2019ud. Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (9/83, 84)\u00a0\n\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee also said:\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is no proof in the fact that a dome was set up over the Prophet\u2019s grave for those who take it as an excuse for building domes of the graves of the awliya (\u201csaints\u201d) and righteous people, because the building of a dome over his grave was not done on his instructions and was not done by any of his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), or by the Tabi'in, or by any of the imams of guidance in the early generations whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) testified were good. Rather it was done by people of bid\u2019ah (innovation). It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.\u201d And it was proven that \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said to Abu\u2019l-Hayyaj: Shall I not send you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any image without erasing it or any high grave without levelling it. Narrated by Muslim. As it is not proven that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) built a dome over his grave, and it is not proven from any of the leading imams; rather what is proven shows that to be an invalid action, and no Muslim should feel any attachment to the action of innovators who built a dome over the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\u201d (Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh \u2018Abd al-Razzaq \u2018Afifi, Shaykh \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Ghadyyan, Shaykh \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Qa\u2019ud. Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (2/264, 265)\u00a0\n\nShaykh Shams al-Din al-Afghani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n\u201cAl-\u2018Allamah al-Khajandi (1379 AH) said, discussing the history of the green dome that was built over the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and explaining that it is an innovation that was done by some sultans and ignorant persons who erred and made a mistake, and that it is contrary to the clear sahih hadiths and reflects ignorance of the Sunnah, and that they went to extremes and imitated the Christians who are confused and misguided:\u00a0\nIt should be noted that until the year 678 AH, there was no dome over the chamber which contains the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather it was built by the king al-Zahir al-Mansur Qalawun al-Salihi in that year (678 AH), when this dome was built.\u00a0\nI say: He did that because he had seen in Egypt and Syria the adorned churches of the Christians, so he imitated them out of ignorance of the command and Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as al-Walid imitated them by adorning the mosque, as was mentioned in Wafa al-Wafa.\u00a0\nIt should be noted that undoubtedly this action of Qalawun was contrary to the authentic hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but ignorance is a great calamity and exaggeration in love and veneration is a real disaster, and imitation of foreigners is a fatal disease. We seek refuge with Allah from ignorance and exaggeration and imitation of foreigners.\u201d (Juhud \u2018Ulama al-Hanafiyyah fi Ibtal \u2018Aqaid al-Quburiyyah, 3/1660-1662)\u00a0\nWhy wasn\u2019t the Green Dome demolished?\nThe scholars have explained the Shar\u2019i rulings concerning the building of this dome and its obvious effects on the followers of bid\u2019ah\u2019 who have developed an attachment to this structure and its colour, and they praise and venerate it a great deal in their poetry and writings. Now it is up to the authorities to implement these fatwas, and this is nothing to do with the scholars. \u00a0\nThe reason why it is not demolished is so as to ward off fitnah and for fear that it may lead to chaos among the ordinary people and the ignorant. Unfortunately the ordinary people have only reached this level of veneration towards this dome because of the leadership of misguided scholars and imams of innovation. They are the ones who incite the ordinary people against the land of the Two Holy Sanctuaries and its \u2018aqidah and its manhaj. They are very upset about many actions that are in accordance with shari\u2019ah in our view and contrary to innovation in their view.\u00a0\nWhatever the case, the shar\u2019i ruling is quite clear, and the fact that this dome has not been demolished does not mean that it is permissible to build it or any dome over any grave, no matter what grave it is.\u00a0\nShaykh Salih al-\u2018Usaymi (may Allah preserve him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cThe fact that this dome has remained for eight centuries does not mean that it has become permissible, and being silent about it does not indicate approval of it or that it is permissible. Rather the Muslim authorities should remove it and put it back as it was at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They should remove the dome and the adornments and engravings that are found in the mosques, above all the Prophet\u2019s Mosque, so long as that will not lead to an even greater fitnah. If it would lead to an even greater fitnah, then the ruler should postpone the matter until he finds an opportunity for that.\u201d (Bida\u2019 al-Qubur, Anwa\u2019uha wa ahkamuha, p. 253)\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "How could Yoosuf have \u201cinclined towards\u201d the wife of al-\u2018Azeez when he was chaste?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd indeed she did desire him, and he would have inclined \n    to her desire, had he not seen the evidence of his Lord\u201d\n\n    [Yoosuf 12:24]\nHer desire was to commit \n    sin, but as for Yoosuf (peace be upon him), if he had not see the evidence \n    of his Lord, he would have inclined to her desire \u2013 because of human nature \n    \u2013 but he did not, because of the evidence mentioned.\u00a0\n\n    Because he hadseen seen the evidence of his Lord, he did not \n    incline to her desire.\u00a0\n\n    Abu Haatim said: I used to recite ghareeb al-Qur\u2019aan \n    to Abu \u2018Ubaydah, and when I reached the verse (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \u201cAnd indeed she did desire him, and he would have inclined to \n    her desire\u201d [Yoosuf 12:24], Abu \u2018Ubayd said: This is to be understood as \n    meaning that he saw the proof of his Lord, and so he did not incline to her \n    desire.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Qurtubi, al-Jaami\u2019 li Ahkaam al-Qur\u2019aan, 9/165.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Shanqeeti said in Adwa\u2019 al-Bayaan (3/58):\u00a0\n\n    This may be answered from two angles:\u00a0\n\n    1 \u2013 That what is meant by saying \u201cYoosuf would have inclined \n    to her desire\u201d is that a thought crossed his mind, but the influence of \n    taqwa (piety) deflected that thought. One of them said: this is the natural \n    inclination and the instinctive desire that is restrained by taqwa. There is \n    no sin in that because this is something that is instilled in man and is not \n    under his control. It says in the hadeeth that the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to divide his time equally among his \n    wives and treat them fairly, then he would say: \u201cO Allaah, this is how I \n    divide that over which I have control, so do not take me to task for that \n    which is beyond my control\u201d \u2013 meaning the inclination of the heart. [Abu \n    Dawood, al-Sunan, hadeeth no. 2134.\u00a0\nThis is like the fasting \n    person\u2019s inclination towards cold water and food, while at the same time his \n    taqwa prevents him from drinking or eating whilst he is fasting.\u00a0\n\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cWhoever thinks of an evil action but does not do it, one hasanah will \n    be recorded for him.\u201d [Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, no. \n    6491; Muslim, no. 207]\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 Yoosuf (peace be upon him) did not think of doing \n    anything at all, because he was prevented\u00a0 from doing so because of the \n    proof of his Lord. This view which was favoured by Abu Hasaan and others is \n    more correct according to the rules of the Arabic language.\u00a0\n\n    Then he started to quote the evidence to support the view he \n    favoured. Based on the above, the meaning of the verse \u2013 and Allaah knows \n    best \u2013 is that if Yoosuf (peace be upon him) had not seen the proof of his \n    Lord, he would have inclined towards her desire, but because he had seen the \n    proof of his Lord he did not incline towards her desire and did not think of \n    it at all.

        "question": "Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Wahhaab \u2013 a reformer concerning whom many malicious lies have been told",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.You should note that one of the ways in which Allah deals with His chosen slaves is to test them according to the level of their faith, to show who is sincere and who is not. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAlif-Laam-Meem.\n[These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.]\n2.\u00a0Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: \u2018We believe,\u2019 and will not be tested.\n3.\u00a0And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)\u201d\u00a0[Al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:1-3]\nThose who are most severely tested are the Prophets, then the next best and the next best, as it says in the saheeh hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\u00a0\nIf you study the seerah (biography) of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), you will see that he went through severe tests; he was even accused of being a liar, a sorcerer and a madman; garbage and filth were thrown on his back; he was expelled from Makkah; and his feet bled in al-Taa\u2019if. This was the situation of all the Prophets who were rejected before him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allah have mercy on him) suffered the same as other sincere scholars and daa\u2019iyahs, but in the end the message of truth that he brought prevailed. How could it be otherwise? How could the light of truth be extinguished? Think about this man and how Allah helped him to sow the seeds of Tawheed throughout the Arabian Peninsula and put an end to all kinds of shirk. If this indicates anything, it indicates that he was sincere in his call and made sacrifices for that cause as far as we can tell, and of course his efforts were supported and helped by Allah.\u00a0\nBut the enemies of this call have spared no effort to make false accusations concerning it. They claimed \u2013 falsely \u2013 that the Shaykh claimed to be a prophet, and that he did not respect the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) properly, and that he condemned all the ummah as kaafirs\u2026 and other fabrications and lies that were told about him. Anyone who examines these claims will realize for sure that they are all lies and fabrications. The books of the Shaykh which are widely circulated bear the greatest witness to that, and his followers who answered his call never mentioned anything to that effect. If the matter were as they claim, his followers would have conveyed the same ideas, otherwise they would have been disloyal to him. If you want to know more details about this and to clarify the matter, you should read the book Da\u2019aawa al-Manaawi\u2019een li Da\u2019wah al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Wahhaab by Dr \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez al-\u2018Abd al-Lateef, which will answer all your questions, if Allah wills.\u00a0\nWith regard to calling his followers Wahhaabis, this is just another in a long series of fabrications made up by the enemies of his call, to divert people away from the call of truth and to place a barrier between his call and the people so that the call will not reach them. If you study the story of how al-Tufayl ibn \u2018Amr al-Dawsi (may Allah be pleased with him) became Muslim, you will see the parallels with what happened in the case of Imam Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Wahhaab.\u00a0\nIbn Hishaam narrated in his Seerah (1/394) that al-Tufayl set out towards Makkah, but Quraysh intercepted him at the gates of the city and warned him against listening to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They made him think that he was a sorcerer who could cause division between man and wife\u2026 they kept on at him until he took some cotton and put it in his ears. Then when he saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he thought to himself that he would take out the cotton and listen to him, and if what he said was true then he would accept it from him, and if he what he said was false and abhorrent, he would reject it. When he listened to him, all he could do was become Muslim on the spot.\u00a0\nYes, he became Muslim after putting cotton in his ears. Those who oppose the call of Shaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Wahhaab fabricated lies the same way Quraysh did. Quraysh understood full well that the call of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had the power to reach people\u2019s hearts and minds, so they exaggerated in their lies about the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in an attempt to stop the truth reaching people. Similarly we see that those who speak against Shaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Wahhaab and his followers repeat the same lies that were told against the original call.\u00a0\nYou should \u2013 if you follow the truth \u2013 not pay any attention to these lies and fabrications. You should look for the truth of the matter by reading the books of Shaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd al-Wahhaab, for his books are the greatest proof that these people are lying, praise be to Allah.\u00a0\nThere is another subtle point that should be noted, which is that the Shaykh\u2019s name was Muhammad, the attributive of which is Muhammadi. The word Wahhabi is the attributive derived from al-Wahhaab (the Bestower), who is Allah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cOur Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower [al-Wahhaab]\u201d\u00a0[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:8]\nAs al-Zajjaaj said in Ishtiqaaq Asma\u2019-Allah, p. 126, al-Wahhaab \u201cis the One Who gives a great deal. This form (fa\u2019\u2019aal) in Arabic is indicative of something that is done to a great extent. Allah is al-Wahhaab (the Bestower) Who gives to His slaves one after another.\u201d\u00a0\nUndoubtedly the path of al-Wahhaab is the path of truth in which there is no crookedness or fabrication, and His party is the one that will prevail. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd whosoever takes Allah, His Messenger, and those who have believed, as Protectors, then the party of Allah will be the victorious\u201d\u00a0[Al-Maa\u2019idah 5:56]\u00a0\n\u201cThey are the party of Allah. Verily, it is the party of Allah that will be the successful\u201d\u00a0[Al-Mujaadilah 58:22]\nLong ago they accused al-Shaafa\u2019i of being a Raafidi (Shi\u2019ah) and he refuted them by saying:\n\u201cIf being a Raafidi means loving the family of Muhammad, then let the two races (of mankind and the jinn) bear witness that I am a Raafidi.\u201d\u00a0\nWe refute the claims of those who accuse us of being Wahhabis by quoting the words of Shaykh Mullah \u2018Imraan who was a Shi\u2019i but Allah guided him to the Sunnah. He said:\u00a0\n\u201cIf the follower of Ahmad [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] is a Wahhaabi, then I affirm that I am a Wahhaabi\u00a0\nI reject the association of any other with Allah, for I have no Lord except the Unique, the Bestower (al-Wahhaab)\u00a0\nThose who were called by the Prophet accused him of being a sorcerer and a liar.\u201d\u00a0\n(See: Manhaaj al-Firqat al-Naajiyah by Shaykh Muhammad Jameel Zayno, p. 142-143.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "What Is the Difference Between al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is Al-Masjid al-Aqsa?\nAl-Masjid al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem) was the first of the two qiblahs (prayer direction), and is one of the three mosques to which people may travel for the purpose of worship.\u00a0\nWho built al-Masjid al-Aqsa?\nAnd it was said that Al-Aqsa Mosque was built by Sulayman (peace be upon him), as stated in Sunan al-Nasai (693) and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasai.\u00a0\nIt was said that Al-Aqsa Mosque  \u00a0existed before Sulayman (peace be upon him) and that Sulayman rebuilt it; this is based on the evidence narrated in al-Sahihayn from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: \u201cI said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, which mosque was built on earth first?\u2019 He said, \u2018Al-Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah].\u2019 I said, \u2018Then which?\u2019 He said, \u2018Al-Masjid al-Aqsa.\u2019 I said, \u2018How much time was there between them?\u2019 He said, \u2018Forty years. So wherever you are when the time for prayer comes, pray, for that is the best thing to do.\u2019\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3366; Muslim, 520)\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken on the Night Journey (Isra) to Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), where he led the Prophets in prayer in this blessed mosque.\u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cGlorified (and Exalted) be He (Allah) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him]\nWho took His slave (Muhammad) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in order that We might show him (Muhammad) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.). Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.\u201d [al-Isra 17:1]\nWho built the Dome of the Rock?\nThe Dome of the Rock was built by the caliph \u2018Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in 72 AH.\u00a0\nIt says in al-Mawsu\u2019ah al-Filastiniyyah (4/203):\u00a0\n\u201cThe name al-Masjid al-Aqsa was historically applied to the entire sanctuary (al-Haram al-Sharif) and the buildings in it, the most important of which is the Dome of the Rock which was built by \u2018Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in 72 AH/691 CE, which is regarded as one of the greatest Islamic historical buildings. But today the name is applied to the great mosque which is situated in the southern part of the sanctuary plateau.\u201d\u00a0\nIt also says in al-Mawsu\u2019ah (3/23):\u00a0\n\u201cThe Dome of the Rock is situated in the middle of the plateau of al-Masjid al-Aqsa, which is in the southeastern part of the city of al-Quds (Jerusalem). It is a spacious rectangular plateau which measures 480 meters from north to south, and 300 meters from east to west. This plateau occupies approximately one-fifth of the area of the Old City of Jerusalem.\u201d\u00a0\nDifference between al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock\u00a0\nThe mosque which is the place of prayer is not the Dome of the Rock, but because pictures of the Dome are so widespread, many Muslims think when they see it that this is the mosque. This is not in fact the case. The Mosque is situated in the southern portion of the plateau, and the Dome is built on the raised rock that is situated in the middle of the plateau.\u00a0\nWe have already seen above that the name of the mosque was historically applied to the whole plateau.\u00a0\nThis is supported by the words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) in Majmu\u2019at al-Rasail al-Kubra, 2/61:\u00a0\n\u201cAl-Masjid al-Aqsa is the name for the whole of the place of worship built by Sulayman (peace be upon him). Some people started to give the name of al-Aqsa to the prayer-place which was built by \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab in front of it. Praying in this prayer-place which \u2018Umar built for the Muslims is better than praying in the rest of the mosque, because when \u2018Umar conquered Jerusalem there was a huge garbage dump on the rock, since the Christians wanted to show their scorn for the place towards which the Jews used to pray. So \u2018Umar issued orders that the filth be removed and he said to Ka\u2019b: \u2018Where do you think we should build a place of prayer for the Muslims?\u2019 He said, \u2018Behind the rock.\u2019 He said, \u2018O you son of a Jewish woman! Are you influenced by your Jewish ideas! Rather I will build it in front of it.\u2019\nHence when the imams of this ummah entered the mosque, they would go and pray in the prayer-place that was built by \u2018Umar. With regard to the Rock, neither \u2018Umar nor any of the Sahabah prayed there, and there was no dome over it during the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs. It was open to the sky during the caliphate of \u2018Umar, \u2018Uthman, \u2018Ali, Mu\u2019awiyah, Yazid and Marwan\u2026 The scholars among the Sahabah and those who followed them in truth did not venerate the rock because it was an abrogated qiblah\u2026 rather it was venerated by the Jews and some of the Christians.\u201d\u00a0\n\u2018Umar denounced Ka\u2019b al-Ahbar and called him the son of a Jewish woman because Ka\u2019b had been a Jewish scholar and rabbi, so when he suggested to \u2018Umar that he should build the mosque behind the rock, that was out of respect for the rock so that the Muslims would face it when praying, and veneration of the rock was part of the religion of the Jews, not the religion of the Muslims.\u00a0\nThe Muslims\u2019 fondness for the picture of the Dome may be because of the beauty of this building, but this does not excuse them from the resulting mistake of not distinguishing between the Mosque and the buildings that surround it.\u00a0\nThis may be one of the plots and tricks of the Jews, because of their veneration for the rock and their facing it in prayer. Or it may be in order to give importance to the Rock so that they can fulfil their desire to build the so-called Temple of Solomon on the ruins of al-Masjid al-Aqsa. This is by making the Muslims think that al-Masjid al-Aqsa is the Dome of the Rock, so that if the Jews start to destroy al-Masjid al-Aqsa and the Muslims denounce them for that, they will tell them, \u201cAl-Masjid al-Aqsa is fine,\u201d and will show them a picture of the Dome of the Rock. Thus they will achieve their aims and be safe from the Muslims\u2019 criticism.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to restore the Muslims\u2019 power and glory, and to cleanse al-Masjid al-Aqsa of the criminals, \"for Allah has full power and control over His Affairs, but most of men know not.\" (Surah Yusuf 12:21)\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Where is al-Husayn buried, and how important is it to know where the graves of the Sahaabah are?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In fact people differed concerning that. It \n    was said that he is buried in Syria, or in Iraq, and Allaah knows best what is true. With regard to his head, they also differed concerning that; \n    it was said that it is buried in Syria, or in Iraq, or in Egypt. The correct view is that the site in Egypt is not his grave, rather that is a \n    mistake and the head of al-Husayn is not there. A number of scholars have written essays on that and explained that there is no evidence for the \n    head of al-Husayn being in Egypt. The most likely to be correct is the view that it is in Syria, because it was taken to Yazeed ibn Mu\u2019aawiyah who \n    was in Syria. There is no basis for the view that it was taken to Egypt. Either it was kept in Syria or it was returned to his body in Iraq.\u00a0\nWhatever the case, the people do not need to \n    know where it is buried or where it is. Rather what is prescribed is to pray for forgiveness and mercy for him, may Allaah forgive him and be \n    pleased with him, for he was killed unlawfully. So we should pray for forgiveness and mercy for him, and hope for much good for him. He and his \n    brother al-Hasan will be the leaders of the youth of Paradise, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. May Allaah be \n    pleased with them.\u00a0\nIf a person\u2019s grave is known, there is \n    nothing wrong with saying salaams to him and making du\u2019aa\u2019 for him, as other graves may be visited, without going to extremes in that or \n    worshipping them. It is not permissible to ask the dead to intercede, because nothing can be asked of the dead; rather we should make du\u2019aa\u2019 for \n    them and pray for mercy for them if they were Muslims, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cVisit the \n    graves, for they will remind you of the Hereafter.\u201d\u00a0\nIf a person visits the graves of al-Husayn or \n    al-Hasan or any other Muslim to make du\u2019aa\u2019 for them and pray for mercy and forgiveness for them, as he would do at the grave of any other Muslim, \n    this is Sunnah. But visiting graves to pray to their occupants or seek their help or ask them to intercede \u2013 this is a reprehensible action, and \n    indeed it is major shirk. It is not permissible to build mosques or domes etc over graves, because the Messenger  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cMay Allaah curse the Jews and Christians, for they took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship.\u201d (Saheeh \u2013 \n    agreed upon). And because it was narrated from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) in al-Saheeh that the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade plastering over graves, sitting on them and erecting structures over them.\u201d So t is not permissible to \n    plaster over graves, perfume them, place screens around them or erect structures over them; all of that is forbidden and these are means that lead \n    to shirk. And we should not pray at graves because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThose who came before you \n    used to take the graves of their Prophets and righteous people as places of worship; do not take graves as places of worship, for I forbid you to \n    do that.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh from Jundub ibn \u2018Abd-Allaah al-Bajali (may Allaah be pleased with him).\u00a0\nThis hadeeth indicates that it is not \n    permissible to pray at graves or to take them as mosques; and because that is a means that leads to shirk and worshipping someone other than \n    Allaah by calling upon them (the occupants of the graves), seeking their help, making vows to them, and touching the graves to seek their \n    blessings. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against that. Rather graves should be visited in the manner \n    prescribed in sharee\u2019ah only, to give salaams to them and make du\u2019aa\u2019 for them and pray for mercy for them, but without travelling specifically \n    for that purpose.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength and the \n    Guide to the straight path."

        "question": "To whom is the book Nahj al-Balaaghah attributed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The book Nahj al-Balaaghah is one of the books that \n    are attributed to Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be \n    pleased with him), but it contains many things concerning which those who \n    claim to be Muslims have disputed. Following the great scientific principle \n    which was followed by the imams of Islam in obedience to the shar\u2019i command \n    to verify reports, we have no choice but to refer to the scholars and \n    specialists to check on the veracity of the things that are attributed to \n    \u2018Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), because what is narrated from the \n    Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) has an effect on sharee\u2019ah, \n    especially in the case of someone like Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen \u2018Ali (may Allaah \n    be pleased with him), concerning whom some people have exaggerated or fallen \n    short, but Allaah guided the Ahl al-Sunnah to follow a middle course.\u00a0\n\n    By referring to the words of the scholars concerning this \n    book and comparing its contents with what has been proven with saheeh \n    isnaads from \u2018Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), it becomes clear that \n    there is material in this book that contradicts what was proven from him \n    (may Allaah be pleased with him). So we should look at what some of these \n    great scholars have said:\u00a0\n\n    Imaam al-Dhahabi (may Allaah be pleased with him) said in his \n    biography of al-Murtada \u2018Ali ibn Husayn ibn Moosa al-Moosawi (d. 436 AH): I \n    said, he was the compiler of the book Nahj al-Balaaghah which is attributed \n    to Imam \u2018Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), but the reports contained \n    therein have are no isnaads. Some of it is false and some of it is true, but \n    it contains some frabricated reports of things that the Imam would never \n    have said. But who is the fair-minded man who would look at it in an \n    objective manner?! It was said that it was compiled by his brother Shareef \n    al-Radiy. It includes slander against the companions of the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); we seek refuge with \n    Allaah from knowledge that is of no benefit.\n\n    Siyar A\u2019laam al-Nubala\u2019, 17/589\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said: \u201cMost of the khutab (sermons) that the author of Nahj al-Balaaghah \n    includes in his book are lies against \u2018Ali. \u2018Ali (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) is too noble and too worthy to have uttered such words. But these \n    people fabricated lies and thought that they were praise, but they are \n    neither truth nor praise. Whoever says that the words of \u2018Ali or any other \n    human being are above the words of any other created being is mistaken, for \n    the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    are above his words, and both of them are created beings. Moreover the \n    correct meanings that are to be found in the words of \u2018Ali are to be found \n    in the words of others, but the author of Nahj al-Balaaghah and his \n    ilk took many of the things that people say and made them the words of \u2018Ali. \n    There are some words narrated from \u2018Ali that he did say, and some of them \n    are true words that would have been befitting for him to say, but in fact \n    they are the words of others. Hence in Kalaam al-Bayaan wa\u2019l-Tabyeen \n    by al-Haafiz and in other books there are words narrated from people other \n    than \u2018Ali and the author of Nahj al-Balaaghah attributed them to \n    \u2018Ali. If these sermons which were transmitted in Nahj al-Balaaghah \n    were really spoken by \u2018Ali, they would have been found in other books that \n    existed before this book was written, and they would have been narrated from \n    \u2018Ali with isnaads and otherwise. It is known from those who are well versed \n    in the study of narrations that many of them (these sermons) \u2013 indeed most \n    of them \u2013 were unknown before this, therefore it may be concluded that they \n    are fabrications. So the narrator should state in which book they are \n    mentioned, who narrated it from \u2018Ali, and what its isnaad is. Otherwise, \n    anybody could say something and claim that it was said by \u2018Ali. Those who \n    are well-versed in the knowledge of the hadeeth scholars and of reports and \n    isnaads and are able to tell what is sound and what is not sound would know \n    that these people who transmitted reports from \u2018Ali are the least likely \n    people to know about reports and be able to distinguish the sound from the \n    unsound.\n\n    Manhaaj al-Sunnah al-Nabawiyyah, \n    8/55.\u00a0\n\n    Other scholars who pointed out the lies in this book was \n    al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi, in al-Jaami\u2019 li Akhlaaq al-Raawi wa Adaab \n    al-Saami\u2019, 2.161; al-Qaadi Ibn Khalkaan; al-Safadi, and others. The \n    things that have been said against it may be summarized in the following \n    points:\u00a0\n\n    1.There are seven generations of \n    narrators between \u2018Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) and the author of \n    this book, and he did not mention any name whatsoever. Hence we cannot \n    accept his words without an isnaad. \n\n    2.If these narrators are \n    mentioned, it is essential to research about them and find out whether they \n    are trustworthy.\n\n    3.The fact that most of these \n    sermons did not exist before this book was written indicates that they were \n    fabricated.\n\n    4.Al-Murtada \u2013 the author of the \n    book \u2013 was not one of the scholars of reports, rather he was one of those \n    whose religious commitment and competence were debatable.\n\n    5.The slander that it contains \n    against the leading Sahaabah is sufficient to count it as false.\n\n    6.The insults and slander that it \n    contains are not the characteristics of the believers, let alone their \n    leaders such as \u2018Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him).\n\n    7.It contains contradictions and \n    clumsy expressions from which it may be known for certain that it was not \n    produced by one who was prominent in eloquence and fluency.\n\n    8.The fact that the Raafidah \n    accept it and are certain that it is as true as the Qur\u2019aan, despite all \n    these objections, indicates that they do not pay attention to verifying \n    sources and ensuring that they are sound with regard to the matters of their \n    religion.\n\n    \u00a0Based on the above, it is clear that this book cannot be \n    attributed to \u2018Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), therefore nothing in it \n    can be used as evidence in matters of sharee\u2019ah, no matter what the issue \n    is. But whoever reads it in order to find out what it contains of eloquence, \n    the ruling is the same as that on all other books on Arabic language, \n    without attributing its contents to Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen \u2018Ali (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him).\n\n    \u00a0See Kutub hadhdhara minha al-\u2018Ulama\u2019, 2/250"

        "question": "Who was al-Hallaaj?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-Hallaaj was al-Husayn ibn Mansoor al-Hallaaj, who was known as Abu Mugheeth, or Abu \u2018Abd-Allaah. He grew up in Waasit, or it was said in Tastar, and he was connected with a group of Sufis including Sahl al-Tastari, al-Junayd, Abu\u2019l-Hasan al-Noori and others.\u00a0\nHe traveled to many places, including Makkah and Khurasaan, and India where he learned sihr (magic, witchcraft). He finally settled in Baghdaad, where he was killed.\u00a0\nHe learned magic in India, and he was a trickster and cheat. He deceived many ignorant people thereby, and they were attracted by him, until they thought that he was one of the greatest awliya\u2019 (close friends or \u201csaints\u201d) of Allaah.\u00a0\nHe is liked by most of the Orientalists, and they think that he was killed wrongfully because, as we shall see below, his beliefs were close to Christian beliefs and he preached a similar message.\u00a0\nHe was executed in Baghdad in 309 AH, because it was proven by his own confession and otherwise that he was a kaafir and a heretic.\u00a0\nThe scholars of his time were agreed that he was to be executed because of the words of kufr and heresy that were narrated from him.\u00a0\nThe following are some of the things that he said:\u00a0\n1-He claimed to be a prophet, then he went further and said that he was God. He used to say, \u201cI am Allaah,\u201d and he commanded his daughter-in-law to prostrate to him. She said, \u201cShould I prostrate to someone other than Allaah?\u201d He said, \u201cThere is a god in the heavens and a god on earth.\u201d\n2-He believed in incarnation and union with the Divine, i.e., that Allaah was incarnated in him, and that he and Allaah had become one and the same \u2013 exalted be Allaah far above that.\nThis is what made him acceptable to the Christian Orientalists, because he shared their belief in incarnation, for they believe that God was incarnated in Jesus (\u2018Eesa, peace be upon him). Hence al-Hallaaj spoke of divine nature and human nature as the Christians do.\u00a0\nSome of the lines of verse that he composed said:\u00a0\n\u201cGlory be to the one Whose human form manifested the secret of His divinity\nThen He emerged among His creation in the form of one who eats and drinks.\u201d\u00a0\nWhen Ibn Haneef heard these lines, he said, \u201cMay the curse of Allaah be upon the one who said this.\u201d It was said to him, \u201cThis is the poetry of al-Hallaaj.\u201d He said, \u201cIf this is what he believes, then he is a kaafir.\u201d\u00a0\n3-He heard someone reciting a verse from the Qur\u2019aan, and he said, \u201cI am able to compose something like that.\u201d\n4-Another of his lines of poetry says:\n\u201cPeople formed different beliefs about God, and I believe in everything that they believed.\u201d\u00a0\nThese words imply that he approved of and believed in all forms of kufr that the misguided sects of humanity believe in, but it is a contradictory notion that no sound mind can accept. How can anyone believe in Tawheed and shirk at the same time?\u00a0\n5-He said things which denied the pillars and basic principles of Islam, namely prayer, zakaah, fasting and Hajj.\n6-He used to say that the souls of the Prophets had been reincarnated in the bodies of his companions and students. So he would say to one of them, \u201cYou are Nooh\u201d; and to another, \u201cYou are Moosa\u201d; and to another, \u201cYou are Muhammad.\u201d\n7-When he was taken out to be executed, he said to his companions, \u201cDo not worry about this, for I will return to you after thirty days,\u201d He was executed and he never came back.\nBecause of these sayings and others, the scholars were agreed that he was a kaafir and a heretic, and for this reason he was executed in Baghdad in 309 AH. Similarly, most of the Sufis denounced him and denied that he was one of them. Among those who denounced him was al-Junayd, and he was not mentioned by Abu\u2019l-Qaasim al-Qushayri in his book in which he mentioned many of the Sufi shaykhs.\u00a0\nThe one who strove to have him executed and who held a council in which he ruled that he deserved to be executed was al-Qaadi Abu \u2018Umar Muhammad ibn Yoosuf al-Maaliki (may Allaah have mercy on him). Ibn Katheer praised him for that and said, \u201cOne of his greatest and most correct judgements was his ruling that al-Husayn ibn Mansoor al-Hallaaj was to be executed.\u201d (al-Bidaayah wa\u2019l-Nihaayah, 11/172)\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u201cWhoever believes what al-Hallaaj believed in and agrees with the ideas for which al-Hallaaj was executed, is a kaafir and an apostate, according to the consensus of the Muslims. For the Muslims executed him because of his belief in incarnation, union with the Divine and other heretical beliefs, such as his saying, \u2018I am Allaah,\u2019 and, \u2018There is a god in the heavens and a god on earth.\u2019 \u2026 Al-Hallaaj performed extraordinary feats and various kinds of magic, and there are books of magic which are attributed to him. In conclusion, there is no dispute among the ummah that whoever believes that Allaah can be incarnated in a human being and be as one with him, or that a human being can be a god, is a kaafir whose blood it is permissible to shed. On this basis al-Hallaaj was executed.\u201d\n(Majmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa, 2/480)\u00a0\nHe also said: \u201cWe do not know of anyone among the imams of the Muslims who spoke well of al-Hallaaj, neither among the scholars nor among the shaykhs. But some of the people did not comment on him because they did not know about him.\u201d\n(Majmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa, 2/483)\u00a0\nFor more information, see Taareekh Baghdaad by al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi, 8/112-141; al-Muntazam by Ibn al-Jawzi, 13/201-206; Siyar A\u2019laam al-Nubalaa\u2019 by al-Shihaabi, 14/313-354; al-Bidaayah wa\u2019l-Nihaayah by Ibn Katheer, 11/132-144\u00a0\nAnd Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path."

        "question": "The number of Sulaymaan\u2019s wives",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The highest number of wives of Sulaymaan (peace be upon him) \n    that is mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth is one hundred, as was narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (5242) from Abu Hurayrah who said: \n    \u201cSulaymaan ibn Dawood (peace be upon them both) said: \u2018Tonight I will go \n    around to one hundred women, each of whom will give birth to a boy who will \n    fight for the sake of Allaah.\u2019 The angel said to him, \u2018Say in sha Allaah (if \n    Allaah wills).\u2019 But he did not say it, as he forgot. He went around to them \n    but none of them gave birth, apart from one woman who gave birth to half a \n    child. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u2018If he had said in sha Allaah, he would not have broken his oath and he \n    would have had more hope of fulfilling his wish.\u2019\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, \n    1654). According to another report narrated by Muslim, he said ninety women. \n    According to a mu\u2019allaq report narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, \n    in the Chapter on seeking a son for jihad (Man talaba al-walad \n    li\u2019l-Jihaad), he said ninety-nine women.\u00a0\n\n    Perhaps the one who said one hundred was rounding up the figure, and the one \n    who said ninety was rounding it down, as was suggested by al-Haafiz ibn \n    Hajar in his commentary on this hadeeth.\u00a0\n\n    But al-Haafiz ibn Hajar narrated in his story of Sulaymaan \n    (peace be upon him) in al-Bidaayah wa\u2019l-Nihaayah, vol. 2, from many \n    of the salaf, that the number of Sulaymaan\u2019s wives was one thousand. \n    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said likewise in Fath al-Baari, in his commentary \n    on hadeeth no. 3424.\u00a0\n\n    This number was narrated from the Children of Israel [i.e., the Jews], so we \n    neither believe it nor disbelieve it. There is nothing in the ahaadeeth \n    quoted above to either prove or disprove that.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the reason for that, Allaah gives to those \n    whom He wills among His slaves whatever He wills of worldly power and \n    enjoyment. This is according to His great wisdom and grace. He is not to be \n    questioned about what He does, may He be glorified and praised. He gave to \n    Sulaymaan exclusively great power which He did not give to anyone after him. \n    So it is not far-fetched to suggest that He also gave him this great \n    strength which enabled him to marry this number of women. It should not \n    cross the mind of any Muslim that this matter implies any form of \n    belittlement towards this Prophet, rather it is a reflection of his perfect \n    power, virtue and manhood, and thus he hoped that Allaah would bless him, in \n    a single night, with one hundred sons, all of whom would go out as knights, \n    fighting for the sake of Allaah. But first and last we must believe that \n    Allaah creates whatever He wills and chooses, and none can overturn His \n    ruling or ward off His decree.\n\n    \u00a0And Allaah knows best."

Hanaan (sympathy, \n          compassion) means the mercy, compassion and empathy that was instilled \n          in him. The word hanaan is widely used among the Arabs to refer \n          to mercy and compassion, for example, they say, \u201cHanaanak wa hanaaneeka \n          yaa Rabb\u201d, meaning, I ask for Your mercy O Lord.\u00a0\n \n          \u201cand pure from sins\u201d\n \n          [Maryam 19:13 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\n \n          This is mentioned in conjunction with the above, and \n          means, \u2018We gave him purity\u2019 i.e., he was free from sin and disobedience \n          because he obeyed Allaah and drew close to Him by means of that which \n          pleases Him.\u00a0\n \n          \u201cand he was righteous\u201d\n \n          [Maryam 19:13 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\n \n          This means, he obeyed the commands of his Lord and avoided \n          that which He forbade. So he never committed any sin and was never blamed \n          for any such action.\u00a0\n \n          \u201cAnd dutiful towards his parents\u201d\n \n          [Maryam 19:14 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\n \n          The word barr (dutiful) refers to one who does \n          acts of kindness, i.e., We made him honour his parents a great deal, \n          i.e., he was very kind towards them and treated them in a gentle manner.\u00a0\n \n          \u201cand he was neither arrogant nor disobedient\u201d\n \n          [Maryam 19:14 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\n \n          This means that he was not too arrogant to obey Allaah \n          or to obey his parents. Rather he was obedient towards Allaah and humble \n          towards his parents. This is the view of Ibn Jareer. Jabbaar \n          (arrogant) means one who is very oppressive towards people and mistreats \n          them. Everyone who is arrogant towards people and does them wrong is \n          described as jabbaar.\u00a0\n \n          \u201cAnd Salaam (peace) be on him the day he was born, \n          and the day he dies, and the day he will be raised up to life (again)!\u201d\n \n          [Maryam 19:15 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\n \n          Ibn Jareer said: \u201cSalaam (peace) be upon him means\u201d, \n          may he be safe and secure. The apparent meaning is that \u201cAnd Salaam \n          (peace) be on him the day he was born\u201d is a greeting from Allaah \n          to Yahyaa, and the meaning is safety and security.\u00a0\n \n          In Soorat Aal \u2018Imraan Allaah says (interpretation of \n          the meaning):\u00a0\n \n          \u201c\u2026 noble, keeping away from sexual relations with \n          women, a Prophet, from among the righteous\u201d[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:39]\n \n          The word sayyid (translated here as \u201cnoble\u201d) \n          means one who is obeyed and followed by a large number of people.\u00a0\n \n          The word husoor (translated here as \u201ckeeping \n          away from sexual relations with women\u201d) means that he kept himself \n          away from women even though he was able to have relations with them, \n          as an act of devotion to Allaah. That was permissible according to his \n          law, but the Sunnah of the Prophet \n          \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is to marry, not to remain \n          celibate\u2026\u00a0\n \n          In the phrase \u201ca Prophet, from among the righteous\u201d, \n          the word Nabi (Prophet) is derived from the word naba\u2019, meaning \n          important news, because the Revelation is important news from Allaah. \n          The righteous are those whose belief, actions, words and intentions \n          are correct. Righteousness is the opposite of immorality or corruption. \n          Allaah described Yahyaa as righteous and He described the Prophets in \n          a similar manner in Soorat al-An\u2019aam, where He says (interpretation \n          of the meaning):\u00a0\n \n          \u201cAnd Zakariyya (Zachariya), and Yahya (John) and \u2018Eesa \n          (Jesus) and Ilyaas (Elias), each one of them was of the righteous\u201d\n \n          [al-An\u2019aam 6:85]"

This is in contrast to those who say that the people of \n          the Cave were one group and the people of the Inscription were another \n          group. Allaah told this story to His Prophet \n          \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them) in this soorah, and He \n          did not mention anything about the people of the Inscription.

Their story is well known and is proven in \n          al-Saheeh, but interpreting this aayah as meaning that these \n          were the people referred to therein is far-fetched as you can see.

        "question": "Our attitude towards Yazeed ibn Mu\u2019aawiyah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.His name was Yazeed ibn Mu\u2019aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan ibn Harb ibn Umayaah al-Umawi al-Dimashqi.\nAl-Dhahabi said: he was the commander of that army during the campaign against Constantinople, among which were people such as Abu Ayyoob al-Ansaari. Yazeed was appointed by his father as his heir, so he took power after his father died in Rajab 60 AH at the age of thirty-three, but his reign lasted for less than four years.\nYazeed is one of those whom we neither curse nor love. There are others like him among the khaleefahs of the two states (Umawi/Umayyad and \u2018Abbaasi/Abbasid) and the governors of various regions, indeed there were some among them who were worse than him. But the issue in the case of Yazeed is that he was came to power forty-nine years after the death of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); it was still close to the time of the Prophet and some of the Sahaabah were still alive such as Ibn \u2018Umar who was more entitled to the position than him or his father or his grandfather.\nHis reign began with the killing of the martyr al-Husayn and it ended with the battle of al-Harrah, so the people hated him and he was not blessed with a long life. There were many revolts against him after al-Husayn, such as the people of Madeenah who revolted for the sake of Allaah, and Ibn al-Zubayr.\n(Siyar A\u2019laam al-Nubalaa\u2019, part 4, p. 38)\nShaykh al-Islam described people\u2019s attitudes towards Yazeed ibn Mu\u2019aawiyah, and said:\nThe people differed concerning Yazeed ibn Mu\u2019aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan, splitting into three groups, two extreme and one moderate.\nOne of the two extremes said that he was a kaafir and a munaafiq, that he strove to kill the grandson of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to spite the Messenger of Allaah and to take revenge on him, and to avenge his grandfather \u2018Utbah, his grandfather\u2019s brother Shaybah and his maternal uncle al-Waleed ibn \u2018Utbah and others who were killed by the companions of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), by \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib and others on the day of Badr and in other battles \u2013 and things of that nature. To have such a view is easy for the Raafidis who regard Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar and \u2018Uthmaan as kaafirs, so it is much easier for them to regard Yazeed as a kaafir.\nThe second extreme group think that he was a righteous man and a just leader, that he was one of the Sahaabah who were born during the time of the Prophet and were carried and blessed by him. Some of them give him a higher status than Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar, and some of them regard him as a prophet. Both views are obviously false to one who has the least common sense and who has any knowledge of the lives and times of the earliest Muslims. This view is not attributable to any of the scholars who are known for following the Sunnah or to any intelligent person who has reason and experience.\nThe third view is that he was one of the kings of the Muslims, who did good deeds and bad deeds. He was not born until the caliphate of \u2018Uthmaan. He was not a kaafir but it was because of him that the killing of al-Husayn happened, and he did what he did to the people of al-Harrah. He was not a Sahaabi, nor was he one of the righteous friends of Allaah. This is the view of most of the people of reason and knowledge and of Ahl al-Sunnah wa\u2019l-Jamaa\u2019ah.\nThen they divided into three groups, one which cursed him, one which loved him and one which neither cursed him nor loved him. This is what was reported from Imaam Ahmad, and this is the view of the fair-minded among his companions and others among the Muslims. Saalih ibn Ahmad said: I said to my father, some people say that they love Yazeed. He said, O my son, does anyone love Yazeed who believes in Allaah and the Last Day? I said, O my father, why do you not curse him? He said, O my son, when did you ever see your father curse anybody?\nAbu Muhammad al-Maqdisi said, when he was asked about Yazeed: according to what I have heard he is neither to be cursed nor to be loved. He said, I also heard that our grandfather Abu \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Taymiyah was asked about Yazeed and he said: we do not deny his good qualities or exaggerate about them. This is the fairest opinion.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 Fataawa Shaykh al-Islam, part 4, p. 481-484"

The last of the Sahaabah to \n          die passed away in 110 AH, i.e., he died one hundred years after the \n          Messenger  (peace and blessings \n          of Allaah be upon him) died.

It does not mean that anyone who \n          was born after that night would not live for a hundred years.

But their problem was that they did not worship Allah Alone in exclusion to others; they had other gods whom they associated in worship with Him, and which they worshipped not on the basis that they were the Lord, the Creator the Provider, but because they claimed that these were intermediaries who would intercede between them and Allah and bring them closer to Allah.

It was also said that he became Muslim.\n\u00a0Ibn Sayyaad was a dajjaal (a liar), and he used to tell fortunes, sometimes what he said came true, and sometimes it did not. He became famous among the people, and it was rumoured that he was the Dajjaal. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to find out about him, so he used to go to him secretly, without revealing his identity to him, hoping to hear something from him. He also asked him some questions directly, to find out what he really was. He outlived the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he was lost on the day of al-Harrah. [comment deleted] \nThe story of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Ibn Sayyaad \n\u00a0\u2018Abdaan told us, \u2018Abd-Allaah informed us, from Yoonus from al-Zuhri, who said, Saalim ibn \u2018Abd-Allaah informed me that Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) informed him that \u2018Umar set out with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to look for Ibn Sayyaad, and they found him playing with some boys near the battlement of Banu Maghaalah. At that time Ibn Sayyaad was on the threshhold of adolescence. He did not notice anything until the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) struck him on the back with his hand. Then he said to Ibn Sayyaad, \u201cDo you bear witness that I am the Messenger of Allaah?\u201d Ibn Sayyaad looked at him and said, \u201cI bear witness that you are the Messenger of the unlettered.\u201d Ibn Sayyaad said to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \u201cDo you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allaah?\u201d He ignored that and said, \u201cI believe in Allaah and His Messengers.\u201d Then he asked him, \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d Ibn Sayyaad said, \u201c(Sometimes) a truthful one comes to me and (sometimes) a liar comes.\u201d The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \u201cYou have been confounded.\u201d Then the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, \u201cI am concealing something from you.\u201d Ibn Sayyaad said, \u201cIt is al-dukh.\u201d [Referring to Soorat al-Dukhaan]. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, \u201cBe off with you! You will never go beyond your rank.\u201d \u2018Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, \u201cPermit me to strike his neck (kill him), O Messenger of Allaah.\u201d The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \u201cIf he is he (the Dajjaal), then you will not be able to overpower him, and if he is not (the Dajjaal), then your killing him will not do any good.\u201dSaalim said, I heard Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) say: After that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Ubayy ibn Ka\u2019b set off to go to some date-palm trees where Ibn Sayyaad was. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concealed himself in order to hear something from Ibn Sayyaad before Ibn Sayyaad saw him. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him lying on his bed with a blanket around him from which was coming a murmuring sound. The mother of Ibn Sayyaad saw the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) hiding behind the trunk of the palm-tree and said, \u201cO Saaf!\u201d \u2013 which was his name \u2013 \u201cHere is Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)!\u201d Then Ibn Sayyaad jumped up and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \u201cIf she had left him alone, things would have been made clear.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1355). \n\u201cBattlement\u201d refers to a structure like a fortress. \nMaghaalah was a tribe of the Ansaar. \nThe Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to talk to Ibn Sayyaad without him realizing who he was. \n\u201cfrom which was coming a murmuring sound\u201d means, a low voice, or moving the lips as in speech, or speaking in an indistinct manner. \nSee Fath al-Baari for the commentary on the above hadeeth in Kitaab al-Janaa\u2019iz of Saheeh al-Bukhaari.\n\u00a0\u00b7Was Ibn Sayyaad the great Dajjaal? \n\u00a0The hadeeth quoted above \u2013 which describes some of the features of Ibn Saayaad and how the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) examined him \u2013 indicates that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not pass judgement on the matter of Ibn Sayyaad, because it was not revealed to him (by Wahy) whether he was the Dajjaal or not. \n\u00a0Many of the Sahaabah thought that Ibn Sayyaad was the Dajjaal. \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) swore that he was the Dajjaal in the presence of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Sahaabah, and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not disapprove of that. Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said, \u201cI saw Jaabir ibn \u2018Abd-Allaah swear by Allaah that Ibn al-Saa\u2019id was the Dajjaal. I said, \u2018Do you swear by Allaah?\u2019 He said, \u2018I heard \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab swear to that effect in the presence of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not disapprove of that.\u2019\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6808). \nIbn \u2018Umar told a strange story about Ibn Sayyaad which was narrated in Saheeh Muslim from Naafi\u2019, who said: Ibn \u2018Umar met Ibn Sayyaad on one of the paths of Madeenah, and said to him something which made him so angry that he swelled up and filled the road. Ibn \u2018Umar went to Hafsah and told her about this. She said, \u201cMay Allaah have mercy upon you! Why did you upset Ibn Sayyaad? Don\u2019t you know that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that he (the Dajjaal) will emerge when something makes him very angry?\u201d (Saheeh Muslim, 2932) \nIn spite of that, when Ibn Sayyaad grew up, hetried to defend himself and said that he was not the Dajjaal; he was apparently upset by this accusation, and he quoted as evidence the fact that the attributes of the Dajjaal described by the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not apply to him.\n\u00a0Abu Sa\u2019eed al-Khudri said: \u201cWe went out for Hajj or \u2018Umrah, and Ibn Saa\u2019id was with us. We stopped at a place to camp, and the people separated and I was left with him (Ibn Saa\u2019id). I felt very nervous and afraid of him, because of what had been said about him. He brought his luggage and put it with mine. I said, \u2018It is very hot \u2013 why don\u2019t you put your things under that tree?\u2019 So he did that. Then some sheep appeared before us, and he went and brought a large vessel (of milk) and said, \u2018Drink, O Abu Sa\u2019eed.\u2019 I said, \u2018It is too hot, and the milk is hot.\u2019 In fact (the only thing wrong was) that I did not want to drink from his hand, or take anything from his hand. He said, \u2018Abu Sa\u2019eed, I have been thinking that I should take a rope and suspend it from a tree, and hang myself, because of what people are saying about me. O Abu Sa\u2019eed, does anyone know more about hadeeth than you Ansaar? Are you not one of the most knowledgeable of people about the hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? Didn\u2019t the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say that the Dajjaal is a kaafir, and I am a Muslim? Didn\u2019t the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say that he would be sterile, with no children, and I have left my child behind in Madeenah? Didn\u2019t the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say that he will never enter Madeenah or Makkah, but I have left Madeenah and am headed for Makkah?\u2019 \u2026 I was about to accept his excuses, then he said, \u2018But, by Allaah, I know who the Dajjaal is, where he was born and where he is now.\u2019 I said to him, \u2018May you perish for the rest of the day!\u2019\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5211). \n\u00a0According to another report, Ibn Sayyaad said: \u201cBy Allaah, I know where he is now and I know his father and mother.\u201d It was said to him, \u201cWould you not be happy to be that man?\u201d He said, \u201cIf it were offered to me, I would not refuse.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 521) \n\u00a0The scholars were confused by the reports about Ibn Sayyaad. Some scholars said that he was the Dajjaal, and others said that he was not. Both groups had evidence (daleel) for what they said, and their views conflicted a great deal. Ibn Hajar tried to reconcile the two views by saying: the best way in which we may reconcile what is said in the hadeeth of Tameem al-Daari and the view that Ibn Sayyaad was the Dajjaal is to say that the Dajjaal is the exact same person whom Tameem al-Daari saw chained up, and that Ibn Sayyaad was a shaytaan (a devil) who appeared in the image of the Dajjaal at that time, until he went to Isfahaan, where he hid with his qareen, until the appointed time comes when Allaah will decree that he should emerge. Because the matter is so confusing, al-Bukhaari, instead of attempting a reconciliation, narrated the hadeeth of Jaabir from \u2018Umar, believing it to be more saheeh, and did not narrate the hadeeth of Faatimah bint Qays about the story of Tameem. (Fath al-Baari, 13/328)\nIt was said that Ibn Sayyaad was one of the dajjaals or liars, but he was not the greater Dajjaal. And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "When did Islam start",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islam began with the beginning of the Prophet's mission, when Jibraa'eel (the Archangel Gabriel) brought down the Revelation from Allah in Makkah (Mecca) in the Arabian Peninsula. This occurred on a Monday in the month of Ramadaan, in the fortieth year of the Prophet Muhammad's (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) life, thirteen years before his Hijrah (migration) to Madeenah (which marks the beginning of the Islamic or Hijri calendar). According to the Gregorian calendar, the beginning of the Prophetic mission happened around 608 or 609 CE. Salmaan al-Farsi, may Allah be pleased with him, one of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reported that between Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Jesus (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there were six hundred years.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Who\r\n    was \u2018Umar al-Khayyaam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.His full name was Abu\u2019l-Fath, \u2018Umar ibn Ibraaheem al-Khayyaami\n        al-Naysapoori. He was a poet and philosopher from among the people of Naysapoor, where he\n        was born and died.\nHe was born in 408 AH, in the town of Naysapoor, where he died and was\n        buried in 517 AH, or it was said, 515 AH.\nHe was a scholar who was well versed in mathematics, astronomy,\n        language, fiqh and history.\nBecause of his brilliance as an astronomer, he was appointed as director\n        of the observatory in Baghdaad, and because of his interest in philosophy, his name is\n        associated with that of Ibn Seenaa (Avicenna), who wrote articles filled with kufr which\n        put him beyond the pale of Islam.\nHe is also famous for his poetry, the best known of which is al-Rubaa\u2019iyaat,\n        which is filled with ideas of kufr, promiscuity and heresy. No wonder the West took such\n        an interest in publishing and distributing this book! It has been translated into many\n        languages, such as English, French, Russian, German, etc. The British sought to spread the\n        ideas of immorality and promiscuity advocated by al-Khayyaam in al-Rubaa\u2019iyaat,\n        so they spread it in the countries which they colonized, such as India and Iran, and\n        attributed it to one of the Muslims, rather one of the greatest of them \u2013 or so they\n        claimed.\nOne of the verses about wine \u2013 in al-Rubaa\u2019iyaat \u2013\n        says:\nDrink wine, for it is the relaxation of the soul\nA cure for the soul and heart, and entertainment.\nIf you are overwhelmed with stress and grief,\nSave yourself through it, for it is like the ship of Nooh.\nDenying the idea of resurrection after death, he said:\nGet up before death seizes you\nAnd take the rose-coloured (liquid) [i.e., wine] to expel darkness\nO fool, you are not a piece of gold\nTo be buried and later brought forth\nHis words of promiscuity and immorality include the following:\nAs much as you can, follow the people of immorality\nDestroy the structure of fasting and prayer\nReceive the best words from al-Khayyaam\nDrink, sing and pursue the good things\nHis mocking of the sharee\u2019ah, his insolence towards his Lord and\n        his attitude towards repentance may be seen in the following words:\nEvery day I have the intention to repent\nIf night falls and I feel that I want to repent from drinking wine\nThen the season of flowers comes and then,\nO Lord, I repent from my intention to repent\nSome researchers, such as al-Zarkali, said that later he repented and\n        performed Hajj. Others, such as \u2018Abd al-Haqq Faadil, expressed doubts about the\n        attribution of al-Rubaa\u2019iyaat to him.\nWhatever the case, the Rubaa\u2019iyaat do not indicate that he\n    repented, because they contain clear statements of kufr, wilful neglect of virtuous\n    attributes and rejection of the idea of repenting and turning to Allaah. Indeed, they\n    contain no indication that their author believed in Allaah and the Last Day.\nThe doubts about whether he wrote these words are outweighed by number\n    of people who attributed them to him. Allaah knows best what is really the case.\nFor more details on his life, see al-A\u2019laam by al-Zarkali,\n    5/38; Mu\u2019jam al-Mu\u2019aalifeen by \u2018Umar Ridaa Kahhaalah, 2/549; \u2018Umar\n    al-Khayyaam bayna al-Kufr wa\u2019l-Eemaan, by Ihsaan Haqqi; Thawrat al-Khayyaam\n    by \u2018Abd al-Haqq Faadil.\nMay Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):\n\u201cVerily, Allaah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they move\n    away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one\n    that could grasp them after Him\u2026\u201d [Faatir 35:41]\n\u201cAnd among His Signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His\n    Command\u2026\u201d [al-Room 30:25]\nThe Rock in Bayt al-Maqdis is not suspended in space with air around it\n    on all sides; it is attached to the side of the mountain of which it is a part and by\n    which it is supported; both it and the mountain stand in their positions because of the\n    well-known physical laws governing the universe; in this regard it is like everything else\n    that exists. We do not deny that Allaah is Able to hold part of His creation in space; all\n    of creation is standing in space by the power of Allaah, as stated above. Allaah raised\n    the mountain above the people of Moosa when they refused to follow the laws that Moosa\n    brought them. It was held up by the power of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the\n    meaning):\n\u201cAnd (remember) when We took your Covenant and We raised above\n    you the Mount (saying): \u2018Hold fast to that which We have given you, and remember that\n    which is therein so that you may become al-muttaqoon (the pious).\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:63]\n\u201cAnd (remember) when We raised the mountain over them as if it had\n    been a canopy, and they thought that it was going to fall on them. (We said): \u2018Hold\n    firmly to what We have given you, and remember that which is therein, so that you may fear\n    Allaah and obey Him.\u201d [al-A\u2019raaf 7:171]\nBut our point here is to explain what is in fact the case: the rock in\n    Jerusalem is not suspended in space, completely separate from the mountain; it is attached\n    to it and is supported by it.

        "question": "Taking the crescent as a symbol",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is no basis in shareeah for taking the crescent or star as\n    a symbol of the Muslims. This was not known at the time of the Prophet \n (peace and\n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), or at the time of the Khulafa al-Raashidoon (the\n    first four leaders of Islam after the death of the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah\n    be upon him), or during the time of the Umawis (Umayyad dynasty). It emerged some time\n    after that, and historians differ as to when this symbol was first adopted and who was the\n    first to adopt it. Some say it was the Persians, others say it was the Greeks, and that\n    this symbol was somehow passed to the Muslims. (See Al-Taraateeb al-Idaariyah\n    by al-Kittaani, 1/320). It was said that the reason why the Muslims adopted\n    the crescent was that when they conquered some western countries, the churches there had\n    crosses on top of them, the Muslims replaced the crosses with these crescents, and the\n    practice spread in this way. Whatever the case, symbols and banners must be in accordance\n    with the teachings of Islam, and as there is no evidence that this symbol is prescribed by\n    Islam, it is better not to use it. Neither the crescent nor the star are symbols of the\n    Muslims, even though some Muslims may use them as symbols. \n    As regards what Muslims think about the moon and the stars, they\n    believe that they are part of the creation of Allaah, and as such can neither benefit nor\n    harm people, and they do not have any influence over events on earth. Allaah has created\n    them for the benefit of mankind, an example of which is seen in the aayah or verse of the\n    Quraan (interpretation of the meaning):\nThey ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: These are\n    signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage\n    [al-Baqarah 2:189]\n[The commentator] Ibn Katheer said, explaining the phrase Say: these\n    are signs to mark fixed periods of time: From them (the new moons) they may know\n    the times for repaying loans, the iddah (waiting period) of their women\n    [after being divorced or widowed] and the timing of their Hajj (pilgrimage) Allaah\n    has made them signs to mark the times when Muslims should start to fast and break their\n    fast [the beginning and end of Ramadaan], to count the iddah of their women\n    and to know the times for repaying loans. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer).\n    [Another commentator] Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on\n    him) said in his commentary on this aayah [verse]: This explains the wisdom behind\n    the waxing and waning of the moon, which is to avoid any confusion in appointed dates,\n    dealings, oaths, Hajj, iddah, fasting, breaking fasts, length of pregnancy,\n    rentals and other matters that concern mankind. Similar to this aayah are others\n    (interpretation of the meanings): \nAnd We have appointed the night and the day as two aayaat\n    (signs). Then, We have made dark the sign of the night while We have made the sign of day\n    illuminating, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of\n    the years and the reckoning [al-Isra 17:12]\nIt is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light\n    and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of years and the\n    reckoning [Yoonus 10:5]\nCounting the new moons is easier than counting days. (See Tafseer\n    al-Qurtubi).\n    With regard to the stars, the scholars of Islam say that\n    Allaah created these stars for three reasons: to adorn the heavens, to drive away the\n    devils (shayaateen) and as signs for navigation. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari,\n    Kitaab Bad al-Khalq), as Allaah says (interpretation of the\n    meaning): \n    It is He Who has set the stars for you, so that you may guide\n    your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea\n    [al-Anaam 6:97]\nAnd indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We\n    have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the shayaateen (devils), and have\n    prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire.

        "question": "Intermarrying among Adam and Eve's children",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.wa alaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh\nAll Praise be to Allaah.\nAs long as you are confident in your heart about your belief, no such insinuations will hurt you (inshaa' \nAllaah). If a doubt strikes a believer or something appears to him as a conflict between different textual \nsources of Shari'ah, he must believe that indeed for such doubts there are true answers and for such \napparent conflicts there are solutions even if he doesnt know it or is unable to find the right answer \nhimself. However, a person should not collect all the doubts in his heart and worry about the \ncomplexities and leave aside the learning of useful knowledge. This is because it is incumbent upon a \nMuslim to learn and know things which have been clearly described (Muhkamaat) in Shari'ah so that he \nmay be able to repel the doubts. \nRegarding the question you have asked, it is a known fact that legislation differs from one Shari'ah to \nanother, while the principles and beliefs remain the same in all of them. So, making of portraits was \nallowed in the Shari'ah of Sulayman (peace be upon him) but is prohibited in our Shari'ah. Similarly, \nmaking prostration of salutation was permitted in the Shari'ah of Yusuf (peace be upon him) but is illegal \nin ours. Also, war booty was prohibited for nations before us but it is completely legal for us. The \nQiblah of people before us used to be towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, but for us it is towards Ka'bah. In a \nsimilar way, marriage between brothers and sisters was permitted in the Shari'ah of Adam (peace be \nupon him) as opposed to those that came afterwards. The following is a clarification on the issue by \nHaafidh Ibn Katheer, who said: \nAllaah allowed Adam (peace be upon him) to marry his daughters to his sons for necessity. Every \ncouple used to have a boy and a girl. Hence, he married the girl of one couple to the boy of another. \nThis is said by Suddi regarding what has been narrated by Abu Maalik and Abu Salih, from Ibn Abbas, \nby Murrah from Ibn Masood and by other companions of the Prophet  (peace be upon him) that \nAdam did not have (in his grandchildren) a baby boy unless it was accompanied by a girl, so he married \nthe male of a couple to the female of another, and the female of a couple to the male of another."
