        "question": "Do You Get Reward for Listening to the Quran Without Understanding It?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The command to listen to the Quran attentively\u00a0\nAllah, may He be exalted, has commanded the believers to listen to the Quran attentively , in a general command. He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSo, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy.\u201d [Al-A`raf 7:204]\u00a0\nShaykh As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cThis command is general and includes everyone who hears the Book of Allah being recited. He is enjoined to listen to it and keep quiet. The difference between listening and keeping quiet is that keeping quiet is done outwardly by not speaking or being distracted with anything that would keep one from focusing on listening to it.\u00a0\nAs for listening to it, this means that one hears it with an attentive heart, pondering the meaning of what one is listening to. The one who adheres to these two commands when the Book of Allah is recited will attain a great deal of good, beneficial knowledge, ongoing and renewed faith, increased guidance and insight into his religion. Hence Allah connected the attainment of mercy to them, which indicates that the one who does not keep quiet and listen attentively when the Book is recited to him will be deprived of the share of mercy and has missed out on a great deal of good.\u00a0\nThe most emphatic command with regard to listening to the Quran attentively has to do with prayers in which Quran is recited out loud by the imam , in which one is enjoined to listen attentively, to such an extent that most of the scholars say that his focusing on keeping quiet and listening attentively takes priority over his reciting Al-Fatihah etc.\u201d (Tafsir As-Sa`di, 314)\u00a0\nThe greater aim of keeping quiet and listening attentively is so that the listener may ponder and understand the meanings, and act upon them.\u00a0\nImam At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cAllah says to those who believe in Him and in His Book, for whom the Quran is guidance and mercy: \u201cSo, when the Quran is recited\u201d, to you, O believers; \u201clisten to it\u201d, i.e. lend your ears so that you might understand its verses and learn from its exhortation; \u201cand be silent\u201d and listen to it attentively, so that you might understand and ponder, and do not utter idle talk during it lest you do not understand; \u201cthat you may receive mercy\u201d i.e., that you might receive the mercy of your Lord by heeding His exhortation and adhering to His limits and to what He enjoins upon you in the verses.\u201d (Tafsir At-Tabari, 13/244)\u00a0\nIf a person manages to achieve that, i.e., keeping quiet, listening attentively, pondering what is recited to him and understanding its meanings, that will bring him goodness in this world and the Hereafter.\u00a0\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cBy means of this listening, Allah guides His slaves and sets straight their affairs in this world and the Hereafter; with this the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent, and he enjoined it upon the Muhajirin and Ansar and those who followed them in truth. The early generations used to gather for this purpose. When the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gathered together, they would tell one of their number to recite whilst they listened. `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) would say to Abu Musa: Remind us of our Lord, and Abu Musa would recite the Quran whilst they listened.\u201d (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 11/626)\u00a0\nDo you get reward for listening to Quran without understanding it?\nAs listening in the complete sense is that in which one understands and ponders, there is no doubt that the one who does that as much as he is able is to be commended for what he does, and he is excused for what he is incapable of. But what one is incapable of should not be an excuse for not doing what one is able to do of goodness. What is possible is not to be omitted because of what is difficult; in other words, whatever a person is able to do of obligatory or recommended actions is not waived because of what he is incapable of doing, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSo keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can\u201d\u00a0[At-Taghabun 64:16] \u00a0\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\u00a0\nWill a person be rewarded if he reads the Quran, even if he does not understand its meanings?\u00a0\nHe replied:\u00a0\n\u201cThe Glorious Quran is blessed, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.\u201d [Sad 38:29]\u00a0\nSo man is enjoined to read it, whether he understands its meanings or not. But the believer who is enjoined to act upon it should not read the Quran without understanding its meanings. If a person wants to learn medicine, for example, and studies the books of medicine, he cannot benefit from them unless he understands their meanings and they are explained to him; in fact he will be very keen to understand the meanings so that he can apply them. So why do you think anyone should read the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, which is a healing for what is in the hearts and exhortation to people, without pondering and without understanding its meanings? For this reason the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would not move on from ten verses until they had learned them and learned the knowledge they contained and how to act upon it. So they learned the Quran and knowledge and action all together.\u00a0\nA person will be rewarded for reading the Quran whether he understands its meanings or not, but he should be very keen to understand its meanings and to learn these meanings from scholars who are trustworthy in their knowledge. If he has no access to a scholar who can teach him the meanings, he may refer to the trustworthy books of Tafsir, such as Tafsir Ibn Jarir, Tafsir Ibn Kathir and others which pay attention to the Tafsir that is based on reports narrated from the Companions and the Successors (may Allah be pleased with them).\u201d (Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb)\u00a0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 106961 , 50010 , 124657 , 78370 , 174743 , 10672 , and 147164 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Can repeating a certain portion of the Quran for a time equivalent to completing the entire Quran be regarded as a khatm?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: We congratulate you on what you are doing of good by constantly reciting Quran, and you should carry on with that, because the religious texts speak of the great virtue of doing that.\nIt was narrated from \u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever recites a letter of the Book of Allah will have one good deed recorded for him, and the good deed brings a tenfold reward. I do not say that alif-lam-mim is a letter; rather alif is a letter, lam is a letter and mim is a letter.\u201d At-Tirmidhi (2910); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nThis reward is attained by everyone who reads or recites any surah of the Quran, whether he recites it as part of a khatm in the correct order, or in his prayer, or in any kind of recitation, without paying attention to any particular khatm.\nBut repeating what you have memorized from al-Baqarah to al-An\u2018am is not regarded as a real khatm of the Quran, even though you will attain reward for reciting Quran. So strive to recite what you recite well from memory, then complete the rest by reading from the Mushaf.\nThe practice of the early generations (the salaf) was to complete the entire Quran, then go back to the beginning and start again, and so on.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is disliked (makruh) to take too long in completing the Quran and to take more than forty days to complete it.\nAhmad said: What I mostly heard is that the Quran should be completed within forty days.\nThat is because taking longer than that will lead to forgetting the Quran and becoming negligent about it. Therefore what we have mentioned is more appropriate.\nThis applies if there is no excuse. If there is an excuse, then the matter is flexible.\u00a0 End quote from al-Mughni (2/611).\nSecondly: you should understand that the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He has told us the timeframe for completing the Quran, and one should not go beyond that.\nIt was narrated from \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: \u201cRead the Quran in a month.\u201d I said: I can do more than that\u2026 Until he said: \u201cRead it in seven days, and do not do more than that.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari (4767).\nHe also forbade them to complete it in less than three days. It was narrated that \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe one who reads the Quran in less than three days will not understand it.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawud (1394); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the longest timeframe for completing the Quran?\nHe replied: There is no set timeframe for that, and the best one can do in that regard is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained to \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018As when he asked him about how to read the Quran. \u2018Abdullah told him that he completed the Quran every day and fasted all the time, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to fast and not fast, and to sleep and pray qiyam, and to complete the Quran every month. He said: \u201cYour own self has a right over you, your wife has a right over you, and your guest has a right over you, so give each of them his or her due.\u201d \u2018Abdullah asked for more, and in the end, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to read it in a week, as he said: \u201cRead it every week,\u201d meaning every seven days.\nSo the best timeframe to complete the Quran is seven days, and if a person takes longer to do it, there is nothing wrong with that. So it may be completed in a month, or in twenty days, or more than that. The minimum time frame for completing it is three days, as it says in the hadith \u201cThe one who reads the Quran in less than three days will not understand it,\u201d or however the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it. End quote from the Shaykh\u2019s website.\nWe have previously given a detailed answer regarding this matter; please see question no. 156299.\nThirdly:\nCompleting 8 juz\u2019 in an hour and a half means that each juz\u2019 is completed in 11 minutes, which is a very short time to recite an entire juz\u2019 of the Quran. It is barely possible for a person to recite in a proper manner in this time, and to recite it as it should be recited, let alone understand what he is reciting and reflect on it.\nThe early generations disallowed reciting Quran quickly, if that will lead to mispronouncing the words or will not give any opportunity for reflection. It was narrated that Ibn Mas\u2018ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Do not recite the Quran rapidly as you recite poetry, and do not utter its words carelessly in the manner of handling poor quality dates. Rather, pause to reflect on its wonders and let your heart be moved by it. The main focus of one of you should not be merely to reach the end of the surah. Al-Bayhaqi: Shu\u2018ab al-Iman (1883).\nIt was narrated that Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: There was a time in our lives when one of us would learn about faith before learning about the Quran, and a surah would be revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he would learn what it permitted and what it prohibited, and where one should pause to reflect and understand, as you learn the Quran. Then he said: I have seen some men, one of whom starts to recite Quran, and he recites it from al-Fatihah to the end without realising what it enjoins and what it prohibits, or where he should pause and reflect, and the way in which he recites it is (careless) like one who is handling poor quality dates. Narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (1/35); he said: It is a sahih hadith according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim, and I am not aware of any problem with the hadith. And adh-Dhahabi agreed with him.\nReciting the Quran with speed is described by the scholars as qira\u2019at al-hadr.\nOne of the conditions of qira\u2019at al-hadr is that it should not lead to mispronunciation. Qira\u2019at al-hadr means reciting one word after another in rapid succession, whilst paying attention to grammar and the correct pronunciation, and pronouncing the letters clearly. See: al-Itqan fi \u2018Ulum al-Quran (1/345).\nReciting a juz\u2019 in ten minutes does not allow one to pronounce words correctly or pay attention to grammar; rather it is reciting at such speed that it is not possible to follow the meaning.\nWhat was narrated from \u2018Uthman ibn \u2018Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), that he recited the entire Quran in a rak\u2018ah, is not a precedent to be followed by others; rather it is something unique to \u2018Uthman. We are not like him, and what he was enabled to do is something that we cannot be enabled to do. If it is said that this is a karamah (miracle or extraordinary feat) with which he was honoured, that would not be far-fetched, but most of the Sahabah used to recite the Quran in seven days.\nAl-Hafiz al-\u2018Iraqi said: The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to complete the Quran every seven days\u2026 Among those who completed it every seven days were: Tamim ad-Dari, \u2018Abd ar-Rahman ibn Yazid, Ibrahim an-Nakha\u2018i, \u2018Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, Abu Mijlaz, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and the wife of Ibn Mas\u2018ud. Masruq regarded that as something good. Among those who would complete it in eight days were Ubay and Abu Qilabah. Among those who would complete it in six days was al-Aswad ibn Yazid. Among those who would complete it in five days was \u2018Ilqimah ibn Qays. Among those who would complete it in three days was Ibn Mas\u2018ud. And he said that the one who recites it in less than three days is reciting at speed. End quote from Tarh at-Tathrib fi Sharh at-Taqrib (3/102).\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Miraculous Language of the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Noble Quran is a sign from Allah, the Exalted and Praised, and Allah has placed within it many signs of truth. Among the signs of its truthfulness and proofs that it is from Allah, the Exalted, are the unique phonetic properties not found in any other text. Indeed, the Quran contains phonetic styles that are unmatched elsewhere.\nDr. Muhammad Daraz says, \"Let the proficient reciter read the Quran; recite it properly, descending upon the inclination of the Quran, and not imposing his own inclinations upon it. Then distance yourself from him to a remote place where you do not hear the ringing of its letters, but you hear its movements and stillness, its elongations and melodies, its connections and pauses, then lend your ear to this phonetic collection, made exclusive and released plainly into the air. You will find yourself facing a strange and wonderful melody; you will not find it in any other speech even if it were rendered exclusive and refined in this manner.\nYou will find a harmony and unity that captivates your hearing as music and poetry do, yet it is not the tunes of music, nor the patterns of rhythm of poetry, and you will find something else that you do not find in music or poetry. That is because you listen to a poem and find its rhythm unified line by line, and part by part, and you listen to a piece of music and find its moods similar and going in a close direction; so your hearing soon rejects it, and your nature tires of it, if it is repeated and recited to you with one signature.\nWhereas with the Quran, you are always in a varied and renewed melody, moving between causes and pegs and pauses in different positions, each string of your heart's chords taking an equal share, so that no matter how often it is repeated, it does not bring you boredom or weariness, but you constantly seek more of it,\" End quote.\n\"An-Naba' Al-Adhim\" (p. 133 - 134).\nHe also mentioned the beauty of the articulation points of the letters, saying, \"If you bring your ear a little closer, the jewels of its letters coming out from their correct articulation points will strike your hearing, surprising you with another pleasure in the arrangement of those letters and their lining up, and the ordering of their positions among themselves; this one taps and that one whistles, a third whispers and a fourth declares loudly, another lets the breath slide over it, and another holds the breath. And so on, you see the linguistic beauty manifest before you in a different yet harmonious collection, without rattling or babbling, without softness or harshness, without discord or repulsion.\nThus, you see speech that is neither the bland urban nor the rough Bedouin, but you see it having blended within it the robustness and grandeur of the desert with the delicacy and fluidity of the city, and the matter is measured in such a way that neither exceeds the other. It is as if it is the essence of the two languages, and their progeny, or as if it is the point of contact between the tribes, where their tastes meet, and upon it their hearts agree,\" End quote.\n\"An-Naba' Al-Adhim\" (p. 135).\nSecondly:\nThere is a correlation between the parts of the Noble Quran, which scholars refer to as the coherence between the verses and Surahs. This coherence may be between one Surah and another, between the beginning of a Surah and the one following it, between the verses of a single Surah, and between the beginning and end of a Surah.\n\"And there is not a Surah except that it has its own (landmarks) that distinguish it, whether they are short or long Surahs, and the shorter the Surahs, the greater this characteristic becomes. This is clear from the fact that Allah, the Exalted, did not make the short Surahs a single independent Surah except for a great wisdom, which is the independence of each one of them with what distinguishes it from others.\"\nSee: \"Misbah Ad-Durar fi Tanasub Ayat Al-Quran Al-Karim wa As-Suwar\" (p. 93).\nThere is also a close proximity between the topics of the Surahs and their objectives, as each Surah of the Quran has a purpose and goal, that is, a significance to which the meanings of the Surah and its content return, and represents its spirit that flows through all its parts.\nThe objective may be the same as the topic of the Surah, or the objective may differ from the topic, in that a single Surah may have a number of topics, and these topics return to one objective.\nKnowing the topics of the Surah and its objective is one of the most important aids to contemplating the Surah and realizing its miraculous nature, because you find that despite the different topics of the Surah, it leads to one goal in a harmony that compels the observer to deem it impossible for this speech to be of human origin.\nThe search for the topics of the Surah and its objective requires certain matters:\nThe most important of which are: understanding the meanings of the Surah, realizing the appropriateness between the verses, and realizing the appropriateness between the Surah and what precedes and follows it. All this makes the reader of the Quran more attentive to what he recites and more present in understanding it.\nAmong the important books in this field are:\n1- Asma' Suwar Al-Quran wa Fada'iliha, Dr. Munirah Al-Dosari, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi, it is an important book in its field.\n2- An-Naba' Al-Adhim, Dr. Muhammad Daraz, Tafakkur Center.\n3- Muhtawayah Suwar Al-Quran Al-Karim, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Taweel, Dar Al-Watan.\n4- Dalail An-Nizam, by the teacher Abdul Hamid Al-Farahi.\n5- Al-Burhan fi Tanasub Surah Al-Quran, by Imam Ibn Zubair Al-Gharnati, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi.\n6- At-Tanasub bayna As-Suwar fi Al-Muftatah wa Al-Khawatim, Dr. Fadil Al-Samarrai, Dar Ibn Kathir.\nAnd among the Tafsirs that have taken care of highlighting these aspects are:\n1- Nazm Al-Durar fi Tanasub Al-Ayat wa As-Suwar, by Imam Al-Biqa`i.\n2- At-Tahrir wa At-Tanwir, by Imam Al-Tahir Ibn Ashur.\n3- Masu`at At-Tafsir Al-Mawdu`i, University of Sharjah.\nAnd see: \"Ad-Dalil ila Al-Quran,\" Amr Al-Sharqawi (p. 78).\nThirdly:\nWe have not been able to personally examine the details of the attempts mentioned in the question, nor have we seen anything of them.\nHowever, we mention here some general methodological alerts, which we summarize as follows:\n1- One should not force oneself to research the characteristics of letters and their connection to the word and then the position of this word in the sentence, because this may obscure the main purpose of the Quran, which is to be a book of guidance.\n2- It must be known that this is merely one of the delicacies of the Quran, and its seasoning, and not from the solid knowledge, nor from the general objectives of the Noble Quran, nor the central meanings it brought; rather, it is closer to being, if correct, from the superficial layer as the scholar (Daraz) expresses.\n3- Writing in such a field, and the possibility of contributing one's own insights, requires special knowledge and tools; the most important of which are specialization in phonetic studies and related sciences, then proficiency in the sciences of Arabic morphology and rhetoric; and such is not attainable by everyone, so the matter should be put in its proper place, and one should not undertake what one has no knowledge of, nor should one pretend to be an expert in a field for which the tools of research and examination are not complete, even if one's tools of research and examination were complete.\n4- If something of this is established for a person, there is no harm in speaking of it, but as his own ijtihad, which should be presented to the solid knowledge, its essence, and its core; and one should not exaggerate in this so that it is said to be from the \"miraculous nature,\" lest the Word of Allah and its miraculous nature be exposed to speculation and debate, as has happened with those concerned with examining aspects of the \"scientific miracles\" of the Noble Quran; and indeed, both extremes in intending matters are reprehensible!!\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Quranic Challenge to the Jinn",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Quran is the Speech of Allah, spoken by Him with His letters and meanings, as He, the Exalted, said (translation of the meaning): {And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the Words of All\u0101h [i.e., the Quran]. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.}\u00a0(At-Tawbah:6).\nIn the Quran, there are statements of various peoples that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has mentioned, including the believers like the prophets and the truthful, and the disbelievers, like Pharaoh and Qarun, and the hypocrites, as well as the angels, the jinn, the birds like the hoopoe, the ants, and others.\nThe purpose of mentioning these statements is to convey the meaning and not necessarily the exact wording. Sometimes the conveyed message is the exact wording, and sometimes it is the meaning, especially if it is impossible for it to be the exact wording, such as when the speaker is not speaking in Arabic. This has been explicitly stated by more than one of the scholars:\nZain Ad-Din Ar-Razi Al-Hanafi said in \"Questions and Answers on the Oddities of the Verses of Revelation\" (p. 144): \"If it is asked: How did Allah, the Exalted, narrate here the speech of the sorcerers who believed and of Pharaoh (translation of the meaning): {They said, 'We believe in the Lord of the worlds'} to the saying of Allah: {And cause us to die as Muslims}, then narrated this meaning in Surah Taha and Surah Ash-Shu`ara with additions and omissions in the words attributed to them, when this event only occurred once, so how did their expression differ in it?\nWe say: The answer to this is that they spoke in their language, not in Arabic, and Allah, the Exalted, narrated that from them in Arabic several times, for a wisdom that necessitated repetition and reiteration, which we will explain in Surah Ash-Shu`ara, Allah willing. So, at one time He narrated it matching their wording in the translation, taking care of the wording, and after that, He narrated it by meaning, following the custom of the Arabs in varying speech and differing in their styles; so as not to bore if it was merely repetitive.\" End quote.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in \"At-Tis`iniyyah\" (2/464): \"Indeed, the letters and sounds that Moses heard were Hebrew, and those that Allah mentioned about him in the Quran were Arabic. If speech were merely letters and sounds, there would be no commonality at all between the speech that Moses heard and that which Allah mentioned that he heard. Thus, reporting that he heard these sounds, which he did not hear, would be a lie.\nLikewise, all those whom Allah narrated in the Quran that they spoke from the previous nations who spoke languages other than Arabic, they spoke in their languages, and Allah narrated that in the language in which the Quran was revealed, which is Arabic. And the Speech of Allah is truth. If their speech was just letters and sounds, and the letters and sounds they said are not like these, then it would not be possible to narrate from them at all. Rather, their speech was letters and meanings, so Allah narrated that from them in another language, and the letters follow the meanings, and the meanings are the main intended purpose, as the speech of all creatures is translated.\" End quote.\nAt-Tahir said: \"The meaning of the statement here is: to convey their intention to those they want to reach among their kind, in the manner in which they understand each other,\" At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (29/220).\nAnd he said: \"This is narrated from the speech of the jinn,\" At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (29/222).\nIn summary, what this ignorant objector mentioned only demonstrates his ignorance, narrow-mindedness, and poor understanding.\nIf Allah's narration of the speech of the jinn or humans, whether believers or disbelievers, in His Book, meant that those whom Allah narrated from them said \"Quran,\" then that would mean that all these humans, and the jinn, had brought forth a Quran from themselves, and then Allah transmitted this Quran in \"His Quran\"; then He challenged them to produce something like it.\nThis could not be from the weakest of people in intellect; rather, it is only imagined and found problematic by someone who is ignorant, who does not know the places of argument, and the aspects of speech.\nAnd it is astonishing that anyone would believe such nonsense, be disturbed by it, and think there is a real problem!!\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Belief of the Salaf Concerning the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cThe belief of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) concerning the Quran is like their belief in all the Names and Attributes of Allah, which is a belief that is based on what is indicated by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah (traditions) of His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him).\u00a0\nWe all know that Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, has described the Quran as being His Word and that it was sent down from Him. Allah, may He be Sxalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd if any of the polytheists seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Quran), and then escort him to where he can be secure.\u201d [At-Tawbah 9:6]\nUndoubtedly what is meant by the Word of Allah here is the Noble Quran .\nAnd He, may He be exalted, says:\n\u201cVerily, this Quran narrates to the Children of Israel most of that about which they differ.\u201d [An-Naml 27:76]\nSo the Quran is the Word of Allah in both wording and meaning. Allah spoke it in a real sense and gave it to Jibril (peace be upon him) the trustworthy, then Jibril brought it down to the heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that he might be one of the warners, in a plain Arabic tongue.\u00a0\nThe Salaf believe that the Quran was revealed ; Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, revealed it to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) piecemeal, i.e., bit by bit, over twenty-three years, in accordance with the Wisdom of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\u00a0\nMoreover, some of the revelation was revealed for a specific reason for which it was sent down, and some of it was revealed without a specific reason. Moreover, some of it was revealed to tell of something that happened to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions. Some of it was revealed concerning Shar`i (legal) rulings, according to what the scholars have said concerning this matter.\u00a0\nThen the Salaf say that the Quran is from Allah in the first place and it will return (to Him) at the end of time. This is the view of the Salaf concerning the Noble Quran.\u00a0\nIt is clear to us that Allah has described the Noble Quran in superlative terms. He has described it as wise (Hakim), noble (Karim), great (`Adhim), and glorious (Majid).\u00a0\nThese qualities, in terms of which Allah has described His Book, may be attainable by one who adheres to this Book and acts upon it both inwardly and outwardly. Allah will give him some share of glory, greatness, wisdom, honour and authority that is not given to the one who does not adhere to the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\u00a0\nHence I call all Muslims, rulers and ruled, scholars and ordinary folk, to adhere to the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, both inwardly and outwardly, so that they may attain honour, happiness and glory, and prevail in the east and in the west.\u201d (Fatawa Kibar `Ulama Al-Ummah)\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Repetition of stories in the Quran with different wording",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The repetition of stories and their wording in the Holy Quran, but in different contexts and synonymous wording, is one of the obvious characteristics of Quranic story-telling, as one story may be repeated in more than one surah, and each time it is told in a different context and different style. Thus the story is repeated with new phrases which give different shades of meaning and offer new lessons, in various eloquent styles. Hence the scholars and commentators regarded this variation in wording and phrases as one of the aspects of eloquence, and they stated that one of the objectives of the Quranic stories is that one incident may be mentioned in different contexts. They even wrote books devoted to this technique, one of which is the book al-Muqtanis fi Fawa\u2019id Tikrar al-Qasas, by Badr al-Din ibn Jama\u2018ah, which was mentioned by al-Suyuti in al-Itqan (2/184).\nAl-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Presenting the same idea with different techniques and styles is quite clearly a sign of eloquence.\"(Al-Burhan fi \u2018Ulum al-Quran\u00a03/26).\nIf we want to count the benefits that this variation in presentation may add to the beauty of the Quran, we would list many such benefits. We will mention some of them below:\n1.\nAdding some details that were not mentioned in other contexts. The example mentioned in the question is one type of these benefits. The verses in Surat al-Hijr add a more specific description of the material from which Adam (peace be upon him) was created, which is the fact that he was created from dry clay, made from black mud moulded into shape, which was not mentioned in the verses of Surat al-A\u2018raf which refer to the same idea.\n2.\nConfirming the challenge that the Quran brought to the polytheist Arabs, to produce something like what is in the Quran. This variation in presenting one idea exposed their inability to produce anything like it in any style and in any words they could come up with.\n3.\nEnlivening the story so that the reader will not get bored with it. That is because a new variation in presentation of the story makes one more attentive and more inclined to listen, and it keeps the reader engaged and interested when reading this holy text. This is also one of the greatest objectives. Thus the eloquent person will find himself inclined to listen to it, because of the natural human inclination to move between a variety of things, each of which gives its own pleasure.\n4.\nPresenting one topic in an amazing way when it is presented in different styles. The polytheists at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were amazed at how often these stories were repeated, in a different style every time, even though the topic was the same. Thus Allah, may He be glorified, showed them that what they were amazed at was produced by One Whose power is infinite and Whose words cannot be counted.\n5.\nCreating harmony between the topic and the context in which the story is presented. Sometimes the context requires highlighting some aspect of the story in the discussion that takes place therein, that did not need to be highlighted in another context in which the same story was mentioned. This reason is one of the bases of the eloquence of the Quran and its miraculous nature. It is discussed in more detail in some books of Tafsir.\nYou can read about these benefits and others in the book al-Burhan fi \u2018Ulum al-Quran (3/26-29).\nDr. Fadl Hasan \u2018Abbas (may Allah have mercy on him) says: The storytelling method in the Holy Quran is a brilliant and miraculous method, as a story may be mentioned in many surahs. Although some surahs may mention a single detail from the story, other scenes and incidents are mentioned in other surahs in which the same story is mentioned, whether there are many events in the story or few. Thus in each surah you will find a detail of the story that you do not find elsewhere, and each surah mentions some detail that is appropriate to the topic and context of that surah. Thus the story is mentioned in the surahs in a particular place in each surah that is appropriate for it.\"(Al-Qasas al-Qurani\u00a0 81).\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Can the basmalah be recited in the middle of a surah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that if a person recites the basmalah when beginning his reading of Quran in the middle of a surah, that is not recommended, because Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{When you recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan}\u00a0[An-Nahl 16:98].\nHe did not instruct us to say anything else. Therefore so long as there is a specific text concerning the matter which states that what is required from the one who wants to read Quran is to seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan, this text makes specific what is mentioned in general terms in the hadith, \u201cEvery important matter that does not start with \u2018Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful), is devoid of blessings.\u201d End quote.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\nLiqa\u2019at al-Bab al-Maftuh (1/177)."

It is permissible for a person to write Quran with ink that it is permissible to drink, then to put the written paper in water and shake it, then drink it. Some of the early generations used to do that, and they would do it using vessels such as bowls and the like. If a person does that, he has a precedent for doing it. The evidence quoted for doing that is the general meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We send down of the Quran that which is healing and mercy for the believers}\u00a0[al-Isra\u2019 17:82].\nSo if healing is sought by means of the Quran in this manner, and it is tried and turns out to be beneficial, then it is included in the general meaning of this verse.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\n(Al-Liqa\u2019 al-Maftuh (p. 112)."

        "question": "When were Surat al-Falaq and Surat an-Nas revealed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadiths indicate that the Mu\u2018awwidhatayn (Al-Falaq) and An-Nas) were revealed in Madinah.\nThis is mentioned in the hadith of \u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018Amir, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cDo you not see verses that have been revealed tonight, the like of which has never been seen? {Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak} [Al-Falaq 113] and {Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind} [An-Nas 114].\u201d\n\u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) accompanied the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Madinah, and these two surahs were revealed after the bewitching incident.\n\u2018Abd ibn Humayd narrated in al-Muntakhab (1/228): Ahmad ibn Yunus told me: Abu Mu\u2018awiyah told us, from al-A\u2018mash, from Yazid ibn Hayyan, from Zayd ibn Arqam, who said: A Jewish man bewitched the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he fell sick. Jibril came to him, bringing down al-Mu\u2018awwidhatayn, and said: A Jewish man has bewitched you, and the item used for witchcraft is in the well of So-and-so. So he sent \u2018Ali, who brought it to him, then he instructed him to untie the knots and recite verses, so he started reciting and untying, until the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up as if he had been released from restraints. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say anything to that Jewish man about what he had done to him, and he never confronted him with it.\nThe narrators of this isnad are trustworthy (thiqat); it was classed as sahih by the commentators on the book, and by Shaykh al-Albani in as-SIlsilah as-Sahihah (6/617).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said:\nHe said: Because of that, al-Mu\u2018aawidhatayn were revealed. End quote.\nThis was narrated by ath-Tha\u2018labi from Ibn \u2018Abbas in a mu\u2018allaq report, and from \u2018A\u2019ishah, also in a mu\u2018allaq report.\nThe isnad going back to \u2018A\u2019ishah is sahih. It was narrated by Sufyan ibn \u2018Uyaynah in his Tafsir from Abu \u2018Ubaydillah, from Hisham ibn \u2018Urwah, from his father, from \u2018A\u2019ishah. In it, it says: And {Qul a\u2018udhu bi Rabb il-falaq} [Surat al-Falaq] was revealed.\"(At-Talkhis al-Habir\u00a0 6/2689).\nAs for the number of knots being eleven, no sahih hadith has been narrated concerning that.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs-Suhayli stated that the number of knots was eleven, so it was appropriate that the number of verses of the Mu\u2018awwidhatayn should be eleven, so that with every verse, one knot was undone.\nI say: al-Bayhaqi narrated in ad-Dala\u2019il something similar with a da\u2018if isnad, in the story in which it is said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was bewitched\u2026 At the end of the hadith, it says that they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and Surat al-Falaq and Surat an-Nas were revealed, so every time he recited a verse, one knot came undone.\nIbn Sa\u2018d narrated with a munqati\u2018 (interrupted) isnad from Ibn \u2018Abbas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent \u2018Ali and \u2018Ammar, and they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and he mentioned a similar report.\"(At-Talkhis al-Habir\u00a06/2689-2690).\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on writing verses of the Qur\u2019an on walls and the front of houses",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not prescribed to write Qur\u2019anic verses on walls, and it is disliked (makruh) according to the majority of scholars; some of them described it as haram.\nIbn al-Humam (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fath al-Qadir (1/169): It is disliked (makruh) to write Qur\u2019an and the names of Allah, may He be exalted, on coins, mihrabs, walls and furnishings. End quote.\nAd-Dardir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ash-Sharh al-Kabir (1/425):\nWhat appears to be the case is that engraving [of Qur\u2019anic verses] is disliked, even Qur\u2019an [on graves]. And it should be regarded as haram, because it could lead to mishandling and disrespect, as they said.\nAn example of that is engraving Qur\u2019an and the names of Allah on walls. End quote.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Rawdat at-Talibin (1/80): It is makruh to write it on walls, whether in the mosque or elsewhere, and on garments. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on writing verses and hadiths on the walls of mosques? He replied: That is a distraction to people.\nAs for writing verses on walls, whether in the mosque or elsewhere, it is an innovation (bid\u2018ah) and there is no report from the Companions to suggest that they used to engrave verses on their walls.\nMoreover, engraving verses on walls is a kind of disrespect towards the words of Allah. Hence we find some of them writing verses in a calligraphic style to look like castles, minarets, mosques and the like, shaping the words to make them look like a castle. Undoubtedly this is toying with the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nFurthermore, even if we assume that the words are written in clear Arabic writing, this is not the way of the righteous early generations.\nWhat benefit can there be in writing verses on walls?\nSome people say that it will be a reminder for people. We say: Reminding is done by spoken words, not by writing the verses.\nMoreover, sometimes they write on the walls {And do not spy or backbite each other} [al-Hujurat 49:12], and you will find that those who are sitting underneath this verse are gossiping and backbiting people, so it is as if they are mocking the verses of Allah.\nTherefore writing verses in mosques and on the walls of houses all comes under the heading of innovation (bid\u2018ah), as it is something that was not known at the time of the righteous early generations.\nAs for writing hadiths in the mosque, if it is in the direction of the qiblah, then undoubtedly it is a distraction, because people, even some of the worshippers who are standing behind the imam during the prayer, may steal glances at it. The scholars regard it as disliked to write anything in the qiblah of the mosque.\nIf that is done in houses, there is nothing wrong with writing a hadith [on the wall] if there is some benefit in it, such as the supplication offered as expiation for a gathering (kaffarat al-majlis): \u201cSubhanak Allahumma rabbana wa bi hamdik, ashhadu an la ilaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk (Glory and praise be to you, O Allah our Lord. I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except You. I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You),\u201d then this serves as a reminder.\"(Liqa\u2019 al-Bab al-Maftuh\u00a0197/13).\nSee also the answer to question no. 254, in which there is a discussion of the negative consequences of hanging verses on walls, most of which are also applicable to writing directly on the walls.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to sitting on the roof of the house, which rests on the walls on which, or on parts of which, Qur\u2019an has been written, there is nothing wrong with it, and it is not like sitting on the Qur\u2019an, because who sits on walls?! Rather they sit on the roof, away from the walls.\nAs for your saying \u201canyone who climbs onto the roof of the house feels that he is stepping on that dhikr,\u201d this comes under the heading of waswasah (intrusive thoughts; whispers from the shaytan).\nBeware of getting carried away with it, because waswasah is a serious problem and a great evil; may Allah keep us all safe and sound.\nThe remedy for waswasah is to ignore it and pay no attention to it, whilst also reciting a great deal of dhikr and doing acts of worship.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nRuling on using vocal effects for recitation of Qur\u2019an\nThere is nothing wrong with using enhancers and vocal effects for recitation of Qur\u2019an, if that will not lead to repetition of the sound of letters, or cause them to disappear, or change the rules of tajwid, provided that the reciter is reciting without restricting himself to a certain maqam (mode or scale) or tune.\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: One of the imams of the mosques is asking: We heard you talking about vocal enhancement (echo); what did you say?\nHe said: What we said was that if this vocal enhancement (echo) leads to repeating the sound of the letter, then it is haram, because it is adding something to the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and that is not permissible.\nBut if it does not lead to repeating the sound, then we examine the matter further: If it makes the reciter\u2019s voice sound like the voice of a singer, then it is also not allowed, but in this case we cannot say definitively that it is haram, because there is no addition to the wording of the Qur\u2019an. This is what we say about these enhancements.\nMoreover, we say: O brothers, what matters is not the tune that moves you and you find pleasurable; rather what matters is to focus with humility (and be moved by the words of the Qur\u2019an). How many people recite without a microphone, let alone vocal enhancements, but it is more conducive to focus and reflection for him and for his listeners.\"(Liqa\u2019 al-Bab al-Maftuh\u00a0 109/14).\nSecondly:\nUsing auto-tune for recitation of Qur\u2019an\nAuto-tune is a sound-purifying tool which works to enhance the sound, cancel any distortion and alter the pitch of the sound.\nThe ruling on reciting with maqamat (modes or scales) has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 169799 .\nBut it is not permissible to use auto-tune, even if the reciter does not pay attention to maqamat and does not restrict himself to that, because of what it leads to of omitting some vowels and even some letters, let alone some rules of tajwid, according to what some specialists have told us.\nShaykh Sulayman al-Majid (may Allah preserve him) was asked: What is the ruling on using filters and vocal effects for recitation of Qur\u2019an, such as what are known as auto-tune filters? I hope you will answer my question, may Allah bless you.\nHe replied: It is not permissible to introduce these vocal effects into recitation of Qur\u2019an. End quote.\nAnd Allah knows best."

But if the interruption is lengthy, then it is Sunnah for him to repeat the isti\u2018aadhah.\nAz-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is recommended (mustahabb) to seek refuge with Allah (isti\u2018aadhah) before starting to recite, then if he stops reading with the intention of not resuming then later on he wants to resume, he should repeat the isti\u2018aadhah.\nIf he interrupts it for an excuse and has resolved to go back to it, the first isti\u2018aadhah is sufficient, so long as the interruption is not lengthy.\" (Al-Burhaan fi \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019an\u00a0 1/460).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo\u2018 (3/281):\nOne isti\u2018aadhah is sufficient, so long as he did not interrupt his recitation by speaking or remaining silent for a long time.\nIf he interrupts it with one of these two, then he should repeat the isti\u2018aadhah.\nIf he does the prostration of recitation then carries on reading or reciting, he does not need to repeat the isti\u2018aadhah, because this is not an interruption, or it is only a brief interruption. This was stated by al-Mutawalli. End quote.\nBut if he interrupted it for a reason having to do with his reading, such as asking a question or seeking an explanation of the verses that he is reading and the like, he does not have to repeat the isti\u2018aadhah. Ibn al-Jazari said in an-Nashr (1/259):\nIf the reader interrupts his reading for a reason, such as pausing to offer a supplication, or to say something that has to do with what he is reading, he does not have to repeat the isti\u2018aadhah. End quote.\nIf he repeats the isti\u2018aadhah after interrupting his reading by saying something that has nothing to do with the recitation \u2013 such as greeting someone with salaam \u2013 that is good.\nAn-Nawawi said in at-Tibyaan (p. 124):\nIf he is reciting whilst walking, and passes by some people, it is recommended (mustahabb) to interrupt his recitation and treat them with salaam, then go back to his recitation.

So it is not permissible for anyone who does not have Wudu to touch it.\u00a0\nAs for the cover that is separate from the Mus-haf , like the sleeve in which the Mus-haf is placed to protect it, there is nothing wrong with touching it without Wudu.\nIt says in\u00a0Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah:\u00a0\n\u201cThe majority of jurists \u2013 Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi`is and Hanbalis \u2013 are of the view that it is not allowed for one who is not in a state of purity to touch the cover of the Mus-haf that is attached to it, or the margins on which there is no writing on the pages of the Mus-haf, or the white spaces between the lines, and the same applies to pages that are free of any writing at all. That is because they are part of the book. Some of the Hanafis and Shafa`is are of the view that that is permissible.\u201d\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cIt is not permissible for the Muslim to touch the Mus-haf unless he is in a state of purity and free of both major and minor impurity. The same applies to moving it from one place to another, if the one who is moving it is not in a state of purity.\nBut if he touches it or moves it with a barrier, such as if he picks it up in a wrapper or sleeve, and the like, there is nothing wrong with that. As for touching it directly when he is not in a state of purity, that is not permissible according to the correct view, which is the view of the majority of scholars, for the reasons mentioned above.\u00a0\nAs for reciting or reading, there is nothing wrong with him reciting it from memory even if he is in a state of minor impurity , or reading when someone else hold the Quran for him and prompts him; there is nothing wrong with that.\" (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz\u00a0 10/149-150)\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "The sending down of the Quran began on Laylat al-Qadr in Ramadan, but fasting was not enjoined until the second year AH",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Quran was revealed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at the beginning of his mission, and the first revelation came in the month of Ramadan, on Laylat al-Qadr, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, We sent the Quran down during the Night of Decree}\u00a0[al-Qadr 97:1]\n{Ha, Meem.\nBy the clear Book. \nIndeed, We sent it down during a blessed night. Indeed, We were to warn [mankind]}\u00a0[ad-Dukhaan 44:1-3].\nThen it continued to be sent down piecemeal until shortly before the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [it is] a Quran which We have separated [by intervals] that you might recite it to the people over a prolonged period. And We have sent it down progressively}\u00a0[al-Isra\u2019 17:106].\nFasting was not enjoined at that time; rather fasting was not enjoined until the second year AH \u2013 in other words, fifteen years after the revelation of the Quran began.\nSo there is no connection between the sending down of the Quran and fasting.\nRather the connection is between the Quran and the month of Ramadan and Laylat al-Qadr. The month of Ramadan was known before the Prophet's mission began and afterwards, as were all the other [Arabic] months.\nThere is no connection between Laylat al-Qadr and fasting, because Laylat al-Qadr is a night in the month of Ramadan, which was known before fasting was enjoined.\nWhat appears to be the case is that this is the reason for your question, which is that you think that there is a connection between Laylat al-Qadr and fasting, and you have not borne in mind the fact that this night and the month in which it occurs were known even before fasting was enjoined.\nTo sum up:\nThe sending down of the Quran began in Ramadan of the first year of the Prophet\u2019s mission, and continued for 23 years.\nWith regard to fasting, it was enjoined approximately fifteen years after the Prophet\u2019s mission began \u2013 that is, after the first words of the Quran were revealed \u2013 and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fasted nine Ramadans; during these years, the Quran continued to be revealed.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words of Allah, may He be exalted, {Indeed, We sent it down} refer to the Quran. It is not mentioned by name in this soorah because what is being referred to is clear, and the entire Quran is like a single soorah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Quran}\u00a0[al-Baqarah 2:185]\n{Ha, Meem.\nBy the clear Book. \nIndeed, We sent it down during a blessed night}\u00a0[ad-Dukhaan 44:1-3]\n\u2013 what is meant is on Laylat al-Qadr.\nAsh-Sha\u2018bi said: What is meant is: We began to send it down on Laylat al-Qadr.\nAnd it was said: Rather Jibreel (peace be upon him) brought it all down at once on Laylat al-Qadr, from al-Lawh al-Mahfooz to the lowest heaven, to Bayt al-'Izzah, and Jibreel dictated it to the angelic scribes, then Jibreel brought it down to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) piecemeal, and between the first and the last of it there were twenty-three years. This was stated by Ibn 'Abbaas.\" (Tafseer at-Tabari\u00a0 20/129).\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: The Battle of Badr took place in Ramadan of the second year AH, and during that year fasting was made obligatory.\" (Fath al-Baari\u00a0 1/50).\nFor more information on the sending down of the Quran piecemeal, please see the answer to question no. 180883 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "The final review of the Qur\u2019an, and was any Qur\u2019an revealed after that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat is meant by the review is that Jibreel reviewed the Qur\u2019an with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) every year in Ramadan.\nIt was narrated from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah that Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: He [the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] told me: Jibreel used to review the Qur\u2019an every year with him once or twice, but this year he reviewed it with him twice. He said: \u201cI think that my death has drawn near, so fear Allah and be patient, for what a good example I am for you.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (2450).\nAccording to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari (3624), \u201cJibreel used to review the Qur\u2019an with me once every year, but this year he has reviewed it with me twice, and I think that my death is approaching, and you [Faatimah] will be the first of my family to join me.\u201d So I [Faatimah] wept, then he said: \u201cDoes it not please you that you will be the leader of the women of Paradise, or of the believing women.\u201d So I smiled at that.\nAmong the Sahaabah, \u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018ood and Zayd ibn Thaabit witnessed this review.\nIbn Katheer said: What is meant by Jibreel\u2019s reviewing the Qur\u2019an with him every year is that he checked it to make sure that it was exactly as he had brought it down to him from Allah, may He be exalted, so that what was meant to remain would remain and what had been abrogated would not remain. This review was by way of verifying, ensuring and preserving, therefore the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reviewed it with Jibreel twice in the last year of his life, and Jibreel reviewed it with him. From this, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) understood that the time of his death was approaching.\n\u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) compiled the master copy of the Mushaf on the basis of this final review.\nRamadan was chosen out of all of the months for this review, because the beginning of the revelation occurred during that month. Hence it is recommended (mustahabb) to study the Qur\u2019an and recite it repeatedly in Ramadan, and the leading scholars strove hard in reciting the Qur\u2019an in that month.\" (Tafseer Ibn Katheer\u00a0 1/51).\nSecondly:\nThere is no cause for confusion in the fact that this annual review did not cover the entire Qur\u2019an every single year, because the revelation of the Qur\u2019an had not yet been completed. This is clear.\nThat is also applicable to what happened during the final review in Ramadan: the review was only of what had been revealed up to that point, and there is nothing to rule out that something could be revealed after Ramadan or after the final review of the Qur\u2019an, that was not included in that review.\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The hadith indicates that the word Qur\u2019an may refer to some of it or most of it, because at the time of the first review in the first Ramadan after the Prophet\u2019s mission began, only some of the Qur\u2019an had been revealed. Then it went on like that every Ramadan after it, until the final Ramadan, in which all of the Qur\u2019an had been revealed except that which was delayed and was revealed after that particular Ramadan.\nFrom 10 AH and until the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died in Rabee\u2018 al-Awwal 11 AH, one of the verses that were revealed during that time was the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{This day I have perfected for you your religion}\u00a0[al-Maa\u2019idah 5:3].\nThis verse was revealed on the day of \u2018Arafah, when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was in \u2018Arafah, according to scholarly consensus.\nIt is as if what was revealed during those days, because it was so little compared to what had already been revealed, was overlooked as far as reviewing it was concerned.\" (Fath al-Baari\u00a0 9/44).\nFor more information on the issue of the final review of the Qur\u2019an, please see: al-\u2018Ardah al-Akheerah: Dalaalaatuha wa Atharuha, by Dr. Naasir al-Quthaami, Chair in Qur\u2019anic Sciences.\nAnd Allah knows best."

Some people choose this sound to be Qur\u2019an, the adhaan, a du\u2018aa\u2019 or a beneficial nasheed, and some choose it to be a song or music, and so on.\nIn principle, there is nothing wrong with this service, so long as the sound that the caller chooses is something permissible.\nIt is not permissible for this sound to be music or indecent songs, because of the proof that songs and music are haraam. This has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 5000 .\nWith regard to choosing the sound of a qaari\u2019 reciting Qur\u2019an, this may be a type of disrespect towards the Holy Qur\u2019an, because Allah, may He be exalted, sent down the Qur\u2019an to be read, reflected upon, recited as an act of worship and acted upon.\nThe words of Allah, may He be exalted, are too great for us to make them simply a means of passing the time or to alert us to something.\nSimilarly, with regard to the adhaan, it was prescribed to alert people to the best and most important act of worship in Islam, namely the prayer, so it is deserving of appropriate respect and veneration. Therefore it should not be used for this service.\nWith regard to du\u2018aa\u2019, the matter is more lenient.\nShaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserving) was asked: What is your opinion on those who put the adhaan or recitation of the Holy Qur\u2019an as ring tones on their mobile phones instead of music?\nHe replied: This is disrespectful towards the adhaan, dhikr and the Noble Qur\u2019an; they should not be used as alarms, and the Qur\u2019an should not be used as an alarm.\u00a0\nIt may be said: This is better than music. Do you have to use music? Ignore music, and put some other sound that will alert you, in which there is no music or Qur\u2019an, and it will simply alert you.\nEnd quote from Majallat ad-Da\u2018wah, issue no. 2097.\nSee also the answer to question no. 34494 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Definition of al-Mufassal in the Quran, and the long and short soorahs of al-Mufassal",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nAl-Mufassal refers to the short soorahs of the Quran which have many breaks between them, in which the Basmalah (\u201cBismillah al-Rahmaan al-Raheem\u201d) appears. They are called mufassal (divided) because a lot of breaks appear in them.\u00a0\nThere was a difference of scholarly opinion concerning the definition of al-Mufassal. Does it begin from Soorat Qaaf or from al-Hujuraat? There was also a difference of opinion as to which soorahs are regarded as long, medium and short. There are several opinions:\u00a0\nIn al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah (33/48) it says: They differed concerning al-Mufassal. The Hanafis are of the view that the long soorahs of al-Mufassal start with al-Hujuraat and end with al-Burooj; the medium soorahs begin there and end with al-Bayyinah; and the short soorahs begin there and go to the end of the Quran.\u00a0\nThe Maalikis said that the long soorahs of al-Mufassal start with al-Hujuraat and end with al-Naazi\u2018aat; the medium soorahs begin with \u2018Abasa and end with al-Duha; and the short soorahs begin with al-Duha, until the end of the Quran.\u00a0\nThe Shaafa\u2018is said: The long soorahs of al-Mufassal are soorahs such as al-Hujuraat, al-Qamar and al-Rahmaan; the medium soorahs are soorahs such as al-Shams and al-Layl; and the short soorahs are soorahs such as al-\u2018Asr and Qul Huwa Allah Ahad (al-Ikhlaas),\u00a0\nThe Hanbalis are of the view that al-Mufassal begins with Soorah Qaaf, because of the hadith of Aws ibn Hudhayfah who said: I asked the companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah upon him) how they divided the Quran. They said, Three and five and seven and nine and eleven and thirteen, and Hizb al-Mufassal [This refers to the number of soorahs in each hizb or portion of Quran. Thus the first hizb contains the first three soorahs, the second contains the next five soorahs, and so on. Hizb al-Mufassal is the last portion of the Quran, from Soorat Qaf until the end]. Narrated by Abu Dawood (1396) and Ibn Maajah (1345); its isnaad was classed as hasan by Ibn Katheer in Fadaa\u2019il al-Quran (83) and as da \u2018eef (weak) by al-Albaani in Da\u2018eef Abi Dawood. They said: This implies that the beginning of al-Mufassal is the forty-ninth soorah from the beginning of al-Baqarah, not from al-Faatihah. The end of the long soorahs is al-Naba\u2019, the medium soorahs go up to al-Duha and the short soorahs go from there to the end of the Quran. End quote.\u00a0\nSee: Fath al-Baari, 2/249; al-Itqaan fi \u2018Uloom al-Quran by al-Suyooti, 1/180\u00a0\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAl-Mufassal starts with Soorah Qaaf and goes to the end of the Quran, according to the sound opinion. It is called mufassal because there many breaks between the soorahs, where the Basmalah appears, according to the correct opinion. End quote from Fath al-Baari, 2/295. See also Fath al-Baari, 9/43.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWith regard to who first called that al-Mufassal, this name was widespread and well known among the Sahaabah and was narrated in many various hadiths from the Sahaabah.\u00a0\nA man came to Ibn Mas\u2018ood and said: I recited al-Mufassal last night in one rak\u2018ah. He said: This is like the hasty recitation of poetry. I know the pairs of soorahs that the Messenger of Allah (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite in each rak\u2018ah. And he mentioned twenty soorahs from al-Mufassal, two soorahs in each rak\u2018ah.\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (775), Muslim (922).\u00a0\nThe hadiths in which the name al-Mufassal is mentioned are very many and various, in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere, which makes it likely that this name was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Jaabir ibn \u2018Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Mu\u2018aadh used to pray with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then he would go back and lead his people in prayer. [One night] he prayed \u2018Isha\u2019 and started to recite Soorat al-Baqarah, and one man left the congregation (and prayed by himself). It was as if Mu\u2018aadh criticized him. News of that reached the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he said: \u201c[You are] one who puts people off praying in congregation, one who puts people off praying in congregation, one who puts people off praying in congregation roblems,\u201d three times, and he told him to recite two of the medium-length soorahs of al-Mufassal. \u2018Amr - the narrator of the hadith - said: I do not remember them.\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (701) and Muslim (465).\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on memorizing Qur\u2019an using the \u201cfive fortresses\u201d method",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The \u201cfive fortresses\u201d method for memorizing the Qur\u2019an is a method based on a plan for preparing the pages that one wants to memorize, a method for memorizing and a method for reviewing what one has previously memorized.\nIt is a method that includes reading from the Mushaf, listening to a skilled narrator, repeating what one wants to memorize, then reviewing what one has memorized without looking at the Mushaf.\nBased on that, it does not seem that there is anything objectionable about this method. Rather it is a good method that connects the Muslim to the Qur\u2019an on a daily basis, and gets him used to reciting the Qur\u2019an and not forget it. It is well known that educational means and methods of reviewing and memorizing, and the like, are only means of acquiring knowledge and memorizing and reviewing the Holy Qur\u2019an.\nThe ruling on these means is that they are permissible, so long as Islam has not forbidden them.\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a method is not forbidden and it is effective, then there is nothing wrong with it. Means are not the same as objectives, and it is not essential that Islam should state for every means or method that it is permissible or otherwise, because means and methods are innumerable and unlimited, so everything that is a means of achieving good is good.\u00a0End quote from Liqa\u2019 al-Baab (15/30).\nMoreover, when determining whether a particular method is better and choosing it over others, we should look at experience and what is best suited to each individual. What is suitable and beneficial to one person is not always suitable and beneficial for another; rather it may be suitable for someone else, or some other method may be more beneficial for him. So each person should look at what is most suitable for him and will help him. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cStrive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless.\u201d\nAnd Allah knows best."

And none of them should lead the prayer, unless he is leading others like him who cannot pronounce well either.\u00a0\nIbn al-Jazari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever is able to read the words of Allah with correct Arabic pronunciation but he deliberately pronounces it incorrectly like a non-Arab, out of arrogance, stubbornness and complacency, or because he is too proud to go to a scholar who could help him to correct his pronunciation, is undoubtedly falling short and sinning and being dishonest. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cReligion is sincerity: to Allah, to His Book, to His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.\u201d\u00a0\nBut if a person\u2019s tongue will not obey him or he cannot find someone to teach him the correct pronunciation, then Allah does not burden any soul beyond its scope.\u00a0\nEnd quote from al-Nashr fi\u2019l-Qiraa\u2019aat al-\u2018Ashr, 1/299\u00a0\nIt should be noted that Allah has made it easy to memorize and recite Quran, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd We have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?\u201d\u00a0[al-Qamar 54:17]\nHence we see many of our brothers in the countries referred to who are able to pronounce the letters perfectly, better than many of their Arab brothers. So you should strive to learn the correct pronunciation and recite Quran with proper Tajweed, and not despair or give up.\n\u00a0And Allah is the Source of strength."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt was narrated by an-Nasaa\u2019i in as-Sunan al-Kubra (11067) and in \u2018Amal al-Yawm wa\u2019l-Laylah (308), and by at-Taaraani in ad-Du\u2018aa\u2019 (1912) that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never sat in any gathering, or recited Quran, or offered any prayer, but he concluded that with certain words. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I see that you never sit in a gathering, or recite Quran, or offer any prayer, but you conclude it with these words. He said: \u201cYes. Whoever spoke good words, that will be like a seal on what he did of good and whoever spoke ill, it will be an expiation for him: \u201cSubhaanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika, laa ilaaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk (Glory and praise be to you, O Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You).\u201d\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (3164).\nIn this hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained that the dhikr of expiation for a gathering should be said at the end of any gathering in which a man sits, whether it was a gathering of dhikr or a gathering in which there was some ill or idle talk, for if it was a gathering of dhikr, it will be a seal on it for him.\nAs-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant is that it will be an affirmation of what he did of good, and will raise his deed to such a level that Allah will accept it, and it will like a guarantee that it will not be rejected, and if it was otherwise, then it will be an expiation for him. See: Mir\u2018aat al-Mafaateeh (8/204).\nBased on that, it is mustahabb for the Muslim to end any gathering with these words, no matter what kind of gathering it was. If it was a gathering to read Quran or to offer a prayer, or he sat with his friends, or with his family members, or to reconcile between people, or any other gathering, then he wants to leave, he should recite this dhikr just before he gets up to leave, then he should get up.\nSecondly:\nThere is no proven supplication specifically for completing the Quran, neither this supplication nor any other. From what has been explained above, it is clear that this dhikr and du\u2018aa\u2019 is not specifically for completing the Quran or anything else; rather it is general and may be recited in any gathering.\nHowever, the scholars have stated that it is mustahabb to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. An-Nawawi said: It is strongly encouraged (mustahabb)\u00a0 to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. At-Tibyaan fi Aadaab Hamlat al-Quran (159).\nIbn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (2/126): It is mustahabb to gather one\u2019s family and others when completing the Quran to listen to the supplication.\nAhmad said: When Anas completed the Quran, he would gather his family and his children.\nThat was narrated from Ibn Mas\u2018ood and others.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 65581 and 37683 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Interacting with the meanings of Qur\u2019an whilst reciting",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt was narrated that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I prayed with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) one night. He started to recite al-Baqarah, and continued to recite until he completed one hundred verses, and I thought that he would bow. Then he continued until he had recited two hundred verses, and I thought that he would bow. And he continued until he completed it, and I thought he would bow. Then he started to recite an-Nisa\u2019, and he recited, then he bowed, and his bowing was as long as his standing, and he said\u00a0 whilst bowing: Subhaana Rabbiy al-\u2018Azeem (Glory be to my Lord Most Great). Then he prostrated, and his prostration was as long as his bowing, and he said whilst prostrating: Subhaana Rabbiy al-A\u2018laa (Glory be to my Lord Most High). When he came to a verse that spoke of mercy, he prayed for mercy; when he came to a verse that mentioned punishment, he sought refuge with Allah from it; and when he came to a verse that glorified Allah, he glorified Allah.\nNarrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (23261) and by Ibn Khuzaymah in as-Saheeh (586).\nSuch was the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when reciting Qur\u2019an and interacting with the meanings of the verses. This is a type of reflecting and pondering the meaning. As-Suyooti said: It is Sunnah to recite with reflection and pondering the meaning. That is the greatest goal and most important aim, by means of which hearts find comfort and illumination.\nHow that is done: the worshipper should focus on the meaning of the words he is uttering, so that he will think of the meaning of each verse, reflect on the commands and prohibitions, and affirm to himself that he will comply with them. If there is something concerning which he fell short in the past, he should apologize and seek forgiveness. If he comes to a verse that mentions mercy, he should feel hopeful and ask Allah for it; if he comes to a verse that mentions punishment, he should feel concerned and seek refuge with Allah from it; if he comes to a verse that glorifies Allah, he should declare Allah to be above all shortcomings and glorify Him; if he comes to a verse in which there is a supplication, he should turn to Allah and ask of Him.\nEnd quote from al-Itqaan (1/369).\nWith regard to interacting with the meaning of the verses in general terms, there is nothing wrong with that, such as when a person understands the meaning of a verse and feels moved by it, so he says Subhaan Allah (Glory be to Allah) or similar words which show that the verse has had an impact on him, saying words that are appropriate to the context and meaning of the verse.\nBut that is on condition that he does not burden himself with doing that (rather it should come naturally). For we are forbidden to go out of our way to do something that we find burdensome. Moreover, obliging ourselves to say words, even if it is glorification of Allah (tasbeeh) or supplication (du\u2018aa\u2019), every time we come to a verse could interrupt the attention of the one who is listening to the one who says that, if he is listening to the recitation of someone else, or it could interrupt the flow of his recitation, if he himself is the one who is reciting.\nWith regard to interacting with the meanings of the verses in prayer, Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: The best is to remain silent and listen attentively, when the imam is reciting in Maghrib, \u2018Isha\u2019 and Fajr, or in Jumu\u2018ah. The best is to remain silent and listen attentively, so you should not say tasbeeh when hearing the verses that mention glorifying Allah or proclaiming His oneness, and you should not say salawaat when a verse mentions the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSo when the Qur'an is recited, then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy\u201d [al-A\u2018raaf 7:204]. So the best is to listen attentively. But if one sends blessings on the Prophet, or says Subhaan Allah when the names of Allah are mentioned, there is nothing wrong with that, although it is better not to do it, because what is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is that when he recited in a prayer in which recitation is done out loud, he did not pause when he came to a verse that mentions mercy, or a verse that contains a warning, or a verse that mentions the names and attributes of Allah. Rather he would carry on reciting. Therefore it is better for you to listen and not pause or say anything when the imam comes to these verses when he is reciting, or for you to do that when you are reciting in an obligatory prayer.\nIn the case of supererogatory prayers, however, the matter is broader in scope, such as when praying tahajjud at night and the like. When you are reciting, you may pause at a verse that mentions mercy and ask Allah for mercy; and at a verse that mentions a warning and seek refuge with Allah; and at verses which mention the names of Allah and glorify Him; and at verses which mention the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and send blessings on him, and so on. This also applies if you are praying behind an imam in prayers such as Taraweeh and qiyaam in Ramadaan; if the imam pauses to offer supplication, you may offer supplication; or if he pauses to send blessings upon the Prophet, you may also send blessings upon him. But if he carries on reciting, you should keep quiet and listen attentively, because you are enjoined to listen attentively.\nEnd quote from Fataawa Noor \u2018ala ad-Darb, ash-Shuway\u2018ir (12/351).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 85481 and 96028 .\nConclusion:\nBecause this is something that is narrated as a Sunnah practice, to ask for mercy when coming to verses that mention mercy, and seeking refuge with Allah when coming to verses that mention punishment, and glorifying Allah when coming to verses that mention glorifying Him, then it is something that is undoubtedly prescribed, outside of prayer.\nWhen one is praying, however, it is prescribed in general terms, although the scholars differed as to whether that applies only to the supererogatory prayers, because that is what is mentioned in the Sunnah, or whether it may be applied by analogy to the obligatory prayers too, which is the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baaz and other scholars, as has been explained previously on our website.\nAs for going beyond that, and working out a supplication for every verse, what appears to be the case is that this is not prescribed, especially in the prayer, because of what it involves of overburdening oneself, interrupting the flow of recitation and not listening attentively to it.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "The honour of being connected to the Qur\u2019an",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah has described the Qur\u2019an in various ways, including describing it as a mighty Book , as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cIndeed, those who disbelieve in the message after it has come to them. And indeed, it is a mighty Book. \nFalsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it; [it is] a revelation from a [Lord who is] Wise and Praiseworthy\u201d\u00a0[Fussilat 41:41-42].\nAnd He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cQaf. By the honored Qur'an\u201d\u00a0[Qaaf 50:1].\nAnd there are many other descriptions of it.\nThe one who adheres to the Qur\u2019an will attain honour and high status because of his adherence to the Qur\u2019an. In the hadith narrated by Muslim (817) from \u2018Aamir ibn Waathilah, it says that Naafi\u2018 ibn \u2018Abd al-Haarith met \u2018Umar in \u2018Usfaan, and \u2018Umar had appointed him as governor of Makkah. He said: Whom did you appoint over the people of the valley? He said: Ibn Abza. He said: Who is Ibn Abza? He said: One of our freed slaves. He said: You have appointed a freed slave over them?! He said: He is well versed in the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and he has knowledge of the shares of inheritance that are prescribed in Islam. \u2018Umar said: Your Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAllah raises some in status by means of this Book and He lowers others by means of it.\u201d\nThe point is that being connected to the Qur\u2019an is an honour for the one who is connected to it and it raises him in status, no matter what the nature of that connection to the Book of Allah, whether it is in writing, calligraphy, uttering, memorizing, reciting, learning or acting upon it. Every kind of connection to the Book of Allah and occupying oneself and one\u2019s time with it is an honour for him and raises him in status in this world and the hereafter, commensurate with the level of this connection, for Allah has set a measure for all things.\nIt does not seem to us that there is any problem with the idea that the fact that the Qur\u2019an was revealed in Makkah was an honour for the sacred land of Allah, and that the fact that it was revealed in Ramadan was an honour for the month of Ramadan, and that the fact that the Qur\u2019an was revealed to the heart of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was an honour that Allah bestowed upon him, and that the fact that the Qur\u2019an was borne from heaven, from the Lord of the Worlds, was an honour to its bearer, the trustworthy angel (Jibreel \u2013 peace be upon him). For the Qur\u2019an is the noblest of speech; it is the words of the Lord of the worlds.\nHowever, it is incorrect to say that these are the only reasons for honour, or that the honour is limited only to that, regardless of how one may think of it, because this is a kind of speaking about Allah without knowledge, and it is also far-fetched, and there is no need for that.\nIn fact it is incorrect to think that the revelation of the Qur\u2019an was the beginning of honour for each of those mentioned.\nJibreel was the best of the angels, the envoy of the Lord of the Worlds to His prophets, before he was sent down with the Qur\u2019an.\nMakkah, the sacred land of Allah, was made a sanctuary by Ibraaheem, and its honourable status was established before the Qur\u2019an was revealed.\nAllah\u2019s Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was already the leader of the sons of Adam, the last of the prophets, when Adam was still in the form of clay.\nThe most that can be said is that one of the causes of honour is being connected to the Book of Allah, for everyone who is connected to it, in whatever way, as mentioned above.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Can You Pray Tarawih Alone?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can you pray tarawih alone?\nIt is prescribed to offer the night prayers in Ramadan in congregation or individually, but it is better to do it in congregation than to do it individually. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led his Companions in offering these prayers in congregation on several nights.\u00a0\nIt is proven in al-Sahihayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led his Companions in prayer (Tarawih ) for several nights, then on the third or fourth night he did not come out to them. When morning came he said: \u201cNothing prevented me from coming out to you except the fact that I feared that it would be made obligatory for you.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1129)\nAccording to the version narrated by Muslim (761): \u201cBut I feared that night prayers would be made obligatory for you and you would not be able to do them.\u201d\u00a0\nOffering Tarawih prayer in congregation\nOffering Tarawih prayer in congregation is something that is established by the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated the reason why he did not persist in offering this prayer in congregation, which is that he feared that it might be made obligatory. This reason ceased to be applicable after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, because when he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, the revelation ceased and there was no longer any worry that it might be made obligatory. Once the reason, which was the fear of it being made obligatory, disappeared with the cessation of the revelation, then the fact that it is Sunnah to offer this prayer in congregation resumed. \u00a0(See al-Sharh al-Mumti\u2019 by Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin, 4/78)\u00a0\nImam Ibn \u2018Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cThis indicates that praying qiyam in Ramadan is one of the Sunnahs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and is recommended and encouraged. It was not introduced by \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab, rather he revived something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) loved and approved of. Nothing stopped him from doing it regularly except the fear that it might be made obligatory upon his ummah. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was kind and compassionate towards his ummah. \u2018Umar knew from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the obligatory duties would not be increased or decreased after his death (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so he revived this practice and enjoined it upon the people. That happened in 14 AH, and \u2018Umar has the honour of being the one who revived this Sunnah.\u201d (Al-Tamhid, 8/108, 109)\u00a0\nAfter the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) prayed Tarawih in small groups and individually, until \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) united them behind a single imam.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that \u2018Abd al-Rahman ibn \u2018Abd al-Qari said: I went out with \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) one night in Ramadan to the mosque , and the people were scattered, with one man praying by himself and another with a group of men following his prayer. \u2018Umar said: \u201cI think that if I gather them behind one reader, it will be better.\u201d Then he decided to unite them behind Ubayy ibn Ka\u2019b. Then I went out with him on another night, and the people were praying behind their reader. \u2018Umar said: \u201cWhat a good innovation this is. But the prayer that they forget about and sleep is better than the one they are offering.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1906)\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, when refuting the view of those who quoted \u2018Umar\u2019s words \u201cWhat a good innovation this is\u201d as meaning that innovation (bid`ah) is permissible:\u00a0\nWith regard to qiyam in Ramadan , the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) introduced this to his ummah, and he led them in prayer for a number of nights, because at his time they used to pray in congregation and individually. But he did not persist in leading them in one congregation, lest that be made obligatory for them.\u00a0\nWhen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, the Shari`ah was established (and would not change after that). When \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) became caliph, he united them behind one imam, Ubayy ibn Ka\u2019b, who united the people in one congregation on the orders of \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him). \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was one of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, of whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs after me; cling tightly to it.\u201d So what he did was Sunnah but he said, \u201cWhat a good innovation this is,\u201d because it was an innovation in the linguistic sense, as they were doing something that they had not done during the life of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), i.e., gathering to do this, but it is Sunnah in the Shar`i sense.\u201d \u00a0(Majmu\u2019 al-Fatawa, 22/234, 235)\u00a0\nIs completing the Quran in Ramadan sunnah?\nCompleting the Quran in Ramadan , whether during prayer or outside prayer, is something that is praiseworthy. Jibril (peace be upon him) used to review the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) every Ramadan, and in the Prophet\u2019s last year he reviewed it with him twice.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Verses that are entirely clear (muhkam) and verses that are not entirely clear (mutashaabih) in the Holy Qur\u2019aan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cIt is He Who has sent down to you (Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) the Book (this Qur\u2019aan). In it are Verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book [and those are the Verses of Al-Ahkaam (commandments), Al-Faraa\u2019id (obligatory duties) and Al-Hudood (laws for the punishment of thieves, adulterers)]; and others not entirely clear. So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah (polytheism and trials), and seeking for its hidden meanings, but none knows its hidden meanings save Allaah. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: \u201cWe believe in it; the whole of it (clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord.\u201d And none receive admonition except men of understanding\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:7]\nWhat is meant is that the Qur\u2019aan contains verses that are entirely clear and verses that are not entirely clear. The entirely clear verses (muhkam) are those which are clear and concerning which there is no confusion; this applies to most of the verses of the Qur\u2019aan. These verses are the \u201cfoundations of the Book\u201d. As for the verses which are not entirely clear (mutashaabih) these are verses which may not be clear to some people, in exclusion to others. The scholars know them but the ignorant do not, and there are some which only Allaah knows.\u00a0\nThose who follow the truth refer the verses which are not entirely clear to the verses which are entirely clear, whereas those who follow deviation follow the verses which are not entirely clear, and they use the verses which are not entirely clear to contradict the verses which are entirely clear, for the purpose of creating confusion, distorting and misleading.\u00a0\nIbn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (2/6): Allaah tells us that in the Qur\u2019aan there are verses which are entirely clear, which are the foundation of the Book, i.e., they are clear in meaning, with no confusion for anyone; and there are other verses which are not entirely clear as to what they mean for many or some people. The one who refers that which is unclear to him to that which is clear, and uses the clear verses to understand what is not clear to him, will be guided. But the one who does the opposite will be misguided. Hence Allaah says: \u201cIt is He Who has sent down to you (Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) the Book (this Qur\u2019aan). In it are Verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book\u201d i.e., they are the root to which reference should be made in the event of confusion; \u201cand others not entirely clear\u201d i.e., they could be interpreted in accordance with those that are entirely clear or they could be interpreted in some other way, based on the wording and the way they are written, not according to the meaning.\u00a0\n\u201cSo as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation\u201d, i.e., misguidance, and ignoring the truth in favour of falsehood, \u201cthey follow that which is not entirely clear thereof\u201d i.e., they interpret that which is not entirely clear in such a way that allows them to distort it to suit their corrupt aims, because the wording could be interpreted in the way they want. But in the case of the verses which are entirely clear, they have no chance of doing that, so that is clear proof against them. Hence Allaah says: \u201cseeking Al-Fitnah (polytheism and trials)\u201d i.e., to misguide their followers and give them the impression that they are using evidence from the Qur\u2019aan to support their bid\u2019ah (innovation). This is evidence against them, not for them. It is similar to when the Christians argue that the Qur\u2019aan says that \u2018Eesa (Jesus) is a Spirit from God and His Word that He bestowed upon Maryam (Mary), but they ignore the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cHe [\u2018Eesa (Jesus)] was not more than a slave. We granted Our Favour to him \u2026\u201d\n[al-Zukhruf 43:59] \u00a0\n\u201cVerily, the likeness of \u2018Eesa (Jesus) before Allaah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: \u2018Be!\u2019 \u2014 and he was\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:59]\n-- and other clear verses which unambiguously show that he was one of the creatures created by Allaah, and a slave of Allaah, and one of the Messengers of Allaah.\u00a0\nAnd the words \u201cand seeking for its hidden meanings\u201d mean, they distort it as they wish.\u00a0\nEnd quote.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\nAllaah, may He be blessed and exalted, has divided the Holy Qur\u2019aan into two categories: the verses which are entirely clear and those which are not entirely clear. What is meant by those which are entirely clear is that the meaning is clear and obvious to everyone, like the heavens and earth, stars, mountains, trees, animals and so on. This is entirely clear because there is no ambiguity in its meaning. The verses which are not entirely clear are those of which the meaning is ambiguous or unknown to most people, and is known only to those who are well-versed in knowledge, such as some verses which are general in meaning and do not give details, but they are explained in detail in the Sunnah. An example is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd perform As-Salaah [prayer]\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:43].\u00a0\nHow prayer is to be performed is not known from this verse; all that is known from it is that it is obligatory to perform prayer. But how that is to be done is known from other evidence. The wisdom behind the fact that the Qur'aan was revealed with verses of these two types is that this is a test, because those in whose hearts is deviation will follow that which is not entirely clear and will thus remain confused. But those who are well-versed in knowledge believe in all of it, both that which is not entirely clear and that which is entirely clear; they know that it is from Allaah and that there is no contradiction in it. An example of verses that are not entirely clear are the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThere will then be (left) no Fitnah (excuses or statements or arguments) for them but to say: \u2018By Allaah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allaah\u2019\u201d\n[al-An\u2019aam 6:23].\u00a0\n\u201cOn that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger (Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) will wish that they were buried in the earth, but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allaah\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 4:42]\nSomeone may come along and say that they contradict one another. How can they say \u201cBy Allaah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allaah\u201d, then it is said of them that \u201cthey will never be able to hide a single fact from Allaah\u201d? They quote the verses against one another in order to confuse people. But those who are well-versed in knowledge say: It is all from Allaah and there is no contradiction in the words of Allaah. They said: The Day of Resurrection will be as long as fifty thousand years, and things will change throughout that Day. The first verse is applicable to one stage and the second verse is applicable to another.\nEnd quote from Fataawa Noor \u2018ala al-Darb.\u00a0\nAnd he also said: As for the people of misguidance and deviance, they followed the verses which are not entirely clear and made them a cause to create doubt and suspicion, so they were misguided and misguided others. They imagined, on the basis of verses that are not entirely clear, something that is not befitting to Allaah or His Book or His Messenger.\u00a0\nAn example of the first is the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cVerily, We give life to the dead\u201d [Yaa-Seen 36:12] and \u201cVerily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur\u2019aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)\u201d [al-Hijr 15:9] \u2013 and other verses in which Allaah attributes something to Himself using the plural pronoun (We). The Christians followed that which is not entirely clear and claimed a plurality of gods, saying that Allaah is the third of three, and they ignored that which is entirely clear and indicates that Allaah is One. \u00a0\nBut those who are well-versed in knowledge interpreted the plural pronoun as being in terms of respect for the numerous attributes of Allaah and their greatness. They referred the verses that are not entirely clear to that which is entirely clear (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God \u2014 Allaah), Laa Ilaaha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He)\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:163]. So they say to the Christians: The claim you make is because of the confusion that you have, so Allaah has deemed you to be kaafirs (disbelievers) and has rejected your claim when you said that. Listen to the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSurely, disbelievers are those who said: \u201cAllaah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).\u201d But there is no Ilaah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilaah (God \u2014Allaah)\u201d [al-Maa'idah 5:73] i.e., they disbelieved when they said that God is the third of three. \u00a0\nAn example of the second is the verses in which Allaah says to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cVerily, you (O Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) guide not whom you like\u201d\n[al-Qasas 28:56].\u00a0\nAnd\n\u201cAnd verily, you (O Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e. Allaah\u2019s religion of Islamic Monotheism)\u201d\n[al-Shoora 42:52].\u00a0\nIn these two verses there is an imagined contradiction, so the one who has deviation in his heart may think that they contradict one another, because in the first verse there is a negation and in the second there is an affirmation. So he thinks that there is a contradiction in the Qur\u2019aan.\u00a0\nBut those who are well-versed in knowledge say that there is no contradiction between these two verses, because what is meant by guidance in the first verse is guidance by means of divine help or inspiration, which no one has control over except Allaah alone; neither the Messenger nor anyone else has any power over that. And what is meant by guidance in the second verse is guidance on the basis of evidence and proof, which may come from Allaah or from others, so it may come from the Messengers and their heirs, meaning the sincere scholars.\nEnd quote from Majmoo\u2019 Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (4/186).\u00a0\nThese are all examples of relative ambiguity which some people may not be able to understand, but those who are well-versed in knowledge understand it. As for the verses which are not entirely clear and which no one knows except Allaah, these have to do with matters such as the essence and nature of Allaah\u2019s attributes, or the essence of what is with Allaah of the delight of the people of Paradise and the torment for those who disobey Him. All of that is known to no one except Allaah.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\n\u00a0Whoever is confused about any of the verses which are not entirely clear should try to understand it in the light of that which is entirely clear, if he is a scholar who is able to use evidence in order to reach conclusions. Otherwise he should ask the scholars, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cSo ask of those who know the Scripture, if you know not\u201d\n[al-Nahl 16:43].\u00a0\nWhatever the case, let him say (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cWe believe in it; the whole of it (clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:7]. \u00a0\nSome of the heretics and deviants, in the past and in modern times, tried to seek out everything in the Qur'aan and Sunnah that is not entirely clear (al-mutashaabih), for the purpose of creating confusion and doubt.. But the scholars rose to this challenge and wrote beneficial books which refute these doubts. An example of that is the book which was written by Ibn Qutaybah (may Allaah have mercy on him), entitled Ta\u2019weel Mukhtalif al-Hadeeth; and the book by Shaykh al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) entitled Daf\u2019 Eehaam al-Idtiraab \u2018an Aayi\u2019l-Kitaab.\u00a0\n, there is no contradiction between the verses of the Qur\u2019aan, or between the Sunnah and the Qur\u2019aan, because it is all from Allaah, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cDo they not then consider the Qur\u2019aan carefully? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 4:82].\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to guide us and you and to grant us all beneficial knowledge and enable us all to do righteous deeds.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "When Was Surat al-Fatihah Revealed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.When was Suat Al-Fatihah revealed?\nSurat al-Fatihah is one of the Makkan surahs [i.e., revealed during the Makkan period, before the Hijrah], according to the majority of scholars. The scholars quoted several things as evidence for it being classified as Makkan, including the following:\n\nThere is a great deal of sahih (sound) evidence to support this view, including the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd We have certainly given you, [O Muhammad], seven of the often repeated [verses] and the great Quran\u201d [Al-Hijr 15:87]\n\nThis verse from Surat al-Hijr is Makkan according to scholarly consensus. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained the \u201cseven often repeated [verses]\u201d as referring to Surat al-Fatihah, which implies that al-Fatihah was revealed during the Makkan period.\u00a0\n\nPrayer was enjoined in Makkah , and prayer is not valid without Surat al-Fatihah .\n\nIn fact, some of the scholars were of the view that al-Fatihah was the first thing to be revealed, but this is a weak view.\nIbn Taymiyah said: \u201cThe Opening of the Book [i.e., Surat al-Fatihah] was undoubtedly revealed during the Makkan period.\u2026\nThe view of those who say that al-Fatihah was not revealed until the Madinan period is undoubtedly wrong.\u201d (Majmu\u2018 al-Fatawa, 17/190-191)\nA number of well-versed scholars \u2013 such as Ibn Taymiyah, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Hajar, al-Baydawi, al-Kawashi, and others \u2013 preferred the view that Surat al-Fatihah was revealed during the Makkan period. (See: al-Makki wa\u2019l-Madani by \u2018Abd ar-Razzaq Husayn, 1/446-468)\nWas Surat al-Fatihah revealed before enjoining prayer?\nAl-Qurtubi said in al-Jami\u2018 li Ahkam al-Quran (1/115):\u00a0\n\u201cThere is no difference of opinion concerning the fact that prayer was enjoined in Makkah , and there is no report to suggest that there was a time when Muslims offered their prayers without \u201cal-hamdu Lillahi Rabbi l-\u2018alamin\u201d. This is indicated by the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, \u201cThere is no prayer except with the Opening of the Book.\u201d This is speaking about the ruling, not when it began. And Allah knows best.\u201d\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "The Mus-haf (Quran) that we have today is that on which there was consensus among the Sahaabah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nFirst of all, we would like to share with the questioner our experience with this type of inquiry, because we have found that those who are behind such queries are usually people who specialize in mixing issues in order to cause confusion, and try to reach a definite conclusion that the idea of the preservation of the Quran is completely incorrect and unfounded, and that no one can prove whether the Mus-hafs that we have nowadays are the word of Allah, may He be glorified, or not. This is a dangerous slippery slope.\nThere is one idea that could prove the point, which is that even if we assume \u2013 for the sake of argument \u2013 that some verses and soorahs that were recited at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were not written in the Mus-haf, for one reason or another, that does not mean that everything that has reached us of the Quran is false and incorrect \u2013 Allah forbid.\nAnother idea that could prove the point is the fact that by always assuming that in any process of large-scale historical transmission \u2013 such as the transmission of the Quran, the number of verses of which are in the thousands, and these verses were also transmitted by thousands of the Sahaabah, and it was written down on thousands of slates, skins, pieces of other material and so on \u2013 it is inevitable that historical reports will tell us that there were some small errors on the part of one or some of the transmitters, or there were some debates between them, or that there were small variations between others. This is something that invariably happens, without a doubt, in the process of transmission or memorization.\nAs for distortion, however, that is done by people of whims and desires, who try to twist the facts and try to confuse non-specialists, so they regard such issues as evidence of the Quran \u201cbeing distorted\u201d, or that its transmission process is not credible.\nThey forget that the Quran was transmitted to us \u2013 in the version that we have nowadays, with the same script, shape and way of writing \u2013 through hundreds of thousands of proven, sound chains of narration that are spread throughout the Muslim world, and that the copies of the Quran that have chains of narration going all the way back to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are innumerable and are housed in libraries throughout the world. If huge academic institutions were to be established to list all these chains of transmission, Mus-hafs and books, and to collect evidence to prove that the Quran was narrated via tawaatur [i.e., it was transmitted from so many by so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a mistake], that would not be possible.\nIf we think that this will undermine the credibility of the transmission of the Quran, and that makes us think that there were additions and subtractions to it, then in that case we are rejecting all the rules and standards on how to judge a text from an academic point of view, and we are dismissing all the proven ways of sound transmission, and we are dismissing all that was transmitted of the legacy and history of nations, because of one report here or there that we did not reflect upon or understand properly, and we did not know the right way to approach it. There is no criticism that was mentioned in the context of the topic under discussion, regardless of how sound and correct it may be when subjected to examination, but it would be possible to find many more criticisms like it, whether of the same type or otherwise, to that which people transmitted of reports, knowledge, history and the ancient legacy, all of which came to us through transmission. Moreover, the transmission of the Quran \u2013 and indeed, the Sunnah too \u2013 was clearly undertaken by trustworthy narraters, and this transmission is proven to be sound, in a manner that is not applicable in the case of any other book or report.\nPerhaps the questioner will agree with us, that it is very strange and amazing to find someone who believes that the Quran is the word of Allah, the Creator of all things, the controller of all things, the Creator of all the wonders of this universe, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, and He has power over all things, yet despite all that he finds it unacceptable that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, should decree that the recitation of a few verses be abrogated, or that the rulings thereof be abrogated, or that both the recitation and ruling thereof be abrogated.\nIs not Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, the one Who sent down these verses, Who spoke these words, the one Who issued the rulings mentioned? So why can he not understand and accept the idea that Allah, may He be glorified, may decree that some of these words be removed from the pages of the Mus-haf, yet remain part of His holy words, just as the Torah and Gospel are words and commands of Allah, yet despite that, the Quran abrogated both of them, yet what is remains of the Torah and Gospel that has not been distorted is still to be venerated and appreciated, on the grounds that it is the word of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted?\nWhat harm is there in any of that?\nWe can see an example of this issue in this world, in anyone who writes a book or composes a speech. He may take out (or \u201cabrogate\u201d) something that he had mentioned in his book, or he may change the order of the ideas of what is mentioned in the book. How could anyone think that this is the right of a weak, created individual, yet some people think that it is a shortcoming in the case of the Creator, may He be glorified and exalted!\nIf someone were to say that abrogation means that Allah realized that there were some shortcomings and problems in what was already there, then He decided to abrogate it and present the verse or soorah in a new way, the response to that is: This is proof that this person does not understand the issue of abrogation in the first place. All that abrogation of recitation means is simply that the verse is no longer part of the Quran, and that reciting it is no longer to be regarded as an act of worship, although its ruling remains in effect, or that the verse is no longer to be regarded as part of the Quran and its ruling is to be abrogated also, although it is still regarded as being the words of Allah.\nIt is well-known that worshipping Allah in a particular manner is a matter that is not subject to rational thinking in the first place, so how can anyone object by saying that abrogation of the recitation of the verse means that it became clear that there was some shortcoming or problem with it.\nOn our website, in the answer\u00a0to question\u00a0no. 105746\u00a0.\u00a0we have given some examples of verses of which the recitation was abrogated, and we have quoted what the scholars of said about the great wisdom behind this type of abrogation.\nThirdly:\nOnce you understand the above, it will become clear that what the scholars of Sunnah said about the verse of stoning, the recitation of which was abrogated whilst the ruling remains in effect, comes under the heading of abrogation (naskh), which has already been discussed and guidelines concerning it have been explained above, and there is a clear reference to it in the Quran itself, in the verses in which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cWe do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?\nDo you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and [that] you have not besides Allah any protector or any helper?\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:106-107].\nFor more detailed information on what was narrated concerning the verse of stoning, please see the answers to questions no. 179886.\nFourthly:\nSimilarly, we may say that there was no difference among the Sahaabah concerning the Quran. Rather some people think that there was a dispute among them because they saw that some of the Sahaabah wrote some interpretations and explanations in their own Mus-hafs, whilst other Sahaabah were still keeping these verses of which the recitation had been abrogated. Therefore they thought \u2013 by mistake or deliberately \u2013 that this was a real difference of opinion among the Sahaabah concerning the Quran, when in fact it was not a difference of opinion at all; rather it was, as noted above, a commentary and explanation written by the Sahaabi in his own personal copy. Therefore some people distorted this fact, trying to give the impression that it was part of the Quran, or it was verses and soorahs that had been abrogated, but this Sahaabi did not erase them from his own personal copy, in order to remember them and act on the ruling, but he knew and accepted that he could not recite them as an act of worship.\nFor more details concerning these matters, please see questions no. 178209, 195880 and 197942.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on deliberately making mistakes in recitation of Qur\u2019an for the purpose of teaching",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to deliberately make mistakes when reciting the Holy Qur\u2019an, even if that is for the purpose of teaching, because it is distorting the words of Allah, may He be exalted, and because of the possibility that the mistake may become fixed in the mind of the listener.\nIt says in al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah (35/214): The Qur\u2019an is the miraculous words of Allah that was sent down to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and was transmitted by tawaatur [i.e., it was transmitted from so many by so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a mistake].\nIt is haraam to deliberately mispronounce it, whether that changes the meaning or not, because its words and phrases are tawqeefi [not subject to change] and it was transmitted to us by tawaatur. Therefore it is not permissible to change any word or phrase in it by changing the vowels at the end of words, or by changing its letters by switching letters around. End quote.\nIt says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa\u2019imah (vol. 3, 2/219): What is the ruling on deliberately making mistakes in recitation of the Holy Qur\u2019an when teaching, so as to draw the student\u2019s attention to that? We visited a teacher in the company of the educational supervisor, and he approved of this method of teaching and asked us to do it, but we refused to do that, because this method is not usually used in teaching, and because the mistake may become deeply rooted in the students\u2019 minds [thinking that this is correct], and you know how easily things may become entrenched in children\u2019s minds when they are very young; the students are no older than eight or nine. Please advise us, may Allah reward you.\nAnswer: Deliberately making mistakes in recitation of the Holy Qur\u2019an when training students, for the purpose of drawing their attention to that, is not known from any of the righteous early generations who conveyed the Holy Qur\u2019an and taught it to people. Teaching the Qur\u2019an to learners is an act of worship by means of which one may draw closer to Allah, may He be exalted, so it is not permissible to do it in any manner other than the correct manner.\nThe Qur\u2019an teacher may pose questions to his students to help them to memorize better, and to deal with any mispronunciations. If he does that, there will be no need to deliberately distort the verse when reciting it to the student.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength.

        "question": "Ruling on reading a commentary on the Qur\u2019an whilst praying",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe questioner should look at the commentary on the verses that he is going to recite in the prayer outside of the prayer first, i.e., before starting to pray, so that he will be free to focus on his recitation and reflect on the meanings.\nIbn Katheer said: The verse \u201cand stand before Allah, devoutly obedient\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:238] means: with humility, humbling oneself before Him. This requires not speaking whilst praying, because that defeats the purpose. Hence, when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not return the greeting of Ibn Mas\u2018ood when the latter greeted him when he was praying, he apologized to him for that, and said: \u201cPrayer is a preoccupation.\u201d\nEnd quote from at-Tafseer (1/654).\nThe hadith was narrated by al-Bukhaari (1216).\nSecondly:\nThe fuqaha\u2019 stated that reading in books whilst praying is makrooh, although some of them said that there is nothing wrong with it, subject to two conditions:\n\nThat he be only looking at the tafseer, and not moving his lips whilst reading;\nit should not require a great deal of movement, such as picking up the book, opening it, and turning the pages, because a great deal of movement invalidates the prayer.\n\nImam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he reads Qur\u2019an from the Mus-haf, that does not invalidate his prayer, whether he has memorized it or not. Rather that is obligatory in his case if he has not memorized al-Faatihah, as noted above. If he turns over the pages sometimes whilst praying, that does not invalidate the prayer.\nIf he looks at anything written that is not Qur\u2019an and reads it to himself, that does not invalidate his prayer, even if he does that at length, but it is makrooh (disliked). This was stated by ash-Shaafa\u2018i.\nEnd quote from al-Majmoo\u2018 (4/95). See also: Rawdat at-Taalibeen (1/294).\nAl-Mirdaawi said in al-Insaaf: The prayer is not invalidated by a lengthy looking at a book, if he reads it in his heart and does not move his lips, according to the correct view, which was deemed to be more correct in al-Furoo\u2018 and elsewhere. The author and others said: This is our view. It was narrated from Imam Ahmad that he did that.\nAnd it was said that it does invalidate the prayer. This was stated by a number of our companions, including Ibn Haamid.\nEnd quote (3/616).\nConclusion:\nPrayer is not invalidated by looking in a Mus-haf in which there is commentary on Qur\u2019an, and the like, on condition that the worshipper does not move his lips when reading anything except Qur\u2019an. Rather, if he looks at the meaning and thinks of it, there is nothing wrong with that, if he needs to do it.\nHowever, what he should do is to avoid all of that completely, and when he is praying behind an imam, he should be content with listening attentively to his imam and following his recitation. If he is leading the prayer or is praying alone, he should recite to himself whatever he can, and he should not let himself be distracted by anything except reciting Qur\u2019an and doing the actions of the prayer, because prayer should be his focus and preoccupation, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.\nSee also the answers to questions no. 9505 and 125619.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "The reasons for differences in the wording of some abrogated verses",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.One of the texts which is abrogated and removed from the Mushaf is this verse: \u201cIf the son of Adam had two valleys of wealth he would desire a third, but nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust.\u201d\nThat is because of the report narrated by Muslim (1050) from Abu Moosa al-Ash\u2018ari who said: We used to recite a soorah which we likened in its length and strictness to Baraa\u2019ah [Soorat at-Tawbah], then I was caused to forget it, but I remember from it the words: \u201cIf the son of Adam had two valleys of wealth he would desire a third, but nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust.\u201d\nWe have previously discussed that in the answer to question no. 176972.\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining the different types of abrogation:\nAbrogation of the text and the ruling: It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to recite a soorah that was equal in length to Soorat at-Tawbah; I do not remember anything of it except this verse: \u201cIf the son of Adam had two valleys of gold, he would desire a third, and if he had a third, he would desire a fourth, but nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust, and Allah turns in mercy to whoever repents.\u201d\nEnd quote from an-Naasikh wa\u2019l-Mansookh by Ibn Hazm (p. 9).\nPerhaps the reason for the different wordings narrated for this verse is that when it was abrogated, it was no longer Qur\u2019an, so the narrators were less careful about its wording, and were not so careful about it as they were in the case of the Qur\u2019an or the hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which they wanted to convey to those who came after them. Do you not see that Abu Moosa al-Ash\u2018ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to recite a soorah which we likened in its length and strictness to Baraa\u2019ah [Soorat at-Tawbah], then I was caused to forget it?\nThe focus of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) was on preserving and memorizing that which was proven, in order to convey it to the people. As for that which had been abrogated, they were not very concerned with it, so it was sufficient for them and for those who narrated from them to narrate it in general terms, or to narrate the meaning, or to narrate it with less precision in some of the phrases, especially since both the text and the ruling were abrogated. If the ruling remained in effect, they would pay more attention to the wording in order to apply it.\nAl-Qaadi \u2018Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Then think about what the Sahaabah mentioned of the verses which were abrogated; they only mentioned the meaning and some words, not the exact wording as revealed.\nThe context and style of the Qur\u2019an confirm what they mentioned about that, and what they narrated here is clearly far removed from the style and eloquence of the Qur\u2019an.\nEnd quote from Ikmaal al-Mu\u2018lim bi Fawaa\u2019id Muslim (3/585).\nIt may be that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said something along these lines with different wording on different occasions, on the grounds that this is a prophetic hadith, then these wordings became mixed with the wording of the abrogated verse, because of what we have noted above, or the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did not focus their attention on memorizing verses of which the text had been abrogated. Hence Anas said: I do not know whether it was something that was revealed to him or something that he said. Narrated by Muslim (1048).\nAnd Allah knows best."

There is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether that is obligatory, and there are two views, the more sound of which is that it is not obligatory, except in the case of prayer, when it is obligatory. This is the view of the majority of scholars.\nBut the Muslim should be keen to listen attentively when the Quran is recited, and not let his attention wander from it, except in the case of work or need. This comes under the heading of venerating and respecting the Quran. We have discussed this previously in the answer to question no. 88728.\nWith regard to leaving the broadcast of the Holy Quran playing whilst you are in the house or out of the house, awake or asleep, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as there is nothing happening at the same time that would drown it out, and there is no noise, idle talk or arguments, and so long as it is not in an inappropriate place.

If there is someone nearby who is engaging in idle talk and speaking and arguing, then that is not right; it is better not to leave the radio on in that case, and it should be turned off, because that is a kind of showing disrespect towards the Quran.

But what if the surah is recorded on a tape; will that achieve the same result?\nHe replied:\n\u201cNo, no; the voice on the tape is nothing and will not serve any purpose, because it cannot be said that one has read or recited Quran; rather it may be said that one has listened to the voice of somebody who recited it before. Hence if we record the adhan of a muadhdhin, then when the time comes we play it over the loudspeakers, and we leave it to call the adhan, is that acceptable? It is not acceptable. If we record a moving khutbah (sermon), then on Friday we play this recording of the \u201cimam of the microphone\u201d, and the recording says \u201cAs-salamu \u2018alaykum wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu (peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings),\u201d then the muadhdhin gives the call to prayer, then the recording of the khutbah is played, is this acceptable? It is not acceptable; why is that? Because this recording is a voice that was recorded in the past. It is like if you wrote it on a piece of paper or put a Mushaf in the house; is that sufficient instead of reading or reciting it? It is not sufficient. (As\u2019ilat al-Bab al-Maftuh (question no. 986)\nBut if there is no one in the house who is able to read or recite Surat al-Baqarah, and there is no one who can recite it for them in the house, and they use a recorder to recite it, then what appears to be the case \u2013 if Allah wills \u2013 is that it will serve this purpose and make the Shaytan flee from the house, especially if there is someone in the house who is listening to the recitation from the recorder.\nFor a detailed commentary on certain verses from Surat al-Baqarah, please see these answers to questions: 141772 , 118142 , 12191 , 1024 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on putting the verses of the Holy Quran as a background on mobile phones, computers and the like",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with putting Quranic verses as a background on the screen of a mobile phone, computer and the like, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThat should be for the purpose of reminding and exhorting, not for adornment.\nIt should be written in the \u2018Uthmaani script, in a way that is clear and legible, not as a kind of adornment, decoration and the like, and not in the shape of a bird or animal.\nThere should not be anything haraam in the background, such as music or other prohibited things.\n\nShaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to hanging up verses and hadiths in offices and schools, there is nothing wrong with that, if it is for the purpose of reminding and benefitting people.\nEnd quote from Majmoo\u2018 Fataawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (9/513).\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League concerning the topic of writing a verse or verses of the Holy Quran in the form of a bird and the like:\nalone, and blessings and peace be upon the one after whom there will be no prophet, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and companions.\nTo proceed: the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League, in its twelfth conference, held in Makkah al-Mukarramah between the dates Saturday 15 Rajab 1410 AH (10 February 1990 CE) and Saturday 22 Rajab 1410 AH (17 February 1990 CE) examined the topic of writing one or more verses from the Holy Quran in the shape of a bird. The Council determined, on the basis of consensus, that it is not permissible to do this, because that is a kind of toying and tampering with the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and treating them in a disrespectful manner. And Allah is the source of strength.\nEnd quote from Qaraaraat al-Majma\u2018 al-Fiqhi, p. 271.\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I have seen some people writing these verses in ornate letters, and I have even seen someone writing some verses in the form of a bird or animal, or a man who is sitting as if reciting the tashahhud in prayer, and so on. So they are writing these verses in a manner that is haraam, by shaping them into images for which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does that.\nMoreover, the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed: is it permissible to write verses in a script other than the \u2018Uthmaani script or is that not permissible?\nThey differed concerning that, and there are three views:\nSome of them said that it is permissible in all cases to write it in whatever script is well-known and according to whatever rules of writing are current at any time or in any place, so long as it is written in Arabic letters.\nSome of them said that it is not permissible in any case; rather the verses of the Quran may be written in \u2018Uthmaani script only.\nAnd some of them said that it is permissible to write it in whatever script is well-known and according to whatever rules of writing are current at any time or in any place for children, to train them in pronouncing the Quran correctly, in contrast to the script used for adults of sound mind, for whom it should be written in the \u2018Uthmaani script.\nWith regard to writing it in ornate scripts or in the form of an animal, undoubtedly this is haraam.\nThe believer should venerate the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and show respect towards it. If he wants to write something in an ornate style, then he may use other phrases, such as famous proverbs or aphorisms and the like. But with regard to doing that in the case of the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and giving the letters and words of the Quran different shapes for the purpose of adornment, or even worse than that, making them into the shape of an animal or human, then this is reprehensible and forbidden, and Allah is the One Whose help we seek.\nEnd quote from Fataawa Noor \u2018ala ad-Darb (4/2).\nIf these guidelines are followed with regard to this matter, then there is nothing wrong with it.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 254.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "What happened to the Scripture of Ibraaheem and the Zaboor of Dawood (peace be upon them)?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah, may He be exalted, revealed a Scripture to Ibraaheem, as He, may He be exalted, said (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cIndeed, this is in the former scriptures,\nThe scriptures of Abraham and Moses\u201d\n[al-A\u2018laa 87:18-19].\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, has told us in His holy Book about some of what was in the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cOr has he not been informed of what was in the scriptures of Moses\nAnd [of] Abraham, who fulfilled [his obligations] \u2013 \nThat no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another\nAnd that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives\nAnd that his effort is going to be seen\nThen he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense\u2026 \u201d\n[an-Najm 53:36-40 \u2026 until the end of the soorah].\nSimilar to that is the well-known verses at the end of Soorat al-A\u2018laa, which are quoted above.\nWhat is required of us is only to believe in general terms in the Scriptures that Allah, may He be exalted, sent down to His Prophet Moosaa (peace be upon him), and to believe in whatever is proven to us to be sound through the revelation sent to the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in which there are lessons and exhortations. As for anything more than that, such as details of what those Scriptures contained, we are not obliged to know it and we have no way of knowing it or finding out about its details. Trying to find out about that is taking on something that cannot be proven, and we have no need of that according to the teachings of our religion, for Allah has perfected our religion for us and is pleased with Islam for us as our religion.\nWe know of no religious text that suggests that the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) is still extant, or that the knowledge contained therein reached any of the people of Islam in such a manner that it can be proven and relied upon.\nWhat appears to be the case is that its knowledge was abrogated a long time ago and was lost to people.\nIn fact, this is applicable to the books of the Children of Israel, namely the Torah and the Gospel; there is no longer anything that can be authenticated in that which is extant among them, except for that which is confirmed by Islamic religious texts. As for everything other than that, the most that can be said is that we neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it.\nIf this is the case with regard to the books of the Children of Israel, despite the large numbers of people who venerate them, pay attention to them and refer to them, then it is even more likely that this is the case with regard to the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him). The most can be said about what is extant among people of that, that is attributed to the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), is that it is like the Scriptures and Books of the Children of Israel: we neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it.\nFor more information, see the answers to questions no. 199116 and 126004.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the Zaboor of Dawood (peace be upon him), it is the Book that Allah revealed to him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd your Lord is most knowing of whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And We have made some of the prophets exceed others [in various ways], and to David We gave the book [of Psalms [Zaboor]]\u201d [al-Israa\u2019 17:55].\nThe word zaboor refers to something written. Tafseer at-Tabari (6/17).\nAt-Taahir said:\nIt is the name for the collected sayings of Daawood (peace be upon him) \u2013 some of which are words that were revealed to him, and some are words with which he was inspired, words of supplication and conversing with Allah. It is the book that is known nowadays as the Book of Psalms in the Old Testament.\nEnd quote from at-Tahreer wa\u2019t-Tanweer (15/138).\nThe scholars have stated that the Zaboor of Dawood contained words of praise and glorification of Allah, may He be exalted; it did not contain any rulings on what is lawful and what is prohibited (halaal and haraam), or on shares of inheritance or hudood punishments. See Tafseer at-Tabari (14/625).\nAl-Qurtubi said: The Zaboor is the book of Dawood. It contained one hundred and fifty chapters, in which there were no rulings or statements of what is lawful and what is prohibited; rather it was words of wisdom and exhortation.\nThere are references to the contents of the Zaboor and the Scripture of Ibraaheem in some reports which are not proven.\nIn the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) it says:\nI said: O Messenger of Allah, what was the Scripture of Ibraaheem?\nHe said: \u201cIt was all proverbs, such as:\nO powerful and arrogant king, I did not appoint you to pile up worldly gains one on top of another; rather I appointed you to avert from Me the supplication of the one who has been wronged, for I do not reject it even if it comes from a disbeliever.\nEvery rational individual, unless he loses his mind, must have certain times: a time in which he converses with his Lord, a time in which he takes stock of himself, a time in which he reflects upon the creation of Allah, and a time in which he focuses on meeting his need for food and drink.\nEvery rational individual should not focus his mind except on three things: seeking provision for the hereafter [by doing righteous deeds], working to earn a living, and finding pleasure in something that is not prohibited.\nThe intelligent man should have insight into the era in which he lives, focus on his own affairs and guard his tongue.\nWhoever regards his words as being among his deeds will speak little and will only speak about what concerns him.\u201d\nI [Abu Dharr] said: O Messenger of Allah, what was the Scripture of Moosa?\nHe said: \u201cIt was all exhortations:\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of death, for how can he rejoice?\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of the Fire, for how can he laugh?\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of the divine decree, for how can he strive too hard?\nI am astounded by the one who sees this world and its vicissitudes, for how can he be at ease with it?\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of the reckoning tomorrow, for how can he not strive?\u201d\nThis hadith was narrated by Ibn Hibbaan (361) and others. Al-Arnaa\u2019oot said in his comments on the book of Ibn Hibbaan: Its isnad is da\u2018eef jiddan (very weak). The same was stated by Shaykh al-Albaani in ad-Da\u2018eefah. See Tafseer Ibn Katheer (2/472).\nWhat we have stated above about the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) with regard to how authentic it is and the extent to which we may trust its contents, we may also state with regard to the Zaboor, because we have no report to indicate that it has survived. Whatever has been transmitted of it via the People of the Book comes under the same ruling as the Israa\u2019eeliyyaat (reports narrated from Jewish sources), which are of three categories:\n\nAcceptable: this refers to that which is known to be sound due to its having been soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThat concerning which no verdict is given: this refers to that for which it cannot be known whether it is valid or false. It is permissible to narrate reports of this category for the purpose of exhortation and admonition, but we do not believe that it is either sound or false, in compliance with the command of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nRejected: this refers to that which is known to be false, and it is not appropriate to believe it, accept it or narrate it.\n\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 265035 and 22289.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "The principles of tafseer (Qur\u2019anic exegesis)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe should understand that there are principles and guidelines for interpreting the Qur\u2019an, which must be properly understood by the one who engages in tafseer (exegesis) of the word of Allah, may He be blessed and exalted. The scholars have written about the guidelines and principles of tafseer, and have explained the difference between tafseer on the basis of reports and tafseer on the basis of one\u2019s own understanding; they have explained when it is acceptable for a person to speak on the basis of his own understanding; and have differentiated between good understanding and poor understanding, especially with regard to what is mentioned in the question about a person coming up with his own understanding of a verse and understanding it on the basis of what he thinks to be right. Such personal understanding and thoughts should be measured against what the scholars said about the interpretation of this verse, and so on.\nIf the one who has his own personal understanding and thoughts is a seeker of knowledge, and is able to check what the commentators and scholars said, then he may find out for himself what was narrated concerning the meaning of the verse, and the views of respected commentators about the meaning and how they explained the meaning. Then if what he came up with about the meaning of the verse is in accordance with some of these views of respected scholars, then all well and good.\nBut if it is not in accordance with these scholarly views, then he must correct his understanding of the verse by checking it against the views of the scholars. However, he may not find the meaning that he came up with mentioned in the books (of tafseer) that he checks, or it may not be stated exactly as he had in mind, but the view that he came up with may be in harmony with the wording and context of the verse, and with the way that meanings are expressed in Arabic, and may indicate that meaning or point to it in one way or another, and in a way of expression that is regarded as possible by the scholars.\nThis requires further examination and study of the views of the scholars (concerning the verse), because the understanding that he developed could be implied in the wording of some scholars in their commentary on the verse.\nHe may, if possible, discuss his idea (about the meaning of the verse) with some scholars who have knowledge of the Book of Allah and the meaning of its verses.\nYou can refer to the following books\n\nSharh Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer, by Shaykh Dr. Musaa\u2018id at-Tayyaar\nAt-Tahreer fi Usool at-Tafseer by Shaykh Dr. Musaa\u2018id at-Tayyaar\n\nto learn about these issues that you need to learn and understand before you venture into the interpretation of the word of Allah, may He be exalted.\nSecondly:\nThe scholars have stated that the Qur\u2019an may be interpreted:\n\nBy the Qur\u2019an\nBy the Sunnah\nBy the words of the early generations (salaf)\nBy the rules of the Arabic language\nBy referring to some of the reports of the People of the Book, and the reasons for revelation (asbaab an-nuzool), in order to understand the meaning of a particular verse.\n\nFor each of these guidelines there is shar\u2018i evidence, within the framework of which tafseer is to be done. The Qur\u2019an is the most appropriate means of understanding the Qur\u2019an, because it is the word of Allah, may He be exalted. The Messenger is the one who explains the words of Allah, for that is his role. The Qur\u2019an was revealed in the language of the Arabs, so it [the Arabic language and its rules of grammar and expression] is one of the basic means of understanding the Qur\u2019an. The early generations were the closest of people to the language and the most knowledgeable of what meaning the Messenger intended when he spoke, for they were witnesses to the revelation and were aware of the circumstances of and reasons for revelation; they are also people who were proven to be good and righteous, so their interpretation takes precedence over that of others.\nIf you want detailed proof, we advise you to refer to the book al-Istidlaal \u2018ala al-Ma\u2018aani fi Tafseer at-Tabari, by Dr. Naayif az-Zahraani, in which he mentions the evidence for all of this.\nThirdly:\nThe scholars have ways of differentiating between what is sound (saheeh) and what is weak (da\u2018eef), namely mustalah al-hadith (the science of hadith). By means of this science, a scholar is able to differentiate between what is sound and what is not, and to differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not acceptable of reports.\nThey have a particular way of dealing with the reports of tafseer; you can find details of that in the books mentioned above.\nFourthly:\nWith regard to the hadith \u201cWhoever gives his personal view about the Book of Allah and it turns out to be correct is still mistaken,\u201d that is, because he spoke about something of which he has no certain knowledge, and he approached the matter in a way other than what is enjoined. So even if he was correct in what he said about the meaning when he gave his view on the matter, he still erred, because he did not have the right approach to the matter. He is like one who judges between people on the basis of ignorance: he will be in the Fire, even if he happened to give the right ruling, but his sin is less grave than that of one who gives a wrong ruling. And Allah knows best. This is similar to the case in which Allah calls those who accuse others of adultery (\u201cslander\u201d) liars, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd when they do not produce the witnesses, then it is they, in the sight of Allah, who are the liars\u201d [an-Noor 24:13]. The slanderer is a liar, even if his accusation of adultery is correct in and of itself, because he spoke of something of which it is not permissible to speak, even if he spoke on the basis of what he knows, because he has spoken of something of which he does not have certain knowledge. And Allah knows best.\nSee: Majmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (13/371); Tafseer Ibn Katheer (1/11).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 205290 and 262476.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Does Reading the Quran on Phones Rewardable?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The best with regard to reading or reciting the Quran is that which will increase a person in focus of mind. If he will have more focus of mind when he recites from memory, then that is best. If he will have more focus of mind when reading from the Mus-haf or from his mobile phone, then that is best.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Adhkar (p. 90-91):\n\u201cReading the Quran from the Mus-haf is better than reciting from memory . This is the view of our companions, and it is the well-known view among the early generations (may Allah be pleased with them). But this is not absolute; rather if a person can reflect, ponder and focus more when he recites from memory than when he reads from the Mus-haf, then in his case reciting from memory is better. If both options are equal in that regard, then reading from the Mus-haf is better. This is what the early generations meant when discussing this issue.\u201d\nSome inauthentic Hadiths were narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which are not sound enough to be taken as evidence, concerning the virtue of looking in the Mus-haf. For more information on that, please see the answer to question no.\u00a032594 .\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is there a difference in reward between reading the Quran from the Mus-haf or reciting from memory ? If I read the Quran from the Mus-haf, is it acceptable to read with my eyes only or must I also move my lips? Is it sufficient to move the lips, or must there also be some sound?\nHe replied:\u00a0\n\u201cI do not know of any evidence to suggest that there is a difference between reading from the Mus-haf or reciting from memory; rather what is prescribed is to reflect and focus, whether one reads from the Mus-haf or recites from memory. It can only be called recitation if it can be heard; it is not sufficient just to look with the eyes, or to think of the words without uttering them. The Sunnah is for the reader to utter the words and reflect, as Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201c[This is] a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded.\u201d [Sad 38:29]\n\u201cThen do they not reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon [their] hearts?\u201d [Muhammad 47:24]\nIf reciting from memory will help one to focus more and reflect more on the Quran, then that is better; if reading from the Mus-haf will help one to focus more and reflect more, then that is better. And Allah is the source of strength.\u201d (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 24/352)\nThus it will become clear that if you read the Quran from your mobile phone with focus and reflecting on the meaning, your reward will not be less than that for reading from the Mus-haf, in sha Allah. What matters is focus of mind and benefitting from reading the Quran.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 108242 , 125930 , 108477 , and 131946 \u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

Some of these soorahs are more special than others, as there are saheeh hadiths which highlight the special virtue of Soorat al-Faatihah, al-Ikhlaas, Soorat al-Kaafiroon, the Mi\u2018wadhatayn [al-Falaq and an-Naas], az-Zalzalah, al-A\u2018laa, Soorat al-Baqarah and Aal \u2018Imraan. As for the rest of soorahs of the Qur\u2019an, they have their own special virtues too.\nThe soorahs are given names, because each one discusses a particular topic which makes it stand out from other soorahs, and contains rulings, exhortation and etiquette, and it has a particular significance in that the one who recites it will have a reward according to what the soorah contains of exhortation and rulings that are unique to it.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is it permissible to complete the Qur\u2019an every day? How are we to understand the proven reports which say that the salaf used to complete it in less than three days?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nReading and reciting the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is one of the greatest acts of worship in Islam. How can that not be the case, when what is read is the words of Allah, may He be exalted? In addition to this honour that is attained by the one who reads the Qur\u2019an, Allah, may He be exalted, has promised the reader great rewards in this world and the hereafter, such as it being guidance and healing for him, that for every letter he will have ten good deeds (hasanaat) to his credit, that the Qur\u2019an will intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection, and other rewards and benefits.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 141700.\nHence we see that the noble Sahaabah and Taabi\u2018een, and those of the early generations of this ummah who followed them, were keen to read the Book of their Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, and they would allocate for themselves a portion of it to be read every day.\nDespite their eagerness to read the Book of their Lord, they adhered to the guidelines set out by Islamic teachings and did not overstep the bounds, and did not let their eagerness cause them to do anything contrary to prophetic guidance. Hence the majority of scholars are of the view that the Qur\u2019an may be completed every seven days, and whoever has the strength to do more should not complete it in less than three days, except in specific circumstances which we will mention below.\nMost of the early generations adhered to the practice of completing it in seven days, following the advice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018Aas.\nIt was narrated that \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cRead the Qur\u2019an in a month.\u201d I said: I am able to do better than that\u2026 Until he said: \u201cThen read it once every seven days, and do not do any more than that.\u201d\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (4767) and Muslim (1159).\nSo they did not complete it in less than three days, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) discouraged them to do that.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that \u2018Abdullah \u2013 that is, ibn \u2018Amr \u2013 said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cNo one properly understands who reads the Qur\u2019an in less than three days.\u201d\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (2949), Abu Dawood (1390) and Ibn Maajah (1347); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.\nThis is what the Sahaabah understood from the Prophet\u2019s teachings, and the leading scholars followed them in that.\n-1-\nIt was narrated that Ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Read the Qur\u2019an in seven days and do not read it in less than three days.\nNarrated by Sa\u2018eed ibn Mansoor in his Sunan with a saheeh isnaad, as was stated by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Fadaa\u2019il al-Qur\u2019an (9/78)\n-2-\nIt was narrated from Mu\u2018aadh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) that he regarded it as makrooh to read the Qur\u2019an in less than three days.\nNarrated by Abu \u2018Ubayd in Fadaa\u2019il al-Qur\u2019an (p. 89)\u2019 classed as saheeh by Ibn Katheer in Fadaa\u2019il al-Qur\u2019an (p. 254).\n-3-\nIbn Katheer said:\nMore than one scholar among the early generations regarded it as makrooh to read the Qur\u2019an in less than three days. This is also the view of Abu \u2018Ubayd, Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh and others of the later generations.\nFadaa\u2019il al-Qur\u2019an (p. 254)\nIn addition to the fact that the one who reads it in less than three days does not understand it properly, he also does not benefit from the sublime and subtle meanings that are understood by the one who reads the Qur\u2019an with reflection, at a measured pace.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nReading Qur\u2019an in the manner enjoined instils great faith in the heart, and increases a person in certainty, reassurance and healing.\nMajmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa (7/283).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to what is mentioned in scholarly books about some people completing the Qur\u2019an four times in one day or four times in one night, such reports should be investigated to find out whether they are soundly narrated from their alleged sources, because it is highly unlikely that that happened, as the time is not long enough for that in the first place. The same may be said concerning the claim that some of them completed the Qur\u2019an between Maghrib and \u2018Isha\u2019 (!) and other claims that cannot be believed, even if one is able to read quickly. As for reading the entire Qur\u2019an in a single day, that is possible; in fact some of the leading scholars did that \u2013 as was narrated from them \u2013 in a single rak\u2018ah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for those who completed the Qur\u2019an in a single rak\u2018ah, they are innumerable, because they are so many. They include: \u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan, Tameem ad-Daari, and Sa\u2018eed ibn Jubayr.\nAl-Adhkaar (p. 102)\nBut is the one who does that following the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or is he doing something that is not permissible according to Islamic teachings?\nThe answer is that the one who does that as a habit and way of life is undoubtedly doing something that is contrary to Islamic teachings, and he can only be doing that at the expense of neglecting other shar\u2018i duties such as prayer, teaching his children, upholding ties of kinship and taking care of his family, or by neglecting working to earn a living.\nAs for the one who does that occasionally with the aim of reviewing what he has memorised, or to make the most of auspicious times \u2013 such as the month of Ramadan \u2013 or because he is observing i\u2018tikaaf (retreat for worship) in the mosque, or because he is focusing on worship for a limited time in Makkah, for example \u2013 then that is not contrary to Islamic teaching. It is in this manner that we may interpret the reports narrated from some of the imams (leading scholars), that they completed the Qur\u2019an twice in one day or once in a day; it is not to be understood that this was their way of life at all times.\nIbn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nQataadah regularly used to complete the Qur\u2019an every seven days, and in Ramadan he would complete it every three days, and in the last ten nights of Ramadan he would complete it every single night. In Ramadan ash-Shaafa\u2018i used to complete the Qur\u2019an sixty times [i.e., twice a day], reciting it outside of prayer. Something similar was also narrated from Abu Haneefah.\nThe prohibition on reading the entire Qur\u2019an in less than three days is to be understood as referring to doing that persistently. But at auspicious times, such as the month of Ramadan, and especially on the nights on which Laylat al-Qadr is sought, or in auspicious places, such as Makkah for those who go there and are not residents, then it is mustahabb to read a great deal of Qur\u2019an so as to make the most of that time or that place. This is the view of Ahmad, Ishaaq and other leading scholars, and is indicated by the actions of other scholars, as mentioned above.\nLataa\u2019if al-Ma\u2018aarif, p. 171\nSee also the answer to question no. 50781\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Some of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) who memorised the Book of Allah, may He be exalted",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were the most eager of people to do good and the swiftest in doing righteous deeds, and the most able to do such deeds.\nOne of the greatest of their concerns was memorising the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, learning it and acting upon it, then teaching it to people. They used to learn it from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and they would teach it to one another. So whoever missed out on learning something from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because they were preoccupied with jihad, would learn it from his companions.\nThe most famous of those who used to teach people the Quran include: \u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan, \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib, and Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with them). They taught many of the younger Sahaabah and, after that, many of the Taabi\u2018een.\nAbu \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sulami said: Those who used to teach us the Quran told us that they used to learn it from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). When they learned ten verses, they would not move on until they put into practice what those verses said, so we used to learn the Quran and how to act upon its teachings together.\"(Tafseer al-Qurtubi\u00a0 1/80).\nSo the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) strove to memorise the Book of Allah and teach it to people and help them to memorise it.\nSuwayd ibn \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez said: When Abu\u2019d-Darda\u2019 had prayed Fajr in the mosque of Damascus, the people would gather to learn Quran from him, so he would put them into groups of ten, with an instructor for each group, and he would stand in the mihrab watching them. If one of them made a mistake, he would refer to his instructor, and if the instructor made a mistake, he would refer to Abu\u2019d-Darda\u2019 and ask him about that.\nIt was narrated that Ibn Mashkam said: Abu\u2019d-Darda\u2019 said to me: Count those who are studying the Quran with me. I counted them, and they were over one thousand and six hundred, and for each group of ten there was a teacher.\"(Ma\u2018rifat al-Qurra\u2019 al-Kibaar, p. 20)\nSecondly:\nA great number of the Sahaabah memorised the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and they were so great in number that they could not all be listed. A number of the scholars mentioned the most prominent of those among them who memorised the Book of Allah.\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAbu \u2018Ubayd mentioned those among the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who memorised the Quran. Among the Muhaajireen he listed the four caliphs, Talhah, Sa\u2018d, Ibn Mas\u2018ood, Hudhayfah, Saalim, Abu Hurayrah, \u2018Abdullah ibn as-Saa\u2019ib and the \u2018Abdullahs. Among the women he listed \u2018Aa\u2019ishah, Hafsah and Umm Salamah. But some of these only completed its memorisation after the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had died.\nIn Kitaab ash-Sharee\u2018ah, Ibn Abi Dawood listed among the Muhaajireen also: Tameem ibn Aws ad-Daari and \u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018Aamir. Among the Ansaar he listed: \u2018Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit, Mu\u2018aadh who was known by the kunyah Abu Haleemah, Mujammi\u2018 ibn Haarithah, Fadaalah ibn \u2018Ubayd, Maslamah ibn Makhlad, and others. He stated that some of them only memorised it after the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had died. Among others who also memorised it was Abu Moosa al-Ash\u2018ari, who was mentioned by Abu \u2018Amr ad-Daani. Some later scholars also listed \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018Aas, Sa\u2018d ibn \u2018Abbaad and Umm Waraqah as being among those who memorised the Quran.\"(Fath al-Baari\u00a0 9/52)\nSee also: al-Itqaan by as-Suyooti (1/248-249)\nAmong the most prominent of these Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) are the following:\n1. Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe died on a Monday in Jumaada al-Oola 13 AH at the age of sixty-three. \u2018Umar led the funeral prayer for him, and he was buried with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (5/316)\n2. \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab\nHe was killed on a Wednesday 26 Dhu\u2019l-Hijjah 23 AH, at the age of sixty-three; there are other views concerning his age.\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (7/441)\n3. \u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe was one of those who memorised the Quran at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died a martyr, unlawfully killed in his house, on 18 Dhu\u2019l-Hijjah 35 AH, at the age of eighty-two, according to the correct view.\n4. \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe was killed in Kufah on the morning of 17 Ramadan 40 AH. He memorised the Quran after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and it was said that he memorised it during his lifetime.\n5. Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe was the most prominent of the Quran-reciters, the one who had best memorised the Book of Allah. He memorised it at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) he died in Madinah in 20 AH or 19 AH.\n6. \u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018ood ibn Ghaafil (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe memorised the Quran at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in Madinah at the end of 32 AH.\n7. Zayd ibn Thaabit ibn ad-Dahhaak (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe memorised the Quran at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in 45 AH, according to the more correct view.\n8. Abu Moosa al-Ash\u2018ari, \u2018Abdullah ibn Qays (may Allah be pleased with him)\n\u00a0He learned the Quran from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in Dhu\u2019l-Hijjah 44 AH according to the correct view.\n9. Abu\u2019d-Darda\u2019 \u2018Uwaymir ibn Zayd al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in 33 AH.\n10. Abu Hurayrah ad-Dawsi (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran from Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b. He died in 57 or 58 or 59 AH.\n11. \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abbaas ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran from Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b. He died in at-Taa\u2019if in 68 AH.\n12. \u2018Abdullah ibn as-Saa\u2019ib ibn Abi\u2019s-Saa\u2019ib, the most prominent reciter of the people of Makkah\nHe was a companion of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and narrated a few reports. He was one of the younger Sahaabah. He learned the Quran from Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b.. He died around 70 AH, during the governorship of Ibn az-Zubayr.\nSee: Ma\u2018rifat al-Qurra\u2019 al-Kibaar by al-Haafiz adh-Dhahabi (p. 10-25).\n13. Mu\u2018aadh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in 17 or 18 AH, at the age of thirty-four.\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (10/187).\n14. Saalim the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in 11 AH on the day of al-Yamaamah.\nAl-Bidaayah wa\u2019n-Nihaayah (9/497).\n15. \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab\nHe learned the Quran from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and from \u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan and Zayd ibn Thaabit. He died in 73 AH or, it was said, in 74 AH.\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (5/330)\n16. \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018Aas (may Allah be pleased with him)\nIbn Maajah (1346) narrated that he said: I memorized the Quran and once I recited it all in one night. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI am afraid that you may live a long life and that you may get tired \u2026\u201d Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.\nHe died in 63 AH; it was also said that he died in 65 or 68 AH, and there were other views.\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (5/338)\n17. \u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).

        "question": "False reports than attribute some linguistic errors to the Holy Qur\u2019an",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tWhen answering \n\tthis question, we cannot hide our extreme astonishment that this specious \n\targument was accepted by some researchers and educated people. In fact we \n\tcannot hide our astonishment at how anyone could let this specious argument \n\tconfuse him in the first place, not only because the Muslims should accept \n\tthe infallibility of the Qur\u2019an because Allah promised to preserve it, but \n\talso because we see that this specious argument has no sound rational or \n\tlogical basis.\n\n\tWe may sum up \n\tour refutation of this argument in the following points:\n\n\tI.\n\n\tWe should \n\trealise that the rules of grammar are only based on the styles of expression \n\tthat have been transmitted to us from the eras that are regarded as \n\tauthoritative, and there is no difference of opinion among linguists \n\tconcerning the fact that the era of Prophethood is one of the authoritative \n\teras. Any word narrated soundly to us (from that era) constitutes a valid \n\tlinguistic proof; rather it is valid to be accepted as forming a foundation \n\tfor some rule of Arabic grammar.\n\n\tII.\n\n\tTo clarify that \n\tfurther, we may say: is it valid for a researcher to quote some lines of \n\tverse from Imru\u2019ul-Qays that the scholars narrated from him, and there is no \n\tdoubt concerning its narration, then think that there is some grammatical or \n\tlinguistic error in his view, and thus conclude that Imru\u2019ul-Qays made some \n\tgrammatical errors in his poetry?!\n\n\tIs that not \n\tundermining the foundation on which the rules of grammar are based, and \n\tdemolishing this entire branch of knowledge itself? So how about if some \n\tignorant person concluded that there is a linguistic or grammatical mistake \n\tin the Holy Qur\u2019an, when the noble Sahaabah and Taabi\u2018een transmitted the \n\tQur\u2019an during the authoritative era and during the time when everyone spoke \n\tcorrect Arabic (fus-ha), and in fact the scholars, grammarians and people of \n\teloquence recited the Qur\u2019an and transmitted it, without anyone among them \n\traising any objection, with a few exceptions with regard to some modes of \n\trecitation that did not reach some grammarians via chains of transmission \n\tthat reached the level of tawaatur.\n\n\tIs it not the \n\tcase that this ignorant person is more deserving of criticism and being \n\tdescribed as mistaken than the pure Arabs, on whose speech the rules of the \n\tlanguage are based?\n\n\tIII.\n\n\tIf we reflect \n\tupon the verses in which they think there was a mistake, we will realise \n\tthat they are in fact in harmony with some known grammatical rules, and that \n\this thinking that there is a mistake in those verses is very far-fetched.\n\n\tAs-Suyooti (may \n\tAllah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tThe scholars of \n\tArabic language spoke about these verses, and they found an explanation for \n\ttheir grammatical structure.\n\n\tAs for the verse \n\t(interpretation of the meaning), \u201cVerily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]\u201d \n\t[Taa-Haa 20:56], there are several explanations:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tIt is in \n\taccordance with a dialect in which the dual form always appears with the \n\talif [i.e., -aani rather than \u2013ayni] in all three cases [nominative \n\t(subject), accusative (object) and genitive (possessive)]. This is the \n\twell-known dialect of Kinaanah and, it was said, of Banu\u2019l-Haarith.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tThe subject of\n\tinna (translated here as Verily), which is omitted, is in the \n\taccusative [in accordance with grammatical rules], so the sentence is \n\tsubject and predicate, the predicate of inna.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tWhat is meant by\n\tinna is kadhaalika (moreover). The word saahiraan (two \n\tmagicians) is the predicate of a hidden [or omitted] subject [and therefore \n\tappears in the nominative form, in accordance with the rules of Arabic \n\tgrammar]. The implied meaning is: they are indeed two magicians.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tWhat is meant by\n\tinna in this instance is \u201cYes\u201d.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tThe first \n\tsyllable of the word haadhaani [these two] is a pronoun, and the \n\twords \u201cdhaani la saahiraan\u201d are the subject and predicate of inna. \n\tBut we have explained above that this is not possible, because inna \n\tis written on its own and the syllable haa- is connected to the rest of its \n\tword, therefore the way it is written in the Mus-haf does not allow this \n\tinterpretation.\n\n\tI \u2013 that is, \n\tas-Suyooti \u2013 say: It seems to me that there is another possible explanation, \n\twhich is that the reason why the alif is used here is so as to make the word\n\tsaahiraan rhyme with the word yureedaan (they [dual form] \n\twant).\u00a0A \n\tsimilar example is seen in the words \u201cand \n\tI have come to you from Saba' (Sheba) with true news [min sabaa\u2019in bi \n\tnabaa\u2019in]\u201d \n\t[an-Naml 27:22].\n\t\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe words \u201cand \n\tthose who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) wa\u2019l-muqeemeena as-salaata\u201d \n\t[an-Nisa\u2019 4:162], there are also several explanations for it:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tIt is \n\tdisconnected from the context, as if it is saying: And I praise\u2026 \u2013 because \n\tthat is more eloquent.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the phrase \u201cbelieve \n\tin what has been sent down to you\u201d \n\tthat is, and they believe in those who perform as-Salaah [the prayer], \n\tnamely the Prophets or, it was said, the angels. It was said that what is \n\tmeant is that they believe in the religion of those who perform the prayer, \n\tso what is meant thereby is the Muslims.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the word \u201cbefore\u201d, that is, before you and before those who perform the \n\tprayer.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the pronoun \u201cyou\u201d in the phrase \u201cbefore \n\tyou\u201d.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the pronoun \u201cyou\u201d in the phrase \u201cto \n\tyou\u201d.\n\n\t6.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the pronoun \u201cthem\u201d in the phrase \u201camong \n\tthem\u201d.\n\n\tThese \n\tpossibilities were narrated by Abu\u2019l-Baqa\u2019.\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe words \u201cand \n\tthe Sabians [wa\u2019s-saabi\u2019oona]\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:69], \n\tthere are also several interpretations:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tIt is a subject \n\tof which the predicate is omitted; in other words, and the Sabians are also \n\tlike that.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the particle inna and the word which follows it (alladheena \n\t\u2013 those who), which together form the subject, and it is the predicate, \n\ttherefore it appears in the nominative [in accordance with the rules of \n\tArabic grammar]. \n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the subject of the verb haadu, which means to be Jewish (\u201cthose \n\twho are the Jews\u201d).\n\t\n\n\t4.\n\tInna \n\there means Yes. So the words \u201cthose who believe\u201d and what comes after that \n\tare nominative, and the words \u201cand \n\tthe Sabians [wa\u2019s-saabi\u2019oona]\u201d \n\tare connected to that.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tIt is like using \n\tthe plural form when referring to the singular.\n\n\tThese \n\texplanations were narrated from Abu\u2019l-Baqa\u2019.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tal-Itqaan fi \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019an (1247-1249), ed by Markaz ad-Diraasaat \n\tal-Qur\u2019aniyyah.\n\n\tWe realise that \n\texplaining these grammatical possibilities may take a long time, and many \n\treaders may not understand them because of their subtlety, but we have \n\tquoted them here so that the ignorant ones who try to undermine the Holy \n\tQur\u2019an will realise the extent of their ignorance of Arabic grammar and \n\tlanguage, and thus they may know their limits and not go beyond the dictates \n\tof sound reasoning.\n\n\tIV.\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe reports narrated from some of the Sahaabah and Taabi\u2018een about this \n\ttopic, there are many such reports, which were compiled by al-Haafiz \n\tas-Suyooti in his book al-Itqaan fi \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019an (p. 1236-1257), \n\twhere he discuss them in detail. We will limit it here to discussing the \n\thadiths mentioned in the question, which were narrated from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah and \n\t\u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with them) concerning this matter.\n\n\tThe first report \n\twas narrated from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her).\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Hishaam ibn \u2018Urwah from his father, who said:\n\n\tI asked \n\t\u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) about the grammatical mistakes in \n\tthe Qur\u2019an: \u201cSurely, \n\tthose who believe, those who are the Jews and the Sabians [wa\u2019s-saabi\u2019oona]\u201d\n\t\n\t[al-Maa\u2019idah 5:69]; \n\t\u201cand those \n\twho perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) wa muqeemeena as-salaata \n\twa\u2019l-mu\u2019toona az-zakaata\u201d [an-Nisa\u2019 4:162]; \n\tand \u201cVerily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]\u201d [Taa-Haa 20:63]. \n\tShe said: O son of my sister, these are the mistakes of the scribes; they \n\tmade a mistake when writing.\n\n\tThis report was \n\tnarrated from Hishaam ibn \u2018Urwah by two of the Kufi narrators:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tAbu Mu\u2018aawiyah \n\tad-Dareer\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Sa\u2018eed ibn Mansoor in as-Sunan (4/1507, no. 769) with this \n\twording. It was also narrated by Abu \u2018Ubayd in Fadaa\u2019il al-Qur\u2019an (p. \n\t229, no. 556) and via him by Abu \u2018Amr ad-Daani in al-Muqni\u2018 (p. 119). \n\tIt was narrated by Ibn Jareer at-Tabari in Jaami\u2018 al-Bayaan (9/359) \n\tand Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif (p. 43).\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\t\u2018Ali ibn Mas-har \n\tal-Kufi\n\n\tAs was narrated \n\tby \u2018Umar ibn Shubbah with his isnaad in Tareekh al-Madinah \n\t(3/1013-1014).\n\n\tSuch a report \n\tthat has such an isnaad is not sound. The problem with it is that the \n\tcritics spoke ill of the reports narrated by Hishaam ibn \u2018Urwah himself when \n\the was in Iraq. Even though he was a trustworthy scholar, and in principle \n\twhat he narrated is to be taken as sound and acceptable, he made a few \n\tmistakes that the scholars could notice by examining the text of the hadith \n\tand researching other corroborating reports and similar reports. Because in \n\tthe text of this report there is something that is clearly odd, and there is \n\tno corroborating report narrated via any other chain of narrators, we can \n\tsay that there is a mistake in it.\n\n\tImam adh-Dhahabi \n\t(may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tWhen he \u2013 i.e., \n\tHishaam ibn \u2018Urwah \u2013 came to Iraq at the end of his life, he taught a great \n\tdeal of knowledge, but there were a few hadiths that he reported (during \n\tthat teaching) that were not sound. Such a thing could happen to Maalik, \n\tShu\u2018bah, Wakee\u2018 and other trustworthy and prominent scholars.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tMizaan al-I\u2018tidaal (4/301).

See also the commentary by Dr \n\tSa\u2018d al-Humayd (may Allah preserve him) on this report in his annotation of\n\tSunan Sa\u2018eed ibn Mansoor (4/507-514).\n\n\tIf someone were \n\tto ask: How could al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) and Muslim, in \n\ttheir Saheehs, narrate hadiths from Hishaam ibn \u2018Urwah from the \n\tIraqis, and narrate from Abu Mu\u2018aawiyah, yet here you are rejecting them, \n\teven though as-Suyooti classed this report as saheeh in al-Itqaan (p. \n\t1236) and said that it meets the conditions of the two shaykhs (al-Bukhaari \n\tand Muslim)? The answer to that is that we are rejecting this report here \n\tbecause the text is obviously odd. It is unlikely that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with her) had not heard these verses with this grammatical \n\tstructure from the lips of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n\thim), and thought that the mistakes had occurred at the hands of the scribes \n\tof the Holy Qur\u2019an.\n\n\tIf the critics \n\tfind something definitely odd in a text, they examine the isnaad, looking \n\tfor some subtle problem with it because of which this problem occurred in \n\tthe text. Here the problem is that it is a hadith from Hishaam ibn \u2018Urwah \n\twhen he was in Iraq.\n\n\tThe second \n\treport is narrated from \u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan (may Allah be pleased with \n\thim).\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tfrom him by a number of narrators:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\t\u2018Ikrimah the \n\tfreed slave of Ibn \u2018Abbaas.\n\n\tHe said: When \n\tthe Mus-hafs had been written, they were shown to \u2018Uthmaan and he found in \n\tthem some grammatical mistakes, but he said: Do not change them, for the \n\tArabs will change them \u2013 or will read them correctly. If the scribe had been \n\tfrom Thaqeef and the one who dictated it had been from Hudhayl, these \n\tmistakes would not have occurred.\n\n\tNarrated by Abu \n\t\u2018Ubayd in Fadaa\u2019il al-Qur\u2019an (2/103, no. 562); Ibn Abi Dawood in \n\tal-Masaahif (1/235, no. 110). They attributed it to as-Suyooti in \n\tal-Itqaan (p. 1239); to Ibn al-Anbaari in ar-Radd \u2018ala man khaalafa \n\tMus-haf \u2018Uthmaan; and to Ibn Ashtah in al-Masaahif \u2013 the latter \n\tare two lost books. This is a da\u2018eef (weak) report, because the narration of \n\t\u2018Ikrimah from \u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan is mursal, as is his narration from Abu \n\tBakr, \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib and the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace \n\tof Allah be upon him). See: Jaami\u2018 at-Tahseel (p. 239). Abu \u2018Amr \n\tad-Daani clearly stated in al-Muqni\u2018 (p. 115) that there is an \n\tinterruption of the chain of narration between \u2018Ikrimah and \u2018Uthmaan. \n\tMoreover, \u2018Ikrimah is referred to by Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif as \n\tat-Taa\u2019i and not as the freed slave of Ibn \u2018Abbaas, and we have not come \n\tacross his biography.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tYahya ibn Ya\u2018mur\n\n\tHe said: It was \n\tnarrated by Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif (1/233) and Ibn Ashtah in\n\tal-Masaahif, as as-Suyooti mentioned in al-Itqaan (p. 1240). \n\tThis is also a mursal report, because it does not seem from the biography of \n\tYahya ibn Ya\u2018mur that he was a contemporary of \u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan (may \n\tAllah be pleased with him). See his biography in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb \n\t(11/305). al-Bukhaari deemed it to be munqati\u2018 in at-Tareekh al-Kabeer \n\t(5/170). Moreover, there is some confusion about the isnaad, as sometimes it \n\tis narrated from Yahya ibn Ya\u2018mur from \u2018Abdullah ibn Futaybah or ibn Abi \n\tFutaymah, and sometimes it is the other way round, so it is narrated from \n\tIbn Futaymah from Yahya ibn Ya\u2018mur, as in Tareekh al-Madinah \n\t(3/1013). Qataadah sometimes narrates from Nasr ibn \u2018Aasim from Yahya, and \n\tsometimes he narrates from Yahya directly, without mentioning Nasr; or there \n\tmay be two other narrators between him and Yahya, as in the place referred \n\tto above in Tareekh al-Madinah. Al-Baaqillaani pointed out these \n\tdifferences in al-Intisaar li\u2019l-Qur\u2019an (2/136-137).\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\t\u2018Abd al-A\u2018la ibn \n\t\u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Aamir\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Ibn al-Anbaari in ar-Radd \u2018ala man khaalafa Mus-haf \u2018Uthmaan, as \n\twas mentioned by as-Suyooti in al-Itqaan (p. 1240). The biography of \n\t\u2018Abd al-A\u2018la is in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (87/6). In the book there is \n\tnothing to suggest that any of the scholars regarded him as a sound \n\tnarrator.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tQataadah\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif. This version says: When \u2018Uthmaan \n\t(may Allah be pleased with him) was given the Mus-haf to check it, he said: \n\tThere are mistakes in it, but the Arabs will recite it correctly. There is \n\tsome ambiguity in its chain of narration about one of the narrators, because \n\tit says: our companions told us.\n\n\tFrom the above \n\tit may be understood that the isnaads of this report are not sound, and \n\tweakness of the isnaad leads to doubt concerning the texts of the report and \n\tregarding the source of those texts.\n\n\tV.\n\n\tThe scholars \n\tdiscussed the way these reports should be understood, as we will highlight \n\there in brief, then follow that with lengthy quotations from the scholars \n\tfor anyone who wants this benefit.\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tThe fact that \n\tall the Mus-hafs that the Sahaabah had agreed on the way these verses were \n\twritten, and that all the Muslims agreed on their recitation, generation \n\tafter generation, proves that there was no grammatical mistake on the part \n\tof the scribe. Rather this is how it was heard from the Prophet (blessings \n\tand peace of Allah be upon him).\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tThe fact that \n\tthe Sahaabah and Taabi\u2018een were very keen and devoted a great deal of effort \n\tto transmitting the Holy Qur\u2019an, and indeed to transmitting details of the \n\tProphet\u2019s Sunnah and serving this religion, offering their souls and their \n\twealth, means that it is not possible for mistakes to have been made by the \n\tscribes who wrote down the Holy Qur\u2019an, then for no one after them to have \n\tcorrected them until the present day.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt is not \n\tpossible that \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) could issue orders \n\tthat copies of the Qur\u2019an be made and distributed to many regions, so as to \n\tput an end to disputes between reciters, then leave these mistakes caused \n\tthe scribes in the Mus-hafs, and not issue orders that they be corrected. \n\tBelieving that is contrary to sound reasoning.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tIt is possible \n\tto interpret \u2018Uthmaan\u2019s words, when he referred to mistakes, as referring to \n\tmistakes in recitation because the way some words are written may be unclear \n\tto some people, at some times. Therefore he reassured the people by saying \n\tthat the Arabs\u2019 understanding of the language would make them correct anyone \n\twho made a mistake in reciting the words of the Qur\u2019an. This is how Abu \u2018Amr \n\tad-Daani interpreted this report.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tIt is also \n\tpossible to interpret the words of \u2018Aa\u2019ishah as meaning that she thought \n\tthat if other modes of recitation had been chosen (to write the Mus-haf in \n\taccordance therewith), that were in accordance with the rules of the Arabic \n\tlanguage with which ordinary people were familiar, that would have been \n\tbetter. So her regarding what is written as wrong means that it was \n\tdifferent from the recitation that is known and common among the Arabs.\n\n\tIbn Jareer \n\tat-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tIn the \n\trecitation of Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b it says: \u201cwa\u2019l-muqeemeena \n\tas-salaata (and those who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah))\u201d\n\t[an-Nisa\u2019 4:162]. That is how it was written in his Mus-haf, as some \n\thave narrated. If that was a mistake by the scribes, then what must have \n\tbeen the case is that this should have meant that all the other Mus-hafs, \n\tapart from our Mus-haf, must have the same mistake, in a manner contrary to \n\twhat is in our Mus-haf. The fact that our Mus-haf is the same as the Mus-haf \n\tof Ubayy proves that what is in our Mus-haf in that regard is correct and is \n\tnot wrong. Moreover, if that was a mistake in writing, the Companions of the \n\tMessenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), from whom it \n\twas learned, would not have taught the Muslims to recite in an incorrect \n\tmanner, and they would have recited it correctly and would have taught the \n\tummah the correct way of reciting it. The fact that the Muslims transmitted \n\tthe recitation of these verses in the way they are written is the strongest \n\tevidence that what is written is sound and correct, and that there is no \n\tmistake on the part of the scribe.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tJaami\u2018 al-Bayaan (9/397). See also: al-Kashshaaf by \n\taz-Zamakhshari (1/590).\n\n\tAbu \u2018Amr \n\tad-Daani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tIf someone were \n\tto ask: What do you say about the report that they narrated from Yahya ibn \n\tYa\u2018mur and \u2018Ikrimah the freed slave of Ibn \u2018Abbaas from \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with him), that when copies were made of the Qur\u2019an, they were \n\tshown to him and he found some grammatical mistakes in them, but he said: \n\tLeave it, for the Arabs will be able to recite it correctly \u2013 and this \n\tindicates that there were some mistakes in the writing?\n\n\tI say: This \n\treport, in our view, cannot be raised to the level of constituting proof, \n\tand it is not valid to quote it as evidence, on two counts:\n\n\tFirstly: in \n\taddition to the flaws in its isnaad and the problems with its wording, it is \n\talso mursal, because Ibn Ya\u2018mur and \u2018Ikrimah did not hear anything from \n\t\u2018Uthmaan and did not see him.\n\n\tAlso, the \n\tapparent meaning of the wording cannot have been said by \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with him), because this report implies criticism of him, and how \n\tcould that criticism be valid when he is known to have attained a high level \n\tof religious leadership, a high status of service to Islam, great sincerity \n\ttowards the ummah and great efforts to do that which is in the best \n\tinterests of the Muslims? It is not possible that he could have compiled the \n\tMus-haf with the help of other righteous Sahaabah, so as to put an end to \n\tdifferences concerning the Qur\u2019an among them, then despite that leave in it \n\tgrammatical mistakes so that someone else (after he was gone) would have to \n\ttake on the task of changing it, who would no doubt not be able to reach his \n\tcalibre or level of knowledge. This is something that no one could accept \n\t(because it does not make sense), and it is not permissible for anyone to \n\tbelieve it.\n\n\tIf he were to \n\task: \n\n\tHow can you \n\tunderstand the report if it was soundly narrated from \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be \n\tpleased with him)?\n\n\tI say:\n\n\tThe way we may \n\tunderstand it is that what \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) meant by \n\tthe grammatical mistakes mentioned is mistakes in recitation, not in the way \n\tit was written, because in many places in the Qur\u2019an, if the words were to \n\tbe recited as they were written, that would give the opposite meaning and \n\twould change the wording. Do you not see the verses in which it says: \n\t\u201cla adhbahannahu (I \n\twill surely \u2026slaughter him)\u201d [an-Naml 27:21], \u201cmin naba\u2019 il-mursaleen (the \n\tinformation (news) about the Messengers)\u201d [al-An\u2018aam 6:34], \n\tand other examples in which an additional alif, yaa or waw appears in the \n\tway it is written. Anyone who recites these words who is not familiar with \n\thow they are usually written will add to the pronunciation something that is \n\tnot part of it, so he will have made a mistake that is clear to anyone who \n\thears him, even though the way it is written is valid and was common. So \n\twhen he realised that, \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said that \n\twhoever is not familiar with the way of writing (some particular words) and \n\tdoes not have knowledge of that among those who come after him, will learn \n\tthat from the Arabs, because the Qur\u2019an was revealed in their language, so \n\tthey will teach him the correct recitation, and will explain to him the \n\tvalidity of the way in which it is written. This is how it is to be \n\tunderstood in my view. And Allah knows best.\n\n\tIf it is said: \n\twhat is meant by the words of \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) at \n\tthe end of this report, \u201cIf the scribe had been from Thaqeef and the one who \n\tdictated it had been from Hudhayl, these mistakes would not have occurred\u201d?\n\n\tI say: What it \n\tmeans is that it would not be written in that way, because Quraysh and \n\tothers who took charge of writing the Mus-hafs from people other than \n\tQuraysh used to write these words in this manner, and this way of writing \n\tthese words was common among them, but Thaqeef and Hudhayl, despite their \n\tgood command of Arabic, did not use this way of writing these words. \n\tTherefore if they \u2013 and not the Muhaajiroon and Ansaar \u2013 had been in charge \n\tof writing the Mus-hafs, they would have written all these words as they are \n\tpronounced, not on the basis of their meaning, because that was the usual \n\tpractice among them and was common. This is how we may understand the \n\tcomment of \u2018Uthmaan in my view, if it is proven and anyone can prove it. And \n\tAllah is the source of strength.\n\n\tIf it is said: \n\tThen what is the meaning of the report that you also narrated from Hishaam \n\tibn \u2018Urwah, from his father, that he asked \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased \n\twith her) about grammatical mistakes in the Qur\u2019an, about the verses, \u201cVerily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]\u201d [Taa-Haa 20:63], \u201cand \n\tthose who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) wa\u2019l muqeemeena as-salaata \n\twa\u2019l-mu\u2019toona az-zakaata wa\u2019l-mu\u2019minoona Billaah\u2026], and give Zakaah\u201d \n\t[an-Nisa\u2019 4:162] \n\tand \u201cSurely, those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah, in His Messenger \n\tMuhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and all that was \n\trevealed to him from Allah), those who are the Jews and the Sabians \n\t[wa\u2019s-saabi\u2019oona]\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:69], \n\tand she said: O \n\tson of my brother, this is the work of the scribes; they made mistakes in \n\twriting?\n\n\tI say:\n\n\tIts meaning is \n\tclear: \u2018Urwah did not ask \u2018Aa\u2019ishah about the written letters that may be \n\tadded for a reason or taken away for a reason, so as to make things clear \n\t(when adding) or to make writing easier (when taking away). Rather he was \n\tasking her about the modes of recitation in which words may differ, which \n\tmay lead to different meanings, according to the dialects in which Allah \n\tpermitted His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his \n\tummah to recite the Qur\u2019an, and to adhere to whichever mode of recitation \n\tthey wanted, so as to make things easy for them. If this is the case, then \n\tthere is no room for mistakes, error, confusion and slips, for these \n\tdialects are widely known and clear in the Arabic language. If this is the \n\tcase, then she was not referring to the meaning of what is written and it \n\thas nothing to do with that at all. Rather \u2018Urwah called that a mistake, and \n\t\u2018Aa\u2019ishah called the way it is written a mistake, but they did not literally \n\tmean it was a mistake; rather it was by way of exaggeration, because that \n\twas contrary to their way and was not something that they would have chosen \n\tthemselves. That was more appropriate in their view and was what was more \n\tcommon in their view, although not in a definitive way, because of what we \n\texplained above about that being valid and common in the language, and it \n\tbeing common usage in the Arabic language. Furthermore there was consensus \n\tthat these words were to be recited as such and not as they (\u2018Aa\u2019ishah and \n\t\u2018Urwah) thought they should be, except for the odd view of Abu \u2018Amr ibn \n\tal-\u2018Ala\u2019, who thought that it was to be recited inna haadhayni in \n\tthis particular instances. [This refers to \u201cVerily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]\u201d [Taa-Haa 20:63]]. \n\tThis is how we should understand this report. But we cannot be certain that \n\tthe Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), despite her \n\thigh status and prominence, and her vast knowledge of Islam and the language \n\tof her people, would accuse the Companions of making grammatical mistakes \n\tand accuse the scribes of making errors, when she was of such a high level \n\tof eloquence and knowledge of Arabic, as was well known and no one would \n\tignore or deny it. That is not appropriate and cannot be true. Some of our \n\tscholars interpreted the words of the Mother of the Believers, They made a \n\tmistake in writing, as meaning that they made a mistake by not choosing what \n\tis more proper of the seven modes of recitation with which the people were \n\tfamiliar, not that what they wrote was a mistake and was not valid, because \n\twhat is not valid is to be rejected by all. no matter how long a time has \n\telapsed since the error was made and no matter how widespread it has become. \n\tSome interpreted the word lahn,\u00a0 translated here as grammatical \n\terror, as referring to recitation and dialect, such as when \u2018Umar (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with him) said: Ubayy is the best reciter among you, even though \n\twe overlook some of his lahn \u2013 i.e., his way of recitation and \n\tdialect. This is clear. And Allah is the source of strength. End quote from\n\tal-Muqni\u2018 (118-119).\n\n\tAs-Suyooti (may \n\tAllah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tThese reports \n\tare very problematic.\n\n\tHow can it be \n\tthought of the Companions, first of all, that they made grammatical mistakes \n\twhen speaking, let alone when reciting Qur\u2019an, when they were the most \n\teloquent of people in Arabic!\n\n\tSecondly, how \n\tcan it be thought that they made grammatical mistakes in the Qur\u2019an which \n\tthey learned from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as \n\tit was revealed, and they memorised it and were very precise with regard to \n\tit?\n\n\tThirdly, how \n\tcould it be thought of them that they would all make the same mistake and \n\twrite it in a mistaken way?\n\n\tMoreover, how \n\tcan it be thought that they would not notice that and correct it?\n\n\tThen how can it \n\tbe thought that \u2018Uthmaan would forbid them to correct the mistake?\n\n\tThen how could \n\tit be thought that the recitation of the Qur\u2019an would continue on the basis \n\tof that mistake, when the Qur\u2019an was transmitted via tawaatur, one \n\tgeneration after another?\n\n\tThis is \n\timpossible on the basis of rational thinking and Islamic teachings and on \n\tthe basis of how things are.\n\n\tThe scholars \n\tresponded to that on three counts:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tThat was not \n\tsoundly narrated from \u2018Uthmaan. Its isnaad is weak (da\u2018eef), flawed \n\t(mudtarib) and interrupted (munqati\u2018). Moreover, \u2018Uthmaan intended to make \n\tthe Mus-haf the reference point to be followed, so how could he see in it \n\tgrammatical mistakes and leave them for the Arabs to correct them when they \n\trecited it. If those who were charged with collecting the Mus-haf and \n\tputting it together in one book, who were the best of people, did not \n\tcorrect it, then how could others do that?!\n\n\tMoreover, \n\t\u2018Uthmaan did not only make one copy of the Qur\u2019an; rather he made many \n\tcopies. So if it is said that there were grammatical mistakes in all of \n\tthem, it is very far-fetched to suggest that the same mistake would be \n\trepeated in all of them, or if the mistake happened in some of them, then \n\tthis is an acknowledgement that some were correct. But none of the reports \n\tsaid that this mistake was in one Mus-haf and not another. The Mus-hafs \n\tnever differed, except in cases where there is an alternative mode of \n\trecitation, and that is not a grammatical error.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tIf we assume \n\tthat the report is sound, then it is to be interpreted as referring to the \n\tsigns or symbols showing where something is omitted, such as the long alif \n\tin words such as al-kitaab (the book), as-saabiroon (the \n\tpatient ones) and so on.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt may be interpreted as referring to words where the way in \n\twhich they are pronounced is different from the way in which they are \n\twritten. For example, they wrote \u201cla adhbahannahu (I \n\twill surely \u2026slaughter him)\u201d \n\t[an-Naml 27:21], \n\twith an alif after the laam, and \u201cbi aydin (With power)\u201d [adh-Dhaariyaat \n\t51:47] with two yaas. If these words to be recited as they are written, \n\tthat would be a grammatical mistake. \n\n\tThis response \n\tand the previous one were given by Ibn Ashtah in Kitaab al-Masaahif.\n\n\tIbn al-Anbaari \n\tsaid in ar-Radd \u2018ala man khaalafa Mus-haf \u2018Uthmaan, concerning the \n\thadiths narrated from \u2018Uthmaan about that:\n\n\tThey do not \n\tconstitute proof, because their isnaads are interrupted and are not intact. \n\tNo man of common sense and reasoning could accept that \u2018Uthmaan \u2013 who was \n\tthe caliph of the ummah and the leader of the people of his time \u2013 could \n\tunite them in accepting the Mus-haf which was the main reference, then \n\trealise that there were mistakes in it and mistakes in the way in which it \n\twas written, then not correct them. No, by Allah, no one who is fair minded \n\tand possesses understanding could think such a thing. He could not believe \n\tthat he would leave the mistake in the books of the people after him to \n\tcorrect it, when the people who would come after him would have no choice \n\tbut to refer to it and go by it. Whoever claims that when \u2018Uthmaan said, \u201cI \n\tsee mistakes in it,\u201d he mean, I see mistakes in the way it is written, then \n\tif we recite it correctly the mistake in writing will not matter in the \n\tsense of distorting the words and going against grammatical rules, is \n\tmistaken, because the way it is written is the way it is to be recited and \n\tpronounced. So whoever makes a mistake in writing will make a mistake in \n\twhat he utters. \u2018Uthmaan would never have delayed correcting a mistake \n\tconcerning the words of the Qur\u2019an, whether in the way they are written or \n\tthe way they are pronounced. It is well-known that \u2018Uthmaan was constantly \n\tin contact with the Qur\u2019an, and was skilled in reciting it in accordance \n\twith the way it was written in the copies of the Qur\u2019an that were sent to \n\tthe various regions. He (as-Suyooti) supported that with what Abu \u2018Ubayd \n\tnarrated. He said: \u2018Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Mahdi told us, from \u2018Abdullah ibn \n\tMubaarak: Abu Waa\u2019il, an old man from Yemen, told us, from Haani\u2019 \n\tal-Barbari, the freed slave of \u2018Uthmaan, who said: I was with \u2018Uthmaan when \n\tthey were presenting the Mus-hafs to him. He sent me to Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b with \n\tthe shoulder blade of a sheep, on which was written, \u201clam yatasanna\u201d and \n\t\u201claa tabdeelah lil-khalq\u201d and \u201cfa amhil al-kaafireen\u201d. He called for an ink \n\tpot and erased one of the two laams (in the word \u201clil khalq\u201d) and wrote \u201cli \n\tkhalq-illah (\u201cin the creation of Allah\u201d \u2013 referring to the verse \n\t\u201cNo \n\tchange let there be in Khalq\u00acill\u00e2h (i.e. the religion of All\u00e2h)\u201d \n\t[ar-Room 30:30]). \n\tHe erased the word fa amhil and wrote \u201cfa mahhil\u201d (\u201cso give respite\u201d \n\treferring to the verse\u201cSo \n\tgive respite to the disbelievers\u201d \n\t[at-Taariq 86:17]). \n\tAnd he wrote lam yatasannah (\u201cthey show no change\u201d, referring to the verse\n\t\u201cthey \n\tshow no change\u201d \n\t[al-Baqarah 2:259]); \n\the added the letter haa\u2019 to it. \n\n\tIbn al-Anbaari \n\tsaid: How can it be claimed that he saw some mistakes and let them pass, \n\twhen he was checking what was written and disputes between scribes were \n\treferred to him so that he could judge on the basis of truth, and he would \n\tcompel them to write what is correct and make it final?\n\n\tThis is also \n\tsupported by what Ibn Ashtah narrated in al-Masaahif. He said: \n\tal-Hasan ibn \u2018Uthmaan told us: ar-Rabee\u2018 ibn Badr informed us, from Siwaar \n\tibn Shubayb, who said: I asked Ibn az-Zubayr about the Mus-hafs and he \n\tsaid:\u00a0 A man went to \u2018Umar and said: O Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen, the people are \n\targuing about the Qur\u2019an. \u2018Umar thought of collecting the Qur\u2019an and making \n\tit according to one recitation, but then he was fatally stabbed. During the \n\tcaliphate of \u2018Uthmaan, that man stood up and spoke to him about the issue, \n\tand \u2018Uthmaan collected and made copies of the Mus-hafs. Then he sent me to \n\t\u2018Aa\u2019ishah, and I brought the pages and showed them to her so that she could \n\tcorrect them, then he ordered that all other copies be destroyed. This \n\tindicates that they checked it and verified it, and they did not leave \n\tanything that needed to be corrected but they corrected it.\n\n\tThen Ibn Ashtah \n\tsaid: Muhammad ibn Ya\u2018qoob informed us: Abu Dawood Sulaymaan ibn al-Ash\u2018ath \n\tinformed us: Ahmad ibn Mas\u2018adah informed us: Ismaa\u2018eel informed us: \n\tal-Haarith ibn \u2018Abd ar-Rahman told me, from \u2018Abd al-A\u2018la ibn \u2018Abdullah ibn \n\t\u2018Aamir who said: When the writing of the Mus-haf was finished, it was \n\tbrought to \u2018Uthmaan and he looked at it, then he said: You have done well. I \n\tsee something but we will be able to correct it according to our dialect.\n\n\tThere is no \n\tproblem with this report, and it explains the meaning of what appears above. \n\tIt is as if it was shown to him immediately after the writing of it was \n\tfinished, and he saw something in it that was written differently from the \n\tway Quraysh would pronounce it, as happened with the word taaboot \n\t[which may be written with taa\u2019 marbootah or taa\u2019 maftoohah], so he promised \n\tto correct it according to the dialect of Quraysh. Then he fulfilled that \n\tpromise when he examined it and verified it, and he did not leave anything \n\t(that needed to be corrected but he corrected it). Perhaps the one who \n\tnarrated those reports quoted above distorted what he heard and did not \n\tremember it precisely as \u2018Uthmaan had said it, which resulted in this \n\tconfusion. This is the best answer that could be given for this problem, to \n\tAllah be praise.\n\n\tSo none of these \n\tresponses is sound with regard to the hadith of \u2018Aa\u2019ishah.\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe response that classes it as da\u2018eef (weak), that is to be rejected \n\tbecause its isnaad is saheeh (sound) as you see. \n\n\tAs for the \n\tresponse which speaks of signs or symbols showing where something is \n\tomitted, \u2018Urwah\u2019s question about the words mentioned does not fit that \n\tdiscussion.\n\n\tIbn Ashtah said \n\t\u2013 and Ibn Jabbaarah followed him in Sharh ar-Raa\u2019iyyah, that what is meant \n\tby her saying, They made a mistake means: in choosing that which was more \n\tappropriate of the seven modes of recitation, according to which all people \n\tcould recite. It does not mean that the way they wrote it is wrong and is \n\tnot permissible. He said: The evidence for that is that whatever is not \n\tpermissible is to be rejected by all, regardless of the passage of time \n\tsince that mistake was made.\n\n\tHe said: With \n\tregard to the view of Sa\u2018eed ibn Jubayr about it being a lahn on the part of \n\tthe scribe, perhaps what he meant by lahn is recitation and dialect, meaning \n\tthat this is the dialect of the one who wrote it and the way he recited it, \n\tand there is another way to recite it .\n\n\tThen he narrated \n\tfrom Ibraaheem an-Nakha\u2018i that he said: \u201cinna hadhaani la saahiraan\u201d \n\t[Taa-Haa 20:63] and \u201cinna hadhayni la saahiraan\u201d are the same. \n\tPerhaps they wrote alif instead of yaa, and in \u201cwa\u2019s-saabi\u2019oona\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah \n\t5:69] they wrote waw instead of yaa\u2019.\n\n\tIbn Ashtah said:\n\n\tThat is, it is \n\takin to replacing a letter when writing it with another letter, as in the \n\twords salaah, zakaah and hayaat [which in the Qur\u2019an are written with a waw \n\talthough they are pronounced as if they are written with a long alif].\n\n\tAnd I say: This \n\tanswer could be fine if it was recited with a yaa\u2019, but the way it is \n\twritten is different. As recitation is done according to the way it is \n\twritten, there is no comparison between the two.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tal-Itqaan fi \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019an (p. 1241-1247).\n\n\tSee also: \n\tMajmoo\u2018 al-Fataawa by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (15/252-255)\n\n\tAnd Allah knows \n\tbest."

        "question": "Ruling on writing the Qur\u2019an or part of it in an alphabet other than Arabic then pronouncing it in Arabic \u2013 will one have the reward of reciting it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly:\u00a0\n\n\tIn the answer to question no. 97741 we \n\tstated that it is not permissible to write the Holy Qur\u2019an in anything other \n\tthan \u2018Uthmaani script.\u00a0\n\n\tSecondly:\u00a0\n\n\tIf it is not permissible to write the Holy Qur\u2019an in anything \n\tother than \u2018Uthmaani script, then it is more appropriate to note that it is \n\tnot permissible to write it in anything other than Arabic letters.\u00a0\n\n\tThe Islamic texts indicate, and the scholars of Islam are \n\tunanimously agreed, that it is obligatory to protect the word of Allah, may \n\tHe be exalted, from distortion and alteration, and undoubtedly writing it in \n\tanything other than Arabic letters is one of the most likely ways that lead \n\tto distortion of its pronunciation and meanings, because of the clear \n\tdifference between the nature of the Arabic language \u2013 with its letters, \n\twords, style, ways of writing, ways of pronouncing, and the usage of its \n\tnative speakers \u2013 and other languages.\u00a0\n\n\tIt says in the book Tahreem Kitaabat al-Qur\u2019an al-Kareem \n\tbi Huroof ghayr \u2018Arabiyyah (Prohibition on writing the Holy Qur\u2019an in \n\tnon-Arabic letters \u2013 1/36):\u00a0\n\n\tAfter studying the topic, discussing it and exchanging \n\topinions concerning it, the Committee unanimously agreed that it is \n\tprohibited to write the Qur\u2019an in Latin script or the letters of any other \n\tlanguage, for the following reasons:\u00a0\n\n\t1.\n\n\tThe Quran was revealed in a clear Arabic tongue, both letters \n\tand meanings. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n\tmeaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd truly, \n\tthis (the Quran) is a revelation from the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, \n\tjinns and all that exists),\n\n\tWhich the trustworthy Rooh (Jibrael (Gabriel)) has brought \n\tdown\n\n\tUpon your heart (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be \n\tupon him)) that you may be (one) of the warners,\n\n\tIn the plain Arabic language\u201d\n\n\t[ash-Shu\u2018ara\u2019 26:192-195].\u00a0\n\n\tWhat is written in Latin letters cannot be called Quran, \n\tbecause Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t\u201cAnd thus We have sent it down as a Quran in Arabic\u201d\n\n\t[Ta-Ha 20:113]\n\n\t\u201cAnd indeed We know that they (polytheists and pagans) say: \n\t\"It is only a human being who teaches him (Muhammad (blessings and peace of \n\tAllah be upon him)).\" The tongue of the man they refer to is foreign, while \n\tthis (the Quran) is a clear Arabic tongue\u201d\n\n\t[an-Nahl 16:103].\u00a0\n\n\t2.\n\n\tThe Quran was written down when it was revealed, and when it \n\twas compiled by Abu Bakr and \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with them), in \n\tArabic letters. All the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) agreed to \n\tthat, as did all the Taabi\u2018een, and those who came after them, until the \n\tpresent day, despite the fact that there were those who did not speak \n\tArabic. And it is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n\tupon him) that he said: \u201cYou must adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the \n\tRightly-Guided Caliphs after me\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\tSo it is obligatory to adhere to that, following what was \n\tdone at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n\tand the Rightly-Guided Caliphs who succeeded him, and acting in accordance \n\twith the consensus of the ummah.\u00a0\n\n\t3.\n\n\tThe letters of different languages are something that people \n\tagree upon and are subject to being changed and replaced with other letters. \n\tTherefore there is the fear, if this door is opened, that it may lead to \n\tchange every time people decide to pronounce a certain letter in a different \n\tmanner, and there is the fear that the recitation may change accordingly, \n\twhich would lead to confusion with the passage of time, so that the enemies \n\tof Islam could find a way to criticise the Qur\u2019an, as happened with the \n\tprevious Scriptures. So it is essential to prevent that, in order to \n\tpreserve the source of Islam and block the means that may lead to evil and \n\tcorruption.\u00a0\n\n\t4.\n\n\tIf a concession is granted allowing that or it is approved, \n\tthere is the fear that the Quran may become a toy in people\u2019s hands, so each \n\tone may suggest writing it in his alphabet or in any other alphabet, and \n\tundoubtedly that will lead to differences and confusion. It is essential to \n\tprotect the Quran from that, so as to protect Islam and preserve the Book of \n\tAllah from tampering and variations.\u00a0\n\n\t5.\n\n\tWriting the Quran in letters other than Arabic will \n\tdiscourage the Muslims from learning the Arabic language, in which they \n\tworship their Lord and learn and understand their religion.\u00a0\n\n\tAnd Allah is the source of strength; may Allah send blessings \n\tand peace upon Muhammad and his family and companions.\u00a0\n\n\tCouncil of Senior Scholars\u00a0\n\n\tWe put this question to His Excellency Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez \n\tibn Baaz, Secretary-General of the Academic Research Council, and he \n\tgraciously sent us this fatwa that was issued by the Council in its \n\tfourteenth session held in at-Taa\u2019if in Shawwaal 1399 AH.\u00a0\n\n\tFrom the above it is clear that the writing and recitation \n\tthat brings reward for the one who recites a letter of the Book of Allah \n\tonly refers to the one who writes it and reads it in Arabic, as Allah \n\trevealed it. As for the one who writes it in anything other than Arabic \u2013 \n\tand more so the one who pronounces it \u2013 he has done something that is not \n\tprescribed in Islam.\u00a0\n\n\tBut for the one who is unable to write it in Arabic, or wants \n\tto quote from it in a book that he has written in a language other than \n\tArabic, he may write a translation of the meanings of what he wants to \n\tquote, but he should not write that for the purpose of recitation and \n\tworship, as appears to be referred to in the question.\u00a0\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best."

Therefore \n\tworship the One Who created you, and no other, then He will take your souls \n\tin death.\u00a0\n\n\tAnd some of you will grow old, and end up reaching a stage of \n\tsenility, which is the worst \n\tof stages. We only bring him back to senility so that he will once again \n\tbecome ignorant, as he was in infancy and childhood, so that he will not \n\tknow anything after the knowledge that he had when he was young. All of that \n\twill be lost when he grows old, and will be forgotten, and he will not know \n\tanything of it, for it will escape his mind. So after having possessed the \n\tpower of rational thinking, he will not understand anything.\u00a0\n\n\tAs-Sa\u2018di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\t\n\n\tHere Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that it is He Who \n\tcreates people and causes them to move through the stages of creation, one \n\tafter another. Then after their lifespan has ended, He causes them to die, \n\tbut He causes some to live until they are \n\tsent back to senility, \n\ti.e., the worst age, in which a person loses his outward and inward \n\tstrength, even his power of reasoning, which is the essence of man. It grows \n\tweaker and weaker, until he forgets what he used to know, and his mind \n\tbecomes like the mind of an infant.

Some of them will become completely senile, so that they do not know \n\tanything at all; some of them will hardly know anything; and some of them \n\twill know a few things but ignorance and lack of knowledge is mostly the \n\tcase for them.\u00a0\n\n\tWhat is meant by the words of Allah, may He be exalted, \u201cso \n\tthat he knows nothing after having known\u201d \n\tis to highlight the fact that ignorance will prevail after he had knowledge, \n\tnot to rule out knowledge altogether for everyone who reaches this stage, \n\tbecause saying that he will know nothing is not to be taken literally; \n\trather it is by way of emphasis.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\tHence Allah says, \u201cand \n\tamong you\u201d, so as to \n\tindicate that not everyone who grows old and reaches old age will be \n\tsent back to senility; \n\trather some of them will be \n\tsent back to senility so \n\tthat they do not know anything after having known something, and some of \n\tthem will grow old but Allah will protect their reasoning, hearing and \n\tsight.\u00a0\n\n\tIbn Jaziyy (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n\tIt does not mean that knowledge is ruled out altogether; \n\trather it is a reference to having little knowledge and to forgetting a \n\tgreat deal.

        "question": "Does a reprehensible pause [when reading Qur\u2019an] lead to kufr?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.These words, in the general terms mentioned in the question, are clearly incorrect and are definitely contrary to the practice of the Muslims and all the imams or leading scholars, which is to quote part of a verse in their writings, lessons or khutbahs, without necessarily having to quote or write the entire verse as it appears in the Mus-haf. Rather they limit it to quoting of the verse only the part that is relevant to the context and relevant to the meaning they are trying to establish, so long as what is quoted of the verse is clear and readily understood.\nIf what you say is something that was said by one of the religious scholars, then he could not have meant it in general terms referring to all kinds of pause, as the questioner understood it. The only way we think he could have meant it is that what he was referring to was a type of pause that is reprehensible, as in the case\u00a0 of a reciter who comes to a verse such as that in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSo know (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) that La ilaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah), and ask forgiveness for your sin, and also for (the sin of) believing men and believing women. And Allah knows well your moving about, and your place of rest (in your homes)\u201d [Muhammad 47:19], and he recites \u201cthere is no god\u201d then pauses there, without any good reason that would compel him to pause there, and without resuming the recitation by repeating some of the words in such a way as to make the meaning clear and make the context of the words understandable.\u00a0\nPausing in such a manner is blameworthy and extremely reprehensible, as is quite obvious. Whoever does that deliberately, intending to convey that distorted meaning, is undoubtedly a disbeliever.\u00a0\nThere are also other kinds of blameworthy pauses that corrupt the meanings of the words or give the impression of a meaning that is not intended by the text.\u00a0\nAz-Zarkashi said in al-Burhaan fi \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019an (1/352-353): What is reprehensible is that which leads to the meaning not being understood, such as saying \u201cal-hamd\u201d [on its own]; there should be no pause on this word, or on any word without its adjective or predicate.\nEven worse than that is pausing on phrases such as \u201cSurely, they have disbelieved who say\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:72] (because the following phrase is \u201c \u2018Allah is the Messiah (\u2018Eeesa (Jesus)), son of Maryam (Mary)\u2019\u201d) and \u201cAnd if any of them should say\u201d [al-Anbiya\u2019 21:29] (because the following phrase is \u201c \u2018Verily, I am an ilah (a god) besides Him (Allah)\u2019\u201d); or starting from phrases such as \u201cAllah is the Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary)\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:17], \u201cAllah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:73] and \u201cVerily, I am an ilah (a god)\u201d [al-Anbiya\u2019 21:29], because it is impossible for the meaning to be correct if you begin in this manner. Whoever does that deliberately, intending that (distorted) meaning, is a disbeliever.\u00a0\nSimilarly reprehensible is stopping at the following phrases: \u201cSo the disbeliever was utterly defeated and Allah\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:258], \u201cFor those who believe not in the Hereafter is an evil description and for Allah\u201d [an-Nahl 16:60] and the like, or \u201cand if there be only one, for her is the half and for his parents\u201d [an-Nisa\u2019 4:11] and \u201cOnly those will respond, who listen and the dead\u201d [al-An\u2018aam 6:36].\u00a0\nEven worse and more reprehensible than that is stopping on a negation without completing the idea, as in the following examples:\n\u201cThere is no god but Allah\u201d\n(pausing after the phrase \u201cthere is no god\u201d, without completing the sentence, is wrong)\n\u201cAnd We have sent you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) not but as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:105]\n(pausing after the phrase \u201cwe have sent you not\u201d is wrong).\u00a0\nAlso, pausing at the end of the following quotations is wrong:\n\u201cAllah has promised those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) and do deeds of righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise) and those who disbelieve\u2026\u201d\n[al-Maa\u2019idah 5:9-10]]\n\u201cThose who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah, and in the Message of Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah (Islamic Monotheism), He will render their deeds vain, and those who believe\u2026\u201d\n[Muhammad 47:1-2].\nIf the reader has no choice but to stop in order to take a breath, that is permissible, but then (when he resumes reading) he should go back to the phrase that came before it and connect it to what comes after it, and there is nothing wrong with doing so.

        "question": "What should a person do if he memorised some of the Qur\u2019an then forgot it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nUndoubtedly studying the Quran, reciting it and memorising it are among the best of righteous deeds. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to read Quran regularly lest we forget it, which means constantly reviewing what one has memorised and repeatedly reciting it.\u00a0\nSimilarly, forgetting Quran is a blameworthy action, because it involves falling short, turning away from the Book of Allah and abandoning it.\u00a0\nSee the answer to question no. 3704.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThe scholars differed concerning the ruling on forgetting Quran:\u00a0\nIt was said that forgetting Quran is a major sin.\u00a0\nIt was said that it is an act of disobedience and sin, but it does not reach the level of major sins.\u00a0\nIt was said that it is a calamity that befalls a person and affects his religious commitment, or it may be a punishment from Allah for some of his deeds, even if it is not in and of itself a major sin or minor sin. This is the view that is most likely to be correct concerning this issue.\nHowever it is not appropriate for the one who has memorised it to neglect his recitation or to be careless about reviewing it. Rather he should adopt the practice of reciting a daily portion in order to help him to remember it and prevent himself from forgetting it, in the hope of reward and of benefitting from its rulings.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nForgetting some of the Quran is a result of neglecting it, and some kinds of neglect are less serious than others, as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Fawaa\u2019id (p. 82). But forgetting it because of turning away from it and being distracted by other things is undoubtedly a calamity that may lead to further calamities, in addition to the loss of reward.\u00a0\nWhat is advised for one who memorised some of the Quran then forgot it is the following:\u00a0\n\u00b7He should revise the soorahs that he had memorised until he has memorised them properly once again.\n\u00b7He should keep up with review in a regular fashion, so that he will not forget it again.\n\u00b7He should carry on memorising and reviewing under a well-versed shaykh.\n\u00b7He should review what he had memorised of large portions such as a juz\u2019 or a hizb and the like, and strive hard to memorise an entire soorah, so that reviewing what he had previously memorised and has memorised again will help him to complete memorisation of the soorah.\n\u00b7As for reviewing small portions that he had memorised then forgotten, such as two or three verses and the like, he should not focus on that and should not go to the trouble of remembering what he had forgotten of them.\u00a0\nHe should focus on re-memorising what he had forgotten of soorahs and large portions, as mentioned above, and there is no sin on him for not re-memorising those small portions, some of which he may have forgotten. He should examine his own situation, and whatever is a sin he should ask Allah to forgive him and repent from it; whatever is a shortcoming, he should amend it; and whatever was a case of turning away from matters of the hereafter and focusing on worldly matters, then he should refocus on the hereafter, for it is better and longer lasting.\u00a0\nMoreover, it is better to put his efforts into reviewing what he has memorised of the Quran immediately, when he is still motivated and before he loses motivation and starts to procrastinate. Ibn al-Mubaarak narrated in az-Zuhd (1/469) that Ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: These hearts sometimes have drive and focus and sometimes they slow down and become distracted, so make the most of the times when they have drive and focus, and let them be when they slow down and are distracted.\u00a0\nUndoubtedly the fact that one who has forgotten Quran feels that he has fallen short and is asking how to restore it comes under the heading of having drive and focus after having slowed down and been distracted. One who is in this situation should start re-memorizing it immediately, and should not delay doing so.\u00a0\nIf he is not able to revise it except during his free time, because he is very busy, has a lot of work and is striving to earn a living for his dependents, and the like, then there is no blame on him.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "The seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir and it is not permissible to cast aspersions on them",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe majority of scholars of recitation and usool are of the view that the seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir going back to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Some of them differed concerning that, such as Abu Shaamah \u2013 according to one of his views \u2013 and at-Tawfi and ash-Shawkaani. However the correct view concerning that is the view of the majority; that is the right view which must be adopted.\nShihaab ad-Deen ad-Dimyaati (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nTaaj al-A\u2019immah as-Subki \u2013 who is Taaj ad-Deen \u2018Abd al-Wahhaab as-Subki \u2013 said in his fatwas:\nThe seven modes of recitation to which ash-Shaatibi referred, to the exclusion of others, and the three others \u2013 namely the recitation of Abu Ja\u2018far, the recitation of Ya\u2018qoob and the recitation of Khalaf \u2013 are mutawaatir and well-known, and it is an established fact in the religion that they were revealed to the Messenger of Allah. No one would stubbornly disagree with that except one who is ignorant. They are not only regarded as mutawaatir by those who know these ten modes of recitation; rather they are regarded as mutawaatir by every Muslim who says \u201cI bear witness that there is no god but Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah,\u201d even if he is rough and uneducated and has not memorised even one letter of the Qur\u2019an.\nHe said: We could elaborate on the proof and evidence, but we do not have room to discuss this matter at length here. However, what is expected of every Muslim, and what he should do is to accept before Allah, may He be exalted, and be certain that what we have mentioned is mutawaatir and is known for certain, and there is no room for doubt or uncertainty about it.\nConclusion:\nThe seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir according to consensus, as are the three others: the recitations of Abu Ja\u2018far, Ya\u2018qoob and Khalaf, according to the more correct view. In fact the correct, favoured view, which is what we learned from most of our shaykhs, is that the recitations of the other four \u2013 Ibn Muhaysin, al-Yazeedi, al-Hasan and al-A\u2018mash, are odd (shaadhdh), according to scholarly consensus.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOur companions and others said:\nIt is permissible to recite, in prayer and otherwise, according to any of the seven modes of recitation, but it is not permissible to recite, in prayer or otherwise, according to an odd mode of recitation, because that is not Qur\u2019an. Qur\u2019an can only be proven by means of mutawaatir reports, and each of the seven modes of recitation is mutawaatir. This is the correct view which one must accept, and whoever says otherwise is wrong or ignorant.\nEnd quote from al-Majmoo\u2018 (3/392)\nIbn an-Najjaar al-Fatoohi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir according to the four imams and other leading Sunni scholars. This was narrated by as-Sarakhsi, who was one of the companions of ash-Shaafa\u2018i, in Kitaab as-Sawm in al-Ghaayah. He said: The Mu\u2018tazilah said: (The modes of recitation are transmitted via) aahaad reports.\n[An aahaad hadith is one of which the narrators at each stage of the isnaad are too few for it to be regarded as mutawaatir.]\nEnd quote from Sharh al-Kawkab al-Muneer (2/127)\nAz-Zarqaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that is supported by evidence is that the ten modes of recitation are all mutawaatir. This is the view of the scholars of usool and of recitation, such as Ibn as-Subki, Ibn al-Jazari and an-Nuwayri.\nEnd quote from Manaahil al-\u2018Irfaan (1/441)\nSecondly:\nThere is a specious argument that may enter some people\u2019s minds, which says that the isnaads of the recitations mentioned by the imams in their books are well known and limited, but they are ahaad isnaads, so how can it be said that their recitations are mutawaatir?\nThe response to that is: this is an old specious argument, which was answered by more than one of the scholars of recitation and usool. The leading scholars who specialised in this field, on whose teachings these modes of recitation are based, and to whom the isnaads go back, are not the only ones who were proficient in these modes of recitation or the only ones who specialised in them. Rather these modes of recitation were mutawaatir during their time, and remained so after their time, as there were other scholars like them who also specialised in that field and had other students who learned from them this branch of knowledge, which has to do with the modes of recitation and the rules and regulations governing them.\nImam Sharaf ad-Deen ad-Dimyaati (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that the isnaads that have to do with the modes of recitation are limited to one group does not mean that the modes of recitation did not have other isnaads. Rather the reports that have to do with the modes of recitation are attributed to them because they are the ones who became specialised in that matter and recorded the names of their shaykhs from whom they learned it, and each of them [the narrators in the isnaads] in his generation had many others who specialised in that field, which would raise the reports to the level of being mutawaatir.\nThis is the view of the scholars, and the dissenting view of Ibn al-Haajib, who differed with regard to some of what we have mentioned, was refuted by one who was very well versed in this field, namely Ibn al-Jazari, who refuted it at length in his book al-Munjid, which is worth reading.\nEnd quote from Ithaaf Fudala\u2019 al-Bashar fi\u2019l-Qiraa\u2019aat al-Arba\u2018at \u2018Ashar (p. 9)\nIbn an-Najjaar al-Fatoohi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSome said that the reports concerning the modes of recitation were aahaad reports, such as at-Tawfi in his Sharh. He said: The fact is that they (the modes of recitation) are widely known as being attributed to them, but they were not widely narrated from them, because the isnaads of the seven imams of recitation for the seven modes of recitation going back to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are to be found in the books of recitation, which were transmitted from one scholar to another at a time, so they do not fulfil the conditions of being mutawaatir.\nThe response to that is as follows: the fact that the isnaads are limited to a particular group does not mean that the modes of recitation were not transmitted via other narrators. The inhabitants of every city used to learn recitation according to the recitation of their Imam, who was one of the Sahaabah or otherwise, so a large number of people would learn from another large number like them, and so on. Therefore the transmission of the recitations was mutawaatir, but the imams who became specialised in the modes of recitation recorded the names of their shaykhs from whom they learned their mode of recitation, and that is why they made their isnaads available (whilst others did not). This is like the reports about the Farewell Pilgrimage which are known to be aahaad, but the reports of the Farewell Pilgrimage continued to be transmitted in the manner of mutawaatir reports, from one large number of people to another, throughout the ages. So one should pay attention to that, and not be deceived by the arguments of those who say that the isnaads of the scholars of recitation are aahaad.\nEnd quote from Sharh al-Kawkab al-Muneer (2/127-128)\nThirdly:\nWith regard to the questioner\u2019s asking: how can we say that (the modes of recitation) are mutawaatir when the term mutawaatir did not appear before Ibn Mujaahid who was the seventh of seven?\nThe response to that is as follows:\nWhat is meant by something being mutawaatir is learning something on the basis of certainty when there is no doubt at all, as opposed to learning something on the basis of probability. The level of certainty concerning the soundness of the seven modes of recitation is established, and it was transmitted by way of mutawaatir reports, which effectively gives certainty. And that is the point, regardless of whether this terminology was known at that time or not. This is simply the matter of terminology that has to do with setting out guidelines in various fields of knowledge and developing them. The Arabs (before Islam) used to observe the rules of grammar in their language, giving words case endings according to whether words were nominative, accusative or genitive, and so on, but if the people of the Jaahiliyyah were to come back to life now, none of them would know the terminology of Arabic grammar; in fact none of them knew anything about grammar as people speak of it now.\nSimilarly, with regard to knowledge of hadith, usool al-fiqh and other branches of Islamic knowledge, the fact that the specific terminology of any particular field appeared later on does not mean that the ideas and concepts that the terminology refers to were not known previously to specialists in that field.\nAs for the notion that the concept was unknown among people who were not specialists, or that it was not widely used by others in general, that does not undermine the fact that the concept was there, and it does not undermine the soundness of a particular academic issue.\nImam Shams ad-Deen adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that something is mutawaatir does not necessarily mean that the entire ummah is aware of it. For the scholars of recitation, there are matters that are mutawaatir among them, but not among others. For the fuqaha\u2019 there are issues that are mutawaatir among them and narrated from their imams via mutawaatir reports, of which the scholars of recitation are unaware. Among the hadith scholars, there are mutawaatir hadiths that the fuqaha\u2019 have never heard, or at least for the fuqaha\u2019 they were not mutawaatir; rather they were at the level of probability only. For the grammarians there are definitive issues, and the same is true of the linguists.

End \n    quote.\u00a0\n\n    Some \n    examples of that:\u00a0\n\n    Al-Bukhaari \n    (4236) narrated from \u2018Alqamah (may Allah have mercy on him) that \u2018Abdullah \n    ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the verse \u201c\u2026and \n    confuse not their belief with Zulm (wrong)\u2026\u201d [al-An\u2018aam 6:82] was \n    revealed, his companions (i.e., the companions of the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: Which of us has not done wrong? Then the \n    verse \u201cVerily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm \n    (wrong) indeed\u201d [Luqmaan 31:13] was revealed. [From the latter verse it \n    is understood that the zulm referred to in the first verse is the zulm of \n    shirk (joining others in worship with Allah), and not any lesser \n    wrongdoing.]\u00a0\n\n    But \n    although interpreting the Qur\u2019an by the Qur\u2019an may sometimes be unambiguous \n    and clear, as in the example mentioned above, in which case it is binding \n    proof that must be followed and not opposed, sometimes it is based on the \n    mufassir\u2019s own ijtihaad and understanding, when he is trying to put together \n    similar verses. Undoubtedly this is of a lesser status than the above, \n    because the one who engages in ijithaad may be wrong or right.\u00a0\n\n    2.\n    \n    The tafseer of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him), explaining the meanings of the Qur\u2019an, because he (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) came to both convey and explain to us what is \n    said in the holy Qur\u2019an. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \u201cWith clear signs and Books (We sent \n    the Messengers). And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him) the reminder and the advice (the Quran), \n    that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they \n    may give thought\u201d [an-Nahl \n    \n    16:44].\u00a0\n\n    An \n    example of that:\u00a0\n\n    Al-Bukhaari \n    (4510) narrated concerning the interpretation of the verse in which Allah, \n    may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cand eat and \n    drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from \n    the black thread (darkness of night)\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:187].\u00a0\n\n    It \n    was narrated that \u2018Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I \n    said: O Messenger of Allah, what is the meaning of the white thread being \n    distinct from the black thread? Are they two threads? He said: \u201cThe back of \n    your heard must be very broad if you want to watch the two threads.\u201d [\u2018Adiyy \n    was thinking in terms of threads in a literal sense, which he wanted to put \n    under his pillow and examine to see when they became distinct from one \n    another with the approach of dawn, but the Prophet (blessings and peace of \n    Allah be upon him) pointed out that if he wanted to put the two threads \u2013 \n    which in fact refers to the light of dawn being distinct from the darkness \n    of night \u2013 under his pillow, then his pillow must be very big indeed, in \n    which case he must have a very large head! \u2013 Translator\u2019s note]. Then he \n    said: \u201cNo; rather it is the darkness of the night and the light of the \n    day.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    If an \n    explanation of a verse or a word in the Qur\u2019an has reached us from the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), it is obligatory for us \n    to adhere to it and be content with it.\u00a0\n\n    The \n    interpretation of a verse may be understood from the Sunnah of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), from his actions and words, and \n    from the things that he approved of.\u00a0\n\n    The \n    Sunnah came to explain the Qur\u2019an. Allah, may He be exalted, has instructed \n    us to pray, give zakaah, perform Hajj, carry out the hadd punishments and so \n    on, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), through his \n    Sunnah \u2013 his actions and words \u2013 has explained to us in detail what is meant \n    by these words. But if the mufassir cannot find any explanation for a verse \n    in the Sunnah, he should look at the sayings of the Sahaabah.\u00a0\n\n    3.\n    \n    Tafseer based on reports from the Sahaabah (may Allah be \n    pleased with them):\n\n    Their \n    tafseer takes precedence over that of anyone else, because their tafseer is \n    likely to be based on what they learned from the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him), as Ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him) \n    said: One of us would learn ten verses then he would not move on (and learn \n    more) until he understood their meaning and put them into practice. Narrated \n    by at-Tabari in his Tafseer (1/80); its isnaad was classed as saheeh \n    by Shaykh Ahmad Shaakir (may Allah have mercy on him).\u00a0\n\n    In \n    some cases the tafseer of the Sahaabah was based on their own ijtihaad and \n    understanding, and their ijtihaad takes precedence over that of those who \n    came after them, because they accompanied the Prophet (blessings and peace \n    of Allah be upon him) and were aware of the circumstances in which the \n    verses of the Qur\u2019an were revealed, such as the reasons for revelation and \n    the place where revelation came down. They were contemporaries who were well \n    aware of the reality of the circumstances in which the Qur\u2019an was revealed \n    and how people were at that time. Moreover, they had a greater understanding \n    than others of the language in which the Qur\u2019an was revealed; they had \n    deeper knowledge, were less complicated (i.e., they were straightforward \n    people), and the furthest removed from misguidance and error in terms of \n    their knowledge and deeds.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer \n    (p. 95): Then if you do not find the explanation of the meaning in either \n    the Qur\u2019an or the Sunnah, you should refer to the words of the Sahaabah, \n    because they had greater knowledge of that, because of what they witnessed \n    of the Qur\u2019an, and because of the advantages they had, and what they had of \n    perfect understanding and sound knowledge, especially the scholars and \n    leading figures among them\u2026 End quote.\u00a0\n\n    The \n    views of the Sahaabah concerning tafseer take precedence over the views of \n    anyone else, unless the Sahaabah differed concerning it, in which case the \n    mufassir must try to work out which view is most correct.\u00a0\n\n    4.\n    \n    Tafseer based on reports from the Taabi\u2018een\n\n    If \n    the mufassir does not find anything in the words of the Sahaabah to explain \n    the meaning of the verse, then he should look at the tafseer of the \n    Taabi\u2018een, who acquired their knowledge from the companions of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them), because in their circumstances, \n    words, deeds and time they were \u2013 naturally \u2013 closer to the Sahaabah and to \n    their teachings and were able to learn from them directly.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in \n    Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer (p. 102): if you do not find the \n    explanation of the meaning in either the Qur\u2019an or the Sunnah, and you do \n    not find it in what is reported from the Sahaabah, in that case many of the \n    imams (leading scholars) turned to the views of the Taabi\u2018een\u2026 End quote.\u00a0\n\n    He \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) also said (p. 37):\u00a0\n\n    Among \n    the Taabi\u2018een are some who learned all their tafseer from the Sahaabah, as \n    Mujaahid said: I showed the Mushaf to Ibn \u2018Abbaas, pausing at each verse and \n    asking him about it. Hence ath-Thawri said: If the interpretation of the \n    meaning of a verse comes to you from Mujaahid, it is sufficient for you. \n    Hence ash-Shaafa\u2018i, al-Bukhaari and other scholars relied on his (Mujaahid\u2019s) \n    tafseer. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    If \n    the scholars of tafseer among the Taabi\u2018een are agreed upon a view \n    concerning the meaning of a verse, then undoubtedly it is obligatory to \n    follow it. But if they differed, the view of one of them is not necessarily \n    stronger than that of another and cannot be given precedence over another or \n    be regarded as the ultimate proof. Rather it must be examined and his proof \n    may be quoted or referred to, (but it is not binding proof).\u00a0\n\n    \n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n    \n    Undoubtedly the Taabi\u2018een differed, but those who learned tafseer from the \n    Sahaabah are not equal to those who did not do so.\u00a0\n\n    \n    However, if they did not state that they learned it from a Sahaabi, then \n    their view is not proof against those who came after them, if they differed \n    in their views, because they are not of the same status as the Sahaabah, but \n    their views are more likely to be closer to the truth. The closer people are \n    to the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), the \n    more likely they are to be correct than those who come after them. This is \n    very clear, because of the prevalence of whims and desires in subsequent \n    periods, and because of the presence of numerous intermediaries between them \n    and the time of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). \n    Undoubtedly this distance detracts from the value of their opinions; hence \n    we know that referring to the view of earlier generations is very important.\n\n    End \n    quote from Sharh Muqaddimat at-Tafseer, p. 140\u00a0\n\n    The \n    second method \n    is for the mufassir who has knowledge of tafseer to use his understanding to \n    interpret the meaning of the verse of the Qur\u2019an, and his ijtihaad must be \n    based on the proper method, following the guidelines and principles of \n    tafseer. This is what is called tafseer on the basis of individual \n    understanding and ijtihaad.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Az-Zarqaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Manaahil al-\u2018Irfaan \n    fi \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019an (2/43):\u00a0\n\n    With \n    regard to the permissible type of tafseer on the basis of one's \n    understanding, it is essential to be aware of what has been narrated from \n    the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions \n    that may give the mufassir some insight into how he should interpret the \n    meaning on the basis of his understanding. The one who does that must also \n    have extensive knowledge of the rules of the Arabic language and its styles \n    and manner of expression, as well as deep insight into the rules of \n    sharee\u2018ah, so that he will be able to interpret the words of Allah on the \n    basis of what is well established of the rules and regulations of His \n    sharee\u2018ah. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Tafseer that is based on one\u2019s individual understanding is blameworthy in \n    the following scenarios:\u00a0\n\n    1.\n    \n    When the one who is seeking to interpret the meaning is not \n    qualified to do so, and he is trying to explain the words of Allah without \n    knowledge. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n    \u201cSay (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): \u2018(But) the \n    things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (great evil sins, \n    every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.) whether committed openly or \n    secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in \n    worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things \n    about Allah of which you have no knowledge\u2019\u201d [al-A\u2018raaf 7:33]; \u201cO mankind! \n    Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the \n    footsteps of Shaitan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy\u201d [al-Baqarah \n    2:168-169].\n\n    2.\n    \n    When he is following his own whims and desires and his aim is \n    to support his bid\u2018ah (innovation) and opinion, even if that is by twisting \n    the meanings of the words or not paying attention to the proper way of \n    understanding, the ways in which the Arabs express different ideas in their \n    language, and the guidelines of sharee\u2018ah, as some innovators among the \n    Raafidis and others did, when they interpreted some verses in a manner that \n    is contrary to what is indicated by the guidelines of sharee\u2018ah and \n    knowledge of the Arabic language.\n\n    \n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    \n    Interpretation of the Qur\u2019an based on individual opinion: sometimes, in \n    order to be in harmony with his preconceived ideas, as the followers of \n    whims and desires do, a person may say that what is meant by a given word or \n    phrase is such and such \u2013 saying something that is in harmony with his \n    preconceived ideas. That includes some later scholars who interpreted the \n    Qur\u2019an in such a manner as to be in harmony with the latest scientific \n    discoveries \u2013 whether astronomical or terrestrial \u2013 when the Qur\u2019an does not \n    indicate that. In that case they are interpreting the Qur\u2019an on the basis of \n    their own preconceived views, because the Qur\u2019an does not indicate that, \n    either on the basis of the text or of what is indicated by the language. \n    This is their own opinion, and it is not right to interpret the Qur\u2019an on \n    that basis.\u00a0\n\n    \n    Similarly, if a person does not understand the linguistic meaning or the \n    shar\u2018i meaning indicated by the verse, if he then says something without \n    knowledge, he is sinning, such as if one of the common folk were to \n    interpret the verse of the holy Qur\u2019an according to his understanding, \n    without basing it on proper understanding of the linguistic or shar\u2018i \n    guidelines, in which case it is haraam for him to do that, because the one \n    who interprets the meanings of the Qur\u2019an is testifying that Allah meant \n    such and such. This is a very serious matter, because Allah has forbidden us \n    to say about Him that which we do not know.\n\n    \u201cSay \n    (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): \u2018(But) the things \n    that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (great evil sins, every \n    kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.) whether committed openly or \n    secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in \n    worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things \n    about Allah of which you have no knowledge\u2019\u201d [al-A\u2018raaf 7:33].\u00a0\n\n    Any \n    person who says about Allah that which he does not know about the meaning of \n    His words or any of His rulings has made a serious error. \n\n    End \n    quote from Muqaddimat at-Tafseer, p. 142\u00a0\n\n    And \n    Allah knows best."

Muslim (804) narrated that Abu Umaamah al-Baahili said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: \u201cRead the Qur\u2019aan, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection interceding for its companions.\u201d\u00a0\nImam Ahmad (6589) narrated from \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cFasting and the Quran will intercede for a person on the Day of Resurrection.

It will keep throwing accusations at him until it is said: Do what you like with him. Then it will take him by the hand and will not let him go until it throws him onto a rock in Hell. And it will bring a righteous man who learned it and adhered to its teachings. It will appear as a defendant and will say: O Lord, You made him learn about me and what a good learner he was; he respected my limits, did the obligatory duties, avoided the sins mentioned in me and obeyed my instructions. And it will keep presenting arguments in his favour until it is said: Do what you like with him. Then it will take him by the hand and will not let him go until it dresses him in brocade and puts on him the crown of a king.\u201d\u00a0\nThis is a da\u2018eef (weak) isnaad, because Ibn Ishaaq is mudallis and used the word \u2018an (narrating from, i.e., he did not state clearly that he heard it directly). But al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Khalq Af\u2018aal al-\u2018Ibaad (474):\u00a0\n\u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): \u201cThe Quran will appear in the form of a man on the Day of Resurrection and will intercede for its companions.\u201d\nZuhayr ibn Harb told me: Ya\u2018qoob ibn Ibraaheem told us: my father told me from Ibn Ishaaq, and \u2018Amr ibn Shu\u2018ayb ibn Muhammad ibn \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr told me, from his father, from his grandfather: I heard this from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Abu \u2018Abdullah (i.e., al-Bukhaari) said: \u201cThis is his earnings and his deeds.\u201d End quote.\u00a0\nSo it is proven that Ibn Ishaaq heard the hadith from \u2018Amr ibn Shu\u2018ayb, thus the hadith is proven.\u00a0\nThe words \u201cThe Quran will appear on the Day of Resurrection\u2026\u201d mean that his recitation of the Quran will appear to him.\u00a0\nSee the answer to question no. 91306\nIt was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (30676) and ad-Daarimi (3325) from ash-Sha\u2018bi, from Ibn Mas\u2018ood who said: \u201cThe Quran will come on the Day of Resurrection and will intercede for its companion, and it will lead him to Paradise, or it will testify against (a person) and will drive him to Hell. Ash-Sha\u2018bi did not hear from Ibn Mas\u2018ood, as it says in al-Maraaseel by Ibn Abi Haatim (p. 25).\u00a0\nBut there is a corroborating report that says: \u201cThe Quran is an intercessor whose intercession will be accepted and an opponent whose testimony will be accepted. Whoever puts it in front of him, it will lead him to Paradise, and whoever puts it behind his back, it will drive him to Hell.\u201d\u00a0\nThis was narrated via a number of isnaads from Ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him).See: Fadaa\u2019il al-Quran\u00a0 by al-Firyaabi (20); Fadaa\u2019il al-Quran by Abu \u2018Ubayd (44); Fadaa\u2019il al-Quran by Ibn Durays (94); az-Zuhd by Imam Ahmad (p. 155); Shu\u2018ab al-Eemaan by al-Bayhaqi (2010); al-Mu\u2018jam al-Kabeer by at-Tabaraani (8655).\u00a0\nFrom the above it is clear that just as the Quran will testify for its companions on the Date of Resurrection, it will also testify against those who went against it.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Whoever adds or takes away a letter from the Qur\u2019an deliberately has committed an act of kufr (disbelief)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In the answer to question no. 158204 we stated that if a person makes a mistake in reciting a soorah, or forgets something of it, whilst he is praying, then he should try to correct the mistake and remember what he forgot. If he is not able to do that, then he may skip that verse and move on to the next one, or he may stop reciting that soorah and start reciting a different one.\u00a0\nBut if he adds to the Qur\u2019an something that is not part of it deliberately \u2013 whether that is during the prayer or otherwise, then this is emphatically forbidden and the scholars have stated that whoever omits a letter of the Qur\u2019an or substitutes a different letter or adds a letter has committed an act of kufr.\u00a0\nAl-Qaadi \u2018Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe Muslims are unanimously that the Qur\u2019an which is recited in all corners of the earth, and is written in the Mushaf between the two covers by the hands of the Muslims, from the beginning of Soorat al-Faatihah to the end of Soorat an-Naas is indeed the word of Allah and His Revelation that He sent down to His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); that everything in it is truth; and that anyone who deliberately omits a letter of it, or substitutes one letter for another, or adds to it a letter that is not included in the Mushaf on which there is consensus, and there is consensus that it is not part of the Qur\u2019an, has committed an act of kufr.\nEnd quote from ash-Shifa, 2/304-305; see also at-Taqreer wa\u2019t-Tahbeer by Ibn Ameer al-Haaj, 2/215\u00a0\nIt says in al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 35/214: The Qur\u2019an is the word of Allah, the miracle that was sent down to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and was transmitted by means of tawaatur (i.e., it was narrated from so many people by so many people that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a lie). It is haram to deliberately make mistakes in it, whether that changes the meaning or not, because its words and phrases are tawqeefi (i.e., to be accepted and recited as they were revealed, and they cannot be altered) and it was transmitted to us by means of tawaatur. It is not permissible to change any word of it by altering the vowels or changing the letters, replacing one letter with another. End quote.\u00a0\nBased on that, it is not permissible for a student to write a word or a letter that he knows is not part of the Qur\u2019an or that does not belong in this verse; rather he should either try hard to remember, or he should leave the parts that he has forgotten blank. He can also apologize for that by explaining that he forgot where this word goes and that he did not want to write something of which he was not certain in this case.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Will he be rewarded for memorizing the Qur\u2019an if he memorizes it from an audio recording?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    You should bear in mind these \n    two important matters, which are from the bounty of Allah that He has \n    bestowed upon His slaves.\u00a0\n\n    The first is that Allah, may He \n    be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd We have indeed \n    made the Quran easy to understand and remember, then is there any that will \n    remember (or receive admonition)?\u201d [al-Qamar 54:17].\u00a0\n\n    The second is that the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe one who is skilled in \n    reciting Qur\u2019an will be with the noble, honourable scribes and the one who \n    recites Qur\u2019an and falters therein, and finds it difficult, will have a \n    double reward.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4937) \n    and Muslim (798).\u00a0\n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy \n    on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The one who falters is the one \n    who stumbles in his recitation because of his poor memorisation. He will \n    have a double reward: the reward for reciting and the reward for faltering \n    in his recitation and the difficulty he encounters. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    If we learn that the Qur\u2019an is \n    easy to remember and understand, and we learn that the one for whom any of \n    that is difficult to learn, memorize or understand will have a double reward \n    \u2013 once this is established, it will be appropriate for the wise person to \n    strive his utmost to achieve that and to show patience in seeking to attain \n    this sublime goal. How often has Allah made it easy for non-Arabs who do not \n    speak Arabic well to memorize His Book in its entirety. To achieve this \n    great virtue it is worth spending a great deal of time and competing with \n    others.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    One of the things that help one \n    to memorize the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is listening to it often \n    on recordings. If it is easy for you to memorize it in this way, then you \n    will become one of those who have memorized the Book of Allah, attained that \n    goal and earned the reward and status of the hafiz, by Allah\u2019s leave. The \n    individual\u2019s precision in recitation, memorization and acting upon the Holy \n    Book and its rulings and teachings will determine his reward and his status \n    before Allah, if he is sincere in his intention and seeks reward with Him.\u00a0\n\n    However it is better to combine \n    two things in that regard: striving to recite it and to memorize whatever \n    you are able to whilst looking at the Mushaf, so as to attain the virtue of \n    reading it yourself and the virtue of looking in the Mushaf. Then by \n    listening to a recording of the Qur\u2019an you will be able to do two things: \n    correct your recitation and make sure that you have got it right before \n    memorizing it, and then continue revising it and reminding yourself of what \n    you have memorized after that.\u00a0\n\n    Undoubtedly the one who listens \n    to the recitation by his shaykh or teacher directly will learn the Book of \n    Allah more precisely than the one who listens to it from a recording. The \n    Muslim cannot memorize properly unless he learns directly from a shaykh and \n    attends his classes whenever he can.\u00a0\n\n    But for the one who does not \n    have access to a shaykh but does have access to a recording, there is \n    nothing wrong with him listening to it and memorizing in that manner.\u00a0\n\n    For more information, please see \n    the answers to questions no. 112763 and\n    147816\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    Competing and hastening to \n    reward is something that is open to everyone. The one who cannot compete in \n    memorizing and reciting Qur\u2019an can compete in prayer, fasting, giving \n    charity, remembering Allah, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is \n    evil, doing good deeds, upholding ties of kinship, honouring parents or \n    other innumerable types of righteous deeds.\u00a0\n\n    All of the proven, prescribed \n    adhkaar bring a great reward, but there are some that bring a greater \n    reward. In the case of the Qur\u2019an \u2013 which is the best dhikr \u2013 reciting \n    Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad (i.e., Soorat al-Ikhlaas 112) is equivalent to one \n    third of the Qur\u2019an. Soorat al-Faatihah is the best soorah and Ayat al-Kursiy \n    (al-Baqarah 2:255) is the best verse. Whoever recites the last two verses of \n    Soorat al-Baqarah at night, they will suffice him. Memorizing these passages \n    and others is something that everyone can do, and in reciting them and \n    repeating them there is a great deal of reward.\u00a0\n\n    Other adhkaar include the \n    following:\u00a0\n\n    \u00b7That which was narrated by Muslim (2729) from Juwayriyah, who \n    said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    left her house one morning when he prayed Fajr, and she was in her \n    prayer-place, then he came back after the forenoon had come, and she was \n    still sitting there. He said: \u201cAre you still as you were when I left you?\u201d \n    She said: Yes. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cAfter I left you I said four words three times, which if they were weighed \n    against what you have said today, they would outweigh it: \u2018Subhan \n    Allah wa bi hamdih, \u2018adada khalqihi, wa rida nafsihi, wazinata \u2018arshihi, wa \n    midaada kalimatihi (Glory \n    and praise be to Allah, as much as the number of His creation, as much as \n    pleases Him, as much as the weight of His Throne and as much as the ink of \n    His words).\u201d\n\n    \u00b7\u201cSubhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-\u2018Azeem \n    (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty).\u201d al-Bukhaari \n    (6682) and Muslim (2694) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of \n    Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cTwo words that are \n    light on the tongue and heavy in the balance and beloved to the Most \n    Merciful: Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-\u2018Azeem \n    (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty).\u201d\n\n    \u00b7The best of prayers for forgiveness (sayyid al-istighfaar): \n    al-Bukhaari (6306) narrated from Shaddaad ibn Aws (may Allah be pleased with \n    him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe \n    best of prayers for forgiveness is to say: \u201cThe best prayer for seeking \n    forgiveness is to say: \u2018Allaahumma anta rabbi la ilaaha illa anta, \n    Khalaqtani wa ana \u2018abduka wa ana \u2018ala \u2018ahdika wa wa\u2019dika ma astata\u2019t. \n    A\u2019oodhu bika min sharri ma sana\u2019tu, aboo\u2019u laka bi ni\u2019matika \u2018alayya wa \n    aboo\u2019u laka bi dhanbi, faghfir li fa innahu laa yaghfiru\u2019l-dhunoob illaa \n    anta (O Allah, You are my Lord. None has the right to be worshipped but \n    You. You created me and I am Your slave, and I am faithful to my covenant \n    and my promise (to You) as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from all \n    the evil I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have \n    bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So I entreat You to \n    forgive my sins, for nobody can forgive sins except You).\u2019 Whoever says this \n    during the day, having faith in it and dies before the evening comes, will \n    be among the people of \n    Paradise, and whoever says it during the night, having faith in it, and dies \n    before the morning comes, will be among the people of Paradise.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Other kinds of dhikr, in \n    general, are the adkhaar to be recited in the morning or the evening, those \n    that are to be recited following the obligatory prayers and those that are \n    to be recited before going to sleep, for the one who regularly recites them \n    will have a great reward.\u00a0\n\n    Please see also the answer to \n    question no 174947\n\n    Fourthly:\u00a0\n\n    It is prescribed for the Muslims \n    to vary the adhkaar and all acts of worship. So sometimes he may read Qur\u2019an, \n    sometimes he may remember Allah (dhikr), sometimes he may pray, sometimes he \n    may study books of knowledge, and sometimes he may relax by doing various \n    kinds of permissible leisure activities. He should not limit himself to one \n    specific type of worship, never doing anything else, because by doing that \n    he will miss out on the reward and virtue of the other types of worship that \n    he ignores, in addition to the fact that there is the fear that he may get \n    tired and bored.\n\n    \u00a0Please see also the answer to \n    question no. 195274\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on referring to Qur\u2019anic verses whilst changing some of the words",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In Arabic linguistics, this action is called iqtibaas (lit. borrowing); this means referring to a verse or hadeeth when speaking, without attributing it to its source, whether one alters a word sometimes or quotes it as it is. The basic principle concerning this is that any such quotations or references should be within a proper context and implying an appropriate meaning.\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nNo one has the right to use the wording of the Qur\u2019an for any purpose other than that for which Allah revealed it. This is how the scholars interpreted the hadeeth, \u201cThe Book of Allah should not be quoted\u201d i.e., the Qur\u2019an should not be referred to inappropriately.\nAn example of that is if one says to someone who has come to discuss a need, \u201cThen you came here according to the fixed term which I ordained (for you), O Moosa\u201d (cf. Ta-Ha 20:40); or if a person says when arguing: \u201cWhen will this promise be fulfilled?\u201d(cf. Yaa-Seen 36:48),or \u201cAllah bears witness that they are certainly liars\u201d (cf. at-Tawbah 9:107).\u00a0\nFurthermore, if the person says that by way of belittling the Qur\u2019an or making fun of it, this is tantamount to kufr (disbelief).\u00a0\nHowever, if he recites the verse to support a ruling for which this verse was revealed, or in the context of discussing some ruling, this is acceptable. That includes what the fuqaha\u2019 concluded of rulings on the basis of analogy, and what shaykhs and preachers quote to support to what they say.\u00a0\nEnd quote from Mukhtasar al-Fataawa al-Misriyyah, 172\u00a0\nAs-Suyooti wrote an essay on this topic entitled Raf\u2018 al-Baas wa Kashf al-Iltibaas fi Darab al-Mathal min al-Qur\u2019an wa\u2019l-Iqtibaas, in the book al-Haawi li\u2019l-Fataawa (1/305): on our website we have discussed this manner of speaking in detail; please see the following fatwas (in Arabic): 119673, 103923, 127745 and 150303.\nFrom these fatwas we may conclude that it is haraam to refer to texts in the scenarios mentioned above; that is based on the following points:\u00a0\n-1-\nit seems, from the phrases quoted above, that they were referred to for the purpose of mocking and making fun of others; in this case the Holy Qur\u2019an was used as a tool for mockery in one of the most abhorrent ways of dealing with this holy Book which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sent down as a book of light and guidance, the words of which showed the way for mankind to follow, in the light of its teachings, and formed the foundation for much historical, linguistic, geographical and scientific research, as well as cultural and moral theories. If we bear all of that and more in mind, there will be no hesitation in regarding as abhorrent the words of one who says \u201cBut the Brothers bore it\u201d instead of \u201cBut man bore it\u201d (cf. al-Ahzaab 33:72), making fun of a group of Muslims. Is there anything more disrespectful towards the words and meanings of the Qur\u2019an than this?\n\u00a0-2-\nwe are very upset by much of what we have seen from some irresponsible media such as newspapers, magazines, satellite channels and so on, who take advantage of recent painful events in the Muslim world and use the Holy Qur\u2019an in this manner, referring to its verses to address religious people and to mock some political Islamic groups and their predicament in some countries. It is as if the Holy Qur\u2019an is not a Book for all Muslims, rather it is a book for some of them only. And it is as if the one who refers to it in this manner is trying to tell people, \u201cWe can come up with something like this Qur\u2019an which you recite and venerate, in order to point out your faults!\u201d For example, he may write \u201cAnd those who were of the Brotherhood will be driven to Hell in groups\u201d (cf. \u201cAnd those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups\u201d [az-Zumar 39:51]); this poor man does not realise that the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is of a sublime status and is not to be touched by any but those who are purified; those who are not purified with regard to religious commitment and manners are only exposing the darkness that resides in their hearts and the foolishness of their minds. They lose in worldly terms, let alone in terms of the Hereafter, by using this kind of mocking language, telling lies about Allah, distorting the meaning of His Book and, in fact, blatantly distorting the wording thereof.\u00a0\n-3-\nhere we will quote the views of some scholars who forbade this kind of referring to the text if it is done in the context of mockery and disrespect.\u00a0\nAs-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nOne kind of reprehensible referral to texts is quoting a verse in the context of a joke \u2013 we seek refuge with Allah from that \u2013 such as saying (in verse):\n\u201cShe conveyed a message to her lovers with her eyes, \u2018Far, very far is that which you are promised\u2019 [cf. al-Mu\u2019minoon 23:36];\nSeek physical intimacy with her \u2013 \u2018For the like of this let all strive, who wish to strive\u2019 [cf. as-Saaffaat 37:61].\u201d\u00a0\nEnd quote from al-Itqaan fi \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019an, 1/387; as-Suyooti quoted this categorization (of ways of quoting or referring to Qur\u2019an, into those which are acceptable and those which are not) from one of the scholars, and approved of this categorization.\u00a0\nThen he (as-Suyooti \u2013 may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nI do not know of any difference of opinion among the scholars that this is permissible to refer to the Qur\u2019an, provided that the context is not one of approving of promiscuity, immorality, mockery on the part of evildoers, drinking alcohol, promoting homosexuality, and so on.\nEnd quote from Tanweer al-Hawaalik Sharh Muwatta\u2019 Maalik, 1/312\nIbn \u2018Aqeel al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nReferencing the Qur\u2019an in the context of improper speech is not permissible.\u00a0\nEnd quote from Ibn Muflih in al-Adaab ash-Shar\u2018iyyah, 2/289.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some examples of referring to Qur\u2019anic texts, such as when someone said, \u201cToday we have seen Noon and what they know (noonwa ma ya \u2018lamoon)\u201d\n(this is a rhyme which tries to sound like what is mentioned at the beginning of Soorat al-Qalam).\u00a0\nHe replied:\u00a0\nAs for the one who said that by way of mockery, this is a very serious matter; it may even be said that he has gone beyond the pale of Islam, because it is not permissible under any circumstances to quote the Qur\u2019an by way of mockery, and the same applies to Islamic rulings. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThe hypocrites fear lest a Soorah (chapter of the Quran) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: \u2018(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.\u2019\nIf you ask them (about this), they declare: \u2018We were only talking idly and joking.\u2019 Say: \u2018Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (SAW) that you were mocking?\n\u2018Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimoon (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.)\u2019\u201d\n[at-Tawbah 9:64-66].\u00a0\nHence the scholars (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever utters a word of disbelief, even if that is jokingly, has become a disbeliever; he must repent and believe that he is repenting from apostasy, and he has to renew his Islam. The verses of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and the words of His Messenger are too great to be taken as a joke.\u00a0\nHowever, in the case of one who quotes a verse in relation to some incident that occurs, there is nothing wrong with that. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) quoted verses in relation to incidents that occurred. He quoted the verse (interpretation of the meaning), \u201cYour wealth and your children are only a trial\u201d [at-Taghaabun 64:15], when [his grandsons] al-Hasan and al-Husayn came stumbling; he came down from the minbar and said: (interpretation of the meaning), \u201cYour wealth and your children are only a trial\u201d [at-Taghaabun 64:15]. So there is nothing wrong with quoting verses in relation to some incidents that occur. But to quote verses inappropriately, in ways that are not in accordance with that which was intended by Allah, especially if that is in the context of joking and mocking \u2013 this is a very serious matter.\nEnd quote from Liqa\u2019 al-Baab al-Maftooh, 60/13\u00a0\nAnyone wishing to know more may refer to the book al-Iqtibaas: Anwaa\u2018uhu wa Ahkaamuhu, by Dr. \u2018Abd al-Muhsin ibn \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez al-\u2018Askar.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    The hadeeth referred to in the question is as follows:\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cThere is not a single Prophet who was not given signs so \n    that the people would believed in him because of them. What I have been \n    given is a Revelation that Allah has revealed to me, and I hope that I will \n    be the one with the most followers on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1044) and Muslim (152).\u00a0\n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There \n    are several possible interpretations of the hadeeth:\u00a0\n\n    It was said that what is meant is that the miracles of the \n    Prophets have come to an end with the end of their time, and no one \n    witnessed them except those who were present, but the miracle of the Qur\u2019an \n    is ongoing and will continue until the Day of Resurrection. It is \n    extraordinary in its style and eloquence, and in what it foretold of future \n    events of the unseen, so that no era passed except something appeared that \n    the Qur\u2019an said would come to pass, which proves the truthfulness of its \n    claim. This is the strongest of the interpretations of the hadeeth.\u00a0\n\n    It was also said that what is meant is that the miracles of \n    the past were visible and could be seen with the eyes, such as the she-camel \n    of Saalih and the staff of Moosa, whereas the miracle of the Qur\u2019an may be \n    comprehended with the intellect, so the number of those who followed the \n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) because of it \n    were more numerous, since that which can be seen with the eyes comes to an \n    end when the looking ends, whereas that which may be comprehended with the \n    intellect will continue to be understood by those who come after the first \n    generations.\u00a0\n\n    Fath al-Baari, 9/70\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    The answer to the question, How can the Qur\u2019an be a miracle \n    for the unlettered non-Arabs who formed the majority of inhabitants of the \n    world at that time? is as follows:\n\n    it is known that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him) was sent among the Arabs, who were distinguished by their great \n    eloquence and beautiful style in speech, so Allah, may He be exalted, made \n    the miracle or sign of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) of the same nature of that by which his people were distinguished, so \n    that the miracle and challenge would be more effective, just as the sign of \n    Moosa (peace be upon him) was his staff or stick, with which he overcame the \n    deceit of the sorcerers, and the sign of \u2018Eesa (peace be upon him) was the \n    healing of those who had been born blind and of the lepers, because \n    knowledge of medicine was widespread at his time.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the non-Arabs, in the past and at present, and \n    how the Qur\u2019an may be a miracle for them, and whether they were included in \n    its challenge, this may be explained from several angles:\u00a0\n\n    -1-\n\n    Not all Arabs have great knowledge of the Arabic language and \n    its style and eloquence, just as not all non-Arabs are ignorant of the \n    Arabic language. Hence it is known that the miracle and the challenge is \n    addressed to all those who know Arabic, whether they learned it from birth, \n    like the Arabs, or they learned it later on, like the non-Arabs. Thus it is \n    clear that the case of the non-Arabs is like that of Arabs who have no \n    knowledge of their language.\u00a0\n\n    Abu \u2018Abdullah al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    If it is said: \u201cWith regard to reviving the dead, turning the \n    staff into a snake and other, similar miracles, they are very clear and no \n    one who observes that will have any doubt about it. It will be clear to all \n    rational people and no doubt will remain; rather they will all reach a \n    definitive conclusion after seeing that. But this is not the case with \n    regard to your Prophet\u2019s claim of the miraculous nature of the Qur\u2019an, \n    because not everyone will be able to understand its miraculous nature; \n    rather it is only you (Arabs) who can see that, and this applies only to \n    those Arabs who have a good command of the language, as you claim. As for \n    those who do not have a good command of the language, or non-Arabs who do \n    not understand Arabic, they will not understand its miraculous nature. If a \n    non-Arab is asked to speak a word of Arabic, he will not be able to do so, \n    so the fact that he is not able to do that, does not prove that what you are \n    challenging him with is true. Similarly, if an Arab who does not have a good \n    command of Arabic is asked to speak proper Arabic, he will not be able to do \n    so; therefore for him the Qur\u2019an is not miraculous.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    The answer to that is:\u00a0\n\n    We will explain, insha Allah, some aspects of its miraculous \n    nature, of which there are many, some of which can be understood by ordinary \n    people, town dwellers and desert dwellers alike, and these aspects are as \n    clear as turning the staff into a snake and raising the dead. If we assume, \n    for the sake of argument, that it is only miraculous with regard to its \n    eloquence and style, which is different to the style of the speech of \n    ordinary people, then we say that the miraculous nature of the Qur\u2019an, \n    raising the dead and turning the staff into a snake are not going to be \n    understood equally or at the same time by rational people. Rather the one \n    who appreciates the miraculous nature of any miracle is the one who knows \n    how and why that thing is a miracle, as he knows that it is something that \n    cannot be achieved by human tricks and cannot be reached by discovering some \n    material with special characteristics.\u00a0\n\n    It may not be far-fetched to say that a specious argument may \n    be developed in the mind of one who is ignorant of medicine or magic, which \n    prevents him from seeing the miracle; therefore he may say: Perhaps Moosa \n    had some extra knowledge of magic that the sorcerers did not know and had \n    never learned, and by the same token, perhaps \u2018Eesa had found some stones \n    with special qualities or some other material with special qualities by \n    means of which he was able to achieve what he achieved. Such a specious \n    argument can only develop in the mind of one who is ignorant of medicine and \n    magic. As for the one who has any knowledge of medicine or magic, no such \n    confusion will arise in his mind, because he realises, on the basis of his \n    knowledge and experience, that the miracle performed by a prophet is \n    something that cannot be achieved by means of professional tricks or finding \n    some materials with special characteristics; rather it is a miracle that \n    happens by the will of the Creator of the universe, by means of which He \n    intended to give proof of the authenticity of the one who called people to \n    Him. Thus we conclude that understanding of the miraculous nature of raising \n    the dead and turning the staff into a snake was first reached by the \n    sorcerers and magicians, and it may not have been understood by many of the \n    fools who were ignorant of medicine and magic. The same may be said of the \n    miraculous nature of the Qur\u2019an, without any differences: understanding of \n    it came to those who had knowledge of the Arabic language and would see, \n    based on their knowledge of Arabic, the difference between the Qur\u2019an and \n    regular Arabic speech. Thus they would conclude that it was not within the \n    ability of the Arabs to say things in the same style. If the eloquent Arabs \n    and those who were well versed in Arabic were unable to match it, then \n    others are more unlikely to be able to do so. As we say, if the doctors are \n    unable to raise the dead and heal those who were born blind and lepers, \n    people other than doctors are more unlikely to be able to do so; and if the \n    sorcerers were unable to turn a stick into a snake, then people other than \n    sorcerers are more unlikely to be able to do so.\u00a0\n\n    The statement that matching the Qur\u2019an is something that the \n    Arabs are not able to do, and non-Arabs are not involved in this challenge, \n    is similar to saying that only doctors are unable to raise the dead, and \n    people other than doctors are not involved in this challenge, or saying that \n    only sorcerers are unable to turn a stick into a snake, and people other \n    than sorcerers are not involved in this challenge. As the challenge in the \n    other two cases (raising the dead and turning the stick into a snake) is \n    expected to be undertaken by those who have the relevant skills, the same \n    applies in the case of the Qur\u2019an. Rather, in the case of the Qur\u2019anic \n    miracle, it has aspects that we will discuss which everyone can understand, \n    whether he is a non-Arab or an Arab, a Magian or a Jew or Christian. We will \n    discuss it below, in sha Allah.\u00a0\n\n    So we may conclude from what we have said that Muhammad \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought the Qur\u2019an, challenged \n    people with it and it is a miracle, and anyone who brings a miracle and \n    challenges others with it is truthful. Therefore the certain conclusion is \n    that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is true.\u00a0\n\n    Al-I\u2018laam bima fi Deen an-Nasaarah min al-Fasaad \n    wa\u2019l-Awhaam wa Izhaar Mahaasin al-Islam, p. 326\u00a0\n\n    -2-\n\n    Some of the scholars said that the miracle in the Book of \n    Allah, may He be exalted, is not only in the wording, but also the meanings, \n    the sequence of meanings and the way in which ideas are presented. So the \n    miracle and challenge for the Arabs has to do with the style, and for others \n    it has to do with the fact that no one among the speakers of any other \n    language is able to come up with something similar to the Qur\u2019an in any \n    other language.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Jassaas (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The words of Allah, may He be exalted, (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \u201cSay: \u2018If mankind and \n    the jinns were together to produce the like of this Qur\u2019an, they could not \n    produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another\u2019\u201d \n    [al-Isra\u2019 17:88] prove the miraculous nature of \n    the Qur\u2019an. Some people say that its miracle is in the wording and style on \n    the one hand, and in the meanings and the sequence in which ideas are \n    presented, on the other hand. They quote as evidence for that the fact that \n    in this verse the Qur\u2019an challenges both the Arabs and the non-Arabs, the \n    jinn and humans. It is well-known that the non-Arabs could not be challenged \n    on the aspect of the wording and style, therefore the challenge for them \n    should have to do with the meanings and the sequence in which ideas are \n    presented.\u00a0\n\n    Some of the scholars insist that its miraculous nature is \n    limited to its style and eloquence of expression. They say: The miraculous \n    nature of the Qur\u2019an has many aspects: its beautiful style, its eloquent and \n    concise wording, the way in which it combines many meanings in few words, in \n    addition to the fact that it is completely free of any words that sound \n    ineloquent or any ideas or meanings that are out of place, as well as being \n    free of any contradictions. All of it, from beginning to end, is consistent, \n    as described above. The words of people, on the other hand, especially if \n    they speak at length, cannot be free of cheap words, corrupt meanings and \n    contradictions. What we have mentioned of the flaws in people\u2019s speech are \n    present in the speech of people of all languages; it does not apply only to \n    those who speak Arabic. Thus it is possible that the challenge of the Qur\u2019an \n    may be applicable to the non-Arabs in that way: challenging them to bring \n    something that is free of the faults and flaws referred to above, because \n    saying things in an eloquent manner is not something that is limited only to \n    Arabic, to the exclusion of other languages, even though the Arabic language \n    is the most eloquent. We know that the Qur\u2019an is the pinnacle of eloquence, \n    so it is possible that the challenge to the non-Arabs is by way of \n    challenging them to produce words at the highest level of eloquence in their \n    own languages.\u00a0\n\n    Ahkaam al-Qur\u2019an, 5/34, 35\u00a0\n\n    -3-\n\n    There are many aspects to the miraculous nature of the Book \n    of Allah; it is not limited to style and eloquence only. Hence some of the \n    scholars said that the miraculous nature of the Book of Allah which all \n    people, not only the Arabs, may understand, and that Allah\u2019s challenge to \n    produce something like it, is only applicable to these aspects. Hence Allah \n    issued this challenge to the jinn as well as to mankind, to produce \n    something like this Qur\u2019an. One of these aspects is that it foretold events \n    that would happen and foretold the time at which they would happen, for \n    example.\u00a0\n\n    Abu \u2018Abdullah al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    \u2026 The third aspect of the miraculous nature of the Qur\u2019an is \n    what it includes of news of the future before any human even knew anything \n    about it, and foretelling events before they happened. This is something \n    that cannot be known except via the truthful ones who are conveying from \n    Allah, may He be exalted. We will refer to some events just to prove this \n    point in brief, with no need for a lengthy discussion.\u00a0\n\n    For example, Allah, may He be exalted, said (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cCertainly, you \n    shall enter Al-Masjid al-Haram; if Allah wills, secure, (some) having your \n    heads shaved, and (some) having your hair cut short, having no fear\u201d\n\n    [Al-Fath 48:27].\u00a0\n\n    This verse is one of the clearest miracles of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, \n    promised him that He would cause him to enter al-Masjid al-Haraam, him and \n    his people, in safety, and that He would grant them the conquest of Makkah \n    in the best state. They kept waiting for that until its time came and Allah \n    fulfilled His promise. Then they entered it as He had promised, and \n    conquered it as they had been foretold.\u00a0\n\n    Al-I\u2018laam bima fi Deen an-Nasaarah min al-Fasaad \n    wa\u2019l-Awhaam wa Izhaar Mahaasin al-Islam, p. 337\u00a0\n\n    There are other opinions too, but what we have quoted above \n    is sufficient, and it is the strongest view concerning this matter.\u00a0\n\n    To sum up: the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) was an Arab and the Qur\u2019an is Arabic. He was sent to eloquent, \n    well-spoken Arabs, hence his greatest miracle was the Book of Allah, may He \n    be exalted. They were unable to match its wording, phrases, style and \n    eloquence. Thus the rational people among the eloquent and well-spoken \n    realised that this was not the words of a human being, hence they believed.\u00a0\n\n    As for those Arabs who were not eloquent or well spoken, and \n    the non-Arabs, what is to be mentioned to them is the meanings and rulings \n    of the Qur\u2019an, and those aspects of its miraculous nature that they are able \n    to understand. Thus they may develop conviction based on the knowledge and \n    understanding that this is not the words of a human being. Hence many of the \n    non-Arabs became Muslim because of coming across the meaning of a verse. In \n    such cases, this non-Arab could not understand its eloquence and style, but \n    its meaning is the reason why he became Muslim. Many such stories have been \n    passed down by numerous narrators, and in our own time there are many more. \n    Those people only became Muslim after they learned what there is in these \n    verses that no human being could have produced, and that at the time of the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) there was no technology \n    and no scientific discoveries that could enable him to tell people about \n    these matters. Thus they accepted that this was revelation from heaven, so \n    they became Muslim. Hence we can see the extent to which the hadeeth the \n    questioner referred to is applicable to real facts.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on learning recitation and tajweed of Qur\u2019an by means of an electronic pen",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    There is no kind of bid\u2018ah (innovation) in the program \n    mentioned, in sha Allah, because this is a new educational means in which \n    there is nothing contrary to Islam, that helps one learn how to read Qur\u2019an \n    correctly and helps one to memorise it and understand its meanings.\u00a0\n\n    This is like using computers, modern recording devices, \n    videos and so on to record and broadcast lectures and the like. Such things \n    do not come under the heading of bid\u2018ah.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n    Bid\u2018ah means worshipping Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in ways \n    other than what He has prescribed. Based on that, innovation does not \n    include anything other than acts of worship. Rather, newly developed or \n    introduced worldly matters may be examined to see whether they are halaal or \n    haraam, but it cannot be said that they are bid\u2018ah. \u2026 Based on that, what \n    people have introduced nowadays of things that are used to help in matters \n    of worship cannot be said to be bid\u2018ah even if they did not exist (at the \n    time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)). That \n    includes loudspeakers. Loudspeakers did not exist at the time of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); rather they were introduced \n    recently, but they serve a religious purpose, as they convey to the people \n    the prayer, recitation and khutbah of the imam. The same applies to \n    organising lectures, as they achieve good and serve the interests of the \n    people, so they are good. Therefore buying loudspeakers for the mosque for \n    this purpose is something that is prescribed, for which a person will be \n    rewarded.\n\n    End quote from Noor \u2018ala ad-Darb, 2/426\u00a0\n\n    Please see also the answer to question no.\n    3175 and\n    95430\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    In the answer to question no.\n    88728 and\n    112763 we have stated that \n    listening attentively to recitation of the Qur\u2019an outside of prayer, whether \n    it is recitation from a reciter or via a recorder, is not obligatory, \n    although it is mustahabb and prescribed.\u00a0\n\n    There is nothing wrong with repeating after the reciter in \n    order to perfect one\u2019s recitation or to review when memorising. Using this \n    electronic pen to help you to memorise, perfect your recitation, correct \n    mistakes and learn about the commentary on the verses is something \n    praiseworthy; there is nothing wrong with it in sha Allah.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\n\n    With regard to reward, listening to recitation from a machine \n    is not like listening directly to the reciter, as we have explained \n    previously in the answer to question no.\n    112763\u00a0\n\n    Similarly, listening is not like reciting; rather reciting it \n    is better than listening. However, varying between prescribed acts of \n    worship is a good thing and is something required, and it is better than not \n    doing some of them all of the time.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allah have mercy on him) \n    said:\u00a0\n\n    A person will be rewarded for his good intention and for \n    listening to recitation of the Qur\u2019an, commentaries thereon and Prophetic \n    hadeeths, whether that is from the lips of a reciter or from a recorded \n    voice on the radio or otherwise, although the basic principle with regard to \n    listening to the recitation of the Qur\u2019an, that was narrated from the early \n    generations, is that it should be listening to the voice of the reciter \n    himself, without any intermediary. And if a person recites Qur\u2019an himself, \n    pondering the meaning and with humble focus of mind, that is better and \n    greater in reward.\u00a0\n\n    End quote from Fataawa wa Rasaa\u2019il Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, \n    13/81\u00a0\n\n    Reciting whilst listening to tajweed of the Qur\u2019an and \n    correcting mistakes is better than mere recitation in which the reciter \n    makes mistakes, because correct recitation with tajweed is better than \n    recitation without tajweed and that in which there are mistakes.\u00a0\n\n    That applies to the one who does not know how to recite \n    properly with tajweed.\u00a0\n\n    But if you do not know how to recite Qur\u2019an well, then \n    reciting Qur\u2019an with tajweed, following a reciter who recites with tajweed \n    by means of the electronic pen, is better than simply reading Qur\u2019an and \n    making some mistakes and not reciting with tajweed. But for one who knows \n    how to recite well with tajweed, it is better for him to stick to reciting \n    from the Mushaf or reciting from memory, if he has memorised it, because \n    this is the basic principle \u2013 to recite Qur\u2019an without combining it with \n    listening \u2013 because this is how it was done by the early generations, the \n    imams, and the people after them. And because that helps the reciter to \n    achieve proper focus and ponder the meanings. But sometimes it is prescribed \n    for him to focus on listening to recitation from someone else, especially if \n    that person recites well and it will be of greater benefit to him. \u00a0\n\n    However, there is no limit to the bounty of Allah and the \n    blessings He bestows upon His slaves. But the recitation of one who is \n    skilled in recitation is better than the recitation of someone else. If a \n    person strives hard to learn properly and memorise, although that is \n    difficult for him, Allah that will reward him for that and will make up for \n    his shortcomings, as al-Bukhaari (4937) and Muslim (798) narrated that \n    \u2018Aa\u2019ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cThe one who is skilled in reciting Qur\u2019aan will be with the \n    noble, honourable scribes and the one who recites Qur\u2019aan and falters \n    therein, and finds it difficult, will have a double reward.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The one who is skilled is the one who has memorised it \n    precisely, and he does not falter or find it difficult to recite because he \n    has memorised it properly. As for the one who falters therein, he is the one \n    who falters in his recitation because he does not have a good memory. He \n    will have a double reward: a reward for reciting and a reward for faltering \n    in his recitation and the difficulty he encounters. Al-Qaadi and other \n    scholars said: It does not mean that the one who falters there in will have \n    a greater reward than the one who recites with skill; rather the one who \n    recites skilfully will have a better and greater reward, because he will be \n    with the noble, honourable scribes and he will have many rewards, and this \n    status is not mentioned for anyone else, so how can the one who did not make \n    the effort to learn the Book of Allah properly and memorise it, perfect his \n    knowledge of it and recite it be like one who made that effort until he \n    became proficient in it. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    To sum up:\u00a0\n\n    As you do not recite well with tajweed and you sometimes make \n    mistakes in recitation, and this pen helps you to correct your mistakes and \n    recite well, whilst also learning the meaning, then your following this \n    program is something good and is Islamically prescribed; there is no bid\u2018ah \n    in it, in sha Allah.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on tankees or altering the order of verses when memorising Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Tankees or altering the order of verses when reciting is haram, whether that is during prayer or otherwise.\u00a0\nIt says in Asna\u2019l-Mataalib (1/63): It is haram to switch the order of verses when reciting, because that undermines the miraculous nature of the text and it ignores the wisdom behind the order in which the verses appear. End quote.\u00a0\nIt says in Haashiyat ad-Dasooqi (1/242): Switching the order of soorahs is makrooh, and switching the order of consecutive verses in one rak\u2018ah is haram and invalidates the prayer, because it distorts it. End quote.\u00a0\nIt says in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa\u2018 (1/343): It is makrooh to switch the order of soorahs, such as reciting al-Inshiraah (94), then reciting ad-Duha (93) after it, whether that is in one or two rak\u2018ahs, because of the report narrated from Ibn Mas\u2018ood, according to which he was asked about someone who recited Quran in the wrong order. He said: His heart is disordered. Abu \u2018Ubayd explained that as referring to when a person recites one soorah, then after it he recites another that comes before it in the order (of soorahs in the Mushaf). This was mentioned by Ibn Nasrullah in ash-Sharh as being similar to the case with verses, that is, a similar ruling of it being makrooh applies in the case of switching the order of the verses. It says in al-Furoo\u2018 that there is consensus on this point. Ibn Nasrullah said: If it was said that it is haram to switch the order of verses, that would be a valid opinion. The evidence for it being only makrooh is not clear, and using as evidence the way the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) learned it is subject to further discussion, because that was due to need, as the Quran was revealed according to events. Shaykh [Ibn Taymiyah] said: Following the order of verses is obligatory, because the order in which they appear is based on clear instructions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), according to scholarly consensus. End quote.\u00a0\nBut if the switching of the order occurs when memorising, not when reciting or asking someone to listen so as to check one\u2019s memorisation, there is nothing wrong with that. So one may begin by memorising the fifth verse, for example, then the fourth, then when one wants to recite them, one recites the fourth verse and then the fifth, without switching the order. Then when he has memorised the third, and he wants to recite what he had memorised, he should recite them in the proper order without switching it. So he should recite the third, then the fourth, then the fifth. There is nothing wrong with this; some teachers do it this way and think that it is the best way of memorising.\u00a0\nTo sum up: It is not permissible to recite two consecutive verses in the wrong order, and it is not permissible to switch the order of words in one verse.\u00a0\nFor more information please see the answer to question no. 7198 \u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Why There Is No Bismillah in Surah At-Tawbah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Reciting the Basmalah before reading the Quran\nPart of the etiquette of reciting the Quran is for the reciter to always say Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) at the beginning of every Surah, except Surah At-Tawbah.\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cHe should always recite Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim at the beginning of every Surah except Surah Bara\u2019ah (At-Tawbah), because the majority of scholars said that it is a verse wherever it is written in the Mushaf, and it was written at the beginning of all the Surahs except Surah At-Tawbah. If he recites it at the beginning of every Surah (other than At-Tawbah), then there is certainty that he had recited the entire Quran or Surah, and if he fails to recite the Basmalah, he has omitted part of the Quran according to the majority.\u201d (At-Tibyan fi Adab Hamalat Al-Quran, 100.)\nBut if he recites from partway through a Surah, he does not have to recite the Basmalah and it is sufficient for him to seek refuge with Allah (by saying A\u2018udhu Billahi min ash-Shaytan ir-rijim (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed devil), but if he does say the Basmalah there is nothing wrong with that.\u00a0\nWhy doesn\u2019t Surah At-Tawbah start with Bislmillah?\nThe reason why the Basmalah does not appear at the beginning of Surah At-Tawbah is that the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did not write it at the beginning of this Surah in the Mushaf, following the example of the caliph `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him). At-Tirmidhi narrated in As-Sunan that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u201cI said to `Uthman ibn `Affan: \u2018What made you put Al-Anfal which is one of the Mathani, next to Bara\u2019ah [At-Tawbah], which is one of the Mi\u2019in? Why did you not put the line Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim in between them when you put it at the beginning of the rest of Al-Sab\u2019 Al-Tiwal [the long seven Surahs]?\u201d `Uthman said: \u201cThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to receive revelation of Surahs with many verses. When they were revealed, he would call his scribes and tell them, \u2018Put these verses in the Surah where such-and-such is mentioned.\u2019 Al-Anfal was one of the first Surahs to be revealed in Madinah, and Bara\u2019ah (At-Tawbah) was one of the last parts of the Quran to be revealed. Its stories were similar to the stories mentioned in Al-Anfal, so it was thought that it was part of it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken [i.e., died] without explaining whether it was indeed part of it, so they were put next to one another, and the line Bismillahi ir-Rahman ir-Rahim was not written between them, and it [At-Tawbah] was put among the Sab\u2019 Al-Tiwal [seven long Surahs].\u201d (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da\u2019imah, 4/225)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u2026 The correct opinion is that there is no Basmalah between it (Surah At-Tawbah) and Al-Anfal, because the Basmalah is a verse of the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, and if the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say to put the Basmalah between the two Surahs, they did not put it between them. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is the one who decided and said: Put the Basmalah, and he did not tell them to put the Basmalah between Surah Al-Anfal and Surah At-Tawbah, so they did not write it. But it remains to be said: if he did not give instructions to this effect, why is there a separation between it and Surah Al-Anfal? Why did they not make it one Surah? We say: Yes, they did not make it one Surah because they were uncertain as to whether it was the same Surah as Al-Anfal or they were two separate Surahs, so they said: Let us make a separation between the two Surahs and not write the Basmalah. This is the correct opinion concerning the absence of the Basmalah between Surah Al-Anfal and Surah At-Tawbah.\nEnd quote from Liqa\u2019 Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, no. 18\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Revelation of the Quran: All at Once or Gradually?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Did the Quran come down all at once?\nThe issue mentioned has two aspects: on one there is consensus and the other is a matter in which there are differences of opinion.\u00a0\nWith regard to the aspect on which there is consensus, it is that the Quran did not come down from Heaven to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) all at once; rather the Revelation came down to him from Allah piecemeal, according to events and circumstances.\u00a0\nThere are verses which confirm this quite clearly with no confusion, and they affirm the wisdom behind its being revealed in this manner:\u00a0\n1- Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd those who disbelieve say: Why is not the Quran revealed to him all at once? Thus (it is sent down in parts), that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages.\u201d [25:32]\u00a0\nShaykh \u2018Abd ar-Rahman as-S\u2019adi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cThat is because every time something of the Quran was revealed to him, it increased his certainty and steadfastness, especially when there was cause for anxiety. The fact that the Quran was revealed when new developments occurred meant that it had greater impact and was more reassuring to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). And that was more effective than if it had been revealed before that, then was remembered when the new developments occurred. \u00a0\n\u201cAnd We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages,\u201d means We revealed it slowly and sent it gradually. All of this indicates that Allah was taking care of His Book, the Quran, and His Messenger, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as He sent down His Book in accordance with the situations faced by the Messenger and as needed to address unfolding issues.\u201d (Tafsir as-S\u2019adi)\n2- Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning) says:\n\u201cAnd (it is) a Quran which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages.\u201d [17:106]\u00a0\nShaykh \u2018Abd ar-Rahman as-S\u2019adi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cAt intervals\u201d means at an easy pace, so that they might ponder it and think about its meanings, and derive knowledge from it.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd We have revealed it by stages,\u201d means: bit by bit, piecemeal over twenty-three years.\u201d (Tafsir as- S\u2019adi)\nThe Quran was revealed piecemeal\u00a0\nWhat confirms the fact that the Quran was revealed piecemeal is the suspension of the Revelation concerning the slander incident (al-ifk), in which \u2018Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was accused of adultery. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was waiting for Quranic verses to be revealed, because of the enormity of the calamity and the accusation that was made against his wife, until the words of Allah were revealed (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cVerily! Those who brought forth the slander (against \u2018Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) are a group among you. Consider it not a bad thing for you. Nay, it is good for you. Unto every man among them will be paid that which he had earned of the sin, and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be a great torment.\u201d [24:11]\u00a0\nAnother confirmation that the Quran was revealed piecemeal is the first few verses of Surah \u2018Abasa which were revealed when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned away from teaching the blind man Ibn Umm Maktum\u00a0 (may Allah be pleased with him) in the hope that the leaders of Quraysh would become Muslim (as he was already talking to the leaders of Quraysh and the blind mind man came to him in the middle of the conversation).\u00a0\nHow was the start of the revelation of the Quran?\nWith regard to that concerning which there is a difference of opinion, it has to do with the start of the revelation of the Quran . Was it sent down all at once to the first heaven, then brought down to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) piecemeal, or was it all brought down in the same manner, piecemeal according to events, as stated above?\u00a0\nThe reason for this difference of opinion is differences in understanding some verses which indicate that the Quran came down at a particular time, such as the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThe month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong).\u201d [2:185]\n\u201cVerily! We have sent it (this Quran) down on the night of Al-Qadr (Decree).\u201d [97:1]\nAnd Ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) clearly stated this understanding.\u00a0\nThe scholars differed concerning this sending down; there are several opinions, the most well-known of which are two:\u00a0\n1- The view of the majority is that the Quran was sent down from al-Lawh al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet) to the first heaven on Laylat al-Qadr (the night of Decree) all at once, then after that it was sent down in stages over twenty-three years.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that Ibn \u2018Abbas \u00a0(may Allah be pleased with him) said, concerning the verse \u201cVerily! We have sent it (this Quran) down on the night of Al-Qadr (Decree).\u201d The Quran was sent down all at once on Laylat al-Qadr, then Allah sent it down to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bit by bit. \u201cAnd those who disbelieve say: Why is not the Quran revealed to him all at once? Thus (it is sent down in parts), that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages.\u201d [25:32].\u00a0[an-Nasai]\n2- The second opinion is that the revelation of the Quran began on Laylat al-Qadr, then after that it was revealed in stages at various times, according to the unfolding of events and what the people needed. This is the view of the great Tabi\u2018i (Successor) ash-Sh\u2019abi.\u00a0\nThis difference of opinion \u2013 as you can see \u2013 does not have any real impact on the reality of the revelation of the Quran in stages to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It has been said that the reason for this revelation (being sent down all at once to the first heaven)\u00a0was to highlight the nobility and great status of the Quran in the upper realm (the heavens).\u00a0\nBadr ad-Din az-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cIf it is asked: what is the reason for the Quran being sent down to the first heaven all at once? The answer is to highlight its high status and the high status of the one to whom it was revealed. That was so as to announce to the inhabitants of the seven heavens that this was the last of the Books that was being sent down to the last of the Messengers and to the noblest of the nations.\u201d (Al-Burhan fi \u2018Ulum al-Quran)\nHow was the Quran conveyed to Prophet Muhammad?\nThe Angel of Revelation who brought it down to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Jibril (peace be upon him), only heard it from the Lord of Glory, may He be exalted, then he passed it on to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so he heard it with his ears and his heart understood it. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd verily, you (O Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) are receiving the Quran from the One, All-Wise, All-Knowing.\u201d [27:6]\n\u201cAnd if you do not bring them a miracle (according to their (i.e. Quraysh-pagans) proposal), they say: Why have you not brought it? Say: I but follow what is revealed to me from my Lord.\u201d [7: 203]\u00a0\n\u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhen Allah speaks via revelation, the people of heaven hear from heaven a clanging like a chain dragged across a rock and they swoon, then they remain like that until Jibril (peace be upon him) comes to them. When he comes to them, they recover and say: O Jibril, what did your Lord say? He says: The truth, and they say: The truth, the truth.\u201d [Abu Dawud]\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cThe fact that it \u2013 the Quran \u2013 is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz and in pure pages in the hands of the angels does not contradict the idea that Jibril (peace be upon him) brought it down from Allah, whether Allah wrote it down before sending Jibril (peace be upon him) with it or after that. And if He sent it down written to Bayt al-\u2018Izzah (in the first heaven) in one go on Laylat al-Qadr, then He had written it all before sending it down. \u2026 If anyone says that Jibril (peace be upon him) took the Quran from the Book and did not hear it from Allah, this is false for a number of reasons \u2013 which the author then listed.\u201d (Majmu\u2018 al-Fatawa)\u00a0\nWe hope that this is sufficiently clear and we hope that you will remain in contact with us if you have any further questions about this matter or if you need to ask more questions about any matter of our religion. We ask Allah to help you and guide you to that which is in your best interests in this world and in the Hereafter.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

And the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were unanimously agreed that it must be written at the beginning of all soorahs apart from Soorat at-Tawbah, and that is in the Mushaf that was written by \u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan (may Allah be pleased with him) and sent to all regions.\u00a0\nAsh-Shawkaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said, when discussing the Basmalah:\u00a0\nIt should be noted that the ummah is unanimously agreed that neither the one who affirms it nor the one who denies it is to be described as a disbeliever, because of the difference of scholarly opinion concerning it. This is different from the case of a person who denies a letter on which there is consensus or who affirms something that no one said; he is to be regarded as a disbeliever according to scholarly consensus.\u00a0\nThere is no difference of opinion concerning the fact that it is a verse in Soorat an-Naml, or that it is a line to be written at the beginning of the soorahs in the Mushaf, apart from the beginning of Soorat at-Tawbah.\u00a0\nNayl al-Awtar, 2/215\u00a0\nSome of the scholars regard the difference of opinion as to whether the Basmalah is a verse of the Quran as being like the difference of opinion among the leading scholars of recitation about some words and letters that may be proven in some recitations and not in others.\u00a0\nShaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shanqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe scholars differed concerning the Basmalah: is it a verse at the beginning of each soorah, or only at the beginning of al-Faatihah, or is it not a verse at all? As for the words of Allah in Soorat an-Naml, \u201cVerily! It is from Sulaiman (Solomon), and verily! It (reads): In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful\u201d [an-Naml 27:30], this is a verse of the Quran according to scholarly consensus.\u00a0\nWith regard to Soorah Baraa\u2019ah (at-Tawbah), the Basmalah is not a verse thereof, according to scholarly consensus. But there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning other cases. Some of these scholars of Usool stated that the Basmalah is not part of the Quran, and some said that it is part of it in al-Faatihah only. And it was said that it is a verse at the beginning of every soorah. This is the view of ash-Shaafa\u2018i (may Allah have mercy on him).\u00a0\nOne of the best things that have been said concerning this matter, to reconcile between all the opinions, is that in some recitations, such as the recitation of Ibn Katheer, the Basmalah is a verse of the Quran, and in some other recitations it is not a verse, and there is nothing strange about that.\u00a0\nIn the verse in Soorat al-Hadeed, \u201cFa inna Allaha huwa al-Ghaniy ul-Hameed (then Allah is Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all praise)\u201d [al-Hadeed 57:24],\u00a0 the word \u201chuwa\u201d is part of the Quran according to the recitations of Ibn Katheer, Abu \u2018Amr, \u2018Aasim, Hamzah, and al-Kasaa\u2019i, and it is not part of the Quran according to the recitations of Naafi\u2018 and Ibn \u2018Aamir, because they recited it \u201cFa inna Allaha al-Ghaniy al-Hameed\u201d. And in some Mushafs the word \u201chuwa\u201d is present and in others it is not present.\u00a0\nIn the passage \u201cso wherever you turn yourselves or your faces there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne). Surely! Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures needs, All-Knowing. And they (Jews, Christians and pagans) say: Allah has begotten a son (children or offspring)\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:115-116], the waw (in the phrase wa qaalu attakhadha Allahu waladan/and they say: Allah has begotten a son) is present in the recitation of the seven, except for Ibn \u2018Aamir; according to the recitation of Ibn \u2018Aamir it is not part of the Quran, because he recited it as \u201cQaalu attakhadha Allahu waladan (They say Allah has begotten a son)\u201d, without the waw. So it is omitted in the Mushaf of the people of ash-Shaam (greater Syria), and there are other exaples.\u00a0\nThus it is known that it does not matter whether the Basmalah is regarded as a verse in some recitations and not others.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Soorat al-Isra\u2019 is called Soorat Bani Israa\u2019eel in two saheeh mawqoof hadeeths, in which it is the words of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them):\u00a0\nThe first hadeeth was narrated from \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him), who said concerning (the soorahs) Bani Israa\u2019eel, al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta-Ha and al-Anbiya\u2019: They are among the best and earliest and they are among the first I received.\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 4994\u00a0\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u2018Itaaq (translated above as \u201cbest\u201d) is the plural of \u2018ateeq, which means ancient, or it may mean everything that reaches the utmost of excellence; the second meaning was preferred by a number of scholars in this hadeeth.\u00a0\n\u201cand they are among the first I received (tilaadi)\u201d i.e., among that which I memorized a long time ago. Tilaad means long-standing possession; it is the opposite of taarif (recent acquisition). What Ibn Mas\u2018ood meant was that they were among the first soorahs he learned of the Qur\u2019aan, and that they possess virtue because of what they contain of stories of the earlier Prophets and nations.\nEnd quote from Fath al-Baari, 8/388\u00a0\nThe second hadeeth was narrated from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used not to sleep until he had recited Bani Israa\u2019eel and al-Zumar. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3402, who said: It is a hasan hadeeth. It was also classed as hasan by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Nataa\u2019ij al-Afkaar, 3/65; and it was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\u00a0\nThe scholars said that this soorah was better known by the name Soorat Bani Isra\u2019eel at the time of the Sahaabah and Taabi\u2019een, because the first verse of Soorat al-Isra\u2019 speaks of the Isra\u2019 (Night Journey) to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, then in the second verse it starts to speak of an important stage in the story of Bani Isra\u2019eel (the Children of Israel) and their mischief in the land, which is not mentioned in any of the stories of Bani Isra\u2019eel anywhere else in the Qur\u2019aan. That is in the passage where Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cGlorified (and Exalted) is He (All\u00e2h) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him]. Who took His slave (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid-al-Har\u00e2m (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid-al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in order that We might show him (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) of Our Ay\u00e2t (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.). Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer\n2. And We gave M\u00fbsa (Moses) the Scripture and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel (saying): \u2018Take not other than Me as (your) Wak\u00eel (Protector, Lord, or Disposer of your affairs).\n3. \u2018O offspring of those whom We carried (in the ship) with N\u00fbh (Noah)! Verily, he was a grateful slave.\u2019\n4. And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture, indeed you would do mischief in land twice and you will become tyrants and extremely arrogant!\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:1-4].\u00a0\nAl-\u2018Allaamah al-Taahir ibn \u2018Ashoor (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIn many Mushafs it is called Soorat al-Isra\u2019. Al-Aloosi stated that it is called by this name, because at the beginning it mentions the Isra\u2019 (Night Journey) of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and that is the only place where it is mentioned. But at the time of the Sahaabah it was called Soorat Bani Israa\u2019eel, the reason for that being that it mentions things about Bani Isra\u2019eel that are not mentioned in other soorahs, namely their subjugation by those who were given to terrible warfare (cf. 17:4) -- the Assyrians; then their subjugation by another people -- namely the Romans. It is also called Soorat Subhaan, because it begins with this word.\nEnd quote from al-Tahreer wal-Tanweer, 15/5\u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 131664\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Firstly:\u00a0\n    \n\n      We ask Allah to make you\n      steadfast in adhering to goodness and guidance.\u00a0\n    \n\n      In the answer to questions no.\n      14035 and 20803 we have discussed the\n      reward for memorising the Qur\u2019aan and the status of its\n      bearers. We ask Allah not to deprive you of any of\n      that.\u00a0\n    \n\n      Secondly:\u00a0\n    \n\n      There is no text in Islam to\n      suggest that the one who memorises the Qur\u2019aan with the\n      numbers of its verses will attain a greater reward or a\n      higher status than the one who memorises it without\n      that.\u00a0\n    \n\n      Our advice to you is not to do\n      that and not to focus on it, because it is a kind of showing\n      off and time is too precious to spend it on something in\n      which there is no point and will not benefit you in your\n      religion or bring you closer to your Lord, may He be\n      exalted.\u00a0\n    \n\n      You should pay attention to\n      perfecting your recitation and memorisation, and striving to\n      understand the verses and ponder their meanings, as well as\n      paying attention to acting upon what it says in it, regarding\n      as halaal what it permits and as haraam what it forbids, and\n      following its commands and avoiding what it prohibits. Acting\n      in accordance with the Qur\u2019aan is the greatest aim behind\n      reading it and memorising it.\u00a0\n    \n\n      It was narrated that \u2018Abd-Allah\n      ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When one of\n      us learned ten verses, he would not move on from them until\n      he understood the meaning and acted upon them.\u00a0\n    \n\n      Abu \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sulami --\n      one of the Taabi\u2018een -- said: Those who used to teach us the\n      Qur\u2019aan, such as \u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan, \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Mas\u2018ood\n      and others, told us that when they learned ten verses from\n      the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) they\n      would not move on from them until they learned what was in\n      them of knowledge and action.

        "question": "One of the characteristics of Makkan verses is that they are addressed to all of mankind",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    The call in the Holy Qur'aan, \u201cO mankind\u201d is mentioned in \n    twenty places in the Book: two in Soorat al-Baqarah, four in al-Nisa\u2019, one \n    in al-A\u2019raaf, four in Yoonus, four in al-Hajj, one in Luqmaan, three in \n    Faatir and one in al-Hujuraat.\u00a0\n\n    The one who ponders all of these verses will find that they \n    are addressed to all of mankind, believers and disbelievers, righteous and \n    evildoers, calling them to think about that which will benefit them in the \n    Hereafter and reminding them of the Lordship of Allah over them and their \n    need for Him, so that this will motivate them to worship Him alone with no \n    partner or associate, and to devote their religious commitment sincerely to \n    Him alone. Because this is addressed to all of mankind, and is not limited \n    to any specific group, it is appropriate that it should say \u201cO mankind\u201d \n    rather than \u201cO you who believe.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    That has nothing to do with mention of the Ka\u2019bah, Makkah or \n    Hajj in particular; rather most of the soorahs mentioned above in which the \n    call, \u201cO mankind\u201d appears, do not mention anything about the Ka\u2019bah, Makkah \n    or Hajj at all. We do not think that this call comes only when there is \n    mention of the Ka\u2019bah or Makkah, to the exclusion of other Islamic duties.\u00a0\n\n    Some scholars have mentioned, when discussing the difference \n    between Makkan and Madinan soorahs, that the words \u201cO mankind\u201d appear in the \n    Makkan soorahs and \u201cO you who believe\u201d appear in the Madinan soorahs. This \n    is what is usually the case. In Madinan soorahs such as al-Baqarah and al-Nisa\u2019, \n    it says \u201cO mankind\u201d and in some of the Makkan soorahs such as al-Hajj, it \n    says \u201cO you who believe.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    With regard to places in the Holy Qur'aan in which words \n    addressed in general to \u201cmankind\u201d appear in the context of Hajj and its \n    rituals, perhaps the reason for that is that Hajj was first enjoined with \n    the call of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) to all the people of Earth, \n    calling them to visit the sacred House of Allah and to perform the Hajj \n    rituals there. That appears in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cAnd proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will \n    come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep \n    and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform Hajj)\u201d\n\n    [al-Hajj 22:27].\u00a0\n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Meaning: give the call to mankind, calling them to come on \n    the pilgrimage to this House which We have commanded you to build.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that he said: O Lord, how can I call mankind \n    when my voice will not reach them? It was said: Call, and it is for Us to \n    convey. So he stood on his Maqaam (station), or it was said on the Hijr, or \n    on al-Safa, or on Abu Qubays [a mountain beside the Ka\u2019bah], and said: O \n    mankind, your Lord has established a House, so come on pilgrimage to it. It \n    was said that the mountains lowered themselves so that his voice could reach \n    all the corners of the earth, and those who were still in their mothers\u2019 \n    wombs and fathers\u2019 loins heard it, and everything that heard him of rocks, \n    plains and trees responded, as did those who Allah decreed would perform \n    Hajj until the Day of Resurrection, saying: Labbayk Allahumma labbayk. This \n    is a summary of what is narrated from Ibn \u2018Abbaas, Mujaahid, \u2018Ikrimah, \n    Sa\u2019eed ibn Jubayr and others of the salaf. And Allaah knows best.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated by Ibn Jareer and Ibn Abi Haatim at length. \n    End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Tafseer al-Qur\u2019aan al-\u2018Azeem, \n    5/414\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

But having the speakers directly next to one's \n    feet in such a way that the sound of the Qur'aan is heard from below is \n    something that is not appropriate and you should limit it to the rear \n    speakers if you have any, or do something to change the position of the \n    speakers.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was \n    asked: In some cars the speakers are level with the feet, and feet or shoes \n    may be placed on the speaker.

We hope that you can advise us, may Allah preserve you.\u00a0\n\n    He replied: If the speakers are beneath the feet as described \n    or are level with the feet, then you should not play Qur'aan, because the \n    fact that the Qur'aan is being heard from beneath a person\u2019s feet is \n    undoubtedly a kind of disrespect towards the Qur'aan.

If he omits a verse and does not recite it, then \n      he has not completed the Holy Qur'aan.\u00a0\n\n    The scholars even said that he should recite \n    the Basmalah at the beginning of every soorah except Soorat Baraa\u2019ah (al-Tawbah), \n    and he should pay attention to that so that he will have completed the \n    Qur'aan.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) \n    said:\u00a0\n\n    He should always recite Bismillaah al-Rahmaan \n    al-Raheem at the beginning of every soorah except Baraa\u2019ah, as most of the \n    scholars said that it is a verse, as it is written in the Mushaf and it is \n    written at the beginning of all soorahs except Bara\u2019aah. If he recites it \n    then he has definitely completed the recitation, and if he omits the \n    Basmalah he has omitted part of the Qur'aan according to the majority.

This \n    is what the imams used to do in Makkah in the past.\n\n    2.When he remembers \n    the verse that he forgot, he should recite it [this applies if he is still \n    reciting in the prayer] and then resume his recitation until he has \n    finished. This was narrated from \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him).\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said, noting that the order in which it is prescribed to \n    recite is waived in the case of forgetting:\u00a0\n\n    \u2026 if he forgets some of the verses of the \n    soorah when praying qiyaam in Ramadan (i.e., Taraaweeh), he should not \n    repeat it [the entire soorah] or repeat what comes after it, but if he \n    deliberately changes the order of the verses in the soorah and recites the \n    later ones before the earlier ones, that is not permissible according to \n    scholarly consensus.\u00a0\n\n    Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) was \n    asked about the imam during the month of Ramadan omitting some verses from \n    the soorah: did he think that the one who was praying behind him should \n    recite them?\u00a0\n\n    He said: Yes, he should do that. In Makkah \n    they used to appoint a man to write down what the imam forgot of verses and \n    so on, then on night of completion he would recite what he had omitted.\u00a0\n\n    His companions -- such as Abu Muhammad (Ibn \n    Qudaamah) -- said: Rather that is mustahabb in order to complete the Qur'aan \n    and so as to attain a complete reward. The people of Makkah and Ahmad and \n    his companions thought that if the one who had omitted some verses recited \n    them later on when he remembered them, that was sufficient to be regarded as \n    having completed the Qur\u2019aan and to attain the reward, even if that meant \n    the order of verses was not followed in this instance, because without \n    reciting these verses, his recitation of the soorah could not be regarded as \n    complete. This was narrated from \u2018Ali: he forgot a verse from a soorah, then \n    whilst he was still reciting he recited it, then resumed his recitation from \n    where he had got to, and no one noticed that he had forgotten anything \n    except those who were Haafiz (i.e., had memorised the entire Qur'aan).\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa, \n    21/410, 411.\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is the Quran the Word of Allah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Praise be to Allah Who has made good dear to you; we ask Him to increase you in guidance and faith, and to guide your parents to practice Islam and adhere to its rulings.\u00a0\nQuran is the word of Allah\nWith regard to the Quran and the proof that it is the word of Allah, these are specious arguments which were put forward out of stubbornness and arrogance by the first disbelievers to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent. Allah refuted what they said in many ways, proving their words to be false and pointing out what was wrong with it. For example:\u00a0\n\nIn this Quran is a challenge from Allah to mankind and the jinn to produce anything like it, but they were unable to. Then He challenged them to produce only ten surahs like it, and they were unable to. Then He challenged them to produce something like the shortest surah in the Quran , and they could not do it, even though those who were being challenged were the most eloquent and well-spoken of mankind, and the Quran was revealed in their language. Yet despite that they stated that they were completely incapable of doing that. This challenge has remained down throughout history, but not one person has been able to produce anything like it. If this were the word of a human being, some people would have been able to produce something like it or close to it. There is a great deal of evidence for this challenge in the Quran, for example, the ayah (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n\u201cSay: If mankind and the jinn were together to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.\u201d [al-Isra 17:88]\nAllah says, challenging them to produce just ten surahs:\u00a0\n\u201cOr they say, He (Prophet Muhammad) forged it (the Quran). Say: Bring you then ten forged Surahs (chapters) like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the truth!\u201d [Hud 11:13 interpretation of the meaning]\nAllah says, challenging them to produce just one surah:\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Quran) to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:23 interpretation of the meaning]\n\nNo matter how much knowledge and understanding mankind attains, they will still inevitably make mistakes, forget things or fall short. If the Quran were not the word of Allah, there would be some contradictions and shortcomings in it, as Allah says:\u00a0\n\n\u201cHad it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein many a contradiction.\u201d [al-Nisa 4:82 interpretation of the meaning]\nBut it is free from any shortcoming, error or contradiction; indeed, all of it is wisdom, mercy and justice. Whoever thinks that there is any contradiction in it, that is because of his diseased thinking and mistaken understanding; if he refers to the scholars they will explain to him what is correct and clear up the confusion for him, as Allah says:\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, those who disbelieved in the Reminder (i.e. the Quran) when it came to them (shall receive the punishment). And verily, it is an honourable well fortified respected Book (because it is Allah\u2019s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption). Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah)\u201d [Fussilat 41:41-42 interpretation of the meaning]\n\nAllah has guaranteed to preserve this Quran, and He says:\u00a0\n\n\u201cVerily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)\u201d [al-Hijr 15:9 interpretation of the meaning]\nEvery letter of it was transmitted by thousands from thousands down throughout history, and not one letter of it was altered. If any person tried to alter anything in it, or add something or take something away, then he would be exposed straight away, because Allah is the One Who has guaranteed to preserve the Quran, unlike the case with other divinely-revealed Books which Allah revealed to the people of a particular Prophet only, and not to all of mankind, so He did not guarantee to preserve them, rather He delegated their preservation to the followers of the prophets. But they did not preserve them, rather they introduced alterations and changes which distorted most of the meanings. The Quran, on the other hand, was revealed by Allah to all of mankind until the end of time, because the Message of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the final message, so the Quran is preserved in men\u2019s hearts and in written form, as is proven by the events of history. How many people have tried to change the verses of the Quran and deceive the Muslims, but they were quickly exposed and their falsehood was discovered, even by Muslim children.\u00a0\nAnother of the definitive signs that this Quran was not produced by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) but that it came revealed by Allah to him is the following:\u00a0\n\nThe great miracles which the Quran contains of legislation, rulings, stories and beliefs, which could not be produced by any created being no matter how great his intelligence and level of understanding. No matter how hard people try to promulgate laws to regulate their lives, they can never succeed so long as they are far away from the teachings of the Quran; the further away they are, the greater their rate of failure. This is something that has been proven by the disbelievers themselves.\u00a0\u00a0\nReports of matters of the unseen, both past and future, which no human being could speak of independently, no matter how great his knowledge, especially at that time which is regarded as primitive in terms of technology and modern tools. There are many things which had not been discovered yet, and which have only been discovered after lengthy and difficult exploration with the most modern equipment, but Allah told us about them in the Quran, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned them, fifteen centuries ago, such as the stages of embryonic development, the nature of the oceans, etc. These things have made some kafirs state that this could only have come from God, as in the case of the development of the embryo:\u00a0\n\nOnly 60 years ago, researchers confirmed that man does not come into existence all at once, but rather he passes through stages of development one after another. Only 60 years ago, science discovered this one Quranic fact.\u00a0\nShaykh al-Zindani said, we met an American professor, one of the greatest American scientists, whose name was Professor Marshall Johnson, and we told him that it says in the Quran that man is created in stages. When he heard this, he was sitting down, but he stood up and said, Stages? We said, That was in the seventh century CE! This Book came and said, man was created in stages. He said, That is impossible, impossible We told him, Why do you say that? This Book says (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u201cHe creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation in three veils of darkness.\u201d [al-Zumar 39:6]\u00a0\nWhat is the matter with you, that [you fear not Allah (His punishment), and] you hope not for reward (from Allah or you believe not in His Oneness).\n\u201cWhile He has created you in (different) stages.\u201d [Nuh 71:14]\nThen he sat back down on his chair and after a few moments he said, There are only three possibilities. The first is that Muhammad had a huge microscope through which he managed to study these things and he knew things that the people did not know, and he said these things. The second is that this happened by accident, it was a coincidence. The third is that he was a Messenger from God. We said, With regard to the first idea, that he had a microscope and other equipment, you know that a microscope needs lenses, and lenses need glass and technical expertise and other equipment. Some of this information can only be discovered with an electron microscope which needs electricity, and electricity needs knowledge which should have been acquired by an earlier generation. It is not possible for this knowledge to have been acquired all at once in a single generation; the previous generation would have had to strive hard in developing science and transmitting it to the next generation, and so on. But for this to be the work of one man, with no one coming before him or after him, either in his own land or the neighbouring lands for the Romans, Persians and Arabs were ignorant and had no such equipment for one man to have all these instruments and tools which he did not pass on to anyone else this is not possible. He said, Thats right, it would be very difficult. We said, And for it to have been an accident or coincidence, what would you think if we said that the Quran did not mention this fact only in one verse but in several verses, and that it did not refer to it in general terms but that it gave details of every stage, saying that in the first stage such and such happens, in the second stage such and such happens, in the third stage and so on. Could that be a coincidence? When we explained to him all the details of those stages, he said, It is wrong to say that this is an accident! This is well-founded knowledge. We said, Then how do you explain it? He said, There is no explanation except that this is revelation from above!\nWith regard to the many statements in the Quran concerning the sea, some of these facts were not discovered until very recently, and many of them are still unknown. For example, these facts were discovered after hundreds of marine stations had been set up, and after images had been taken by satellites. The one who said this was Professor Schroeder, one of the greatest oceanographers in West Germany. He used to say that if science advanced, religion would have to retreat. But when he heard the translation of the verses of the Quran, he was stunned and said, These could not be the words of a human being. \u00a0 And Professor Dorjaro, a professor of oceanography, told us of the latest developments on science, when he heard the verse:\u00a0\n\u201cOr (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed with waves topped by waves, topped by dark clouds, (layers of) darkness upon darkness: if a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And he for whom Allah has not appointed light, for him there is no light.\u201d [al-Nur 24:40 interpretation of the meaning]\nHe said:\n\u201cIn the past, man could not dive to a depth of more than twenty meters because he had no special equipment. But now we can dive to the bottom of the ocean, using modern equipment, and we find intense darkness at a depth of two hundred meters. The ayah says a vast deep sea . The discoveries in the depths of the sea give us an understanding of the verse, (layers of) darkness upon darkness. It is known that there are seven colours in the spectrum, including red, yellow, blue, green, orange, etc. When we dive down into the depths of the ocean, these colours disappear one after another, and the disappearance of each colour results in more darkness. Red disappears first, then orange, then yellow and the last colour to disappear is blue, at a depth of two hundred meters. Each colour that disappears adds to the darkness until it reaches total darkness.\u00a0 With regard to the phrase waves topped by waves, it has been proven scientifically that there is a separation between the upper and lower parts of the ocean, and that this separation is filled with waves, as if there are waves on the edge of the dark, lower portion of the sea, which we do not see, and there are waves on the shores of the sea, which we do see. So it is as if there are waves above waves. This is a confirmed scientific fact, hence Professor Dorjaro said concerning these Quranic verses, that this cannot be human knowledge.\u201d (Al-Adillah al-Maddiyyah \u2018ala Wujud-Allah by Muhammad Mutwalli al-Sha\u2019rawi)\u00a0\nAnd there are very many such examples\u00a0\n\nIn the Quran there are some verses which rebuke the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and mention some things to which Allah drew his attention. Some of them may have been embarrassing for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). But if this Quran had come from the Messenger of Allah, there would have been no need for this; if he were to conceal any part of the Quran, he would have concealed some of these verses which contained rebukes or drew his attention to certain matters which he should not have done, such as the verse in which Allah says to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., their saying that Muhammad married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him.\u201d [al-Ahzab 33:37 interpretation of the meaning]\nAfter this, can there be any doubt left in the mind of any intelligent person that this Quran is the word of Allah, and that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) conveyed that which was revealed to him in full?\u00a0\nMoreover, we tell this person, try it for yourself, read a sound translation of the Quran and use your mind to ponder these rules and regulations. There is no doubt that any intelligent person who has the power of discernment will see a great difference between these words (of Allah) and the words of any person on the face of the earth.\u00a0\nMan-woman relationship in Islam\nWith regard to your relationship with this young man, this noble religion forbids women to mix with men for a great and wise reason. So you have to stop meeting him and break off your relationship with him until he becomes Muslim, in which case you can marry him in a proper Islamic marriage. In the answer to Question no. 1200 you will find an explanation of the rulings on a Muslim woman mixing with non-mahram men.\u00a0\nWith regard to your love for him, this is a test from Allah: will you put your love of Allah before your love for one of His creation, or will you put your love for this person before the love of your Almighty Lord Who has forbidden such things. Note that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than that, the first of which is that you will find, in sha Allah, that Allah will compensate you with comfort and tranquility in loving Him and striving to draw closer to Allah by means of that which He loves; so your love for your Lord and your attachment to Him will increase, and\u00a0 your attachment to all of His creation will become weaker. In the answer to Question no. 10254 you will find some solutions to this problem.\u00a0\nCan Muslim women marry non-Muslim men?\nWith regard to the ruling on a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man , this is haram according to scholarly consensus, indeed it is one of the major immoral actions which Allah has forbidden in the Quran. In the answers to Questions no. 8396 and 1825 you will find a detailed response to this question.\u00a0\nWe advise you to be patient and to put up with difficulties, and to keep far away from everything that may cause you to do things that would anger your Lord. Note that Allah has made this world a place of trial and testing for His believing slaves; whoever is patient and refrains from following his desries, seeking the pleasure of Allah, Allah will compensate him with Paradise where He will bestow upon him all kinds of delight which cannot be compared with the fleeting worldly pleasures that he sacrificed. This is in addition to the happiness and tranquility that he will find in his heart when he obeys his Lord.\u00a0\nPerhaps if he sees how you adhere to your religion and avoid meeting him and sitting with him despite your love for him, he will come to realize the greatness of this religion which makes its followers prepared to sacrifice all that they love in order to please their Lord, and that they hope for a great reward from their Lord for their patience in obeying Him and keeping away from that which He has forbidden and perhaps that will be the cause of his becoming Muslim.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to guide him to Islam, and to make goodness easy for you, and to keep all evil away from you, Ameen.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Commentary on the verse in which Allaah says: \u201cVerily, Allaah will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allaah)\u201d [al-Ra\u2019d 13:11]",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This is an important verse which indicates that Allaah, may \n    He be blessed and exalted, in His perfect justice and wisdom does not change \n    the condition of the people from good to bad or from bad to good, from ease \n    to hardship or from hardship to ease, unless they change their condition \n    themselves. So if they are in a state of righteousness and goodness and they \n    change, Allaah will change things for them with punishment, calamities, \n    hardship, drought, famine, disunity and other kinds of punishments as \n    appropriate requital. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd \n    your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves\u201d [Fussilat 41:46].\u00a0\n\n    Or He may give them respite and give them time so that they \n    might truen to the right path, but if they do not then they will be seized \n    unexpectedly, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n    \u201cSo, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been \n    reminded, We opened for them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in \n    the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, \n    We took them (in punishment), and lo! They were plunged into destruction \n    with deep regrets and sorrows\u201d [al-An\u2019aam 6:44]., \n    meaning despairing of all goodness -- we seek refuge in Allaah from the \n    punishment and wrath of Allaah. Or they may be given respite until the Day \n    of Resurrection, when their punishment will be more severe, as Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    \u201cConsider not that Allaah is unaware of that which the \n    Z\u00e2lim\u00fbn (polytheists, wrongdoers) do, but He gives them respite up to a Day \n    when the eyes will stare in horror\u201d[Ibraaheem 14:42], \n    meaning that they are given respite until after death, and that will be a \n    greater and more severe punishment.\u00a0\n\n    Or they may be in a state of evil and sin, then they repent \n    to Allaah and turn back to Him, and they regret their sins and adhere to \n    obedience, so Allaah changes their state of wretchedness, hardship and \n    poverty to ease, unity and righteousness because of their good deeds and \n    their repentance to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. It says in \n    another verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n    \u201cThat is so because Allaah will never change a grace which He has bestowed \n    on a people until they change what is in their ownselves\u201d [al-Anfaal 8:53]. \n    This verse tells us that if they are in a state of ease, comfort and \n    goodness, then they change and turn to sin, their situation will be changed \n    -- there is no power and no strength except with Allaah -- or they may be \n    given respite, as stated above. The opposite is also true: if they were in a state of evil and sin, or disbelief and misguidance, then they repent, regret their sin and adhere to obedience to Allaah, Allaah will change their situation from bad to good; He will change their disunity into unity and harmony; He will change their hardship to ease, well being and plenty; He will change their situation from draught, famine, , lack of water and so on to rainfall, fertile land and other kinds of goodness.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Reading Qur\u2019aan is an act of worship, pure and simple, an act \n    by means of which a person seeks to draw close to his Lord. The basic \n    principle concerning this and similar acts that are only worship is that the \n    Muslim does them seeking thereby the pleasure of Allaah and seeking the \n    reward that is with Him, and not to seek reward or appreciation from any \n    other person. Hence it was unknown among the righteous salaf to hire people \n    to read the Qur\u2019aan for the dead or on weddings or at parties. There is no \n    report from any of the imams of Islam that they enjoined such a thing or \n    allowed it. Neither it is known that any of them accepted payment for \n    reading Qur\u2019aan.

The Prophet (blessings and peace \n    of Allaah be upon him) commanded the one who reads the Qur\u2019aan to ask of \n    Allaah thereby, and he warned against seeking anything from people. \n    Al-Tirmidhi narrated in his Sunan from \u2018Imraan ibn Husayn that he \n    passed by a reader who was reading the Qur'aan, then he asked (for \n    something). He said Inna Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji\u2019oon (verily to \n    Allaah we belong and to Him is our return -- said when faced with calamity), \n    and then he said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of \n    Allaah be upon him) say: \u201cWhoever reads the Qur'aan, let him ask of Allaah \n    thereby, for there will come people who will read the Qur'aan and ask of \n    people thereby.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    As for accepting payment for teaching it, or performing \n    ruqyah in which the Qur\u2019aan is recited, and other things in which the \n    benefit goes to someone other than the reader, the saheeh hadeeths indicate \n    that it is permissible, because of the hadeeth of Abu Sa\u2019eed who accepted a \n    flock of sheep as payment for performing ruqyah for the man who had been \n    stung by a scorpion, and he recited Soorat al-Faatihah for him as a ruqyah; \n    and the hadeeth of Sahl about when the Prophet (blessings and peace of \n    Allaah be upon him) gave a woman in marriage to a man in return for his \n    teaching her what he had memorised of the Qur'aan. So the one who accepts \n    payment just for reading or hires a group of people to read the Qur'aan is \n    going against the Sunnah and against what the righteous salaf (may Allaah be \n    pleased with them all) were agreed upon.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah sent \n    blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions. End \n    quote\u00a0\n\n    Standing Committee For Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas"

        "question": "Ruling on going back to Soorat al-Faatihah and the first few verses of Soorat al-Baqarah after completing the Qur'aan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed \n    concerning the ruling on what many Qur'aan reciters do when completing the \n    Qur'aan, which is starting a new recitation, by going back to Soorat \n    al-Faatihah and reading it along with the first five verses of Soorat \n    al-Baqarah only. The difference of opinion is reflected in the two following \n    views:\u00a0\nThe first view is: that \n    this is prescribed and is mustahabb. This is the view favoured by the \n    reciters and was stated by some of the scholars. They quoted a number of \n    things as evidence for this view, among which is the following:\u00a0\n(i)\nthe hadeeth narrated from \n    \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn \u2018Abbaas, from Ubayy ibn Ka\u2019b, from the Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), which says that when he recited \u201cQul \n    A\u2019oodhu bi Rabbi l-Naas\u201d, he would start again with al-Faatihah, then he \n    would recite al-Baqarah up to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n    \u201cand they are the successful\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:5]. Then he would recite \n    du\u2019aa\u2019 al-khatmah (du\u2019aa\u2019 for completing the Qur\u2019aan), then he would get \n    up.\u00a0\nThis was narrated by \n    al-Daarimi, as attributed to him by al-Suyooti in al-Itqaan (1/295), \n    and he said it was narrated with a hasan isnaad. It was also narrated by \n    al-Haafiz Abu \u2018Amr al-Daani and al-Haafiz Abu\u2019l-A\u2019la\u2019 al-Hamadhaani, as \n    narrated from them by Ibn al-Jazari in al-Nashr (688-694), and by \n    al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali al-Jawhari in Fawaa\u2019id Muntaqaah (2/29). They all \n    narrated it via one isnaad:\nAl-\u2018Abbaas ibn Ahmad \n    al-Barti, \u2018Abd al-Wahhaab ibn Faleeh al-Makki narrated to us, \u2018Abd al-Malik \n    ibn \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Sha\u2019wah narrated to us, from his maternal uncle Wahb ibn \n    Zam\u2019ah ibn Saalih, from Zam\u2019ah ibn Saalih, from \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Katheer, \n    from Darbaas the freed slave of Ibn \u2018Abbaas, and from Mujaahid, from \n    \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn \u2018Abbaas, from Ubayy ibn Ka\u2019b, from the Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him).\u00a0\nShaykh al-Albaani (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThis is a da\u2019eef (weak) \n    isnaad, for two reasons:\u00a0\nThe first is that it hinges \n    on Zam\u2019ah ibn Saalih. Al-Dhahabi said in al-Kaashif: He was classed \n    as da\u2019eef by Ahmad. Al-Haafiz said in al-Taqreeb: (he is) da\u2019eef and \n    his hadeeth is maqroon according to Muslim.\nThe other reason is that \n    there is confusion concerning its isnaad for two reasons. The first is this \n    hadeeth quoted above from Darbaas and from Mujaahid, who are mentioned \n    together in the isnaad.\u00a0\nThe second is from Darbaas \n    alone, and Mujaahid is not mentioned with him. Ibn al-Jazari quoted the \n    isnaads like this in al-Nashr (2/420-425).\u00a0\nAccording to a version \n    narrated from Wahb ibn Zam\u2019ah ibn Saalih, from \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Katheer, from \n    Darbaas, from \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn \u2018Abbaas\u2026 in a marfoo\u2019 report. No mention is \n    made in this isnaad of Zam\u2019ah.\u00a0\nHe said following that: a \n    ghareeb hadeeth, which we know only through this isnaad. Its isnaad is hasan \n    but al-Haafiz Abu\u2019l-Shaykh al-Asbahaani and Abu Bakr al-Zaynabi narrated it \n    from Wahb from his father Zam\u2019ah,\u2026 and this is the correct isnaad.\u00a0\nI say: This suggestion is \n    correct, because it is what appears in most reports. On that basis there is \n    no way to class its isnaad as hasan, because it hinges on Zam\u2019ah ibn Saalih \n    who is da\u2019eef, as stated above.\u00a0\nHow can it be hasan when it \n    includes Darbaas the freed slave of Ibn \u2018Abbaas, who is majhool \u2013 as Abu \n    Haatim said and was followed in that by al-Dhahabi and al-\u2018Asqallaani? Yes, \n    he was mentioned with Mujaahid in some reports, as in the version narrated \n    by al-Jawhari and others, but even if that is correct, the fault in it is \n    still the same, namely Zam\u2019ah. And Allaah knows best. end quote.\u00a0\nAl-Silsilah al-Da\u2019eefah \n    (no. 6134).\u00a0\n(ii)\nA marfoo\u2019 hadeeth in which \n    it says:\u00a0\nA man said: O Messenger of \n    Allaah, which deed is most beloved to Allaah? He said: The one who reaches \n    (the end) then keeps going. He said: Who is the one who reaches (the end) \n    then keep going? He said: The one who reads the Qur\u2019aan from the beginning \n    to the end, then when he reaches the end he starts again from the beginning. \n    \u00a0\nThis hadeeth was narrated \n    via two isnaads:\u00a0\nThe first is muttasil: via \n    Saalih al-Murri, from Qataadah, from Zaraarah ibn Awfa, from Ibn \u2018Abbaas. It \n    was narrated with this isnaad from Saalih al-Murri by al-Haytham ibn \n    al-Rabee\u2019 \u2013 as quoted by al-Tirmidhi (no. 2948) \u2013 and by \u2018Amr ibn \u2018Aasim \u2013 \n    as quoted by al-Bazzaar (2/213) \u2013 and by \u2018Aasim al-Kilaabi, \u2018Amr ibn Marzooq \n    and Zayd ibn al-Habbaab in al-Mustadrak (1/757), and by Ibraaheem ibn \n    Abi Suwayd al-Dhaari\u2019 \u2013 as quoted in Mu\u2019jam al-Tabaraani (12/168).\u00a0\nThe second is mursal, via \n    Saalih al-Murri, from Qataadah, from Zaraarah ibn Awfa, from the Prophet \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), without any mention of Ibn \n    \u2018Abbaas. It was narrated from Saalih al-Murri with this isnaad by Muslim ibn \n    Ibraaheem, as quoted by al-Tirmidhi (no. 2948); Ishaaq ibn \u2018Eesa, as quoted \n    by al-Daarimi (2/560); \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mu\u2019aawiyah al-Jumahi \u2013 as quoted in\n    al-Nashr by Ibn al-Jazari (p. 699). Al-Tirmidhi regarded as more \n    correct the report of the one who narrated it as mursal, and said: This is a \n    ghareeb hadeeth; we do not know of it from the hadeeth of Ibn \u2018Abbaas except \n    through this isnaad, and it is not qawiy (strong). This \u2013 meaning the mursal \n    report \u2013 in my view is more saheeh than the hadeeth of Nasr ibn \u2018Ali from \n    al-Haytham ibn al-Rabee\u2019. End quote.\u00a0\nThere is a corroborating, \n    marfoo\u2019 report in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah which was narrated by \n    al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak (1/758), in the isnaad of which there is \n    Miqdaam ibn Dawood who is da\u2019eef al-hadeeth. See: Lisaan al-Mizaan \n    (6/84). There is another corroborating report from Zayd ibn Aslam from the \n    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which is mursal. Abu \n    \u2018Amr al-Daani gives its isnaad in al-Nashr (p. 700).\u00a0\nThis hadeeth was classed as \n    da\u2019eef by a number of scholars, including its narrator Imam al-Tirmidhi, \n    al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar, as it says in al-Futoohaat al-Rabaaniyyah \n    (3/248) and Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Da\u2019eefah (no. 1834).\u00a0\n(iii)\nThe action of the righteous \n    salaf; this Sunnah was part of their traditions.\u00a0\nIbn al-Jazari (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAl-Haafiz Abu \u2018Amr also \n    narrated with a saheeh isnaad from al-A\u2019mash, from Ibraaheem who said: When \n    they completed the Qur\u2019aan, they regarded it as mustahabb to read a few \n    verses from the beginning. This is a clear statement of the validity of the \n    view favoured by the reciters and held by the salaf. End quote.\u00a0\nAl-Nashr \n    (2/449, p. 703).\u00a0\nAl-Haafiz Abu \u2018Amr al-Daani \n    said:\u00a0\nThe fact that Ibn Katheer \u2013 \n    meaning the famous reciter \u2013 did that is indicated in the narrated texts and \n    the reports are mawqoof and do not go back to the Messenger of Allaah (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him). There are many other reports narrated \n    from the Sahaabah, Taabi\u2019een and those who come after them. End quote from\n    al-Nashr fi\u2019l-Qiraa\u2019at al-\u2018Ashar by Ibn al-Jazari (p. 688).\u00a0\n(iv)\nThe fact that the Muslims \n    followed this Sunnah in all regions.\u00a0\nIbn al-Jazari (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThis action was done in all \n    Muslim regions according to the recitation of Ibn Katheer and others, to \n    such an extent that there was hardly anyone who completed a reading of the \n    Qur\u2019aan but he would immediately start another, whether he completed what he \n    started or not, and whether he intended to complete it or not. That became \n    part of the Sunnah of completing a reading of the Qur\u2019aan among them, and \n    they describe the one who did that as \u201cthe one who reaches (the end) then \n    keeps going\u201d, i.e., the one who reaches the end of the Qur\u2019aan and then \n    starts again from the beginning. End quote.\u00a0\nAl-Nashr \n    (p. 694).\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIt is mustahabb when \n    finishing a complete reading, to start another one immediately after \n    completing it. This was regarded as mustahabb by the earlier and later \n    generations, and they quoted as evidence for it the hadeeth of Anas (may \n    Allaah be pleased with him). End quote.\u00a0\nAl-Tibyaan fi Adaab \n    Hamalat al-Qur\u2019aan (p. 110).\u00a0\nAl-Suyooti (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIt is Sunnah when \n    comp\u2019leuting a reading of the Qur'aan to start another immediately after \n    completing it, because of the hadeeth of al-Tirmidhi and others... End \n    quote. \u00a0\nAl-Itqaan (1/295). See \n    also: Sunan al-Qurra\u2019 wa Manaahij al-Mujawwideen (p. 227).\u00a0\nThe second view is that it \n    is not allowed and is not mustahabb. This was stated by Imam Ahmad (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him).\u00a0\nThe basis for this opinion \n    is that this action was not narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace \n    of Allaah be upon him). He would review the Qur'aan with Jibril once every \n    year, and he reviewed it with him twice in the year in which he died, and no \n    one has transmitted anything to us about this practice which is followed \n    today. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAbu Taalib said: I asked \n    Ahmad when he recited \u201cQul a\u2019oodhu bi Rabbi l-naas\u201d, whether he recited \n    anything of al-Baqarah? He said no, and he did not regard it is mustahabb to \n    follow his completion of the Qur'aan with the recitation of anything. \n    Perhaps he had no verification of any saheeh report to indicate that. End \n    quote.\u00a0\nAl-Mughni \n    (1/838).\u00a0\nIt says in al-Furoo\u2019 \n    (1/554):\u00a0\nHe should not read \n    al-Faatihah and the first five verses of al-Baqarah. al-Aamidi said: meaning \n    before the supplication. And it was said that it is mustahabb. End quote.\u00a0\nIbn Muflih said in \n    al-Adaab al-Shar\u2019iyyah (2/319):\u00a0\nIf one finishes reciting \n    Soorat al-Naas, he should not add al-Faatihah and five verses of al-Baqarah. \n    He said in the commentary: Perhaps he did not have any proven saheeh report. \n    And it was said: it is permissible after the du\u2019aa\u2019, or it is mustahabb.\u00a0\nAl-Qaadi said, after \n    mentioning the meaning of this report from the hadeeth of Anas which was \n    narrated by Ibn Abi Dawood \u2013 meaning the hadeeth which mentions \u201cThe one who \n    reaches (the end) then keeps going\u201d \u2013: The apparent meaning of this is that \n    this is mustahabb. The answer is that what is meant is to encourage repeated \n    reading of the entire Qur\u2019aan, time after time. There is nothing in this to \n    indicate that the du\u2019aa\u2019 should not come immediately after completing the \n    Qur\u2019aan. End quote.\u00a0\nImam Ibn al-Qayyim (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nSome of them understood \n    from this that every time one finishes reading the entire Qur\u2019aan, he should \n    read the Opening of the Book (al-Faatihah) and three verses of Soorat \n    al-Baqarah, because he has reached the end then kept going by starting again \n    from the beginning.\u00a0\nNone of the Sahaabah did \n    this, nor did the Taabi\u2019een, and none of the imams regarded it as \n    mustahabb.\u00a0\nThe hadeeth \u201cThe one who \n    reaches (the end) then keeps going\u201d may mean either of two things. One is \n    that every time he reaches the end of a soorah or juz\u2019, he keeps going and \n    moves on to the next; the second is that every time he completes the Qur\u2019aan \n    he starts it again from the beginning. End quote.\u00a0\nI\u2019laam al-Muwaqqi\u2019een \n    (4/306).\u00a0\nThe second view is more \n    likely, based on the evidence, in sha Allaah, because there is no proven \n    evidence that such a thing is mustahabb, rather the apparent meaning of the \n    Sunnah indicates the opposite, as explained above. This view is favoured in \n    the answer to question no. 12032.\u00a0\nBut we should note that \n    this issue, even though we have pointed out what we believe is more correct, \n    is a matter of ijtihaad, and it is not a definitive matter. If someone has \n    sound evidence that the salaf used to do that, or he believes that the \n    hadeeth narrated concerning it is saheeh, then he is not innovating or going \n    astray, rather he should not be denounced.\u00a0\nSimilarly, those who follow \n    the view that we regard as more correct should not be denounced. Rather Imam \n    al-Jazari (may Allaah have mercy on him), who is one of those who say that \n    this is prescribed, says:\u00a0\nWhatever the case, we do \n    not say that this is binding upon every reader, rather we say what our imam \n    Faaris ibn Ahmad and others said: Whoever does that has done well, and \n    whoever does not do it, there is no blame on him. End quote.\u00a0\nAl-Nashr \n    (p. 704).\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "The Quran and medicine",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nAllah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with a religion that covers all aspects of life, as Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left us and no bird flapped its wings in the sky except that he had taught us some knowledge about it.\u00a0\n(Narrated by Ahmad, 20399. See Majma\u2019 al-Zawaa\u2019id, 8/263. al-Haythami said: it was narrated by al-Tabaraani and its men are the men of saheeh apart from Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Yazeed al-Muqri\u2019 who is thiqah (trustworthy)).\u00a0\nIslam came to meet the needs of people in all aspects of their lives. \u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWhat is narrated in the Sunnah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) complements what is in the Quran. These two sources are the principal sources for Muslims. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that Allah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down a cure for it.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAllah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down a cure for it.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 5678.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nWhat the questioner has mentioned, that some Muslims say that many remedies were discovered through the Holy Quran, we say that this is somewhat exaggerated.\u00a0\nThe Quran is not a book of medicine or geography or geology as some Muslims like to say to westerners. Rather it is a book of guidance for mankind and one of the greatest of its miracles is its eloquence and the ideas and concepts that it contains. This is the main aspect of its miraculous nature. Allah revealed it to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at a time when eloquence had reached great heights, so this book came to amaze those people and challenge them in their area of expertise, to prove to them that it was from Allah.\u00a0\nThis is not strange, and it is nothing new in religion. The signs of Moosa (peace be upon him) \u2013 his stick and his hand \u2013 were of the kind that was prevalent during his time, which was magic (sihr). The signs of \u2018Eesa (peace be upon him) \u2013 raising the dead and healing the blind and lepers \u2013 were of the kind that his people were skilled in and that was widespread among them, which was medicine.\u00a0\nHence we say that the greatest feature of the Quran is its eloquence. Scholars nowadays are still discovering new aspects of its eloquence through their study of its verses. \u00a0\nThis does not mean that there is no other miraculous aspects to the Quran. Rather in some verses Allah mentions things about the design of the human body, the stages of its creation and development, some natural phenomena, etc.\u00a0\nBut with regard to cures for various diseases, as the questioner mentions, the Quran is a healing for the believers. This includes healing the heart (mental or spiritual disease) and physical healing. Allah mentions honey in the Quran and says that it is a healing for mankind. And He mentions the principle of preserving good health and guarding against sickness. So whoever says that the Quran says a lot about medicine in this regard is right, but whoever goes beyond that is exaggerating. Rather this is a kind of exaggeration coined by some Muslims. The Quran is not a book of medicine. There are some diseases that did not exist previously, so how could their cure come \u2013 according to what the questioner says \u2013 before they appeared?\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\n(a)The following are some of the verses which indicate that the Quran is healing:\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe\u201d\n[al-Isra\u2019 17:82]\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAllah says \u201cAnd We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe\u201d. The correct view is that the word min (translated here as \u201cof\u201d) serves to explain the nature of the Quran as a whole, not to refer to parts of it and not other parts. \u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Quran, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your hearts\u201d\n[Yoonus 10:57]\nThe Quran is the complete healing for all mental, spiritual and physical diseases, all diseases of this world and the Hereafter. But not everyone is guided to use it for the purpose of healing. If the sick person uses the Quran for healing in the proper way, and applies it to his disease with sincerity, faith, complete acceptance and firm conviction, fulfilling all its conditions, then no disease can resist it.\u00a0\nHow can disease resist the words of the Lord of heaven and earth which, if He had revealed it to the mountains they would have crumbled and if He had revealed it to the earth it would have broken it apart? There is no sickness, spiritual or physical, but in the Quran there is that which indicates its remedy, its cause and how to protect against it for those who are blessed with understanding of His Book.\u00a0\nZaad al-Ma\u2019aad, 4/352\u00a0\n(b)The Quran contains the treatment for hearts and souls, and as such it is a means of expelling all sicknesses from the body. In this regard the Quran is a healing and a remedy for many diseases.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nWe and others have tried this on many occasions and we have seen that it works in ways that physical remedies do not. Indeed we now regard physical medicine as the doctors regard folk medicine. This is in accordance with the law of divine wisdom, not contrary to it, but the causes of healing are many and varied. When the heart is in contact with the Lord of the Worlds, the Creator of the disease and the remedy, the Controller of nature Who directs it as He wills, he has other remedies apart from the remedies that are sought by the heart that is far away from Him and that turns away from Him. It is known that when a person\u2019s spirits are high and his body is in good shape, they cooperate in warding off disease and suppressing it, so if a person is in high spirits and physical good shape, finds comfort in being close to his Creator, loving Him, enjoying remembrance of Him (dhikr), devoting all his strength and power for His sake and focusing on Him, seeking His help, putting his trust in Him, how can anyone deny that this is the greatest medicine or that this spiritual power gives him the means to ward off pain and defeat it completely? No one would deny this but the most ignorant of people, those who are furthest away from Allah and the most hard-hearted and unaware of human nature.\u00a0\nZaad al-Ma\u2019aad 4/12\u00a0\n(c)In the Quran there is Soorat al-Faatihah which is a ruqyah to be recited as a prayer for healing.\nIt was narrated that Abu Sa\u2019eed (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u201cA group of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out on a journey and traveled until they stopped in (the land of) one of the Arab tribes. They asked them for hospitality but they refused to welcome them. The chief of that tribe was stung by a scorpion and they tried everything but nothing helped them. Some of them said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you go to those people who are camped (near us), maybe you will find something with them.\u2019 So they went to them and said, \u2018O people, our chief has been stung by a scorpion and we have tried everything but nothing helped him. Can any of you do anything?\u2019 One of them said, \u2018Yes, by Allah, I will recite ruqyah for him, but by Allah we asked you for hospitality and you did not welcome us, so I will not recite ruqyah for you until you give us something in return.\u2019 Then they agreed upon a flock of sheep.\u2019 Then he went and spat drily and recited over him Al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-\u2018Aalameen [Soorat al-Faatihah]. (The chief) got up as if he was released from a chain and started walking, and there were no signs of sickness on him. They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e. the companions) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who performed the ruqyah said, \u2018Do not divide them until we go to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him what happened, then wait and see what he tells us to do.\u2019 So they went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, \u2018How did you know that it (al-Faatihah) is a ruqyah?\u2019 Then he added, \u2018You have done the right thing. Share out (the flock of sheep) and give me a share too.\u2019 And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 2156; Muslim, 2201\u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim said concerning Soorat al-Faatihah: \u00a0\nWhoever is guided by Allah and is given good insight to understand the deep meaning of this soorah and what it contains of Tawheed, understanding of the Divine nature, the names, attributes and actions of Allah, the Divine decree, the Resurrection, rejecting any misconception that undermines the concept of the Oneness of the Divine Lordship and Divine nature, complete trust in Allah and referring all one\u2019s affairs to the One Who has full control of all things \u2013 to Him be all praise, for all goodness is in His hand and to Him all things return \u2013 and feeling in need of Him in seeking guidance that is the root of happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, will realize the connection between the contents of this soorah and bringing good and warding off evil. He will understand that ultimate goodness and blessing is connected to this soorah and is dependent upon understanding it and acting upon it. Then this soorah will make him independent of many other kinds of medicine and ruqyah, and it will open the door to a great deal of goodness and ward off a great deal of evil.\u00a0\nZaad al-Ma\u2019aad, 4/347\u00a0\n(d)The Quran mentions the principle of maintaining good health.\nIbn al-Qayyim said:\u00a0\nThe basic principles of medicine are three: prevention, maintaining good health, and removing harmful substances from the body.\u00a0\nAllah has mentioned them all together, to His Prophet and his ummah in three places in His Book.\u00a0\nHe prevented the sick person from using water lest it harm him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum)\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 4:43]\nAllah allowed the sick person to do tayammum to protect him, just as He permitted it to the one who has no water.\u00a0\nAllah says concerning the maintenance of good health:\u00a0\n\u201cand whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:185]\nThe traveller is allowed to break his fast during Ramadaan, to protect his health lest the combination of fasting and the difficulties of travel weakens him and affects his health.\u00a0\nAnd Allah said concerning the removal of harmful things by shaving the head of the person in ihraam (for Hajj or \u2018Umrah):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Sawm (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity \u2014 feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:196]\nSo if a person has an ailment in his scalp when he is in ihraam, he is permitted to shave his head and remove the harmful thing or the bad substance that is causing lice to develop \u2013 as happened to Ka\u2019b ibn \u2018Ajrah \u2013 or if it is causing sickness to develop.\u00a0\nThese three matters are the basic principles of medicine. We have mentioned an example of each one in order to point out the blessing of Allah to His slaves in preventing sickness, protecting their health and removing harmful substances from them, as a mercy and kindness towards His slaves, for He is the Most Kind, Most Merciful.\u00a0\nZaad al-Ma\u2019aad, 1/164, 165\u00a0\nIbn al-Qayyim said: On one occasion I discussed this with one of the chief doctors of Egypt, and he said: By Allah if I had to travel to the west to obtain these benefits that would not be too much \u2013 or words to that effect.\u00a0\nIghaathat al-Lahfaan, 1/25\u00a0\n(e)Mention of honey in the Quran, and that it is a healing for mankind.\n\u00a0Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThere comes forth from their [bees\u2019] bellies, a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men\u201d\n[al-Nahl 16:69]\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nWith regard to the Prophet\u2019s guidance concerning drinking, it is the most perfect guidance that maintains good health. He used to drink honey mixed with cold water. This is very healthy and no one can understand how healthy it is except the most prominent doctors. For drinking honey on an empty stomach dissolves phlegm, cleanses the stomach, reduces its viscosity, washes away waste matter, warms it up a little and opens its inlet and exit. It has a similar effect on the liver, kidneys and urethra. It is more beneficial to the stomach than any other kind of sweet that enters it. However it may cause side effects in people who are suffering from jaundice because it is hot and jaundice is hot, so it may aggravate it; in order to avoid this effect vinegar may be added, then honey will become beneficial and drinking it will be more useful than many or most of the drinks that are made from sugar, especially for those who are not used to these drinks, for if they drink them they will not suit them as well as honey does, or even come close. \u00a0\nWith regard to drinking it when it is collected and well-prepared, this is one of the most beneficial things for the body, and one of the greatest means of preserving health; it is very refreshing and energizing, and it is good for the liver and heart. If it is well-prepared it provides nutrition and makes food reach all parts of the body in the most effective manner.\u00a0\nZaad al-Ma\u2019aad, 4/224, 225\u00a0\nAnd he said (may Allah have mercy on him):\u00a0\nHoney contains great benefits, for it cleanses impurities from the veins and stomach etc, whether it is eaten or applied to the skin. It is good for the elderly, the phlegmatic and those whose humours are cold and wet. It is nourishing, aids digestion, energizes, makes unpleasant medicine palatable, is good for the liver and chest, is a diuretic and helps to ease coughs caused by phlegm. If it is drunk warm mixed with rosewater it is beneficial for one who has been bitten by a scorpion or who has consumed opium. If it is drunk on its own mixed with water, it is good for the one who has been bitten by a rabid dog or eaten poisonous mushrooms. If fresh meat is placed in honey, it will stay fresh for three months, as will cucumbers, pumpkins and eggplants. Many fruits can be kept in it for six months. It will also preserve a dead body, and it is known as the trustworthy preserver. If the body of one who is afflicted with lice is painted with honey, it will kill the lice and their eggs. It makes the hair long, beautiful and smooth. If used on the eyes like kohl it clears the vision. If the teeth are brushed with it, it whitens the teeth and makes them bright, and keeps the gums healthy. It opens the veins and induces menstruation. If taken on an empty stomach it takes away phlegm and cleanses the stomach, clearing away waste matter and restoring the correct temperature. It does likewise to the liver, kidneys and urethra.\n\u00a0As well as all this, it has no side effects and causes little harm. It may cause side effects in one who is suffering from jaundice, but that may be counteracted by vinegar and the like, in which case it becomes very beneficial for him.\n\u00a0It is a kind of nourishment, a kind of medicine, a kind of drink, a kind of sweet, a kind of cream. There is nothing that has been created for us for a similar purpose that is better than it, or even comes close. The ancient peoples relied on it, and in most of the books of the ancients there is no mention of sugar at all and it was unknown to them, for it is something that is very new. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to drink honey mixed with water on an empty stomach, and this is the secret of maintaining good health that no one can understand except one who is intelligent and blessed.\nZaad al-Ma\u2019aad, 4/33, 34."

        "question": "Can We Read Quran While Lying Down?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with reading the Quran from the Mus-haf whilst lying down. \u00a0\nAl-Bukhari (7549) and Muslim (301) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to lie in \u2018Aishah\u2019s lap and recite Quran.\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Sah\u0647h Muslim:\u00a0\n\u201cThis indicates that it is permissible to read Quran when reclining and lying down.\u201d\u00a0\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan said:\u00a0\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with reading the Quran when lying down, whether one is lying on a bed or on the ground.

        "question": "The revelation of the Quran in seven styles (ahruf, sing. harf)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly :\nyou should note, may Allah bless you, that the Quran was revealed in one style at the beginning, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kept asking Jibreel until he taught him seven styles, all of which were complete. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Ibn \u2018Abbaas who narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cJibreel taught me one style and I reviewed it until he taught me more, and I kept asking him for more and he gave me more until finally there were seven styles.\u201d\n(narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3047; Muslim, 819)\u00a0\nSecondly, what is meant by styles (ahruf, sing. harf)?\u00a0\nThe best of the scholarly opinions concerning what is meant is that there are seven ways of reciting the Quran, where the wording may differ but the meaning is the same; if there is a different meaning then it is by way of variations on a theme, not opposing and contradiction.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nSome of the scholars said that what was meant by ahruf was the dialects of the Arabs, but this is far-fetched, because of the hadeeth of \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab who said: \u201cI heard Hishaam ibn Hakeem reciting Soorat al-Furqaan in a manner different from that in which I used to recite it and the way in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me to recite it.\u00a0 I was about to argue with him whilst he was praying, but I waited until he finished his prayer, and then I tied his garment around his neck and seized him by it and brought him to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, I heard this man reciting Soorat-al-Furqaan in a way different to the way you taught it to me.\u2019 The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, \u2018Recite it,\u2019 and he recited it as I had heard him recite it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \u2018It was revealed like this.\u2019 Then he said to me, \u2018Recite it,\u2019 so I recited it and he said, \u2018It was revealed like this.\u2019 This Qur'aan has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way that is easiest for you.\u2019\u201d\n(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2287; Muslim, 818)\u00a0\nIt is known that Hishaam was Asadi Qurashi (i.e., from the clan of Bani Asad in Quraysh) and \u2018Umar was \u2018Adawi Qurashi (i.e., from the clan of Bani \u2018Adiyy in Quraysh). Both of them were from Quraysh and Quraysh had only one dialect. If the difference in ahruf (styles) had been a difference in dialects, why would two men of Quraysh have been different?\u00a0\nThe scholars mentioned nearly forty different opinions concerning this matter! Perhaps the most correct is that which we have mentioned above. And Allah knows best.\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nIt seems that the seven styles were revealed with different wordings, as indicated by the hadeeth of \u2018Umar, because \u2018Umar\u2019s objection was to the style, not the meaning. The differences between these styles are not the matter of contradiction and opposition, rather they are synonymous, as Ibn Mas\u2019ood said: \u201cIt is like one of you saying halumma, aqbil or ta\u2019aal (all different ways of saying \u2018Come here\u2019).\u201d\u00a0\nFifthly:\u00a0\nWith regard to the seven recitations (al-qiraa\u2019aat al-saba\u2019), this number is not based on the Quran and Sunnah, rather it is the ijtihaad of Ibn Mujaahid (may Allah have mercy on him). People thought that al-ahruf al-saba\u2019 (the seven styles) were al-qiraa\u2019aat al-saba\u2019 (the seven recitations) because they happened to be the same number. But this number may have come about coincidentally, or it may have been done deliberately by Ibn Mujaahid to match what was narrated about the number of styles (ahruf) being seven. Some people thought that the styles (ahruf) were the recitations, but this is a mistake. No such comment is known among the scholars. The seven recitations are one of the seven styles, and this is the style that \u2018Uthmaan chose for all the Muslims. \u00a0\nSixthly:\u00a0\nWhen \u2018Uthmaan made copies of the Quran, he did so according to one style (harf), but he omitted the dots and vowel points so that some other styles could also be accommodated.\u00a0 So the Mus-haf that was copied in his time could be read according to other styles, and whatever styles were accommodated by the Mus-haf of \u2018Uthmaan remained in use, and the styles that could not be accommodated fell into disuse. The people had started to criticize one another for reciting differently, so \u2018Uthmaan united them by giving them one style of the Quran.\u00a0\nSeventhly:\u00a0\nYour saying that Mujaahid\u2019s different recitations meant the seven styles (ahruf) is not correct, as was said by Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah. (Majmoo\u2019ah al-Fatawa, vol. 13, p. 210)\u00a0\nEighthly:\u00a0\nThe seven readers or reciters were:\u00a0\n1-Naafi\u2019 al-Madani\n2-Ibn Katheer al-Makki\n3-\u2018Aasim al-Kufi\n4-Hamzah al-Zayaat al-Kufi\n5-Al-Kisaa\u2019i al-Kufi\n6-Abu \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018Ala\u2019 al-Basri\n7-\u2018Abd-Allah ibn \u2018Aamir al-Shaami\nThe ones who have the strongest isnaad in recitation are Naafi\u2019 and \u2018Aasim.\u00a0\nThe most eloquent are Abu \u2018Amr and al-Kisaa\u2019i.\u00a0\nWarsh and Qaaloon narrated from Naafi\u2019.\nHafs and Shu\u2019bah narrated from \u2018Aasim.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

Its challenge to mankind and the jinn to \n    produce something similar to it still stands.

Allaah created seven heavens, \n    seven earths and seven days, and man\u2019s creation is completed in seven \n    stages; Allaah has prescribed that His slaves should walk around the Ka\u2019bah \n    seven times (tawaaf) and go back and forth between Safa and Marwah seven \n    times (saa\u2019i), and stone the jamaraat with seven pebbles each, and the \n    takbeeraat of Eid are seven in the first rak\u2019ah. The Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cInstruct your children to pray when \n    they are seven.\u201d When the boy reaches the age of seven he should be given \n    the choice between his parents according to one report, and according to \n    another report, his father has more right to him than his mother; according \n    to a third report his mother has more right to him. When he was sick, the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered that water \n    from seven skins be poured on him. Allaah sent the wind against the people \n    of \u2018Aad for seven days. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) asked Allaah to help him by sending upon his people seven (years) \n    like the seven years of Yoosuf \u2013 i.e., seven years of famine. Allaah likened \n    the reward of one who gives charity to a grain that produces seven ears, in \n    each of which are one hundred grains. The number of ears of grain seen by \n    the companion of Yoosuf (in the dream) was seven, the number of years for \n    which they were cultivated was seven, and (the reward for charity) is \n    multiplied seven hundred fold or more. Seventy thousand of this ummah will \n    be admitted to Paradise without being brought to account.\u00a0\nThen Ibn al-Qayyim \n    commented: Undoubtedly this number has some special qualities that are not \n    shared by other numbers. \u2026 Allaah knows best about His wisdom, laws and \n    decree in singling out this number. End quote. \u00a0\nBased on this, the correct \n    view is to refrain from indulging in discussion of the reason why this \n    number is singled out for mention, except on the basis of clear, sound \n    evidence.\u00a0\nFor more information please \n    see the answer to question no. 69741.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Meaning of \u2018Qul Huwallahu Ahad\u2019 Being Equivalent to One-Third of the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Hadiths about Qul Huwallahu Ahad being one-third of the Quran\nThere follow some of the ahadith narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which state that Surat al-Ikhlas (Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad) is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.\n\u00a0Al-Bukhari (6643) narrated from Abu Sa\u2019id that a man heard another man reciting Qul Huwallahu Ahad and repeating it. The next morning he came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him about that. The man thought that it was too little, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cBy the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.\u201d\nMuslim (811) narrated from Abu\u2019l-Darda that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIs any one of you unable to recite one-third of the Quran in one night?\u201d They said, \u201cHow could anyone read one-third of the Quran?\u201d He said, \u201cQul Huwallahu Ahad is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.\u201d\n\u00a0Muslim (812) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cGather together, for I will recite to you one-third of the Quran.\u201d So those who could gather together gathered there, then the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out and recited Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad, then he went in. They said to one another, perhaps there has been some news from heaven on account of which he has gone inside (the house). Then the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out and said, \u201cI told you that I was going to recite to you one-third of the Quran. Verily it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.\u201d\u00a0\nThe bounty of Allah is immense\u00a0\nThe bounty of Allah is immense, and Allah has bestowed His bounty upon this ummah and has made up for its short life span by giving it more reward for simple deeds. It is strange that with some people, instead of this motivating them to do more good, this makes them apathetic and lazy in doing acts of worship, or they feel that this bounty and reward is strange and farfetched.\nHow Qul Huwallahu Ahad\u00a0 is equivalent to one-third of the Quran\nThere is a difference between jaza (reward) and ijza (what is sufficient). What is making the brother confused is that he does not see the difference between them.\n\u00a0Jaza means the reward which Allah gives for obeying Him.\n\u00a0Ijza means what is sufficient and takes the place of something else.\nReciting Qul Huwallahu Ahad brings a reward equivalent to reciting one-third of the Quran, but it does not take the place of reading one-third of the Quran.\n\u00a0If a person vows \u2013 for example \u2013 to read one-third of the Quran, it is not sufficient for him to read Qul Huwallahu Ahad, because it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran in reward, but not in terms of being sufficient or taking the place of reading one-third of the Quran.\n\u00a0The same may be said of reciting it three times. If a person recites it three times in his prayer,\u00a0 that does not mean that he does not have to recite al-Fatihah, even though he will be given the reward of reciting the whole Quran.\n\u00a0A similar example is the reward given by the Lawgiver to one who offers a single prayer in the Sanctuary of Makkah, and that he will have the reward of one hundred thousand prayers. Does anyone take this divine bounty to mean that he does not have to pray for decades because he offered a single prayer in the Haram that is equivalent to one hundred thousand prayers?\n\u00a0Rather this has to do with reward; as for what is sufficient, that is another matter altogether.\n\u00a0Moreover, none of the scholars has ever said that there is no need for us to read the Quran or that Qul Huwallah Ahad is sufficient and takes the place of that.\u00a0\nWhy Qul Huwallahu Ahad\u00a0 is equivalent to one-third of the Quran\u00a0\nThe correct scholarly view is that this surah has this great virtue because the Quran deals with three topics: one-third for rulings, one-third for promises and warnings, and one-third for the Divine names and attributes.\n\u00a0This surah combines names and attributes.\n\u00a0This is the view of Abu\u2019l-\u2018Abbas ibn Surayj, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah stated that it was good in Majmu\u2019 al-Fatawa, 17/103.\n\u00a0The Muslim cannot do without the two other issues, which are the rulings and the promises and warnings. His knowledge cannot be complete unless he looks at the Book of Allah as a whole. The one who stops at Surat al-Ikhlas cannot know the other two matters.\n\u00a0Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah \u2013 may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\"Rewards are of different types, just as wealth is of different types, such as food, drink, clothing, houses, money and so on. If a man possesses one type of wealth, to the value of one thousand dinars, that does not mean that he can do without the other types. Rather if he has wealth in the form of food, he also needs clothing and a place to live, etc. Similarly if it is a type other than money, he still needs other things. If he has nothing but money, he will need all kinds of wealth that are usually needed. In al-Fatihah there are the benefits of praise and du\u2019a which people need, and Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad cannot replace it in that sense. Although its reward is very great, he cannot benefit from it unless he also recites the Opening of the Book (al-Fatihah) in his prayer. Hence if a person recites only Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad in his prayer, without al-Fatihah, his prayer is not valid. Even if he recited the whole of the Quran without al-Fatihah, his prayer would not be valid, because al-Faatihah refers to the basic needs that people cannot do without.\u201d (Majmu\u2019 al-Fatawa, 17/131)\n\u00a0And he said:\n\u201cThe people need the commands, prohibitions and stories that are in the Quran, even though Tawhid is greater than that. Man needs to know what he is enjoined to do and what he is forbidden to do; he needs to know what is enjoined upon him and the stories and promises and rewards. These cannot be replaced by anything else, and Tawhid cannot be replaced by these. The stories cannot take the place of the commands and prohibitions, and the commands and prohibitions cannot take the place of the stories. Rather everything that was sent down by Allah is beneficial and people need it.\n\u00a0If a person recites Qul Huwallahu Ahad, he earns a reward equivalent to the reward of one-third of the Quran, but that does not mean that the reward is of the same kind as that earned by reading the rest of the Quran. Rather he may need the kind of reward that comes from reading the commands and prohibitions and stories, so Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad cannot take the place of all that.\u201d \u00a0\nAnd he said:\n\u201cThe knowledge that is to be gained by reading the rest of the Quran cannot be gained by reciting this surah only. So whoever reads the whole Quran is better than one who simply recites this surah three times in the sense that he earns different kinds of reward, even though the one who recites Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad earns a reward equivalent to that reward, but it is of one type and does not include all the types that a person needs. This is like a man who has three thousand dinars and another who has food, clothing, accommodation and money equivalent to three thousand dinars.\u00a0 The latter has that which will benefit him in all his affairs, whereas the former needs what the latter has, even though what he has is equivalent in value. Similarly, if he has the finest food, equivalent to three thousand dinars in value, he still needs clothing and accommodation, and weapons and tools that will ward off harm from him, and the like, which cannot be done with food alone.\u201d (Majmu\u2019 al-Fatawa, 17/137-139)\n\u00a0And Allah knows best."

        "question": "What is meant by reciting Qur\u2019aan in a melodious voice",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In the saheeh Sunnah it is encouraged to recite the Qur\u2019aan in a melodious voice, i.e., making the voice beautiful when reciting it. It does not mean that one should recite it as if singing, rather what is meant is that one should make the voice beautiful when reciting. For example the saheeh hadeeth says: \u201cAllaah never listens to anything as He listens to a Prophet with a beautiful voice reciting the Qur\u2019aan out loud\u201d and \u201cHe is not one of us who does not recite Qur\u2019aan in a melodious voice when reciting it out loud.\u201d What this means is making the voice beautiful, as stated above.\u00a0\nThe meaning of the hadeeth quoted above refers to listening in a manner that is befitting to Allaah and it is not like the attributes of His creation, as is the case with all His other attributes. It may be said of His listening that it is like His other attributes, that it is in a manner that is befitting to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and there is nothing like unto Him, may He be glorified and exalted. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThere is nothing like Him, and He is the All\u2011Hearer, the All\u2011Seer\u201d [al-Shoora 42:11]. Reciting in a melodious tone means reciting out loud and making the voice beautiful and with proper focus, so that the heart is moved, because the aim is to stir the heart with this Qur\u2019aan, so that people will fear Allaah and so that they will find peace and benefit from it. An example of this is the story of Abu Moosa al-Ash\u2019ari (may Allaah be pleased with him), when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by him as he was reciting Qur\u2019aan, and he started listening to him and said: \u201cYou have been given a beautiful voice like the beautiful voices of the family of Dawood.\u201d When Abu Moosa came, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him about that and Abu Moosa said: If I had known, O Messenger of Allaah, that you were listening, I would have made it very beautiful indeed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not denounce him for that, which indicates that making the voice beautiful and being careful in reciting is something that is required, so that both the reader and the listener will focus properly and will both benefit.

He said: No, it should be written as it was written initially. \u00a0\nThis was narrated by Abu \u2018Amr al-Daani in al-Muqni\u2019, then he said: None of the scholars of the ummah disagreed with that.\u00a0\nImam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is haraam to differ from the script of the Mus-haf of \u2018Uthmaan in ya\u2019, waw, alif or any other letter.\u00a0\nAl-Bayhaqi said in Shu\u2019ab al-Eeeman: Whoever writes a Mus-haf should adhere to the letters as they are written in these Mus-hafs and not write them differently or change anything that they wrote, for they had more knowledge and were more sincere in heart and in speech, and were more trustworthy than us, so we should not think that we know better than them.\u00a0 \u00a0\nAnd he narrated that Zayd said: Recitation should be done in accordance with the Sunnah. Sulaymaan ibn Dawood al-Haashimi said: This means, do not differ from the people, rather follow the Sunnah.\u00a0\nHe said: I heard something similar in meaning from Abu \u2018Ubayd concerning that, and you see that the reciters never paid any attention to the way the Arabic language is written if that differs from the script of the Mus-haf and adhering to the script of the Mus-haf is one of the established ways that no one has the right to differ from. End quote.\u00a0\nSee: al-Burhaan fi \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019aan by al-Zarkashi (1/379); al-Itqaan by al-Suyooti (4/146).\u00a0\nAl-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Itqaan: They are unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to follow the script of the \u2018Uthmaani Mus-hafs in [rules of tajweed].

They buried Mus-hafs and they also burned them, when the Sahaabah \n    united the people upon a single Mus-haf, which was the Mus-haf of \u2018Uthmaan \n    (may Allaah be pleased with him), and they burned all other Mus-hafs.\u00a0\n\n    If a Mus-haf has reached a state where it cannot be benefited \n    from because it has become worn out, then it should either be buried in a \n    pure place, or be burned.

        "question": "Saying takbeer from Soorat al-Duha to Soorat al-Naas",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    The scholars differed concerning the ruling on saying takbeer \n    after every soorah from Soorat al-Duha to al-Naas. Imam Ahmad regarded it as \n    mustahabb but the other imams differed with him. There is another report \n    from Imam Ahmad which is in accordance with the view of the majority. The \n    correct view is that it is not prescribed to say takbeer, and this is not \n    proven in any marfoo\u2019 hadeeth from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him). There is also no saheeh report about this takbeer from \n    any of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), rather it was proven \n    from some of the qurraa\u2019 (reciters) of the people of Makkah.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that \u2018Ikrimah ibn Sulaymaan said: I recited \n    to Ismaa\u2019eel ibn \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Constantine, and when I reached Wa\u2019l-duha \n    (i.e., Soorat al-Duha), he said to me: Say takbeer, say takbeer at the end \n    of every soorah until you complete (the Qur\u2019aan). \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Katheer \n    told him that he recited to Mujaahid and he told him to do that, and \n    Mujaahid told him that Ibn \u2018Abbaas had told him to do that, and Ibn \u2018Abbaas \n    told him that Ubayy ibn Ka\u2019b told him to do that, and Ubayy ibn Ka\u2019b told \n    him that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told \n    him to do that. \u00a0\n\n    Narrated by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak (3/304).\u00a0\n\n    This hadeeth is da\u2019eef (weak). Its isnaad includes Ahmad ibn \n    Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Bazzah al-Muqri\u2019. Abu Haatim said: His \n    hadeeth is da\u2019eef (weak) and I will not narrate from him. Al-\u2018Aqeeli said: \n    His hadeeth is munkar (odd). Al-Dhahabi said: This is a ghareeb (strange) \n    hadeeth, and it is one of the hadeeth of al-Bazzi that were regarded as \n    munkar. Abu Haatim said: This is munkar. And he said: Al-Haakim regarded his \n    hadeeth about takbeer as saheeh, but it is munkar.\u00a0\n\n    See: al-Du\u2019afa\u2019 by al-\u2018Aqeeli (1/127); and Mizaan \n    al-I\u2019tidaal (1/144, 145) and Siyar A\u2019laam al-Nubala\u2019 (12/51), \n    both by Imam al-Dhahabi.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    Ahmad regarded it is mustahabb to say takbeer from the \n    beginning of Soorat al-Duha until the end of the Qur\u2019aan. This was mentioned \n    by Ibn Tameem and others, and this is the recitation of the people of \n    Makkah, which al-Bazzi took from Ibn Katheer, and Ibn Katheer took it from \n    Mujaahid, and Mujaahid took it from Ibn \u2018Abbaas, and Ibn \u2018Abbaas took it \n    from Ubayy ibn Ka\u2019b, and Ubayy ibn Ka\u2019b took it from the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him). A number of them narrated that, \n    including al-Baghawi in his Tafseer, and the reason for that is that \n    the Wahy (revelation) ceased. \u00a0\n\n    This is a ghareeb hadeeth, reported by Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn \n    \u2018Abd-Allaah al-Bazzi, who is sound with regard to recitation but da\u2019eef \n    (weak) with regard to hadeeth.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Haatim al-Raazi said: This is a munkar hadeeth.\u00a0\n\n    It was also narrated from him \u2013 i.e., Imam Ahmad \u2013 that there \n    should be no takbeer, as is the view of all reciters. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Al-Adaab al-Shar\u2019iyyah (2/295, \n    296).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was asked about a group who gathered to read the entire Qur\u2019aan (khatmah) \n    and they were reading to \u2018Aasim and Abu \u2018Amr. When they reached Soorat \n    al-Duha, they did not say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah or Allaahu akbar, until they \n    reached the end of the Qur\u2019aan. Is what they did better or not? Is the \n    hadeeth which is narrated about saying tahleel and takbeer saheeh and \n    mutawaatir, or not?\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\u00a0\nYes, if they recited in accordance with \n    a recitation other than that of Ibn Katheer, their not doing that is better, \n    and is in fact what is prescribed and is Sunnah. These imams of recitation \n    did not say takbeer either at the beginning of the soorahs or at the ends. \n    If it is acceptable to say that Ibn Katheer narrated the takbeer from the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it is \n    acceptable for others to say that these people narrated the omission of that \n    from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) too. It is not possible that the recitation of the majority that was \n    narrated by more people than the recitation of Ibn Katheer omitted something \n    enjoined by the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him), because those who narrated mutawaatir reports could not have \n    concealed something for which there was good reason to narrate it. The one \n    who accepts that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) told the majority of reciters to add an extra takbeer then they \n    disobeyed the command of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) and failed to do what he had commanded them to do, \n    deserves to be punished severely as a deterrent to him and others like him.\u00a0\n    \n    With regard to the takbeer, the one who says that it is part \n    of the Qur\u2019aan has gone astray according to scholarly consensus and must be \n    asked to repent; if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he should be \n    executed. How could the one who does not recite it be denounced for not \n    reciting it? The one who regard a person who does not say this takbeer as an \n    innovator or one who goes against the Sunnah or a sinner, is closer to kufr \n    than Islam and should be punished; indeed if he insists on that after having \n    the proof explained to him, then he should be executed.\u00a0\n\n    If we assume [?] that the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) told some of those who recited it to say takbeer, \n    then at most this indicates that it is permissible or mustahabb. If it were \n    obligatory, the majority of reciters would not have neglected it and the \n    imams of the Muslims would not have agreed that it is not obligatory. But \n    none of the imams narrated that the takbeer is obligatory, rather the most \n    that anyone who reads according to the recitation of Ibn Katheer can say is \n    that it is mustahabb. This is unlike the Basmalah, recitation of which is \n    obligatory according to those who regard it as part of the Qur\u2019aan, but \n    despite that the reciters allow not reciting it if one does not want to use \n    it as a break between one soorah and another. So how could it not be allowed \n    to omit the takbeer, which is not part of the Qur\u2019aan?\u00a0\u00a0 End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (13/417-419)\u00a0\n\n    And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\n    The takbeer that is narrated from Ibn Katheer is not narrated \n    with an isnad from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him), and no one attributed it to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) except al-Bazzi, who thus went against all those who \n    narrated it, as they only narrated it as something optional that was done by \n    some of those who came after the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him), and he was the only one who attributed it to the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

Is that \n    permissible, and is there any evidence for it?\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\u00a0\n\n    This is contrary to what the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased \n    with them) did, who separated one soorah from another by saying Bismillaah \n    il-Rahmaan il-Raheem, and it is contrary to the scholarly view that the \n    soorahs of the Qur\u2019aan should not be separated by takbeer throughout the \n    Qur\u2019aan.\u00a0\n\n    At the very most, there are some reciters who regard it as \n    mustahabb for a person to say takbeer when he finishes every soorah from \n    al-Duha to the end of the Qur\u2019aan, along with the Basmalah between every two \n    soorahs. But the correct view is that this is not Sunnah, because that was \n    not narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him). Based on this, what is prescribed is to separate one soorah from \n    another by saying the Basmalah,\u00a0 Bismillaah il-Rahmaan il-Raheem, \n    except in the case of Soorat Baraa\u2019ah (al-Tawbah), as there is no Basmalah \n    between al-Anfaal and it.

This was stated clearly by many \n    scholars of reports, although some of the most famous reciters, such as Ibn \n    Mujaahid in his book al-Sab\u2019ah, did not narrate the takbeer, and \n    neither did Abu\u2019l-Qaasim al-Hudhali in his book al-Kaamil.

That is so as to protect the Book of \n    Allaah and to keep out of it anything that is not part of it, whether it is \n    thought to be Sunnah or not. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds. \n    End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    Many reasons for this takbeer have been mentioned, the most \n    well known of which is that the Revelation to the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) ceased for a while, and when it resumed \n    after that, the first thing that was revealed was Soorat al-Duha, in which \n    it says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cYour Lord (O Muhammad\n    \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) has neither forsaken \n    you nor hates you\u201d [al-Duha 93:3], and he said takbeer in joy at that. \n    Even if this is saheeh, it does not indicate that it is mustahabb to say \n    takbeer as suggested by some scholars of recitation, for several reasons:\u00a0\n\n    1.It does not indicate that \n    takbeer is to be said after every recitation of the soorah.\n\n    2.It does not indicate that \n    takbeer is to be said until Soorat al-Naas.\n\n    3.The takbeer was said only once, \n    because of the Revelation resuming after it had ceased for a while.\n\n    4.The other soorahs do not have \n    the same content as Soorat al-Duha.\n\n    Moreover, this report does not have any saheeh isnaad, or \n    even any da\u2019eef (weak) one.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n    Imam Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\n\n    With regard to saying takbeer after Soorat al-Duha, the \n    reciters said that when the revelation was late in coming to the Messenger \n    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and that went on \n    for a while, then the angel came to him and brought the words \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cBy the forenoon (after sunrise). By the \n    night when it darkens (and stands still)\u201d [al-Duha 93:1-2], he said \n    takbeer out of joy and happiness.\u00a0\n\n    But this was not narrated with any isnaad that can be judged \n    to be saheeh or da\u2019eef.

        "question": "Repetition in the Qur\u2019aan \u2013 types and benefits",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There follows a brief discussion on the repetitions in the Qur\u2019aan, which suits the nature of our site. You can examine the subject further by looking at the references we refer to, or by studying the books of \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019aan in general.\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Definition of repetition\u00a0\nIbn al-Manzoor said:\u00a0\nThe word takraar (translated here as repetition) is derived from the word al-karr, which means going back to a thing. \u00a0\nLisaan al-\u2018Arab (5/135).\u00a0\nIn sharee\u2019ah terminology, takraar means repeating a word or phrase more than once for various reasons, such as emphasis, exaggeration, reinforcement and so on.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 Repetition is a kind of eloquence\u00a0\nSome of those who do not have any understanding of the Arabic language criticized the repetition that appears in the Qur\u2019aan, and thought that this is not eloquent. This stems from their ignorance. The repetition that appears in the Qur\u2019aan is not the kind of worthless repetition that is of no value \u2013 as we shall see in detail below \u2013 and which appears in the speech of one who does not speak the language well or express himself well.\u00a0\nAl-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nRepetition is more eloquent than merely emphasizing and it is reflective of good style, contrary to what some people think.\u00a0\nAl-Itqaan fi \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019aan (3/280), Mu\u2019sasat al-Nada\u2019 edition.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Kinds of repetition\u00a0\nThe scholars have divided the repetition in the Qur\u2019aan into two kinds:\u00a0\n(i) Repetition of words and meanings\u00a0\nThis is where words are repeated with no difference in the meaning. There are two types, connected and disconnected.\u00a0\nThe connected type appears in various ways, either by repeating the words in the same verse, as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cFar, very far is that which you are promised!\u201d\n[al-Mu\u2019minoon 23:36]\nor at the end of a verse and at the beginning of the following verse, such as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd amongst them will be passed round vessels of silver and cups of crystal \u2014\n16.\u00a0Crystal\u2011clear, made of silver. They will determine the measure thereof (according to their wishes)\u201d\n[al-Insaan 76:15,16]\nor at the end of a verse, such as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cNay! When the earth is ground to powder [kallaa idha dukkat il-ardu dakkan dakka]\u201d\n[al-Fajr 89:21]\nor when a verse is repeated straight after another verse, such as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201c5.\u00a0Verily, along with every hardship is relief,\n6.\u00a0Verily, along with every hardship is relief\u201d\n[al-Sharh 94:5,6]\nAs for that which is disconnected, it appears in two forms, either repeated in the same soorah, or repeated throughout the Qur\u2019aan.\u00a0\nExamples of repetition in the same soorah include the phrase \u201cAnd verily, your Lord, He is truly, the All\u2011Mighty, the Most Merciful\u201d which is repeated 8 times in Soorat al-Shu\u2019ara\u2019 and \u201cWoe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!\u201d which is repeated 10 times in Soorat al-Mursalaat, and \u201cThen which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?\u201d which is repeated 31 times in Soorat al-Rahmaan.\u00a0 \u00a0\nExamples of phrases which are repeated throughout the Qur\u2019aan include the phrase \u201cThey say: \u2018When will this promise (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) come to pass if you are telling the truth?\u2019\u201d which appears six times, in Yoonus 10:48, al-Anbiya\u2019 21:38, al-Naml 27:71, Saba\u2019 34:29, Yaa-Seen 36:48 and al-Mulk 67:25. And the phrase \u201cO Prophet (Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645)! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe against them; their abode will be Hell, and worst indeed is that destination\u201d appears twice, in al-Tawbah 9:73 and al-Tahreem 66:9. \u00a0\n(ii) Repetition of meaning but not words\u00a0\nSuch as the stories of the Prophets with their peoples, and mention of Paradise and its people and Hell and its horrors.\u00a0\n4 \u2013 Benefits of repetition\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThere is no pointless repetition in the Qur\u2019aan, rather there are benefits in every repetition.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa (14/408)\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the repetition of the story of Moosa and his people:\n\u00a0Allaah mentions this story in several places in the Qur'aan, and in every place He highlights a different idea and conclusion, just as Allaah, His Messenger and His Book are called by different names, each name indicating a meaning that is not indicated by another name. There is no repetition in that, rather it is a kind of diversity, like the names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as he is called Muhammad, Ahmad, al-Haashir, al-\u2018Aaqib, al-Muqaffa, the Prophet of Mercy, the Prophet of Repentance, and each name points to a meaning that is not indicated by any other name; the person is the same but the attributes are numerous.\u00a0\nThe same applies to the Qur\u2019aan, which is also called Furqaan (criterion), Bayaan (a plain statement), Huda (guidance), Basaa\u2019ir (clear evidence), Shifa\u2019 (healing), Noor (light) and Rahmah (mercy). Each name points to a meaning that is not indicated by other names.\u00a0\nThe same applies to the names of the Lord, as He is called: al-Malik (the Sovereign), al-Quddoos (the Holy), al-Salaam (the One Free from all defects), al-Mu\u2019min (the Guardian of faith), al-Muhaymin (the Watcher over His creatures), al-\u2018Azeez (the Almighty), al-Jabbaar (the compeller), al-Mutakabbir (the Majestic), al-Khaaliq (the Creator), al-Baari\u2019 (the Inventor of all things), and al-Musawwir (the Bestower of forms). Each name points to a meaning that is not indicated by another name. The Essence is One but the attributes are numerous. \u00a0\nThe same applies to sentences that are complete in meaning. The story is told in one way that highlights one point, then it is told in another way which highlights a different point. The story is the same story, but its details are numerous, and every sentence conveys a meaning that is not indicated by other sentences.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 al-Fataawa 919/167, 168).\u00a0\nAl-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u00a0\nThere are a number of reasons for repetition:\u00a0\nThis includes confirmation. It is said that if words are repeated the meaning is confirmed. Allaah has indicated the reason why He repeats stories and reminders in the Qur\u2019aan, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cand have explained therein in detail the warnings, in order that they may fear Allaah, or that it may cause them to have a lesson from it\u201d\n[Ta-Ha 20:113]\nIt also includes emphasis.\u00a0\nIt also includes highlighting a point so that the words will be accepted, such as the verse: \u00a0\n\u201cAnd the man who believed said: \u2018O my people! Follow me, I will guide you to the way of right conduct [i.e. guide you to Allaah\u2019s religion of Islamic Monotheism with which Moosa (Moses) has been sent].\n39.\u00a0\u2018O my people! Truly, this life of the world is nothing but a (quick passing) enjoyment\u2019\u201d\n[Ghaafir 40:38].\nIn the passage the call is repeated for this reason.\u00a0\nAnother example is if the speech is lengthy and there is the fear that what was said at the beginning may be forgotten, so it is repeated a second time to keep the idea fresh. For example, in the verses:\u00a0\n\u201cThen, verily, your Lord __ for those who do evil (commit sins and are disobedient to Allaah) in ignorance and afterward repent and do righteous deeds, verily, your Lord thereafter, (to such) is Oft\u2011Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d\n[al-Nahl 16:119]\u00a0\n\u201cThen, verily, your Lord _for those who emigrated after they had been put to trials and thereafter strove hard and fought (for the Cause of Allaah) and were patient, verily, your Lord afterward\u201d\n[al-Nahl 16:110]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd when there came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur\u2019aan) from Allaah confirming what is with them [the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], although aforetime they had invoked Allaah (for coming of Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved, then when there came to them that which they had recognised, they disbelieved in it\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:89]\n\u201cThink not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,\u2014 think not you that they are rescued from the torment\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:188]\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, I saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon \u2014 I saw them\u201d\n[Yoosuf 12:4]\nIt may also be done for emphasis, as in the verses:\u00a0\n\u201cThe Inevitable (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)!\n2.\u00a0What is the Inevitable?\u201d\n[al-Haaqqah 69:1]\u00a0\n\u201cAl\u2011Qaari\u2018ah (the striking Hour, i.e. the Day of Resurrection).\n2.\u00a0What is the striking (Hour)?\u201d\n[al-Qaari\u2019ah 101:1]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd those on the Right Hand \u2014how (fortunate) will be those on the Right Hand?\u201d\n[al-Waaqi\u2019ah 56:27]\nal-Itqaan fi \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019aan (3/281, 282).\u00a0\n5 \u2013 Benefits of repeating some stories and verses\u00a0\n1 \u2013 Abu\u2019l-Faraj Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIf it is said: What is the point of repeating the verse \u201cThen which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?\u201d [in Soorat al-Rahmaan]?\u00a0\nThe answer is: This repetition is in order to confirm the blessing and emphasize the remembrance thereof. Ibn Qutaybah said: It is the habit of the Arabs to repeat things for emphasis and to ensure that they are understood, although they may also speak briefly so as not to tire the listener, because if a speaker addresses a point from different angles, that is better than him approaching it from just one angle, such as if someone said:\u00a0 By Allaah, I will not do it, and by Allaah, I will not do it \u2013 because he wanted to emphasize his point and put an end to any hope that he could do it. And if he wanted to be brief he may say:\u00a0 By Allaah I shall do it, but omitting the word \u2018not\u2019 for the sake of brevity. Similarly, one who is in a hurry may say, Hurry up, hurry up! And it may be said to the archer: Shoot, shoot!\u00a0\nIbn Qutaybah said: When Allaah listed His blessings in this soorah, and reminded His slaves of His signs, and drew attention to His power, He repeated this phrase between each two blessings, so that they would appreciate the blessings and recognize them, such as when you say to a man: Didn\u2019t I give you accommodation when you were homeless \u2013 can you deny that? Didn\u2019t I take you for Hajj when you had never been \u2013 can you deny that? \u00a0\nZaad al-Maseer (5/461).\u00a0\n2 \u2013 al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nAs for the way in which the repetition is done \u2013 i.e., \u201cSay (O Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 to these Mushrikoon and Kaafiroon): \u201cO Al\u2011Kaafiroon (disbelievers)\u201d \u2013 it is said that it is for emphasis to cut off their hopes, as one might say: By Allaah, I will not do it, and by Allaah I will not do it.\u00a0\nMost of the scholars of semantics said: The Qur\u2019aan was revealed in the language of the Arabs, and it is their way to repeat things for emphasis and to ensure that they are understood, and also to speak briefly so as not to tire the listener, because when the speaker uses different phrases in his speech, it is better than limiting himself to one phrase. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThen which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?\u201d and \u201cNay, they will come to know! Nay, again, they will come to know!\u201d [al-Naba\u2019 78:4, 5] and \u201c5.\u00a0Verily, along with every hardship is relief,6.\u00a0Verily, along with every hardship is relief\u201d [al-Sharh 94:5,6]. In all cases, the aim is emphasis.\u00a0\nTafseer al-Qurtubi (20/226).\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Mus-haf al-Tajweed with coloured letters",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.After examining the Mus-haf al-Tajweed with coloured letters, it is clear that there is nothing wrong with using these colours, rather it makes it easier to learn tajweed, for those who are not able to learn directly from experts.\u00a0\nThe Dar al-Ma\u2019rifah (publisher\u2019s) website has published a copy of the approval of the Islamic Research Council in al-Azhar of this Mus-haf in which different colours are used; it also cites the approval of the senior scholar of Qur\u2019aan in Syria, Shaykh Muhammad Kareem Raajih, and the approval of Shaykh Dr. Wahbah al-Zuhayli. This is the text of what it says on the site:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWith regard to this work of ours, the senior scholar of Qur\u2019aan in Syria, Shaykh Muhammad Kareem Raajih stated on 21 Safar 1412 AH that this work \u201cis acceptable and even it is of no benefit then it does not cause any harm, moreover it serves as a reminder and indication of the rules of tajweed, but it does not do away with the importance of learning tajweed directly from the mouths of the shaykhs.\u201d At the same time, Shaykh al-Qaari\u2019 Muhiy al-Deen al-Kurdi stated on 18 Safar 1415 AH that \u201cthose who away from educational circles and elderly people may benefit from this work, because they cannot learn directly.\u201d Professor Wahbat al-Zuhayli, a member of the Islamic Fiqh Council in Jeddah and the President of the Faculty of Islamic Fiqh and Madhhabs at the University of Damascus stated on 18 Muharram 1415AH: \u201cAllaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018And We have indeed made the Qur\u2019aan easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?\u2019 [al-Qamar 54:17]. This clearly indicates that everything that makes it easy to recite Qur\u2019aan, which we are required in Islam to study it, understand its meanings and act in accordance with what it says, is a must according to sharee\u2019ah for those who study knowledge, fiqh and the tafseer of the Book of Allaah. As reciting the Qur\u2019aan in the manner that is known in the science of tajweed is obligatory, then every means that makes it easy for the reader to learn the rulings on tajweed and follow them when reciting is something that is permissible according to sharee\u2019ah, whether it is letters printed in one colour or several colours. The good reading is that which imprints the letters in the mind, and this printing of the Holy Qur\u2019aan in different colours makes it easy to read the Qur\u2019aan, and establishes the rulings in the mind, so it is a contemporary means that is to be encouraged and it does not contradict the way in which Qur\u2019aan was traditionally transmitted to us and the traditional way of writing it.\u00a0 May Allaah help Dar al-Ma\u2019rifah with this blessed work. End quote.\u00a0\nThere is no way that these colours can be ruled to be an innovation, because the scholars of Qur\u2019aan at the time of the Taabi\u2019een introduced dots and vowels in the Mus-haf and wrote the dots and vowels in red. \u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe Sahaabah did not write dots and vowels in the Mus-hafs because they were Arabs who did not make mistakes in pronouncing the words, so they did not need the dots. A single word could be read in two ways, with a ya\u2019 or a ta\u2019, such as ya\u2019maloon (\u064a\u0639\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0646) and ta\u2019maloon (\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0644\u0648\u0646), which they would read in only one way because they knew that the other was not correct. \u00a0\nBut at the time of the Taabi\u2019een, when it become common for people to mispronounce words, some of the Taabi\u2019een added vowels and dots to the Mus-haf, and they wrote them in red. They wrote the fathah as a red dot above the letter, and the kasrah as a red dot below the letter, and the dammah as a red dot before the letter. Then they expanded the red dots and they denoted the shaddah by writing \u201cshadd\u201d and the maddah by writing \u201cmadd\u201d. They made the sign for the hamzah look like the letter \u2018ayn, because the hamzah is the sister of the \u2018ayn. Then they abbreviated them and made the sign for the shaddah look like the main part of the letter seen, and the sign for the maddah an abbreviated sign, as those who keep records may abbreviate numbers etc, and as the scholars of hadeeth abbreviated words such as akhbarana (he informed us) and haddathana (he narrated to us) by writing the first and last part of the word in the forms ana (\u0623\u0646\u0627) \u00a0and thana(\u062b\u0646\u0627) . \u00a0\nThe scholars disputed as to whether it was makrooh or not to add vowels and dots to the Mus-haf and there are two well known views, both of which were narrated from Ahmad, but there was no dispute concerning the fact that if there are vowels and dots in a Mus-haf, they must be respected just as the letters are respected. End quote from Majmoo\u2019 Fataawa Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (12/101).\u00a0\nShaykh Dr. \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Muhammad al-Mutlaq (may Allaah preserve him) said: The following things were not originally part of the \u2018Uthmaani text:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 The dots by means of which letters are distinguished, for they were added to the Arabic letters at the time of the Taabi\u2019een. Before that the letters were written without dots. Abu \u2018Amr \u2018Uthmaan ibn Sa\u2019eed al-Daani (d. 444 AH) said: Chapter on the first ones among the Taabi\u2019een to add dots to the Mus-hafs, and those who regarded it as makrooh and those among the scholars who granted concessions allowing that: the reports we have vary as to who was the first to add dots to the Mus-haf among the Taabi\u2019een, but we think that the first one who did that was Abu\u2019l-Aswad al-Du\u2019ali.\u00a0\nWe narrated that Ibn Sireen had a Mus-haf to which dots had been added by Yahya ibn Ya\u2019mar, and that Yahya was the first one to add dots to it. [Kitaab al-Naqd, printed alongside al-Maqna\u2019 fi Ma\u2019rifat Arsoom Masaahif Ahl al-Amsaar, p. 129]. \u00a0\n2 \u2013 Vowels and tanween \u2013 the first one to add them was Abu\u2019l-Aswad al-Du\u2019ali, and they were dots. That was because he wanted to write Arabic in such a way that the people would correct the mistakes that they had started to make in their speech, as that had become common among the elite and the common folk. So he brought someone to hold the Mus-haf, and he brought ink of a different colour, and he said to the one who was holding the Mus-haf for him: If I open my mouth then put the dot above the letter, and if I stretch my mouth then put the dot beneath the letter, if I purse my lips then put the dot before the letter, and if I follow these letters with ghunnah (i.e., tanween), then put two dots, until I reach the end of the Mus-haf. And it was said that the first one who did that was Nasr ibn \u2018Aasim al-Laythi. [Kitaab al-Naqd, printed alongside al-Maqna\u2019 fi Ma\u2019rifat Arsoom Masaahif Ahl al-Amsaar, p. 129]. \u00a0\nThen al-Khaleel ibn Ahmad developed that when he invented vowel signs derived from the letters. [al-Itqaan fi \u2018Uloom al-Qur\u2019aan, p. 219].\u00a0\n3 \u2013 Hamzah, shaddah, rawm and ishmaam. The first one who introduced these was al-Khaleel ibn Ahmad al-Faraaheedi.\u00a0\n4 \u2013 Signs of tajweed and signs of al-wasl (joining) and al-waqf (pausing). These did not exist in the \u2018Uthmaani text, rather they were developed later on in \u2018ilm al-tajweed.

They quoted as evidence the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSo, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy\u201d\u00a0[al-A\u2019raaf 7:204]\nIt says in al-Mawsoo\u2019ah al-Fiqhiyyah (4/86):\u00a0\nListening to recitation of Quran when it is recited outside of prayer is obligatory if there is no legitimate shar\u2019i excuse for not listening.\u00a0\nThe Hanafis differed with regard to this obligation: is it an individual obligation or a communal obligation?\u00a0\nIbn \u2018Aabideen said: The basic principle is that listening to Quran is a communal obligation, because it is establishing its right to be listened to and not ignored, which is achieved by some listening attentively, as is the case with returning salaams (i.e., it is sufficient for some members of a group to return the greeting).\u00a0\nAl-Hamawi narrated that his teacher, the prominent judge Yahya who is better known as Minqaarizaadah, said that listening to the Quran is an individual obligation.\u00a0\nYes, the verse in Soorat al-A\u2019raaf, \u201cSo, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy\u201d was revealed to abrogate the permission to speak during prayer, but what counts is the general meaning of the words, not the specific reason for its revelation, and the general meaning includes recitation of Quran both during prayer and otherwise. End quote.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 The second view is that it is mustahabb and recommended. They interpreted the verse in Soorat al-A\u2019raaf as referring to recitation in prayer only. Outside of prayer it is recommended and mustahabb. This is the view of the majority of scholars. \u00a0\nIbn Katheer says in Tafseer al-Quran il-\u2018Azeem (2/372):\u00a0\n\u2018Ali ibn Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn \u2018Abbaas concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSo, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy\u201d\n[al-A\u2019raaf 7:204]:\u00a0\ni.e., in the obligatory prayer. Something similar was narrated from \u2018Abd-Allah ibn al-Mughaffal. Ibn Jareer said: Humayd ibn Mas\u2019adah told us, Bishr ibn al-Mufaddal told us, al-Jareeri told us, that Talhah ibn \u2018Ubayd-Allah ibn Kurayz said: I saw \u2018Ubayd ibn \u2018Umayr and \u2018Ata\u2019 ibn Abi Rabaah talking whilst the storyteller was speaking, and I said: Why don\u2019t you listen to the reminder, lest you be subject to the warning? They looked at me, then they went back to their conversation. I repeated it, and they looked at me, then they went back to their conversation. I said it a third time and they looked at me and said: That is only in prayer: \u201cSo, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy\u201d\n[al-A\u2019raaf 7:204]. \u00a0\nThis is how it was narrated by more than one person from Mujaahid. \u2018Abd al-Razzaaq narrated from al-Thawri from Layth that Mujaahid said: There is nothing wrong with speaking if a man recites Quran other than in prayer.\u00a0\nSomething similar was stated by Sa\u2019eed ibn Jubayr, al-Dahhaak, Ibraheem al-Nakha\u2019i, Qataadah, al-Sha\u2019bi, al-Saddi and \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam, that what is meant (in the verse) is in prayer.\u00a0\nThis was the view favoured by Ibn Jareer, that what is meant is listening attentively in prayer and during the khutbah, as it says in the ahaadeeth which enjoin listening attentively behind the imam and during the khutbah. End quote.\u00a0\nIt seems that this view is the correct one, because in order for a thing to be obligatory, clear evidence is required, otherwise obliging the people to adhere to that will clause undue hardship without any evidence for it.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked, as it says in Liqaa\u2019aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (no. 197/ question no. 26):\u00a0\nThere was a group of people travelling by car, and one of them put on a tape of Quran; should they all listen to this tape, and is anyone who speaks whilst the tape is playing sinning thereby?\u00a0\nThe answer was:\u00a0\nImam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning this verse: This applies to prayer. He said: They were unanimously agreed that this applies to prayer. Based on this, if I am next to a person who is reciting Quran out loud, but I am reciting tasbeeh and saying laa ilaaha ill-Allah, then I do not have to listen to him, rather that applies to prayer only.\u00a0\nBut I say to the brother who put the tape on: Do not put it on when people are not paying attention, because the least that may said about that is that it is like those of whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd those who disbelieve say: \u2018Listen not to this Quran, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome\u2019\u201d [Fussilat 41:26]. If you see that your brothers do not want to listen, and they are busy talking to one another, then do not put the tape on. If you want to listen to it, then there are small headphones that you can put in your ears, and you can listen to it by yourself. End quote.\u00a0\nIt says in al-Muntaqa fi Fataawa al-Fawzaan (3/question no. 437):\u00a0\nSometimes I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, to prepare food for my husband, and I want to make good use of my time, so I listen to the Holy Quran either on the radio or on tapes. Is this action of mine correct or should I not do that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSo, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy\u201d[al-A\u2019raaf 7:204]?\u00a0\nThe answer is: There is nothing wrong with listening to the Holy Quran on the radio or on tapes when one is working, and that does not go against the words \u201cSo, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent\u201d, because listening attentively is required as much as one is able to do, and the one who puts on the tape should listen attentively to the Quran as much as he can. End quote.\u00a0\nFavouring the view that it is mustahabb does not mean that one may be careless and deliberately fail to listen attentively to the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, when they are recited. Keenness to listen attentively should be the basic principle that is established in the life of the Muslim, and he should not do otherwise except in the case of work or need.\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi said in al-Tabyaan fi Adaab Hamalat al-Quran (92):\u00a0\nSomething that attention must be paid to and which should be affirmed is respecting the Quran in cases where some of the negligent may be heedless about it in gatherings where Quran is recited, such as not laughing, chatting or talking during the recitation, except in cases of necessity; obeying the words of Allah, \u201cSo, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy\u201d; and following the example that was narrated from Ibn Abi Dawood from Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), that when the Quran was recited he would not talk until the recitation ended. End quote.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Liqaa\u2019aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (no. 146, question no. 9): It is not good manners to ignore the Book of Allah when it is being recited, even if it is on a tape.\u201d End quote.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on seeking refuge with Allaah before reciting al-Faatihah in the prayer",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nIt is proven \n    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to \n    seek refuge with Allaah before reciting al-Faatihah in the prayer. Narrated \n    by Abu Dawood (775) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThe scholars \n    differed as to the ruling on seeking refuge with Allaah before reciting \n    al-Faatihah in the prayer. Some of them were of the view that it is \n    obligatory. This is the view of \u2018Ata\u2019, al-Thawri, al-Awzaa\u2019i and Dawood, as \n    was narrated by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla (3/247-248), and it was the \n    view favoured by him. It was also narrated from Ahmad and was favoured by \n    Ibn Battah, as it says in al-Insaaf (2/119). Among later scholars \n    this view was favoured by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on them \n    all). \u00a0\nOthers were \n    of the view that it is only mustahabb and is not obligatory. This is the \n    view of the majority of scholars among the Sahaabah and Taabi\u2019een and of the \n    Imams Abu Haneefah and al-Shaafa\u2019i, and Ahmad according to the well known \n    view of his madhhab.\u00a0\nSee: \n    Tabyeen al-Haqaa\u2019iq (1/107); al-Majmoo\u2019 (3/280-282), al-Mughni \n    (1/283); al-Fataawa al-Kubra by Ibn Taymiyah (5/332).\u00a0\nThose who \n    say that it is obligatory quoted as evidence the verse in which Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSo when \n    you want to recite the Qur\u2019aan, seek refuge with Allaah from Shaytaan \n    (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one)\u201d\n[al-Nahl \n    16:98]\nThey said: \n    In this verse there is the command to seek refuge with Allaah, and the basic \n    principle is that a command means that something is obligatory, so long as \n    there is no other evidence to indicate that what is meant in the command is \n    mustahabb.\u00a0\nIbn Hazm \n    said in al-Muhalla (2/279):\u00a0\nWith regard \n    to the view of Abu Haneefah and al-Shaafa\u2019i, that seeking refuge with Allaah \n    is not obligatory, this is wrong, because Allaah, may He be exalted, says:\n    \u201cSo when you want to recite the Qur\u2019aan, seek refuge with Allaah from \n    Shaytaan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one)\u201d. When Allaah commands \n    something, it is wrong for anyone to say without any evidence from the \n    Qur\u2019aan or Sunnah that this is not obligatory, especially His command to \n    pray for Him to protect us from the tricks of the shaytaan.\u00a0 So this command \n    is definitely obligatory, because avoiding the shaytaan and fleeing from him \n    and asking for protection against him are things that no one can dispute are \n    obligatory. Moreover, Allaah has enjoined that upon us when reading Qur\u2019aan. \n    End quote.\u00a0\nThe majority \n    of scholars responded by noting that there is other evidence which indicates \n    that it is mustahabb rather than obligatory. This other evidence is:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 The \n    hadeeth about the man who did not pray properly. The Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught him how to pray and said: \u201cWhen you \n    go to pray, say takbeer, then recite whatever you can of the Qur\u2019aan. Then \n    bow \u2026\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim (397). And he did not tell him to \n    seek refuge with Allaah.\u00a0\nImam \n    al-Shaafa\u2019i said in al-Umm (1/208):\u00a0\nIf he omits \n    it by mistake or out of ignorance or deliberately, he does not have to \n    repeat it or do the prostration of forgetfulness, but I regard it as makrooh \n    to omit it deliberately. If he omits it in the first rak\u2019ah, I prefer for \n    him to say it in some other rak\u2019ah. The only thing that keeps me from \n    telling him to repeat the prayer is the fact that when the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught a man what is sufficient \n    in prayer he said: \u201csay takbeer, then recite\u2026\u201d, and it is not narrated that \n    he told him to seek refuge with Allaah or recite the opening du\u2019aa\u2019. This \n    indicates that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) regarded the opening du\u2019aa\u2019 as something optional, and that \n    seeking refuge with Allaah is something that does not invalidate the prayer \n    if it is omitted. End quote.\u00a0\n2 \u2013It says \n    in al-Mawsoo\u2019ah al-Fiqhiyyah (4/6):\u00a0\nThe majority \n    quoted as evidence that the command means that it is recommended and not \n    obligatory the fact that the salaf were unanimously agreed that it is \n    Sunnah. End quote. \u00a0\nThe scholars \n    of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas also favoured the view that it \n    is mustahabb and not obligatory, as did Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen.\u00a0\nIt says in\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah (6/383):\u00a0\nWhat is the \n    ruling on one who forgets to seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed \n    shaytaan and remembers after finishing the prayer, if he remembers that he \n    did not say A\u2019oodhu Billaahi min al-shaytaan il-rajeem (I seek refuge \n    with Allaah from the accursed shaytaan) whilst he was praying?\u00a0\nThey \n    replied:\u00a0\nSeeing \n    refuge with Allaah is Sunnah, and it does not matter if it is omitted from \n    the prayer whether deliberately or by mistake. End quote.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \n    \u2018Uthaymeen was asked: Should one seek refuge with Allaah in every rak\u2019ah or \n    only in the first rak\u2019ah?\u00a0\nHe replied:\u00a0\nSeeking \n    refuge with Allaah from the accursed shaytaan in prayer is Sunnah.\u00a0\nThe scholars \n    (may Allaah have mercy on them) differed as to whether one should seek \n    refuge with Allaah in every rak\u2019ah or only in the first rak\u2019ah, based on the \n    recitation in prayer \u2013 is it regarded as one recitation or is the recitation \n    in each rak\u2019ah separate?\u00a0\nIt seems to \n    me that the recitation in prayer is one recitation, so one should seek \n    refuge with Allaah in the first rak\u2019ah, unless there happens something that \n    requires seeking refuge with Allaah, such as if there come whispers from the \n    shaytaan (waswaas), because if whispers come from the shaytaan, the \n    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined spitting \n    drily to the left three times and seeking refuge with Allaah from the \n    accursed shaytaan. End quote.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019 \n    Fataawa Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (13/110)\u00a0\nThis view is \n    also favoured in the answer to question no. \n    65847.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah \n    knows best."

        "question": "Is it essential to recite the Quran in sequence for one who wants to complete it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is mustahabb to read Quran a great deal during Ramadaan, because it is the month of the Quran. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThe month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong)\u201d\u00a0[al-Baqarah 2:185].\nJibreel used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) every night in Ramadaan and review the Quran with him. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5) and Muslim (4268).\u00a0\nAl-Bukhaari (4614) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that Jibreel used to review the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) once every year, and he reviewed it with him twice in the year when he died. This indicates that it is mustahabb to complete the Quran and study it in Ramadaan.\n\u00a0Hence the salaf used to read Quran a great deal during Ramadaan, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Qataadah (may Allah have mercy on him) used to complete the Quran every seven nights all the time, and every three nights in Ramadaan, and every two nights during the last ten days of Ramadaan. \u00a0\nIbraaheem al-Nakha\u2019i used to complete the Quran in Ramadaan every three nights, and in the last ten days every two nights.\u00a0\nAl-Aswad (may Allah have mercy on him) used to read the entire Quran every two nights throughout the month. End quote from Majaalis Shahr Ramadaan by Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) p. 65.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThe best is to read the Quran in the order of soorahs as given in the Mus-haf, which is the sequence in which Jibreel reviewed the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at the end of his life. \u00a0\nSee: al-Tahbeer fi \u2018Ilm al-Tafseer by al-Suyooti, p. 637\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Tibyaan:\u00a0\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said: The best is to read it in the order in which it appears in the Mus-haf, so he should read al-Faatihah, then al-Baqarah, then Aal \u2018Imraan, then al-Nisa\u2019, until he ends with Qul a\u2019oodhu bi Rabbi l-naas (Sooratal-Naas), whether he is reciting it in prayer or otherwise. It is also mustahabb, if he recites one soorah, to recite after it the soorah that comes after it. So if he recites Qul a\u2019oodhu bi Rabbi l-naas (Sooratal-Naas) in the first rak\u2019ah, he should recite from al-Baqarah in the second.\u00a0\nThe evidence for that is that the order of soorahs given in the Mus-haf is for a reason, so that order should be followed, except in cases where it is narrated that there is an exception, such as in Fajr prayer on Friday, when Alif-Laam-Meem Tanzeel (Soorat al-Sajdah) is recited in the first rak\u2019ah and Hal ata (Soorat al-Insaan) in the second, and the Eid prayers when Soorat Qaaf and Soorat al-Qamar may be recited.\u00a0\nIf he recites them in a different order and recites one soorah then recites a soorah that comes before it, or he recites a soorah that does not come straight after it, that is permissible, even if he is not doing what is best. As for reciting a soorah from the end to the beginning, there is no dispute that this is not allowed and is blameworthy, because it is a distortion that detracts from the linguistic miracle of the Quran and goes against the wisdom behind the order in which the verses appear.\u00a0\nEnd quote from al-Nawawi.\u00a0\nThere is a report from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah which indicates that it is not obligatory to read Quran in sequence.\u00a0\nAl-Bukhaari (4993) narrated that Yoosuf ibn Maahak said: I was with \u2018Aa\u2019ishah the Mother of the Believers when an Iraqi came to her and said: \u201cO Mother of the Believers, show me your Mus-haf.\u201d She said: \u201cWhy?\u201d He said: \u201cSo that I may compile and arrange the Quran according to it, for people recite it with its soorahs not in proper order.\u201d She said: \u201cIt does not matter which part you read first. The first part of it to be revealed was a soorah from al-Mufassal which mentioned Paradise and Hell, then when the people became steadfast in Islam, (rulings on) halaal and haraam were revealed. If the first thing to have been revealed was \u2018Do not drink wine,\u2019 they would have said: \u2018We will never give up wine.\u2019 If it had been revealed, \u2018Do not commit zina,\u2019 they would have said, \u2018We will never give up zina.\u2019 It was revealed in Makkah to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when I was a young girl playing, \u2018Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter\u2019 [al-Qamar 54:46]. And Soorat al-Baqarah and al-Nisa\u2019 were not revealed except I was with him.\u201d\u00a0\nAl-Haafiz said:\u00a0\nIt seems to me that this Iraqi was one of those who followed the recitation of Ibn Mas\u2019ood. When the Mus-haf of \u2018Uthmaan was brought to Kufa, Ibn Mas\u2019ood did not agree to recant his recitation or destroy his Mus-haf, and his compilation was different from that of \u2018Uthmaan\u2019s Mus-haf. (Compilation means the collection of the Mus-haf in order). Undoubtedly the compilation of \u2018Uthmaan\u2019s Mus-haf was more appropriate than any other, hence this Iraqi said that its soorahs were not in proper order.\u00a0\nIbn Battaal said: We do not know of anyone who regarded it as obligatory to recite the soorahs in order, whether during prayer or otherwise, rather it is permissible to recite al-Kahf before al-Baqarah, or al-Hajj before al-Kahf, for example. As for what is narrated from the salaf about it being forbidden to recite the Quran out of order, what is meant by that is reciting a soorah from its end to its beginning. There was a group which did that in poetry, to demonstrate their precise memorization thereof. So the salaf ruled that this is not allowed with regard to the Quran and it is haraam. Al-Qaadi \u2018Iyaad said: The order of soorahs is not obligatory when reading or praying, or studying or teaching, hence Mus-hafs varied, but when the Mus-haf of \u2018Uthmaan was written they wrote it in the order in which it appears now. Hence the order of the Mus-hafs of the Sahaabah varied\u2026 then he mentioned something similar to Ibn Battaal. End quote from Fath al-Baari.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is there any du`a in the Sunnah for after one has completed the Quran?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is no specific u`a narrated in the Sunnah for after one has completed the Quran, or even from the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or the well-known imams. One of the most well-known u`as regarding this matter is the u`a which is written at the end of many Mus-hafs and it attributed to Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), but there is no basis for attributing it to him. See Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen, 14/226.\u00a0\nThe u`a after completing the Quran is recited either after completing it whilst praying, or when not praying. There is no basis for reciting any u`a after completing it whilst praying. As for reciting a u`a after completing it when not praying, it is narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) did that.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on making u`a after completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan? \u00a0\nHe replied:\u00a0\nI do not know of any u`a for completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan, either from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from his companions. The most that has been narrated concerning that is that when Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) had completed a reading of the Quran, he would gather his family and make u`a. This had to do with reading it outside of prayer. End quote.\u00a0\nFataawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 354\u00a0\nShaykh Bakr Abu Zayd wrote a useful essay on this issue, at the end of which he said:\u00a0\nFrom the quotations in the two previous sections we may draw the following conclusion:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 u`a upon completion of the Quran in general:\u00a0\nThe conclusion concerning this is as follows:\u00a0\nFirstly:\u00a0\nWhat we have stated above has to do with u`a upon completion of the Quran in general.\u00a0\nThere is no proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that, rather the reports are either mawdoo\u2019 (fabricated) or are da\u2019eef (weak) with no other reports to strengthen them. It is almost certain that there are no marfoo\u2019 reports concerning this matter that can be relied upon, because the scholars who wrote comprehensively about the sciences of the Quran and the dhikrs to be recited in connection with the Quran, such as al-Nawawi, Ibn Katheer, al-Qurtubi and al-Suyooti, did not narrate anything other than what we have referred to above. If they had known of any reports with stronger isnaads, they would have quoted them.\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThere is a saheeh report that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said u`a when he completed the Quran, and he would gather his family and children for that, and that a number of the Taabi\u2019een followed him in that, as mentioned in the report of Mujaahid ibn Jabr (may Allah have mercy on them all).\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nThere is no suggestion in the texts of Imam Abu Haneefah and Imam al-Shaafa\u2019i (may Allah have mercy on them) that this is Islamically prescribed.\u00a0\nWhat is narrated from Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) is that this is not something that the people did, and that completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan is not Sunnah.\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nThe view that it is mustahabb to make u`a after completing the Quran is what is narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), as our Hanbali scholars narrated from him, and as was affirmed by some later scholars of the other three madhhabs.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 u`a following completion of the Quran in prayer\u00a0\nThis may be summed up as follows: \u00a0\nFirstly:\u00a0\nFrom what is quoted above, there is no one letter from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from one of his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) to indicate that it is Islamically prescribed to recite this u`a in prayer after completing the Quran, before or after bowing, whether that is done by an imam or by one who is praying alone.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThe closest we can find on this matter is what was quoted by the scholars of our madhhab from the report from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), according to the report of Hanbal, al-Fadl and al-Harbi, the isnaad of which we cannot find, about saying the u`a for completing the Quran in Taraweeh prayer before bowing.\u00a0\nAccording to another report narrated from him \u2013 the source of which is not known \u2013 he allowed it in the u`a of Witr.\u00a0\nSee Marwiyaat u`a Khatm al-Quran.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "They read Qur\u2019aan before Taraaweeh prayer then complete it in the prayer",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      There is nothing wrong with you having this gathering. For \n      one person to read Qur\u2019aan whilst the others listen is something that is \n      prescribed in sharee\u2019ah; the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n      be upon him) and his companions did that.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Ibn Mas\u2019ood (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said \n    to me: \u201cRecite Qur\u2019aan for me.\u201d I said: \u201cO Messenger of Allaah, should I \n    recite it to you when it was revealed to you?\u201d He said: \u201cI like to hear it \n    from someone else.\u201d So I recited Soorat al-Nisa\u2019 to him, until I reached \n    this verse (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cHow (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a \n    witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people?\u201d\n\n    [al-Nisa\u2019 4:41]\nHe said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough \n    for now.\u201d And he turned to me with his eyes flowing with tears.\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4763; Muslim, 800.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez ibn Baaz said:\u00a0\n\n    It is prescribed for the Muslims during this blessed month to \n    study the Qur\u2019aan together, day and night, following the example of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with whom Jibreel \n    used to study the Qur\u2019aan every year in Ramadaan, and he studied it with him \n    twice in the last year of his life, and with the aim of drawing closer to \n    Allaah, and pondering the meanings of the Book of Allaah in order to benefit \n    from it and act upon it. This is the way of the righteous salaf and the \n    believers, male and female, should occupy themselves with the Qur\u2019aan, \n    reciting it, pondering its meanings and referring to the books of tafseer in \n    order to benefit from it and learn more.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, \n    11/319, 320.\u00a0\nIt is better when reading \n    Qur\u2019aan to also learn the rulings of the Qur\u2019aan, and understand it \n    meanings. So if you add to reading some tafseer (commentary) on what you \n    read or on part of it, then you will combine many good things, such as \n    following the Sunnah, studying the Qur\u2019aan together, teaching the Muslims \n    and helping them to ponder the Qur\u2019aan.\u00a0\n\n    If this completion of the Qur\u2019aan is done in Taraaweeh prayer \n    that is better than it being done outside the prayer.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra \n    (2/297):\u00a0\nThe command and \n    encouragement to recite Qur\u2019aan applies more to the one who is praying than \n    to anyone else, for reciting the Qur\u2019aan in prayer is better than reciting \n    it outside of prayer. The reports which speak of the virtue of the one who \n    recites Qur\u2019aan refer to the one who is praying more than anyone else. End \n    quote.\u00a0\n\n    If it is difficult for the people to complete the Qur\u2019aan in \n    the prayer, they can combine two good things: studying the Qur\u2019aan before \n    the prayer, and reciting the rest during the prayer, as you are doing.\u00a0\n\n    It was narrated that Ibn \u2018Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous \n    during Ramadaan when Jibreel would meet with him. He would meet him on every \n    night of Ramadaan and study the Qur\u2019aan with him. And the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was as generous as \n    the wind in doing good.\u00a0\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3048; Muslim, 2308.\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was asked:\u00a0\n\n    Can it be understood from the fact that Jibreel (peace be \n    upon him) studied Qur\u2019aan with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) every night in Ramadaan, that it is good to complete the \n    Qur\u2019aan (in this month)?\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\u00a0\n\n    It may be understood that it is mustahabb to study the \n    Qur\u2019aan and that the believer should study it with those who will benefit \n    him and help him, because the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) studied with Jibreel (peace be upon him) for a reason, because \n    Jibreel was the one who had brought it from Allaah, so he was the emissary \n    between Allaah and the Messengers.\u00a0\n\n    Undoubtedly the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) would benefit from his study with Jibreel, such as learning the \n    variant recitations (huroof) of the Qur\u2019aan and the meanings intended by \n    Allaah. If a person studies with someone who will help him to understand the \n    Qur\u2019aan and help him to pronounce it properly, this is what is desirable, \n    just as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) studied \n    it with Jibreel. The point is not that Jibreel was better than the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but Jibreel was the \n    messenger who brought it from Allaah and conveyed to the Messenger  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that which Allaah had commanded \n    him, namely the Qur\u2019aan and its pronunciation and meanings. So the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) benefited from Jibreel in \n    these ways. This does not mean that Jibreel was better than the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for he is the best of mankind \n    and is better than the angels. But there was a great deal of goodness in \n    their studying the Qur\u2019aan together, for the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and for the ummah, because it was studying \n    what had come from Allaah in order to benefit from what had come from \n    Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    There is another benefit in that, which is that studying \n    together at night is better than doing so during the day, because this study \n    used to take place at night, and it is known that the night is better for \n    studying than the day because one is better able to focus and concentrate \n    then.\u00a0\n\n    Another benefit is that studying together is prescribed in \n    sharee\u2019ah, and it is a righteous deed even if it is done at times other than \n    Ramadaan, because it benefits both parties. Even if there are more than two, \n    it doesn\u2019t matter, because each of them can benefit from his brothers and \n    they can encourage one another to read. It may be that a person would not be \n    motivated to read if he sits on his own, but if he has a companion or \n    companions to study with him, that will encourage him to read, as well as \n    the benefits they will all share of studying and learning together.\u00a0\n\n    It may be understood from that that the imam\u2019s reading the \n    whole Qur\u2019aan to the congregation during Ramadaan is a kind of this studying \n    together, because it enables them to listen to the whole Qur\u2019aan. Hence Imam \n    Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) liked the one who was leading them in \n    prayer to complete the Qur\u2019aan with them. This is akin to the practice of \n    the salaf who used to like to hear the whole of the Qur\u2019aan, but this does \n    not mean that he should hasten and rush and not be deliberate in his reading \n    and humble, focused and at ease in his prayer. Rather paying attention to \n    these matters is more important than reciting the entire Qur\u2019aan.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, \n    11/331-333\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was also asked:\u00a0\n\n    Many imams are keen to complete the Qur\u2019aan in Taraaweeh and \n    they strive to let the congregation hear the entire Qur\u2019aan. Is there \n    anything wrong with that?\u00a0\n\n    He replied:\u00a0\n\n    This is a good deed, so the imam may recite a juz\u2019 or less \n    each night, then read more during the last ten nights so as to complete the \n    Qur\u2019aan. This applies if it is easy for him to do so and will not cause any \n    hardship\u2026 The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    wrote a chapter in his book Jala\u2019 al-Afhaam fi\u2019l-Salaati wa\u2019l-Salaam \u2018ala \n    Khayr al-Anaam, in which he described how the salaf were keen to \n    complete the Qur\u2019aan; we advise you to read this chapter in order to learn \n    more.\u00a0\n\n    Majmoo\u2019 Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, \n    11/333, 334.\u00a0\n\n    See also the answers to questions no. \n    46088, \n    1505, \n    4039.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Can You Listen to the Quran while Sleeping?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can you listen to Quran while sleeping?\nThere is nothing wrong with a Muslim listening to Quran before he sleeps , or listening to a lecture or anything permissible. Indeed it is narrated in the sahih Sunnah that among the adhkar to be recited before going to sleep are some du`as and verses and Surahs from the Quran .\u00a0\nAl-Bukhari said:\u00a0\nChapter: Seeking refuge with Allah and reciting Quran when going to sleep\u00a0\n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would blow into his hands and recite the Mu\u2019awwadhat, and wipe his body with them.\u00a0(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5960)\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed me to guard the zakah of Ramadan, and someone came and started to rummage in the food. I took hold of him and said: \u201cI am going to take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)\u201d\u2026 And he said: \u201cWhen you go to your bed, recite Ayat al-Kursi, and you will have ongoing protection from Allah and no devil will come near you until morning comes.\u201d The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cHe spoke the truth even though he is a liar; that was a devil.\u201d\u00a0(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3101)\u00a0\nBenefits of listening to Quran while sleeping\nListening to Quran before going to sleep and after, during Ramadan and at other times, instills tranquility in the heart and helps one relax. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u201cVerily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.\u201d [Al-Ra\u2019d 13:28]\nFor more, please see these answers: 14590 , 78370 , 124657 , and 228366 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Which is better, reading Qur\u2019aan together or individually?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nFirstly:\u00a0\nWith regard to how he reviewed it with him, I \n    do not know how that was done.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWith regard to whether it is mustahabb for \n    people to gather to read Qur\u2019aan together or for each person to read it individually, that depends on the person himself. If gathering with his \n    brothers to study Qur\u2019aan together will make him more focused and help him to learn better, then gathering with others is preferable, i.e., if \n    gathering with others will make him have proper presence of mind and be more focused on pondering the meanings of the Qur\u2019aan, and allow the \n    opportunity to discuss the meanings, then that is better. But if it is the opposite then reading it on his own is better.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nWith regard to Jibreel reviewing the Qur\u2019aan \n    with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that was for the purpose of making sure that the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) memorized it. \u00a0\nWith regard to the third part of your \n    question \u2013 which is whether it is better to do that at night rather than during the day \u2013 the answer is yes, but a person may need to do other \n    things which means that he cannot study Qur\u2019aan at night, in which case he should study it more during the day.\u00a0\nSo each person should look at what is best for him, because of the general meaning of the \n    words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \u201cStrive to do that which will benefit you.\u201d So whatever is more beneficial \n    for you, so long as it is not forbidden according to sharee\u2019ah, is best."

        "question": "He claims that the Qur\u2019aan is lacking in eloquence and contains grammatical errors",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe one who is not able to engage in debate \n    with others should fear Allaah and not get involved in debates and arguments with others; rather he should try to protect his religious commitment \n    by refraining from arguing with the ignorant or those who promote specious arguments. \u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWith regard to the specious arguments \n    mentioned \u2013 which are more flimsy than a spider\u2019s web \u2013 these may be answered in two ways.\u00a0\nThe first way is in general terms, which is \n    to say that the Qur\u2019aan is the Book of Allaah which was revealed to the pure Arabs, who were the most advanced nation in the field of eloquence; \n    they paid a great deal of attention to that and had reached a high level of eloquent self-expression. They had established festivals of poetry and \n    speech-giving, they hung their mu\u2019allaqaat poems on the Ka\u2019bah as a sign of the high esteem in which they held eloquence and literature; they \n    competed in poetry and beautiful speech. Poetry flowed through their veins and they recited poems on all occasions, for joy and sorrow, birth and \n    death, happiness and misery, victory and defeat. This was something that was unknown in any other nation.\u00a0\nHence by His wisdom Allaah revealed to them \n    this Qur\u2019aan in this language of which they were so proud and because of which they thought themselves superior to other nations. The Qur\u2019aan \n    dazzled them with its beautiful words and meanings, its great purpose and structure. So they submitted to it out of respect for its language and \n    dare not speak any word of criticism against its wording, grammar or expression. \u00a0\nAllaah challenged them in His Book to produce \n    anything like the Qur\u2019aan, but they could not match it, let alone find fault with its grammar. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSay: \u2018If the mankind and the jinn were \n    together to produce the like of this Qur\u2019aan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another\u2019\u201d\n    [al-Isra\u2019 17:88]\nThen Allaah challenged them to produced ten \n    soorahs like it, as He said (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cOr they say, \u2018He (Prophet Muhammad) \n    forged it (the Qur\u2019aan).\u2019 Say: \u2018Bring you then ten forged Soorah (chapters) like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allaah (to your \n    help), if you speak the truth!\u2019\u201d\n[Hood 11:13]\nWhen they were unable to do that, then Allaah \n    challenged them to produce just one soorah like it. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and \n    Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur\u2019aan) to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a Soorah (chapter) of \n    the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allaah, if you are truthful\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:23]\nNo one who comes afterwards, when the \n    language has become corrupted and mixed with foreign languages, has any right to support such nonsensical ideas that do no more than point to the \n    depth of his ignorance and the shallowness of his thinking, and his lack of knowledge of the Arabic language. As it was said, \u00a0\n\u201cHow often do you see someone criticizing \n    something that is sound, and his problem is that he cannot understand it properly.\u201d\u00a0\nThe second way is in specific, detailed \n    terms, discussing the aspects of eloquence in the words that he criticized. This is as follows:\u00a0\nWith regard to the words of Allaah \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSome you disbelieved and some you killed \n    (fafareeqan kadhdhabtum wa fareeqan taqtuloon)\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:87]\nThe scholar al-Taahir ibn \u2018Ashoor said in his \n    commentary (al-Tahreer wa\u2019l-Tanweer, 1/598):\u00a0\nThe word taqtuloon (translated as \u201cyou \n    killed\u201d) appears in the present tense form to emphasize more vividly the terrible action that they did, namely killing the Prophets. This is like \n    the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd it is Allaah Who sends [arsala \u2013 part \n    tense form] the winds, so that they raise up [fa tutheeru \u2013 present tense form] the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land, and revive therewith \n    the earth after its death\u201d\n[Faatir 35:9]\nMoreover, the form taqtuloon fits with \n    the rhyme of the soorah and makes it more vivid; this provides eloquence of meaning and beauty of form. End of quote.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen quoted in his \n    Tasfeer (1/283) from some of the scholars another reason for using the present tense form taqtuloon, which is to provide a sense of \n    continuity, i.e., the Jews kept on killing the Prophets, even the last of them, Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They \n    killed the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the poison that they gave him at Khaybar, and he  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) continued to suffer the effects of that until, in his final illness, he said, \u201cI still feel pain from the food I \n    ate at Khaybar. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.\u201d \nAbu Dawood; also narrated by al-Bukhaari in a \n    mu\u2019allaq report. Al-Albaani said in Saheeh Abi Dawood (3784), it is hasan saheeh.\u00a0\nWith regard to the verse in which Allaah says \n    \u00a0\n(interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cWhen \n    He has decreed something, He says to it only: \u2018Be!\u2019 __and \n    it is [kun fa yakoon]\u201d\n[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:47]\nThis is more indicative of the ignorance of \n    this objector, because this verse is speaking of when Allaah wills to create something in the future, not in the past; this is to be understood \n    from the use of the word idha (meaning when, if), which refers to something in the future. Hence the verb yaqool (says) appears in \n    the present tense, to indicate that it is referring to something in the future, and it is followed by the verb yakoon (it is), also in the \n    present tense, which also refers to something in the future.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In prayer, it is better to recite from memory. See question no. 3465.\u00a0\nOutside of prayer, it is better for a person to do that which will increase his khushoo\u2019 (humility, focus). If his khushoo\u2019 will be increased by reciting from memory, then that is better; if his khushoo\u2019 will be increased by reading from the Mus-haf, then that is better. If it is the same in either case, then reading from the Mus-haf is better, because it combines reading and looking, and his eyes will be protected from looking at things that may distract him from reciting and pondering the meaning.\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi said in al-Adhkaar (p. 90-91):\u00a0\nReading Quran from the Mus-haf is better than reciting from memory; this is the view of our companions and it is well known from the salaf (may Allah be pleased with them). This does not apply in all cases however; if the reader can focus and ponder the meanings more when reciting from memory than when reading from the Mus-haf, then reciting from memory is better. If it is the same in both cases, then reading from the Mus-haf is better. This is what the salaf meant.\u00a0\nThere are weak (da\u2019eef) ahaadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which cannot be used as proof that it is better to look at the Mus-haf. We mention them only to draw attention to the fact that they are weak. These include:\u00a0\n\u201cLooking at the Mus-haf is an act of worship; for a child to look at his parents is an act of worship; looking at \u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib is an act of worship.\u201d This is a fabricated (mawdoo\u2019) hadith, as al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah al-Da\u2019eefah, 1/531.\u00a0\n\u201cGive your eyes their share of worship: looking at the Mus-haf, thinking about it and pondering its wonders.\u201d This is also fabricated (mawdoo\u2019).

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)\u201d [al-Hijr 15:9]\nIbn Jareer al-Tabari said in his Tafseer, 14/8:\u00a0\n\u201cAllah is saying, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (Reminder), i.e. the Quran, and We will guard the Quran against anything false being added to it that is not part of it, or anything that is part of it being taken away, whether that has to do with rulings, hudood punishments or matters having to do with inheritance.\u201d\u00a0\nAl-Sa\u2019di said in his Tafseer (p. 696):\u00a0\n\u201cIt is We Who have sent down the Quran in which there is mention of all issues and clear evidence, and in which We remind those who want to be reminded. \u00a0\n\u201cand surely, We will guard it\u201d means, when it is being revealed and after it has been revealed. When it is revealed, We protect it from the tampering of every accursed devil, and after it has been revealed Allah instilled it in the heart of His Messenger. Allah protected the words from being changed and from anything being added or taken away, or from its meanings being distorted. So no one can attempt to distort its meanings but Allah will guide someone to explain the truth of the Quran. This is one of the greatest signs of Allah and His blessing to His believing slaves. Another aspect of this protection is that Allah protects the people of the Quran against their enemies, and no enemy can overpower them and eliminate them.\u201d \u00a0\nThe Quran was revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in stages over a period of twenty-three years. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd (it is) a Quran which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages'' [al-Isra\u2019 17:106]\nal-Sa\u2019di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cThis means, We have revealed this Quran in stages, to differentiate between guidance and misguidance, between truth and falsehood.\n\u00a0\u201cin order that you might recite it to men at intervals\u201d means, slowly, so that they may ponder and think about its meanings, and understand the different branches of knowledge contained therein.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd We have revealed it by stages\u201d means, gradually, over a period of twenty-three years.\u201d Tafseer al-Sa\u2019di, p. 760.\u00a0\nLiteracy was not widespread among the Arabs\u00a0\nLiteracy was not widespread among the Arabs. Allah described them in such terms when He said (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cHe it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad) from among themselves\u201d [al-Jumu\u2019ah 63:2]\nThey used to memorize the Quran by heart, and a few of them used to write down some verses or surahs on animal skins, thin white stones and the like.\u00a0\nThe prohibition to write anything other than the Quran\nAt first the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the writing of anything other than the Quran, and he forbade them to write down his words for a while, so that the Sahabah would focus on memorizing the Quran and writing it down, and so that the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would not be confused with the words of Allah, and so the Quran was protected from anything being added or taken away.\u00a0\nThe Prophetic order to write down the revelation\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed a group of his Companions who were trustworthy and knowledgeable to write down the revelation . They are known in their biographies as those who wrote down the Revelation, such as the four Caliphs, \u2018Abd-Allah ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018As, Mu\u2019awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, Zayd ibn Thabit and others \u2013 may Allah be pleased with them all.\u00a0\nThe Quran was revealed in seven dialects\nThe Quran was revealed in seven dialects as was narrated in the saheeh hadeeth of \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This was narrated by al-Bukhari (2287) and Muslim (818); these were the dialects of the Arabs which were known for their eloquence.\u00a0\nHow was the Quran compiled?\nThe Quran continued to be preserved in the hearts of the Sahabah who had memorized it, and on the skins and other materials until the time of the caliph Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him).\u00a0\nDuring the Riddah wars many of the Sahabah who had memorized the Quran were killed, and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) was afraid that the Quran would be lost. So he consulted the senior Sahabah about compiling the Quran in a single book so that it would remain preserved and would not be lost. He entrusted this mission to the chief of memorizers Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him). Al-Bukhari narrated in his Saheeh (4986) that Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u00a0\nAbu Bakr al-Siddeeq sent for me when the people of al-Yamamah had been killed [i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against the false prophet Musaylimah]. (I went to him) and found \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), \u201c \u2018Umar has come to me and said: \u2018Casualties were heavy among the Qurra of the Quran (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the battle of al-Yamamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Quran may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you (Abu Bakr) order that the Quran be collected.\u201d I said to 'Umar, \"How can you do something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do?\" 'Umar said, \"By Allah, this is something good.\" 'Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my heart to it and I began to realize the good in the idea which 'Umar had realized.\" Then Abu Bakr said (to me). \u201cYou are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). So search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Quran and compile it in one book.\" By Allah If they had ordered me to move one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to compile the Quran. Then I said (to Abu Bakr), \"How can you do something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"By Allah, it is a good thing.\" Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my heart to that to which He had opened the hearts of Abu Bakr and 'Umar. So I started looking for the Quran and collecting it from (what it was written on) palm stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, until I found the last Verse of Surah al-Taubah with Abu Khuzaymah al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The verse is (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\"Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty...\u201d [al-Taubah 9:128] until the end of Surat Bara'ah (i.e., al-Taubah). \u00a0\nThen the complete manuscript (copy) of the Quran remained with Abu Bakr until he died, then with 'Umar until the end of his life, and then with Hafsah, the daughter of 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them).\u00a0\nThe Sahabi Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) knew the Quran by heart but he was methodical in his confirmation; he would not agree to write down any verse until two of the Sahabah testified that they had heard it from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \u00a0\nWhat was the Quran copy of \u2018Uthman?\nThis Mus-haf (written copy of the Quran) remained in the hands of the caliphs until the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliph \u2018Uthman ibn \u2018Affan (may Allah be pleased with him). The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) had dispersed to different lands, and they used to recite the Quran according to what they had heard of the seven recitations from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and each of their students used to recite according to what he had heard from his shaykh.\nIf a student heard someone reciting in a manner different from what he knew, he would denounce him and accuse him of making a mistake, and this went on until the Sahabah feared that there would be fitnah (trouble) between the Tabi'een and successive generations. So they thought that they should unite the people in following one recitation, which was in the dialect of Quraysh in which the Quran had first been revealed, so as to dispel any disputes and resolve the matter. \u2018Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) was consulted, and he agreed with this opinion.\u00a0\nAl-Bukhari narrated in his Saheeh (4988) from Anas ibn Malik that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman came to \u2018Uthman at the time when the people of Sham (Syria) and the people of Iraq were waging war to conquer Armenia and Azerbaijan. Hudhayfah was alarmed by their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Quran, so he said to 'Uthman, \"O Ameer al-Mu\u2019mineen! Save this nation before they dispute about the Book (Quran) as the Jews and the Christians did before.\" So 'Uthman sent a message to Hafsah saying, \"Send us the manuscript of the Quran so that we may make copies of the Mus-haf and we will return the manuscript to you.\" \u00a0\nHafsah sent it to 'Uthman. Then 'Uthman ordered Zayd ibn Thabit, 'Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr, Sa\u2019eed ibn al-\u2018As and \u2018Abd al-Rahman ibn Harith ibn Hisham to copy out the manuscripts. 'Uthman said to the three men who were from Quraysh (the tribe of which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a member), \u201cIn case you disagree with Zayd ibn Thabit on any point in the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraysh, for the Quran was revealed in their tongue.\" They did so, and when they had written many copies, 'Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsah. \u00a0\n'Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Quranic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt. \u00a0\nIbn Shihab said: Kharijah ibn Zayd ibn Thabit told me that he heard Zayd ibn Thabit say: \u201cWhen we made copies of the Mus-haf I missed a verse of al-Ahzab that I used to hear the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recite. So we searched for it and we found it with Khuzaymah ibn Taabit al-Ansari. (The verse was) \u2018Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah\u2019 [al-Ahzab 33:23 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]. So we put it in its place in its surah in the Mus-haf.\u201d\nThus an end was put to dispute and the Muslims were united. The Quran has remained and will remain narrated from generation to generation and preserved in men's hearts until the Day of Resurrection. This is how Allah has preserved His Book, in confirmation of the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cVerily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)\u201d [al-Hijr 15:9]\n\u00a0And Allah knows best."

        "question": "The Quran is a healing and a mercy to the believers",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Quran is the word of Allah that was revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and is recited as an act of worship. \u00a0\nThis definition of the Quran is comprehensive. \u00a0\nOur saying \u201cthe word of Allah\u201d excludes the words of human beings or others.\u00a0\nOur saying \u201crevealed to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)\u201d excludes anything that was revealed to anyone else, such as the Injeel (Gospel), Tawraat (Torah) and Zaboor (Psalms).\u00a0\nOur saying \u201cit is recited as an act of worship\u201d excludes the hadeeth qudsi (ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) narrated words from Allah which are not part of the Quran).\u00a0\nIt brings light and gives certainty, it is the strong rope, it is the path of the righteous. It tells us of those who came before us, Prophets and righteous people, and how those who disobeyed them tasted the punishment of Allah and were humiliated. It contains verses which speak of the miracles of Allah and His power in this great universe. It tells us of the origins of human beings who are created from \u201cdespised water\u201d (semen). It contains the basic principles of faith which must be embraced by every humble heart. It contains the rules of sharee\u2019ah which tells us what is permissible and what is forbidden; what is true and what is false. It tells us of the Resurrection and the fate of human beings, either in the Fire in which they will burn and be among those who are humiliated, or in Paradise with its gardens, springs, plants and places of security.\u00a0\nIn it there is healing for men\u2019s hearts, light and illumination for the blind. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism and act on it), and it increases the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) nothing but loss\u201d\u00a0[al-Isra\u2019 17:82]\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Katheer said in his commentary on this verse:\u00a0\nHere Allah tells us about His Book, which He revealed to His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and which is the Quran which \u201cFalsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise\u201d [Fussilat 42:41- interpretation of the meaning], that it is \u201ca healing and a mercy to those who believe\u201d \u2013 i.e., it takes away the diseases in the heart such as doubt, hypocrisy, shirk, deviation and misguidance; the Quran heals all of that. And it is also a mercy which brings about faith, wisdom and the pursuit of and desire for goodness. This is only for those who believe in it and follow it; for such it will be a healing and a mercy. But as for the kaafir and those who wrong themselves thereby, their hearing the Quran only makes them further away (from truth) and increases them in kufr. The problem comes from the kaafir, not from the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cSay: It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Quran) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand)\u201d\u00a0[Fussilat 41:44]\n\u201cAnd whenever there comes down a Soorah, some of them (hypocrites) say: \u2018Which of you has had his Faith increased by it?\u2019 As for those who believe, it has increased their Faith, and they rejoice.\nBut as for those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubt, disbelief and hypocrisy), it will add suspicion and doubt to their suspicion, disbelief and doubt; and they die while they are disbelievers\u201d\n[al-Tawbah 9:124-125]\nQutaadah said, concerning the phrase \u201cAnd We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe\u201d: when the believer hears it he benefits from it, memorizes it and understands it. \u201cand it increases the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) nothing but loss\u201d means, they do not benefit from it, memorize it or understand it. Allah has made this Quran a healing and a mercy for the believers.\"(Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/60).\u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Quran, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your breasts, \u2014 a guidance and a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers\u201d\u00a0[Yoonus 10:57]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if We had sent this as a Quran in a foreign language (other than Arabic), they would have said: \u2018Why are not its verses explained in detail (in our language)? What! (A Book) not in Arabic and (the Messenger) an Arab?\u2019 Say: \u2018It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Quran) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand)\u2019\u201d\u00a0[Fussilat 41:44]\nIn it is guidance for mankind, away from misguidance and to the truth. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThis is the Book (the Quran), whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqoon [the pious\u201d\u00a0[al-Baqarah 2:2]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd thus We have revealed to you (O Muhammad) a Quran in Arabic that you may warn the Mother of the Towns (Makkah) and all around it, and warn (them) of the Day of Assembling of which there is no doubt, when a party will be in Paradise (those who believed in Allah and followed what Allah\u2019s Messenger brought them) and a party in the blazing Fire (Hell) (those who disbelieved in Allah and followed not what Allah\u2019s Messenger brought them)\u201d\u00a0[al-Shoora 42:9]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad) Rooh (a revelation, and a mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made it (this Quran) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will. And verily, you (O Muhammad) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e. Allah\u2019s religion of Islamic Monotheism).\nThe path of Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Verily, all matters at the end go to Allah (for decision)\u201d\u00a0[al-Shoora 42:52-53]\nIt contains innumerable benefits, so everyone who seeks happiness in this world and in the Hereafter must refer to it for judgement and follow its commands. \u00a0\nImam Ibn Hazm said:\nBecause the proof and the miracles indicate that the Quran is the covenant of Allah with us, we must believe in it and act in accordance with it. It has come down to us through generations of Muslims narrating it to those who came after them, which leaves no room for doubt that the Quran is the one which is written in the Mus-hafs which we find everywhere. We have to follow its teachings, for it is our reference-point, because we read in it the words (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThere is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered\u201d\u00a0[al-An\u2019aam 6:38]\nWhatever commands and prohibitions are in the Quran, we must adhere to them.\"(Al-Ihkaam, 1/92)\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Distortion of the Quran by the Raafidis",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to Soorat al-Wilaayah, some of the Shi\u2019ah scholars and imams have stated that it exists. Any of them who denies that does so by way of taqiyah (dissimulation). One of those who clearly stated that it exists is Mirza Hussein Muhammad Taqiy al-Noori al-Tubrusi (d. 1320 AH). He wrote a book in which he claimed that the Quran had been distorted and that the Sahaabah has concealed some parts of it, including Soorat al-Wilaayah. The Raafidis honoured him after his death by burying him in al-Najaf. This book by al-Tubrusi was published in Iran in 1298 AH, and when it was published there was a great deal of controversy because they wanted the doubts about the validity of the Quran, which were known only to their leaders, to remain scattered throughout hundreds of their major books, and they did not want that to be compiled in one book. At the beginning of his book he said: \u00a0\n\u201cThis is a good and noble book entitled Fasl al-khitaab fi ithbaat tahreef Kitaab Rabb il-Arbaab (Decisive comment on the distortion of the Book of the Lord of Lords)\u2026 He mentioned aayahs and soorahs which he claims that the Sahaabah concealed, including \u2018Soorat al-Wilaayah,\u2019\u201d the text of which, according to them, and as quoted in this book, is:\u00a0\n\u201cO you who believe, believe in the Prophet and the Wali [i.e., \u2018Ali] whom We have sent to guide you to the straight path, a Prophet and a Wali who are part of one another, and I am the All-Knowing, All-Aware\u2026\u201d \u00a0\nAnd they have another soorah which they call Soorat al-Noorayn: \u201cO you who believe, believe in the two lights (al-noorayn) which We have sent down to you to recite to you My Verses and to warn you of the punishment of a great Day. They are part of one another and I am the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. Those who fulfil the covenant with Allah and His Messenger mentioned in the verses (of the Quran), the Gardens of delight will be theirs, but those who disbelieve after they believed by breaking their covenant and disobeying the command of the Prophet, they will be thrown into Hell. They have wronged themselves and gone against the wasiyyah of the Prophet (i.e., the appointment of \u2018Ali as khaleefah), and they will be given to drink of boiling water\u2026\u201d and other such nonsense.\u00a0\nProf. Muhammad \u2018Ali Sa\u2019oodi \u2013 who was one of the greatest experts of the Ministry of Justice in Egypt \u2013 examined an Iranian mus-haf kept by the Orientalist Bryan and he obtained a copy of this soorah; above the lines of Arabic script there is written the translation in the Iranian language.\u00a0\nAs it was mentioned by al-Tubrusi in his book, Fasl al-khitaab fi ithbaat tahreef Kitaab Rabb il-Arbaab, it is also mentioned in their book Dabastan Madhaahib, which is in Farsi, written by Muhsin Faani al-Kashmiri. This book has been printed numerous times in Iran, and this false soorah was quoted from it by the Orientalist Noeldeke in his book The History of Qur\u2019anic Manuscripts, 2/120, and was published by the French Asian newspaper in 1842 (p. 431-439).\u00a0\nIt was also mentioned by Mirza Habibullaah al-Haashimi al-Kho\u2019i in his book Manhaaj al-Baraa\u2019ah fi Sharh Nahj al-Balaaghah (2/217); and by Muhammad Baaqir al-Majlisi in his book Tadhkirat al-A\u2019immah (p. 19, 20) in Farsi, (published by) Manshoorat Mawlana, Iran.\u00a0\nSee also al-Khutoot al-\u2018Areedah li\u2019l-Asas allati qaama \u2018alayha deen al-Shi\u2019ah by Muhibb al-Deen al-Khateeb.\u00a0\nThis claim of theirs is a denial of the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)\u201d\n[al-Hijr 15:9]\nHence the Muslims are unanimously agreed that anyone who claims that anything in the Quran has been altered or changed is a kaafir.\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:\u00a0\nThe same applies to those among them who claim that some verses of the Quran have been taken away or concealed, or who claim to have some esoteric interpretations that exempt him from having to do the actions prescribed in sharee\u2019ah etc., who are called al-Qaraamitah and al-Baatiniyyah, and who include al-Tanaasukhiyyah [names of esoteric sects]. There is no dispute that they are kaafirs.\u00a0\nAl-Saarim al-Maslool, 3/1108-1110.\u00a0\nIbn Hazm said:\u00a0\nThe view that the Quran has been altered is blatant kufr and is a rejection of what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said.\u00a0\nAl-Fasl fi\u2019l-Ahwa\u2019 wa\u2019-Milal wa\u2019l-Nihal, 4/139.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Refutation of those who try to prove that the Qur\u2019aan is not true",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    1 \u2013 The proof that the copies of the Holy Qur\u2019aan that we \n    have before us is not just one or two pieces of evidence, rather it is \n    proven by a vast amount of evidence that no fair-minded person can study \n    without becoming convinced that it is exactly as Allaah revealed it to \n    Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\u00a0\n\n    2 \u2013 There have been generations coming one after another, \n    reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it, memorizing it and writing it \n    down. They have not omitted a single letter, and no one can change even the \n    vowel point of a single letter. Writing is just one means of preserving it; \n    basically it is preserved in their hearts.\u00a0\n\n    3 \u2013 The Qur\u2019aan has not come down to us on its own, such that \n    the so-called alterations could be made. Rather the interpretation of its \n    verses, the meanings of its words, the reasons for its revelation, the \n    grammar of its words and the commentary on its rulings have all been \n    transmitted. When such care has been given to this Book, how could sinful \n    hands find a way to distort even one letter of it, or add a word, or take \n    away a verse?\u00a0\n\n    4 \u2013 The Qur\u2019aan speaks of matters of the unseen, in the \n    future, which Allaah revealed to His Messenger Muhammad  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to show him that they came from Allaah. If \n    a human being wants to write a book, he can describe an event or express a \n    point of view, but if any human being were to speak about matters of the \n    unseen, in this field he can only base that on speculation and lies. But the \n    Qur\u2019aan told of the defeat of the Romans by the Persians, at the time when \n    there was no means of communication to inform the Arabs of this event. The \n    same verses also foretold that they (the Persians) would be defeated after a \n    certain number of years. If what the Qur\u2019aan said was not accurate, then the \n    kaafirs would have had a great opportunity to criticize the Qur\u2019aan.\u00a0\n\n    5 \u2013 If you read any verse of the Qur\u2019aan, then you go to \n    America or Asia or the jungles of Africa, or to the deserts of Arabia or any \n    place where there are Muslims, you will find that all of them have the exact \n    same verse, memorized by heart or in their books; not a single letter of it \n    will have been altered. \u00a0\n\n    So what is the importance of this unknown manuscript in Yemen \n    which we have not seen, and in which some ignorant may have altered, in \n    recent times, one verse or one word?\u00a0\n\n    Does this argument carry any weight when properly researched \n    and discussed? Especially when the people claim to be fair-minded and \n    objective in their research. \u00a0\n\n    What would be their response if we went to one of their most \n    trusted books by a well-known author, a book of which there are many copies \n    in the world, all of them exactly the same, and we claimed that there was a \n    copy of this book in some country or other in which there was extra material \n    and alterations, and it was different from what is in their copies? Would \n    they pay any attention?\u00a0\n\n    Their answer would be the same as ours.\u00a0\n\n    6 \u2013 The manuscript copies which are in the Muslims\u2019 \n    possession cannot be proven to be authentic in this simplistic manner, for \n    we have experts who know the history of calligraphy and we have principles \n    and guidelines through which we may determine whether a manuscript is \n    genuine, such as the names and signatures of the people who heard it and \n    read it. \u00a0\n\n    We do not think that these features are present in this \n    so-called copy of the Qur\u2019aan in Yemen or in others.\u00a0\n\n    7 \u2013 We are happy to conclude our answer with this true story \n    that happened in Baghdad during the \u2018Abbasid era, when a Jew wanted to find \n    out how true are the books attributed by their followers to God, namely the \n    Torah among the Jews, the Gospel among the Christians and the Qur\u2019aan among \n    the Muslims.\u00a0\n\n    He went to the Torah and added and took away a few minor \n    things that were not very obvious, then he gave it to a scribe from among \n    the Jews and asked him to make copies of it. It did not take long before \n    these copies were placed in the synagogues of the Jews and were in \n    circulation among their major scholars.\u00a0\n\n    Then he went to the Gospel and added and took away a few \n    things as he had done with the Torah, and he gave it to their scribes and \n    asked them to make copies of it. It was not long before it was being read in \n    their churches and was in circulation among their scholars.\u00a0\n\n    Then he went to the Qur\u2019aan and added and took away a few \n    things as he had done with the Torah and the Gospel. Then he gave it to a \n    Muslim scribe to make copies of it.\u00a0\n\n    When he went back to get his copy, the scribe threw it in his \n    face and told him that this was not the Qur\u2019aan of the Muslims!\u00a0\n\n    From this experiment the man came to know that the Qur\u2019aan is \n    the true Book of Allaah and that all other books were the works of human \n    beings.\u00a0\n\n    If the scribes of the Muslims could tell that this copy had \n    been tampered with, then how could it go into circulation among the Muslim \n    scholars undetected?\u00a0\n\n    If the questioner wants to repeat this ancient experiment \n    nowadays, all she has to do is to do the same as that Jewish man did, who \n    later became Muslim; she can add and take away things from these three books \n    and see what happens as a result.\u00a0\n\n    But we do not tell her to show her copy of the Qur\u2019aan to a \n    scribe, rather we tell her to show it to Muslim children, and they will tell \n    her where the mistakes are in her copy!\u00a0\n\n    Some Muslim states have printed Mus-hafs in which there were \n    mistakes, and young children found them before the grown-ups did!\n\n    \u00a0And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path."

        "question": "Claims that the Qur\u2019aan has been distorted",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nIt is not possible for a Muslim to entertain doubts concerning the immutability of the Qur\u2019aan, because Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur\u2019aan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cVerily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur\u2019aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)\u201d\n[al-Hijr 15:9]\nThe Qur\u2019aan was preserved in the hearts of the Sahaabah who had memorized it, and on the trunks of trees and thin white stones until the time of the caliph Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him). During the Riddah wars many of the Sahaabah who had memorized the Qur\u2019aan were killed, so Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) was afraid that the Qur\u2019aan may be lost. He consulted the senior Sahaabah concerning the idea of compiling the entire Qur\u2019aan in one book so that it would be preserved and would not be lost, and this task was entrusted to the great hafiz Zayd ibn Thaabit and others who had written down the Revelation. Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh that Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \u00a0\n\u201cAbu Bakr As-Siddeeq sent for me when the people of Yamamah had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against Musaylimah). (I went to him) and found 'Umar bin al-Khattaab sitting with him. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said (to me), \u2018 \u2018Umar has come to me and said: \u201cCasualties were heavy among the Qurra' of the Qur'aan (i.e. those who knew the Qur\u2019aan by heart) at the Battle of Yamaamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra' on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur'an may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you [Abu Bakr] should issue orders that the Qur\u2019aan be collected.\u201d I said to 'Umar, \u201cHow can you do something that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do?\" 'Umar said, \u201cBy Allah, this is something good.\u201d \u2018Umar kept on urging me (to accept his proposal) until Allah opened my heart to it and I began to realize the good in the idea which 'Umar had realized.\u2019 Then Abu Bakr said (to me): \u2018You are a wise young man and we have a great deal of confidence in you. You used to write down the Revelation for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). So you should seek out the Qur\u2019aan [i.e., the fragments on which it is written] and collect it (in one book).\u2019 By Allaah, if they had ordered me to move one of the mountains, it would not have been harder for me than this command to collect the Qur\u2019aan. I said (to Abu Bakr), \u2018How can you do something which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do?\u2019 Abu Bakr said, \u2018By Allaah, it is a good thing.\u2019 Abu Bakr kept on urging me (to accept his proposal) until Allah opened my heart to it as He had opened the hearts of Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar. So I started to look for the Qur\u2019aan and collected it from (the fragments on which it was written of) palm-stalks, thin white stones and the hearts of men (i.e., from men who knew it by heart), until I found the last verse of Soorat al-Tawbah with Abu Khuzaymah al-Ansaari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The verse is : \u00a0\n\u2018Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty\u2026\u2019\n[al-Tawbah 9:128 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\n\u2026 until the end of Soorat Baraa\u2019ah (Soorat al-Tawbah).\u00a0\nThese fragments remained with Abu Bakr until he died, then with \u2018Umar for the rest of his life, then with Hafsah bint \u2018Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both).\u201d\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWith regard to al-Hajjaaj, it was not his idea to write out the Mus-haf, rather he was commanded by an intelligent man to do that. There follows the complete story:\u00a0\nAl-Zarqaani said:\u00a0\nIt is known that the Mus-haf of \u2018Uthmaan was unpointed (i.e., it had no diacritical marks). Whatever the case the addition of diacritical marks to the Mus-haf did not happen, according to the well-established view, until the era of \u2018Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan, when he realized that Islam had spread widely and the Arabs were mixing with the non-Arabs, which was having an effect on the Arabic language, so that there was much confusion about the correct reading of the Mus-hafs and it was becoming very difficult for people to tell the letters apart. By his deep insight, he realized that he should do something to solve the problem. So he commanded al-Hajjaaj to take care of this important matter. In obedience to the caliph, Al-Hajjaaj appointed two men to deal with this matter, namely Nasr ibn \u2018Aasim al-Laythi and Yahya ibn Ya\u2019mar al-\u2018Adwaani, both of whom were qualified and able to do the task required of them, because they were knowledgeable, righteous, pious and experts in Arabic language and the various readings of the Qur\u2019aan. They had also both studied under Abu\u2019l-Aswad al-Du\u2019li. May Allaah have mercy on these two shaykhs, for they succeeded in their work and gave the Mus-haf diacritical points for the first time. They added dots to all the letters that look similar, not adding more than three dots to any one letter. That became widespread among the people and was very effective in dispelling confusion concerning reading of the Mus-haf. \u00a0\nIt was said that the first person to add diacritical marks to the Mus-haf was Abu\u2019l-Aswad al-Du\u2019li, and that Ibn Seereen had a Mus-haf to which diacritical marks had been added by Yahya ibn Ya\u2019mar. These opinions may be reconciled by noting that Abu\u2019l-Aswad was the first one who added diacritical marks to the Mus-haf, but he did that for his own individual use, then Ibn Seereen followed him in that, and that \u2018Abd al-Malik was the first one to add diacritical marks to the Mus-haf\u00a0 in an official and public manner that was spread widely among the people in order to dispel any confusion with regard to reading Qur\u2019aan.\u201d\u00a0\nManaahil al-\u2018Irfaan, 1/280, 281\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nWith regard to what is mentioned in the question, quoting from al-Masaahif by Ibn Abi Dawood, there follows the report concerning that and the ruling thereon:\u00a0\nIt was narrated from \u2018Abbaad ibn Suhayb from \u2018Awf ibn Abi Jameelah that al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf changed eleven letters in the Mus-haf. He said that in Soorat al-Baqarah 2:259 it said lam yatasanna wa\u2019nzur, with no ha\u2019, and he changed it to lam yatasannah wa\u2019nzur (they show no change, and look\u2026)\u00a0\nIn al-Maa'idah 5:48 it said sharee\u2019atan wa minhaajan, and he changed it to shir\u2019atan wa minhaajan (a law and a clear way)\u00a0\nIn Yoonus 10:22 it said, Huwa alladhi yunshirukum and he changed it to Huwa alladhi yusayyirukum (He it is Who enables you to travel\u2026)\u00a0\nIn Yoosuf 12:45 it said Ana aateekum bi ta\u2019weelihi and he changed it to Ana unabbi\u2019ukum bi ta\u2019weelihi (I will tell you its interpretation)\u00a0\nIn al-Zukhruf 43:32 it said, Nahnu qasamnaa baynahum ma\u2019aayishahum and he changed it to Nahnu qasamnaa baynahum ma\u2019eeshatahum (It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood)\u00a0\nIn al-Takweer 81:24 it said Wa ma huwa \u2018ala\u2019l-ghaybi bi zaneen and he changed it to Wa ma huwa \u2018ala\u2019l-ghaybi bi daneen (and he withholds not a knowledge of the unseen)\u00a0\nKitaab al-Masaahif by al-Sajistaani, p. 49.\u00a0\nThis report is da\u2019eef jiddan (very weak) or mawdoo\u2019 (fabricated), because its isnaad includes \u2018Abbaad ibn Suhayb, whose hadeeth is to be rejected.\u00a0\n\u2018Ali ibn al-Madeeni said: his hadeeth is no good. Al-Bukhaari, al-Nasaa\u2019i and others said: he is matrook (to be rejected). Ibn Hibbaan said: he was a Qadari who promoted his innovated ideas, and he narrated things which a beginner in this field would realize were fabricated if he heard them. Al-Dhahabi said: he is one of those who are to be rejected.\u00a0\nSee Meezaan al-I\u2019tidaal, by al-Dhahabi, 4/28.\u00a0\nThe text of the report is also false, because it dos not make sense that these changes could be made in the Qur\u2019aan and then spread throughout the world. Even some of the non-Muslims, such as the Raafidis (Shi\u2019ah) who think that the Qur\u2019aan is incomplete, rejected this and criticized its text.\u00a0\nAl-Kho\u2019i, who is one of the Raafidis, said: \u201cThis claim is like the hallucination of one who is suffering a fever, or like the fairy tales of the insane or of children. Al-Hajjaaj was one of the governors of the Umayyads, and he is too incapable to do anything to the Qur\u2019aan. He is even incapable of changing any of the minor issues of Islam, so how could he change the thing which is the foundation of the religion and the basis of sharee\u2019ah? Where would he get the power to introduce this change throughout the realm of Islam and beyond at the time when the Qur\u2019aan was well known throughout the Muslim world? How come no historian has ever mentioned this disastrous event even though it is so serious and they would have a lot of motives to mention it? How come no one among the Muslims of his time narrated it? How could the Muslims have turned a blind eye to such an action after the reign of al-Hajjaaj came to an end? Even if we assume that he could have gathered all the copies of the Qur\u2019aan and that not one single copy escaped his grasp anywhere in the far-flung regions of the Islamic world, how could he have removed it from the hearts of the Muslims and those who had memorized it, the number of whom at that time is known only to Allaah.\u201d\u00a0\n(al-Bayaan fi Tafseer al-Qur\u2019aan, p. 219)\u00a0\nWhat the questioner mentions about Imam al-Sajistaani, and that he wrote a book called Ma Ghayyarahu al-Hajjaaj fi Mus-haf \u2018Uthmaan (What al-Hajjaaj altered in the Mus-haf of \u2018Uthmaan) is not true, rather it is a blatant lie. All there is, is the commentary that al-Sajistaani wrote concerning the words quoted above from al-Hajjaaj, entitled Baab Ma Kataba al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf fi\u2019l-Mus-haf (Chapter on what al-Hajjaaj wrote in the Mus-haf).\u00a0\nOn this basis, we cannot rely upon this report under any circumstances whatsoever. The fact that until now it has not been proven that anyone has succeeded in his attempt to change even one letter (of the Qur\u2019aan) is sufficient to prove that it is a lie. If what has been narrated is true, then it would be possible to repeat it, especially at the times when the Muslims were weak and their enemies plotted against them.\u00a0 It is such specious arguments that prove that these claims are false, and that our enemies are incapable of refuting the evidence of the Qur\u2019aan or its clarity, so they resorted to attacking it.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

This was also the view of the scholars among the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Taabi\u2019een. They said a man may recite Quran without wudoo\u2019 but he should not read from the Mus-haf unless he is taahir (pure, i.e., has wudoo\u2019). This was the view of Sufyaan al-Thawri, al-Shaafa\u2019i, Ahmad and Ishaaq.\u00a0\nSee Da\u2019eef Sunan al-Tirmidhi by al-Albaani, hadith no. 22\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: The imams are agreed that it is haraam to recite Quran when in a state of janaabah.\u00a0\nIt is not proper etiquette to recite Quran when one is in a state of janaabah because it is the words of Allah which must be respected and venerated, and kept away from all unclean places and places where haraam things take place, which could dishonour it and show disrespect towards its sanctity. Moreover the person who is in a state of janaabah can remove the impurity whenever he wants, so he is not allowed to recite Quran. But if you are impure in the sense of minor impurity then it is permissible for you to recite only, without touching the Mus-haf. See question no. 10672. With regard to women when they are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth, see question no. 2564. And Allah knows best.\u00a0\nSee Tawdeeh Ahkaam al-Nisa\u2019, 1/309."

He said:\u00a0\nIbraaheem brought her and her son Ismaa\u2019eel while \n          she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka'bah under a tree on the \n          spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days \n          there was nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them \n          sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, \n          and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. \n          Ismaa\u2019eel's mother followed him saying, \"O Ibraaheem! Where are \n          you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose \n          company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated \n          that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked \n          him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do this?\" He said, \"Yes.\" \n          She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while \n          Ibraaheem went on his way. When he reached al-Thaniyyah, where they \n          could not see him, he faced the Ka'bah, and raising both hands, prayed \n          to Allaah in the following words:\n\u201cO \n          our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable \n          valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka\u2018bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, \n          that they may perform As\u2011Salaah (Iqaamat\u2011as\u2011Salaah). \n          So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allaah) \n          provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks\u201d[Ibraaheem 14:37 \n          \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\u00a0\nIsmaa\u2019eel's mother went on suckling Ismaa\u2019eel and \n          drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin \n          had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. \n          She started looking at him (i.e. Ismaa\u2019eel) tossing in agony (or he \n          said: kicking with his heels). She left him, for she could not endure \n          looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safa was the nearest \n          mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at \n          the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not \n          see anybody. Then she descended from al-Safa and when she reached the \n          valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in \n          distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached al-Marwa \n          where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but \n          she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between al-Safa \n          and al-Marwa) seven times.\nIbn \u2018Abbaas said: the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \"This is the \n          source of the tradition of the walking between them (i.e. al-Safa and \n          al-Marwa). When she reached al-Marwa (for the last time) she heard a \n          voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She \n          heard the voice again and said, \u201cO (whoever you may be)! You have made \n          me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And she \n          saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel \n          (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make \n          something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started \n          filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water started \n          flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\"\nIbn \n          \u2018Abbaas said: The Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ismaa\u2019eel's \n          mother! Had she left the Zamzam alone (flowing without trying to control \n          it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), \n          Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" \n          The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled \n          her child. The angel said to her, 'Don't be afraid of being neglected, \n          for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his \n          father, and Allah never neglects His people.' The House (i.e. Ka\u2019bah) \n          at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents \n          came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till \n          some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed \n          by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through \n          the way of Kada'. They landed in the lower part of Makkah where they \n          saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving \n          it. They said, \u2018This bird must be flying around water, though we know \n          that there is no water in this valley.\u2019 They sent one or two messengers \n          who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the \n          water. So, they all came (towards the water).\"\nThe \n          Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, \n          \"Ismaa\u2019eel's mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, \n          'Do you allow us to stay with you?' She replied, 'Yes, but you will \n          have no right to possess the water.' They agreed to that.\" Ibn \n          \u2018Abbaas said: the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further said, \"Ismaa\u2019eel's mother was pleased with \n          the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the \n          people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families \n          who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent \n          residents there. The child (i.e. Ismaa\u2019eel) grew up and learnt Arabic \n          from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he \n          grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry \n          a woman from amongst them.\u00a0 \nAfter Ismaa\u2019eel's mother had died, Ibraaheem \n          came after Ismaa\u2019eel's marriage in order to see his family that he had \n          left before\u2026\nThen \n          Ibraaheem came back later on. He saw Ismaa\u2019eel under a tree near Zam-zam, \n          sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibraaheem, he stood up to welcome \n          him, and they greeted each other as a father does with his son and a \n          son does with his father. Ibraaheem said, 'O Ismaa\u2019eel! Allah has given \n          me an order.' Ismaa\u2019eel said, 'Do what your Lord has ordered you to \n          do.' Ibraaheem asked, 'Will you help me?' Ismaa\u2019eel said, 'I will help \n          you.' Ibraaheem said, \u2018Allah has ordered me to build a house here,' \n          pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The \n          Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. \n          the Ka'bah). Ismaa\u2019eel brought the stones and Ibraaheem was building, \n          and when the walls became high, Ismaa\u2019eel brought this stone and put \n          it for Ibraaheem who stood on it and carried on building, while Ismaa\u2019eel \n          was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, \u2018Our \n          Lord!

        "question": "Celebrating completing the Qur\u2019aan (khatm al-Qur\u2019aan)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah., and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allaah.\n\u00a0Celebrating the completion of memorizing the Qur\u2019aan is not Sunnah, because nothing of that nature was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from any of his Sahaabah. Doing this on the grounds that it is part of religion is bid\u2019ah. But people do it as a customary expression of joy for the blessing of having memorized Qur\u2019aan, like celebrations for the return of one who has been away, or for finding work, or for moving to a new home. If the celebration for completing the Qur\u2019aan is of this nature, then there is nothing wrong with it. If a passage from the Qur\u2019aan is recited, from the beginning or the end, without having to recite a specific soorah or recite in a particular way such as joining the end to the beginning, then this is fine, because reciting from Qur\u2019aan is the best thing that can be done in a gathering and it is a reminder for those who are present. With regard to making du\u2019aa\u2019 when completing the recitation of the Qur\u2019aan, it was reported with a saheeh isnaad from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that when he completed the Qur\u2019aan, he would gather his family together and make du\u2019aa\u2019 with them. If the reader makes du\u2019aa\u2019 when he completes the Qur\u2019aan, and those who are present say \u201cAmeen\u201d to his du\u2019aa\u2019, this is fine.\n\u00a0With regard to calling the teacher \u201cshaykhah\u201d , there is nothing wrong with this. Now you know, may Allaah bless you, that there is no reason not to have the celebration you have described. There is no need to read from the end of the Mus-haf and then join it to the beginning. Doing something in this manner requires evidence (daleel), because reading Qur\u2019aan is an act of worship, and acts of worship must be done only in the manner in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did them, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cIndeed in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day, and remembers Allaah much\u201d [al-Ahzaab 33:21]\n\u00a0Written by Shaykh \u2018Abd-Al-Rahmaan al-Barraak\n\u00a0There is a hadeeth about the person who stops for a rest immediately carrying on, which was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) from Ibn \u2018Abbaas. According to this hadeeth, a man said, \u201cO Messenger of Allaah, which deed is most beloved to Allaah? He said, \u201cAl-haal al-murtahil.\u201d The man said, \u2018What is al-haal al-murtahil?\u201d He said, \u201cThe one who starts from the beginning of the Qur\u2019aan until he reaches the end, and when he stops for a rest, he immediately carries on.\u201d\n\u00a0But this hadeeth is da\u2019eef (weak), as al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) says after he quotes it: this is a ghareeb (strange) hadeeth which we only know from Ibn \u2018Abbaas with this isnaad, and this isnaad is not strong.\n\u00a0Hence Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-I\u2019laam (p.289, part2), after he mentioned this hadeeth: Some of them understood from this that when a person has finished reading the whole Qur\u2019aan, he should then read al-Faatihah and three verses of Soorat al-Baqarah, because he stopped when he completed it, and he continued when he started again. But none of the Sahaabah or Taabi\u2019een did this, and none of the imaams regarded it as mustahabb (encouraged). What is referred to in the hadeeth is when a person returns from one military campaign and immediately joins another, or every time he completes one good deed, he starts another which he\u00a0 completes as he did the first one. But what some readers do is not what was meant in the hadeeth at all. And Allaah is the source of strength."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is a false and incorrectstatement made by those who try to find faults with\n      Islam so as to put people off this religion. It is sufficient to know that\n      Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur\u2019aan, as He says\n      (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cVerily,\n      We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur\u2019aan) and surely,\n      We will guard it (from corruption).\u201d [al-Hijr 15:9]\n\u00a0Moreover, the fact that the transmission\n      of the Qur\u2019aan by memory and in writing was mutawaatir \u2013 narrated by\n      groups to groups [to such anextent\n      that so many people could not conceivably have agreed upon a lie] \u2013 is\n      well known to anyone who has the slightest acquaintance with Islamic\n      knowledge, especially knowledge of recitations and reciters. \n\u00a0There are still many people nowadays who\n      have learned the Qur\u2019aan orally, with isnaads directly going back to the\n      Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\n\u00a0One of the miracles of Allaah\u2019s\n      protection of the Qur\u2019aan is the fact that those who try to tamper with\n      it are always found out.\n\u00a0The point is, everything that was\n      revealed to the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\n      was written down in front of him straight away, and some of the Sahaabah\n      had masaahif (written copies\n      of the Qur\u2019aan). After the death of the Prophet \n (peace and\n      blessings of Allaah be upon him), thefirst khaleefah, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with\n      him) gathered the Qur\u2019aan inwritten\n      and kept it. Then the third khaleefah, \u2018Uthmaan ibn \u2018Affaan (may\n      Allaah be pleased with him) compiled it in mus-hafs that were based on the\n      mus-haf compiled by Abu Bakr, in addition to what had been memorized.\nWhen\n      we realize that the Qur\u2019aan was written down and compiled by the\n      Sahaabah, and \u2018Uthmaan sent copies of the Mus-haf during his reign to\n      all the main centres of Islam, so that it would be a reference for them,\n      and there were no disputes concerning them, then how can we say that there\n      is no written trace of the Qur\u2019aan in the seventh century? Moreover,\n      there are several ancient manuscripts of the Qur\u2019aan in libraries and\n      museums which bear visible testimony to the fact that nothing has been\n      changed in the Book of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the\n      meaning):\n\u201cAnd\n      verily, it is an honourable well\u2011fortified respected Book (because\n      it is Allaah\u2019s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption).\n      Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down\n      by the All\u2011Wise, Worthy of all\n      praise (Allaah).\u201d [Fussilat 41:41-42]\n      \n      \n      \n      And Allaah knows best."

((Al-Sharh al-Mumti\u2019 by Ibn \u2018Uthaymin, 3/110)\nWhat is Tankis al-Kalimat (inversion of words)?\nTankis al-Kalimat (inversion of words) means putting a later word before a previous word, for example, instead of Qul huwa Allahu ahad, one reads Ahad Allah huwa qul!\nThis also is undoubtedly haram, because it changes the Quran from the way in which it was spoken by Allah. (Al-Sharh al-Mumti\u2019, 3/110)\nWhat is Tankis al-Ayat (inversion of verses)?\nTankis al-Aayat (inversion of verses) means reciting a later ayah before a previous ayah, for example, reciting min sharr il-waswas il-khannas before ilah il-nas!\nConcerning this, al-Qadi \u2018Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cThere is no dispute concerning the order of the verses in each Surah. This is something which is tawqifi, i.e., based on revelation [and is not open to ijtihad], and the order is that which now appears in the Mus-haf, and this is how the ummah transmitted it from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\u201d (Sharh al-Nawawi, 6/62. This was also the view of Ibn al-\u2019Arabi, as stated in al-Fath, 2/257)\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin said:\nTankis al-ayat (inverting verses) is also haram according to the most correct view, because the order of the verses is tawqifi (something which is based on revelation [and not open to ijtihad]). The meaning of tawqifi is that it was dictated by the order of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Al-Sharh al-Mumti\u2019, 3/110)\nWhat is Tankis al-Suwar (inversion of Surahs)?\nTankis al-Suwar (inversion of Surahs) means, reciting later Surahs before earlier ones, for example, reciting Al \u2018Imran before al-Baqarah.\nRuling on Tankis al-Suwar\nThose scholars who say that the order of Surahs is not tawqifi do not see anything wrong with this.\nThose who think that it is tawqifi or that the consensus of the Companions on the order of Surahs is evidence, do not think that it is permissible.\nThe correct view is that the order of Surahs is not tawqifi; it is the result of ijtihad on the part of some of the Companions.\nThere was no ijma` (consensus) among the Companions on the order of Surahs; the order in the Mus-haf of \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Mas\u2019ud for example is different from that in the Mus-hafs of others.\nIn the Sunnah there is evidence that supports the view that it is permissible:\nHudhayfah said: I prayed with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one night, and he started to recite al-Baqarah. I thought he would do ruku\u2019 when he reached one hundred ayas, but he kept going. I thought he would complete it in one rak`ah, but he kept going. I thought, he would do ruku\u2019 now, but he started to recite al-Nisa, and he recited all of it, then he started to recite Al Imran and recited all of it. (Narrated by Muslim, 772).\nThe evidence in this hadith is that he recited al-Nisa then Al Imran.\nAl-Nawawi said:\n\u201cAl-Qadi \u2018Iyad said: this contains evidence for those who say that the order of Surahs is the result of ijtihad on the part of the Muslims when they wrote down the Mus-haf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not dictate the order of Surahs; he entrusted this task to his ummah after his death. This is the view of Malik and the majority of the scholars, and was the view favoured by al-Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqillani. Ibn al-Baqillani said: it is the more correct of the two views, although both are possible.\nHe said: what we say is that the order of Surahs is not binding when writing, praying, studying, teaching or learning. There is no report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning that which would make it forbidden to differ from it. Hence the order of Surahs in the various Mus-hafs differed, before the Mus-haf of \u2018Uthman.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the ummah after him in all ages regarded it as permissible to differ from the order of Surahs in prayer , and when studying and teaching.\nHe said: with regard to the view of those scholars who say that (the order of Surahs) was set by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and that he put them in the same order as appears in the Mus-haf of \u2018Uthman and that the different orders came about before they heard of his ruling and his final review of the Quran with Jibril they interpret the fact that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited al-Nisa first and then Al Imran as meaning that this happened before the final ruling was dictated, and these two Surahs appear in this order in the Mus-haf of Ubayy.\nHe said: there is no dispute concerning the fact that a person who is praying may recite in the second rak`ah a Surah which comes before the Surah which he recited in the first rak`ah; but it is makruh to do this in one rak`ah, or when reciting Quran outside of prayer.\nHe said: but some of them permitted this.\nThe prohibition of the Salaf against reading the Quran backwards is interpreted as referring to those who read from the end of a Surah to the beginning.\nHe said: there is no dispute concerning the fact that the order of verses in each Surah is based on revelation from Allah and is as it now appears in the Mus-haf and as it was transmitted by the ummah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\u201d (End of the comments of al-Qadi \u2018Iyad). And Allah knows best.\u201d (Sharh Muslim, 6/61, 62)\nAl-Sindi said:\nThe phrase [in the hadith of Hudhayfah] then he started to recite Al \u2018Imran means that it is not obligatory to follow the order of Surahs when reciting. (Sharh al-Nasai, 3/226)\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was reported from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man from among the Ansar used to lead them in prayer in the mosque of Quba. Every time he led them in prayer, he would start his recitation with Qul huwa Allahu ahad, then when he finished it, he would recite another Surah. He did that in every rak`ah. His companions spoke with him and said, You always start with this Surah, then you do not think it is enough and you recite another. Either you should recite this Surah alone, or you should leave it and recite another. He said, I am not going to stop reciting it. If you like, I will lead you in prayer as I have been doing, and if you do not like it, I will leave you. They felt that he was one of the best of them, and they did not want anyone else to lead them in prayer. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to them, they told him about this. He said, O So and So, what is stopping you from doing what your companions tell you? What makes you keep on reciting this Surah in every rak`ah? He said, I love it. He said, Your love for it will grant you admittance to Paradise. (Narrated by al-Bukhari mu\u2019allaqan, and by al-Tirmidhi with an isnad similar to that of al-Bukhari, 2901).\nThe evidence in this report is the fact that the man recited Surat al-Ikhlas in his prayer before any other Surah that comes before it (in the Mus-haf), and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of that.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is the action of \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).\nAl-Imam al-Bukhari said:\n\u201cAl-Ahnaf recited al-Kahf in the first rak`ah and Yusuf or Yunus in the second, and he said that he had prayed Fajr with \u2018Umar and he had done the same.\u201d (Bab al-Jam\u2019 bayna Suratayn fil-Rak`ah, in Kitab al-Adhan)\nWith regard to the latter part of your question, we say:\nIt is permissible to recite verses 50-60 of al-Baqarah in the first rak`ah, then to recite verses 1-20 of al-Baqarah in the second rak`ah, because then the meaning of the passage will be complete.\nBut reciting verses 10-20 means that one is cutting off the meaning, so it is better not to do this. Perhaps you mentioned the numbers only by way of example and you did not mean these particular verses.\nFor more, please see these answers: 20043 , 69915 , 171060 , and 7198 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Hanging plaques and cloths containing verses of the Quran in homes , schools, social clubs and places of business, involves a number of reservations and prohibitions according to Islam, such as the following:\n\nIn most cases, hanging such things on the wall is done for purposes of decoration and adornment, as the verses etc. are written in calligraphy and colorful brocade. This is an inappropriate use of the Quran, as it was revealed to guide people and to be read regularly. The Quran was not revealed to decorate walls, but to guide mankind.\nSome people hang up such things for blessing - which is a form of worship. The blessing as described in Islam comes from reading or reciting the Quran, not from hanging it up or placing it on shelves or turning it into artwork and three-dimensional images.\nThis is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Khalifas (al-Khulafa al-Rashidun), may Allah be pleased with them, who never did such a thing. The best way is to follow them, not to introduce innovations in religion. History tells us that in places such as Andalusia, Turkey, etc., the adornment of houses and mosques with ornate carvings of verses only happened at times when the Muslims were weak and humiliated.\nHanging up such pictures or plaques could lead to shirk, because some people think that these things are amulets that will protect the house and its people from evil and disease. This is shirk and is haram, because the One Who really offers protection is Allah, may He be glorified, and one of the means of gaining His protection is sincere recitation of the Quran and du\u2019as taught in the Quran and Sunnah.\nThere is the risk that the Quran may be used, in such cases, as a means of promoting one's business or increasing one's earnings. The Quran should be protected from being used for such purposes. It is well-known that the production and sale of these pictures and plaques involves a great deal of extravagance and wasting money.\nMany of these plaques are painted with real gold, which makes using them and hanging them up even more haram.\nMany of these plaques involve a kind of carelessness, because the letters are twisted into complex designs that are of no benefit to anyone because they are barely legible. Sometimes words are fashioned into the shape of a bird or a man prostrating, and similarly forbidden pictures of animate beings.\nVerses and surahs of the Quran are exposed to misuse and abuse by this practice. For example, when moving house, they are piled up with the rest of the furniture and belongings, and other objects may be placed on top of them. This also happens when they are taken down so that the wall may be painted or cleaned.\nSome Muslims whose observance of Islam is lacking put these plaques and pictures up so that they can feel that they are doing something religious, in order to reduce their feelings of guilt in spite of the fact that this practice does not help them in any way.\n\nAll in all, we must close the doors of evil and follow the leaders of guidance of the early centuries of Islam, whose people the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) testified were the best of the Muslims in faith and practice. If someone were to say, We are not going to abuse it or make it a decoration or exaggerate about it, we only want to remind people (about their religion) in our gatherings, our response would be: if we look at real life, will we find that this is what actually happens? Do people really remember Allah? Do they even read these verses when they raise their heads?\nWhat really happens is the opposite: people go against the words hanging over their heads, they still tell lies, engage in gossip, make fun of others and do and say evil things. Even if we assume that there are some who do benefit from these plaques etc., the fact is that they are very few, and this does not change the Islamic ruling on the matter.\nThe Muslims must turn to the Book of Allah, read it and recite it, and act in accordance with it. We ask Allah to make the Quran a light of guidance for us, and a means of removing our grief and anxiety. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\nFor more, please see these answers: 39185 , 13648 and 170060 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Which is better,    to recite Quran from the Mushaf or from memory?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If one is reciting Quran in situations other than in prayer, then reading from the Mushaf is better, because it is more accurate and helps one to remember better. But if reciting from memory is easier and helps one to concentrate more and have better presence of mind (khushoo\u2019), then one should recite from memory.\nIn prayer, however, it is better to recite from memory, because if a person recites from the Mushaf, he will be doing repeated actions such as holding the Mushaf, putting it down, turning its pages and looking at the letters. By doing so he will miss out on putting his right hand over his left hand on his chest when standing during the prayer, or spreading out his arms during rukoo\u2019 and sujood, if he puts the Mushaf under his arm. Hence we think that it is preferable for a person who is praying to recite from memory rather than from the Mushaf.\nWe see some people when they pray behind the imaam, carrying the Mushaf and following the imaam\u2019s recitation. This is something which should not be done, for the reasons we have referred to above, and because they do not need to do anything except follow the imaam.\nHowever, if the imaam does not have such a good memory, and he says to one of the members of the congregation, \u201cPray behind me, and follow me (my recitation) in the Mushaf, and if I make a mistake, correct me,\u201d then there is nothing wrong with this."

        "question": "Rulings of al-Madd\r\n    in Qur\u2019aan recitation",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This symbol \"~\" is used to indicate places where a Madd\n    (elongation) that is longer than the regular elongation is required. It is used in places\n    where the Madd is compulsory (Madd laazim), as in the word \"At-Taammah \", where\n    the elongation is six harakaat or counts. One harakah is equal to the time taken to curl\n    or stretch one finger. This symbol is also used for al-Madd al-Muttasal (where a long\n    vowel is followed by a hamzah in one word), such as \"sawaa'un 'alaynaa \", where\n    the Madd is between four and six harakaat. And it is used for al-Madd al-Munfassal, (where\n    one word ends with a long vowel and is immediately followed by a word that starts with a\n    hamzah), as in the phrase \"fee aadhaaninaa waqar \", where the Madd is four or\n    five harakaat.\n    This symbol does not have any effect on the meanings of the words; it is only used to\n    indicate some kinds of Madds or elongations, as explained above. The Madd which is longer\n    than the regular elongation (two harakaat) does not change the meaning when you do it. But\n    we have to follow the Sunnah of recitation, and the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of\n    Allaah be upon him) used to elongate some vowels in his recitation. And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "How Was the Order of the Quran Determined?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Order of verses in one Surah\nThe fact there is scholarly consensus, and many texts stating the order of verses in one Surah, that is very well known. The consensus was reported by many scholars, including Al-Zarkashi in al-Burhan and Abu Ja\u2019far, who said: \u201cThe order of the verses in their Surahs came about because this is how it was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and there is no dispute among the Muslims with regard to this matter.\u201d\nThe texts regarding this matter include the following:\n\nThe report narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai, Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim from Ibn `Abbas, who said: \u201cI said to \u2018Uthman, \u2018What made you put al-Anfal which is one of the Mathani, next to Bara-ah [al-Tawbah], which is one of the Mi\u2019in? Why did you not put the line Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim in between them when you put it at the beginning of the rest of al-Sab\u2019 al-Tiwal [the long seven Surahs]?\u201d \u2018Uthman said: \u201cThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to receive revelation of Surahs with many verses. When they were revealed, he would call his scribes and tell them, \u2018Put these verses in the Surah where such-and-such is mentioned.\u2019 Al-Anfal was one of the first Surahs to be revealed in Madinah, and Bara-ah (al-Tawbah) was one of the last parts of the Quran to be revealed. Its stories were similar to the stories mentioned in al-Anfal, so it was thought that it was part of it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken [i.e., died] without explaining whether it was indeed part of it, so they were put next to one another, and the line Bismillahir Rahman ir\u2019Rahim was not written between them, and it [al-Tawbah] was put among the Sab\u2019 al-Tiwal [seven long Surahs].\u201d (Al-Hakim said: its isnad is sahih, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Al-Mustadrak, 2/330)\nAhmad narrated in al-Musnad (4/218) with a hasan isnad from \u2018Uthman ibn Abi\u2019l-\u2018As that he said: \u201cI was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he fixed his gaze on something, then lowered his gaze until he was almost looking at the ground, then he gazed at something. He said, \u2018Jibril (peace be upon him) came to me and told me to put this verse in this place in this Surah: \u201cVerily, All\u00e2h enjoins Al-\u2018Adl (i.e. justice and worshipping none but All\u00e2h Alone Isl\u00e2mic Monotheism) and Al-Ihs\u00e2n [i.e. to be patient in performing your duties to All\u00e2h, totally for All\u00e2h\u2019s sake and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet in a perfect manner], and giving (help) to kith and kin (i.e. all that All\u00e2h has ordered you to give them, e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of help), and forbids Al-Fahsh\u00e2 (i.e. all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false witness, to kill a life without right), and Al-Munkar (i.e. all that is prohibited by Isl\u00e2mic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every kind of evil deeds), and Al-Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression). He admonishes you, that you may take heed.\u201d [al-Nahl 16:90 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning].\u2019\u201d\nAl-Bukhari narrated in al-Sahih (no. 4536) that Ibn Abi Malikah said: \u201cIbn al-Zubayr said: \u2018I said to \u2018Uthman, \u201cThis verse that is in al-Baqarah (interpretation of the meaning), \u2018And those of you who die and leave wives behind them \u2026 And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year\u2019s maintenance and residence without turning them out\u2019 [al-Baqarah 2:234-240] has been abrogated by the other, so why are you writing it down?\u201d He said, \u201cLeave it as it is, my nephew, I will not change anything from its place.\u201d\u2019\u201d\nMuslim narrated (no. 1617) that \u2018Umar said: \u201cI did not ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about anything more than I asked him about al-Kalalah [those who die leaving neither ascendants nor descendents as heirs], until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said, \u201cIs not ayat al-sayf at the end of Surat al-Nisa enough for you?\u201d\nThere are also the hadiths about the verses at the end of Surat al-Baqarah.\nMuslim narrated (no. 809) from Abu al-Darda that whoever memorizes the first ten verses of Surat al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjal; according to another version, whoever recites the last ten verses will be protected.\n\nThe Prophet\u2019s recitation of various Surahs in the presence of his Companions indicates that the order of their verses is something that was instituted and commanded by him, and that the Companions did not put the verses in a different order from that in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite them. The reports to that effect reach the level of Mutawatir.\nAl-Qadi Abu Bakr said in al-Intisar:\u00a0\n\u201cThe order of the verses is something that is obligatory and binding. Jibril used to say (to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)), \u2018Put such and such an verse in such and such a place.\u2019\u201d\nHe also said:\n\u00a0\u201cWhat we think is that all of the Quran which Allah revealed and commanded that it should be written down, and which was not abrogated after being revealed, is that which is contained between the covers of the Mus-haf of \u2018Uthman, and that there is nothing lacking or added to it. Its order is the same as that commanded by Allah, may He be exalted, and instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Nobody has moved any verse backwards or forwards. The Ummah learned from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the order of the verses of each Surah properly, just as they learned from him the correct pronunciation and recitation.\u201d\nAl-Baghawi said in Sharh al-Sunnah:\u00a0\n\u201cThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to instruct his Companions and teach them what was revealed to him of the Quran in the order in which it appears in our Mus-hafs now, the order which Jibril taught him. When each verse was revealed, Jibril would tell him, this verse is to be written after such and such a verse in Surah such and such. Thus it is clear that the efforts of the Companions were limited solely to gathering the Quran in one place, not to arranging its order. The Quran is written on al-Lawh al-Mahfuz in this order, then Allah sent it down in its entirety to the first heaven, whence it was revealed in stages as it was needed, and the order in which it was revealed is not the order in which it is recited.\u201d\nOrder of Surahs in the Quran\nWith regard to the order of Surahs, was this also instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or was this the ijtihad of the Companions? With regard to this question, there were differences among the scholars. The majority of scholars, including Malik and al-Qadi Abu Bakr, according to one of his two opinions, favoured the second opinion.\nIbn Faris said:\u00a0\n\u201cThere were two aspects to the compilation of the Quran. One was putting the Surahs in a certain order, such as putting al-Sab\u2019 al-Tiwal (the seven long Surahs) first, and following them with the Mi\u2019in, which is what the Companions did. The second aspect is the compilation of the verses within the Surahs. This was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who recited them as he was told to by Jibreel, on the command of his Lord. On this basis, the Salaf differed as to the order in which the Surahs should appear. Some of them put them in order of revelation, which was the mus-haf of \u2018Ali, which started with Iqra (al-\u2018Alaq), then al-Muddaththir, then Nun (al-Qalam), then al-Muzzammil, and so on. The Mus-haf of Ibn Mas\u2019ud started with al-Baqarah, then al-Nisa, then Al \u2018Imran, with other major differences. The Mus-haf of Ubayy was similar.\u201d\nAl-Karmani said in al-Burhan: the order of the Surahs as it is now is the same as that in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz which is with Allah. This is the order in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to review the Surahs of the Quran he had received so far with Jibril each year. In the year in which he died, he reviewed it with him twice, and the last verses to be revealed were (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018And be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah\u2026\u2019 [al-Baqarah 2:281]. Jibril commanded the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to put this between the verses dealing with riba and those dealing with loans.\u201d\nAl-Zarkashi said in al-Burhan: \u201cThe difference between the two views is one of wording. Those who support the second view say that it was taught to them so that they could learn the reasons of Revelation and the sequence of the words. Hence Malik said that they compiled the Quran according to what they had heard from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as well as saying that the order of the Surahs was the product of their ijtihad. He said that the dispute boils down to one question which is: was this a verbal instruction of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or were they merely referring to what he used to do, which would give them room for ijtihad.\u201d\nAl-Bayhaqi said in al-Madkhil: \u201cAt the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Surahs and verses of the Quran were in this order, except for al-Anfal and Bara-ah (al-Tawbah), as we see from the hadith of \u2018Uthman referred to above.\u201d\nIbn \u2018Atiyah said: \u201cThe order of many of the Surahs was known during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as the seven long Surahs, those that begin with Ha\u2019-Mim, and al-Mufassal. With regard to the others, it may be the case that it was left for the Ummah to determine their order after he died.\u201d\nAbu Ja\u2019far said: \u201cThe reports support most of what Ibn \u2018Atiyah said, and a little is left which is open to debate, such as the hadith, \u2018Recite the two shining ones, al-Baqarah and Al \u2018Imran.\u2019\u201d (Reported by Muslim, no. 804)\nAl-Bukhari narrated (no. 4739) that \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Mas\u2019ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u201cBani Israil (al-Isra), al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta-Ha and al-Anbiya, these are among the earliest and most beautiful Surahs and they are my treasures,\u201d (meaning, these are among the earliest I recited).\nAbu Ja\u2019far al-Nahhas al-Mukhtar said that the Surahs were compiled in this order from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) because of the hadith of Wathilah, \u201cIn place of the Tawrat I was given the seven long Surahs.\u201d He said: \u201cThis hadith indicates that the order of the Quran was taken from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nIbn Hajar said, \u201cthe fact that the Surahs, or most of them, are in a given order does not contradict the idea that this was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). What proves that this was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the report narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud from Aws ibn Hudhayfah, who said: \u2018We asked the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the morning, \u201cHow did you write down the Quran in chapters?\u201d They said, \u201cWe wrote it down in chapters of six Surahs, five Surahs, seven Surahs, nine Surahs, eleven Surahs and thirteen Surahs, and the chapter of al-Mufassal, from Qaf until the end. This indicates that the order of the Surahs \u2013 as it appears in the Mus-haf now \u2013 existed at the time of the Messenger of Allah, or it is possible that what was known in order at that time was Hizb al-Mufassal specifically, which is not the case with the rest.\u201d\n(See al-Itqan fi \u2018Ulum al-Quran by al-Suyuti, 1/62-65)\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Verses of Sujud al-Tilawah in the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Sujud in the Quran\nThere are fifteen places in the Quran where we should perform sajdat al-tilawah (prostration of recitation) when reciting them.\u00a0\n\u2018Amr ibn al-\u2019As narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited to him fifteen verses in the Quran where one should prostrate, three of which are in al-Mufassal and two in Surat al-Hajj. It was reported by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, al-Hakim and al-Daraqutni, and classed as hasan by al-Mundhiri and al-Nawawi.\u00a0\nVerses of sujud al-tilawah\nThe fifteen verses of sujud al-tilawah are:\n\nSurely those who are with your Lord (angels) are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him, but they glorify His Praise and prostrate before Him. [al-A'raf 7:206]\nAnd unto Allah (Alone) falls in prostration whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the mornings and in the afternoons. [al-Ra\u2019d 13:15]\nAnd to Allah prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the live moving creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e., they worship their Lord (Allah) with humility]. [al-Nahl 16:49]\nSay (O Muhammad): Believe in it (the Quran) or do not believe (in it). Verily! Those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in humble prostration. [al-Isra 17:107-109]\nWhen the Verses of the Most Beneficent (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping. [Maryam 19:58]\nSee you not that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and al-dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified. And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily! Allah does what He wills. [al-Hajj 22:18]\nO you who believe! Bow down, and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord and do good that you may be successful. [al-Hajj 22:77]\nAnd when it is said to them: Prostrate to the Most Beneficent (Allah)! They say, And what is the Most Beneficent? Shall we fall down in prostration to that which you (O Muhammad) command us? And it increases in them only aversion. [al-Furqan 25:60]\n[As Shaytan has barred them from Allah's Way] so that they do not worship (prostrate before) Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal. [al-Naml 27:25, 26]\nOnly those believe in Our ayat (verses, signs, etc.) who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate, and glorify the Praises of their Lord, and they are not proud. [al-Sajdah 32:15]\nAnd Dawud guessed that We had tried him and he sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allah) in repentance. [Sad 38:24]\nAnd from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate to Him Who created them, if you (really) worship Him. [Fussilat 41:37, 38]\nSo fall down in prostration to Allah, and worship Him (Alone). [al-Najm 53:62]\nAnd when the Quran is recited to them, they fall not prostrate. [al-Inshiqaq 84:21]\nFall prostrate and draw near to Allah! [al-\u2019Alaq 96:19] (See Fiqh al-Sunnah by Sheikh Sayyid Sabiq, 186-188)\n\nScholarly views of the narration of \u2018Amr ibn Al-\u2019As about sujud al-tilawah\nAl-Albani said, in Tamam al-Minnah (296):\nOn the contrary, the hadith is not hasan, because it includes two majhul [unknown] narrators. Al-Hafiz said in al-Talkhis, after quoting the opinion of al-Mundhiri and al-Nawawi that it is hasan: \u2018Abd al-Haqq and Ibn Qattan classed it as da\u2019if [weak]. It includes \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Munayn, who is majhul, and the one who narrated from him is al-Harith ibn Sa\u2019id al-Atqi, who is also unknown. Ibn Makula said: He did not narrate any hadith apart from this one.\u201d\nHence al-Tahawi was of the opinion that there is no second sajdah in Surat al-Hajj, towards the end of the surah. This is also the opinion of Ibn Hazm who said in al-Muhalla:\n\u201cBecause it is not narrated in any sahih report that this was the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there is no scholarly consensus to this effect. But it was reported with a sahih isnad that \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab, his son \u2018Abd-Allah and Abu Darda performed sajdah in (the second verse quoted from Surat al-Hajj).\u201d\nThen Ibn Hazm discussed whether the sajdahs for the other verses quoted are prescribed in Islam. He mentioned that the scholars are agreed upon the first ten, that performing sujud when reciting these verses is prescribed.\n\u00a0Al-Tahawi also reported this consensus in Sharh al-Ma\u2019ani (1/211), but he said that the sajdah in Surat Fussilat was prescribed, instead of the sajdah in Surat Sad.\u00a0\nBoth scholars narrated ahadith with sahih isnads from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the sajdahs in Sad, al-Najm, al-Inshiqaq and al-\u2019Alaq. These last three are from the Mufassal, which is referred to in the hadith of \u2018Amr mentioned above.\nIn conclusion, even though the isnad of the hadith is weak, it is supported by the consensus of the ummah which supports most of it, and by sahih ahadith which support the rest of it, except for the second sajdah in Suat al-Hajj, for which there is no evidence in the Sunnah or in the consensus of the scholars. But some of the Sahabah used to prostrate when reciting it, which could be taken as evidence, especially since no one is known to have disputed with them in this regard.\nTo sum up, the prostration of recitation should be performed when reciting the fifteen verses quoted above.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "What is the ruling    on hanging up aayaat for protection?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The ruling on placing the Mus-haf (copy of the Quran) in cars to ward off the evil eye and for protection from danger is a bidah. The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) never carried the Mus-haf to ward off danger or the evil eye. If it is bidah, then we should remember that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Every bidah is a going-astray and every going-astray will lead to Hell.\n(Telephone conversation with Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen) (al-Bida wal-Muhdathaat wa maa laa aslun lahu, p. 259).\nShaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked the following question: Some people hang up aayaat of the Quran and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the rooms of their homes or in restaurants or offices. In some hospitals and doctors offices they hang the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me [al-Shuara 26:80], and so on. Is this considered to be the use of amulets which is forbidden in shareeah, knowing that the intention behind it is to seek blessings and ward off the shayaateen, or to remind the forgetful and warn the negligent? Is it like using amulets to put the Mus-haf in one's car in order to seek blessings?\nHis Eminence replied as follows:\nIf the intention is as described, to remind people and teach them something beneficial, then there is no harm in that. But if they believe that it is a protection against the shayaateen or jinn, then I know of no basis for this. By the same token, there is no basis for putting the Mus-haf in one's car to protect it, and doing so is not allowed, but if a person puts it in his car so that he can read it sometimes or so that some of his passengers can read it, then this is good and there is nothing wrong with it.

If what is meant is that\n    they recite it all together, in unison, pausing and stopping at the same time, then this\n    is not prescribed in Islam and at the very least it is makrooh (disliked), because it is\n    not reported that the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his\n    Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) did any such thing.

        "question": "Will a person be\r\n    rewarded for reading Qur\u2019aan even if he does not know the meaning of what he reads?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Holy Qur\u2019aan is blessed, as Allaah says\n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201c(This is) a Book (the Qur\u2019aan) which We have sent down to\n    you, full of blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding\n    may remember.\u201d[Saad 38:29]\nA man will be rewarded for reading it whether he understands its\n    meanings or not\u2026 But the believer should not read the Qur\u2019aan without\n    understanding at the time when he is responsible for his actions. If a person wants to\n    learn medicine, for example, and studies medical books, he cannot learn anything from them\n    unless he understands what they mean and it is explained to him. Indeed, he would very\n    keen to understand what they say so that he can put it into practice. So how about the\n    Book of Allaah which is healing for what is in people\u2019s hearts and exhortation for\n    all people? What about a person who reads it and does not understand or ponder its\n    meanings? The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) would not go beyond ten aayaat\n    until they had learnt them and understood the knowledge therein and how to act upon it. A\n    person will be rewarded for reading Qur\u2019aan whether or not he understands it, but he\n    should try his best to find out what it means and to seek this knowledge from scholars who\n    can be trusted. If he cannot easily find a scholar from whom he can learn, he should refer\n    to reliable books of Tafseer such as Tafseer Ibn Jareer, Tafseer Ibn Katheer, and others.\n    And Allaah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If the speakers are as you describe, under the feet and shoes of passengers, then tapes of Quran should not be played, because the fact that Quran is being heard from beneath people\u2019s feet or shoes is undoubtedly a kind of disrespect towards the Quran. If a person really must listen to Quran, let him lift the speakers up so that they are not at the same level as people\u2019s feet."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permitted to enter the bathroom with anything that has aayat from the Quran on it, because this could lead to disrespect of the Word of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Therefore, your wife should remove this necklace before entering the bathroom. Our advice is that women should not wear any jewellery with aayaat or duaas on it, because there are a number of reservations about this practice, of which wearing it when entering the bathroom is just one."

        "question": "The TenCommandments",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Thank you for your question, which shows an interest in the Quran. We are happy to answer your question here.\nThere are in the Quran certain aayaat (verses) which some scholars call the verses of the Ten Commandments, because they include ten important commandments given by Allaah to mankind. These aayaat are to be found in two passages of the Quran.\nThe first is in Soorat al-Anaam, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\nSay: Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty We provide sustenance for you and for them; come not near to al-fawaahish (shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse, etc.), whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand.\nAnd come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he (or she) attains the age of full strength; and give full measure and full weight with justice. We burden not any person, but that which he can bear. And whenever you give your word (i.e., judge between men or give evidence, etc.), say the truth even if a near relative is concerned, and fulfil the Covenant of Allaah. This He commands you, that you may remember.\nAnd, verily, this (i.e., Allaah's commandments mentioned in the above two verses) is my Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become al-muttaqoon (the pious). [al-Anaam 6:151-153]\nThe second passage occurs in Soorat al-Israa, and may be considered as a commentary on the passage quoted above. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\nAnd your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them, but address them in terms of honour.\nAnd lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was small.\nYour Lord knows best what is in your inner-selves. If you are righteous, then, verily, He is ever Most-Forgiving to those who turn unto Him again and again in obedience, and in repentance.\nAnd give to the kindred his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift.\nVerily, spendthrifts are brothers of the shayaateen (devils), and the Shaytaan (Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord.\nAnd if you turn away from them (kindred, poor, wayfarers, etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but if you have no money at the time they ask you for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then, speak unto them a soft kind word (i.e., Allaah will give to me and I will give to you).\nAnd let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, not stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.\nTruly, your Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Verily, He is Ever All-Knower, All-Seer of His slaves.\nAnd kill not your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely the killing of them is a great sin.\nAnd come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).\nAnd do not kill anyone which Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause. And whoever is killed (intentionally with hostility and oppression and not by mistake), We have given his heir the authority [to demand qisaas Law of Equality in punishment or to forgive, or to take Diya (blood money)]. But let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life (i.e., he should not kill except the killer only). Verily, he is helped (by the Islamic law).\nAnd come not near to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength. And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily! The covenant will be questioned about.\nAnd give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good (advantageous) and better in the end.\nAnd follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not or witness not, etc.) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those you will be questioned by Allaah.\nAnd walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth, nor can you attain a stature like that of the mountains in height.\nAll the bad aspects of these (the above mentioned things) are hateful to your Lord.\nThis is part of al-hikmah (wisdom, good manners and high character, etc.) which your Lord has inspired to you (O Muhammad). And set not up with Allaah any other ilaah (god) lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected (from Allaahs mercy). [al-Israa 17:23-39]\nPerhaps after enjoying reading these verses, you will have a better idea of the Quraan than before, and this will be the beginning of a fundamental change in your life, the start of your way to Islam. May Allaah guide and help you always. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.\n."

        "question": "Warning about Internet sites that distort the\r\n Qur\u2019aan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Before answering this question, we should advise you of the importance\n    of wisdom in denouncing evil, and of being careful not to inadvertantly promote\n    anti-Islamic websites so that everyone will go and read them, because this will indirectly\n    contribute to the promotion of these worthless people who claim to imitate the\n    Qur\u2019aan. \nProducing anything like the Qur\u2019aan is impossible, because Allaah\n    challenged anyone to do this. This challenge was issued to the most brilliant and eloquent\n    Arab poets at the time when the Qur\u2019aan was revealed, which was also the time when\n    Arabic eloquence was at its peak. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cLet\n    them then produce a recital like unto it (the Qur\u2019aan) if they are truthful.\u201d [al-Tur\n    52:34]\nWhen they could not do this, Allaah challenged them to produce ten\n    soorahs like its soorahs: \u201cOr they say: \u2018He (Muhammad) forged it (the\n    Qur\u2019aan).\u2019 Say: \u2018Bring you then ten forged soorahs (chapters) like unto it,\n    and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the\n    truth!\u2019\u201d [Hud 11:13 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning].\nWhen they could not do this, Allah challenged them to produce just\n    one soorah that contained the same eloquence and wisdom as the Qur\u2019aan. He said\n    (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cOr do they say: \u2018He (Muhammad) has forged\n    it\u2019? Say: \u2018Bring then a soorah (chapter) like unto it, and call upon whomsoever\n    you like, besides Allah, if you are truthful!\u201d [Yoonus 10:38]\nAllah called on them to seek help from whoever they wanted, and to\n    accept the challenge. He said (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd if you (Arab\n    pagans, Jews, Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our\n    slave (Muhammad), then produce a soorah of the like thereof and call your witnesses\n    (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:23]\nWhen they were unable to do this, Allah informed them that they\n    would never be able to do it, no matter who they called upon to help them. He said\n    (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSay: \u2018If mankind and jinn were together to\n    produce the like of this Qur\u2019aan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if\n    they helped one another.\u2019\u201d [al-Isra\u2019 17:88]\nThere is no one except Allah who can produce the like of the\n    Qur\u2019aan, because the Qur\u2019aan, as He says, is \u201ca Book, the Verses whereof\n    are perfected and then explained in detail from One Who is All-Wise and Well-Acquainted\n    (with all things).\u201d [Hud 11:1 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning].\nWhen some liars did try to imitate the Qur\u2019aan they came up\n    with ridicualous nonsense that would make children laugh, let alone mature and intelligent\n    adults. For example, the liar Musaylimah said: \u201cO frog, daughter of two frogs, croak\n    as much as you want, your upper part is in the water and your lower part is in the\n    mud.\u201d This is an example of the kind of thing said by him and other pretenders to\n    Prophethood. (See Sayd al-Khaatir by Ibn al-Jawzi, p. 404).\n    Some forms of falsehood may deceive some of the people\n    because of their ignorance and lack of understanding of the rules of grammar and accepted\n    styles of eloquence in Arabic. But anyone who has intelligence and common sense should at\n    least be able to see the difference and realize that these made-up words cannot possibly\n    be Qur\u2019aan. If we look at the Website referred to in the question, we see that kufr\n    is quite clearly mentioned in these fabricated soorahs, such as the statement that the\n    Messiah is the son of God or is God, and the promotion of the evil madhhab of Raafidah (a\n    kind of Shi\u2019ah), and other such nonsense. There are also some weird contradictions,\n    for example, these liars say in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called \u201csoorah\n    al-tajassud\u201d: \u201cExalted be He above taking any of His creation as a son,\u201d\n    but then we find in the so-called ninth aayah of the so-called \u201csoorah\n    al-eemaan\u201d the words: \u201cYou are he, the son of God, truly; in you we\n    believe.\u201d But verily Allah has spoken the truth when He said (interpretation of the\n    meaning): \u201cDo they not then consider the Qur\u2019aan carefully? Had it been from\n    other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions.\u201d [al-Nisaa\u2019\n    4:82]\nYou also find other silly comments in these made-up soorahs, such\n    as the claim that Allah permitted His Prophet to change whatever he wanted in the\n    Qur\u2019aan, as in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called \u201csoorah\n    al-wasaaya\u201d: \u201cAbrogate whatever you want to abrogate of the commands that We\n    have given you, for We permit you to make changes to Our decisions\u201d!\nEvery Muslim will realize the extent of the lies contained in these\n    words that come from this mind that is driven by ulterior motives. Have you ever seen\n    anything more foolish than these words? Allah has told us to adhere to His Book and put it\n    into practice, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd this is a blessed\n    Book which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah, that you may receive\n    mercy.\u201d [al-An\u2019aam 6:155] \nHe commanded His Messenger to adhere to the Qur\u2019aan, saying\n    (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSo hold you (Muhammad) to that which is inspired\n    in you. Verily, you are on a Straight Path.\u201d [al-Zukhruf 43:43]. \nAllah warned His Messenger not to fail in conveying the message\n    complete and unaltered, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cVerily, they\n    were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad), to\n    fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you\n    for a friend! And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a\n    little. In that case, We would have made you taste a double portion (of punishment) in\n    this life and a double portion (of punishment) after death. And then you would have found\n    none to help you against Us\u201d [al-Isra\u2019 17:73-75] and \u201c\u2026 if he\n    (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah), We surely should have seized\n    him by his right hand (or with power and might), and then certainly should have cut off\n    his life artery (aorta)\u201d [al-Haaqqah 69:44-46]. Having said all this, how can\n    there be any so-called soorah that says the messenger has the right to abrogate whatever\n    he wants in the Qur\u2019aan and that he has the authority to change or omit whatever\n    rules he wants??\nThe only One Who can abrogate whatever He wants of the Qur\u2019aan is\n    the One Who revealed it, may He be glorified, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAllah\n    blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the\n    Book\u201d [al-Ra\u2019d 13:39]; \n\u201cWhatever a Verse (revelation) We abrogate or cause to be\n    forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allah is able to do\n    all things?\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:106]. \nWe, like our Messenger, are obliged to understand and implement the\n    Qur\u2019aan without distorting, omitting or changing anything. Allah said (interpretation\n    of the meaning): \u201c(This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of\n    blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may\n    remember.\u201d [Saad 38:29].\nWe have seen in the false soorahs quoted on that Internet website a\n    real example of what is referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd\n    verily, among them is a party who distort the Book with their tongues (as they read), so\n    that you may think it is from the Book, but it is not from the Book, and they say:\n    \u2018This is from Allah,\u2019 but it is not from Allah; and they speak a lie against\n    Allah while they know it.\u201d [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:78]. \nWe ask Allah to make His Religion and His Book prevail and to make His\n    friends victorious, as We ask Him to defeat and humiliate His enemies and cause them to\n    fail. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

        "question": "Can one celebrate completing the\r\nQur\u2019aan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nThis is a wonderful thing for such a young person (11 years old) living in a non-Muslim\ncountry and deviant society to accomplish. The fact that she has not given her name is a\nsign of sincerity, in sha Allaah. I think that this should only be announced for the\npurposes of encouraging others to do the same. The affair should be limited to a small\ngathering where some relatives or friends invite a few of the girl\u2019s friends, tell\nthem of her achievement in completing the Qur\u2019aan in order to encourage them - not to\nshow off or boast - and some of the mothers say a few words about the greatness of the\nQur\u2019aan, the importance of reading it and how the Muslim should treat the\nQur\u2019aan. Or this girl could invite her friends to a meal to mark the occasion and\ngive thanks for this blessing. There is nothing wrong with such activities, as long as one\nis careful not to let it turn into a celebration. \nIt is clear from the above that celebrating a person\u2019s completion of reciting or\nmemorizing the Qur\u2019aan, inviting people and offering food, is an action in which\nthere is a risk of two fitnahs (temptations): \n(1) that it might be an occasion for showing off and boasting, and \n(2) that it may constitute bid\u2019ah, if people believe that such celebrations are part\nof the religion and must be held every time a person completes the reading of the\nQur\u2019aan. The first danger may be avoided by striving within oneself to be sincere\ntowards Allaah, and the second by restricting the invitees to a small number of family and\nfriends. \nWe should not hold such gatherings regularly, lest people think it is a part of the Sunnah\nI ask Allaah to increase His blessings upon you and to give you the strength to memorize\nQur\u2019aan and Sincerity in speech and deeds."

So the \nphrase \u2018If any of your women are guilty of lewdness\u2019 refers to adultery. \u2018Take the evidence of \nfour (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to \nhouses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way\u2019 - the \u2018other way\u2019 \nthat Allah made for them was the abrogation of this. Ibn \u2018Abbas, may Allah be pleased with \nhim, said: \u2018This was the ruling until Allah revealed Surat al-Nur, then this punishment was \nabrogated and replaced with whipping or stoning.\u2019 Something similar was reported from \n\u2018Ikrimah, Sa\u2018id ibn Jubayr, al-Hasan, \u2018Ataa\u2019 al-Khurasani, Abu Saalih, Qutaadah, Zayd ibn \nAslam and al-Dahhak, stating that this is abrogated, and this is agreed upon. Imam Ahmad said: \n\u2018Muhammad ibn Ja\u2018far told us that Sa\u2018id told us from Qutaadah from al-Hasan from Hattaan \nibn \u2018Abdullah al-Raqaashi from \u2018Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit who said: Whenever the wahy \n(revelation) descended upon the Messenger of Allah \n (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), it affected him, the stress showed on \nhim and his face would change. Allah sent a revelation to him one day, and when it was over, he \nsaid: \" Listen to me, Allah has made another way for them. (When) a married man (commits \nadultery) with a married woman, and an unmarried man with an unmarried woman, then in the \ncase of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to \ndeath), and in the case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile \nfor one year.\"\u2019 It was reported by Muslim and other narrators of Sunan via Qutaadah from \nal-Hasan from al-Hattan from \u2018Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit from the Prophet \n (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) with the wording: \n\u2018Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those \n(women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should \nreceive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male \ncommitting adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be \nstoned to death.\u2019 Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth.\" \nAl-Qurtubi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah:\n\"This [confinement] was the first punishment for adultery, at the beginning of Islam.

This ruling applied for \na while, then the Prophet \n (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said, according to the hadeeth narrated by \u2018Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit: \n\"Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those \n(women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should \nreceive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male \ncommitting adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be \nstoned to death.\" Some of the scholars said: the idea of punishment and shame was still there \nwith the lashing, because there is no contradiction, and they are applied to one person. As for \nconfinement, this is abrogated, by the consensus of the scholars. And Allah knows best. \nTo complete the benefit of what has been said, it is appropriate to learn the tafseer of the next \naayah in Surat al-Nisaa\u2019:\n\"If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, \nleave them alone; for Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful.\" [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:16]\nIbn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer of this aayah:\n\"\u2018If two men among you are guilty of lewdness\u2019 means two who commit an immoral act, so \nthey should be punished. Ibn \u2018Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Sa\u2018eed ibn Jubayr and \nothers said: i.e., by putting them to public shame and hitting them with shoes. This was the \nruling until Allah abrogated it and replaced it with lashing and stoning. \u2018Ikrimah, \u2018Ataa\u2019, \nal-Hasan and \u2018Abdullah ibn Katheer said: \u2018This was revealed concerning a man and a woman \nwho commit adultery. The phrase \u2018if they repent and amend\u2019 means if they give up what they \nwere doing and mend their ways. \u2018Leave them alone\u2019 means not to keep rebuking them with \nugly words after that, because the one who has repented from his sin is like one who never \nsinned at all. \u2018Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful\u2019 - it was proven in the two Saheehs: \u2018If the \nslave woman of one of you commits adultery, apply the punishment of lashing, and do not \nblame her (after that)\u2019 - i.e., do not blame her for what she did after the punishment has been \ngiven, because the punishment is an expiation for her deed.\u2019\""
