        "question": "Is it permissible for the mother to take some of the wealth of her children who are in her custody?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that the mother who has custody of her children does not have the right to take anything from her children\u2019s maintenance money in return for taking care of them; rather she is entrusted with the money that is sent for her children\u2019s maintenance and is expected to dispose of it according to what is in their best interests.\nAd-Dardir al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said: She does not have the right to spend any of her child\u2019s maintenance money on herself in return for taking care of the child. End quote from Bulghat as-Salik li Aqrab al-Masalik (2/765).\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible for the father and mother to take from their children\u2019s wealth for their needs, so long as it does not harm the children.\nIt was narrated from \u2018A\u2019ishah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: \u201cA man\u2019s son is part of his earnings, among the best of his earnings, so you may take from their wealth.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawud (3529); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIbn al-Amir as-San\u2018ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is soundly narrated from Abu\u2019z-Zubayr that he heard Jabir ibn \u2018Abdillah say: The father and mother may take from their child\u2019s wealth without his permission.\nEnd quote from Risalah Latifah fi Sharh Hadith Anta wa Maluka li Abik (p. 24). The report was narrated by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla with his isnad (6/385).\nIt was narrated that \u2018Aa\u2019ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cYour children are a gift from Allah to you, {He gives to whom He wills female [children], and He gives to whom He wills males} [al-Shoora 42:49]. They and their wealth are yours if you need it.\u201d Narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (3123), who said: It is sahih according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim. Also narrated by al-Bayhaqi in al-Kubra (15745). Classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (2564). See the commentary of Shu\u2018ayb al-Arna\u2019ut et al. on Sunan Ibn Majah, hadith no. 2137.\nAs-Sawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that it is permissible for the mother to take from her child\u2019s wealth, if she is in difficulty, and she does not regard it as being in return for looking after the child:\nShe does not have the right to spend on herself in return for looking after the child.\nBut if it is for another reason \u2013 meaning that she takes it for a reason other than looking after the child \u2013 and is in difficulty, then she may spend on herself from the child\u2019s wealth, whether what she takes is less than the going rate for looking after the child or more than that, because she is entitled to maintenance even if she does not look after the child.\nEnd quote from Hashiyat as-Sawi \u2018ala ash-Sharh as-Saghir (2/765).\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: The father has the right to take from his child\u2019s wealth so long as it will not harm the child or take what the child needs, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe best of what you consume is your earnings, and your children are among your earnings.\u201d And he said: \u201cYou and your wealth belong to your father.\u201d This undoubtedly refers to the father\u2019s rights, but it also includes the mother\u2019s rights, because she is like the father according to the correct view. So she may take from her child\u2019s wealth that which will benefit her and meet her needs, so long as that will not be detrimental to the child and what she takes is not needed by him.\nEnd quote from al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan.\nBased on the above:\nIt is permissible for you to take from your children\u2019s wealth to pay for medical treatment, on condition that that will not harm the children. In other words, that should only be after ensuring that the children have enough.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "My sister is suffering because of her husband; can I advise her to seek a divorce?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the situation is as described in the question, undoubtedly this is one of the troubles of life. It is not appropriate for a man whom Allah has enjoined to be in charge of his household, spend on them and shoulder the responsibility of raising his children to be like this. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cEach of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care. A woman is in a position of responsibility over her husband\u2019s house and children and is answerable for those under her care. Indeed, each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari (2278).\nIt is well known that the woman has the right to ask for divorce (talaq) or khul\u2018 if there is a reason for that. It was narrated from Ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: \u201cO Messenger of Allah, I do not find any fault with Thaabit ibn Qays in his character or his religious commitment, but I do not want to commit any act of disbelief after becoming a Muslim.\u201d The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to her, \u201cWill you give back his garden [that he had given to her as the mahr]?\u201d She said, \u201cYes.\u201d So the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Thaabit: \u201cTake back your garden, and divorce her.\u201d\u00a0\nWhat is meant by her words \u201cbut I do not want to commit any act of disbelief after becoming a Muslim\u201d is: I do not want to do any actions that are contrary to the rulings of Islam, such as despising my husband, disobeying him, not fulfilling his rights, and so on.\nSee: Fath al-Bari (9/400).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining what justifies seeking khul\u2018:\nIf the woman dislikes her husband\u2019s characteristics, such as if he is harsh, strict, short-tempered, filled with anger, criticizes the slightest action and rebukes her for the slightest shortcoming, then she has the right to seek khul\u2018.\nSecondly: if she dislikes his appearance, such as a flaw, a defect, or a deficiency in his senses, then she has the right to seek khul\u2018.\nThirdly: if he is lacking in religious commitment, such as if he does not pray or is careless about attending prayers in congregation, or he breaks the fast of Ramadan with no excuse, or he goes to places where haram activities take place, such as zina, drinking, listening to music and entertainment, and the like, then she has the right to seek khul\u2018.\nFourthly: If he deprives her of her rights, such as maintenance, clothing or essential needs, when he is able to provide those things, then she has the right to seek khul\u2018.\nFifthly: If he does not give her her right to regular intimacy in a way that will keep her chaste because he is impotent, or has no interest in her, or he prefers someone else, or he is not fair in sharing his time [among co-wives], then she has the right to seek khul\u2018. And Allah knows best. End quote.\nSee also the answer to question no. 1859 .\nSecondly:\nAs your sister is the one who is in charge, and she knows her husband\u2019s condition better than anyone, she is the one who should decide whether it is better to stay with him for the sake of the children despite these annoyances, because the presence of the father and the sense of family unity has a positive psychological impact on the children, gives them a good social standing and it helps in giving them a good upbringing, and in many cases it is better than separation.\nWe should also note that our advice should differ, depending on whether the couple have children or not. Making sacrifices for the sake of the children\u2019s safety, their social standing, their psychological wellbeing and sense of family is worth patience and sacrifice.\nShe should also persist in calling upon Allah, asking Him to rectify his condition, and she should ask sincere and knowledgeable people to advise him. For hearts fluctuate, and they are in the hand of Allah. How many people have come back to their senses and settled down after having gone astray and misbehaved.\nIf there is anyone among his family and relatives who is rational and mature in thinking, and is held in high esteem by him and can influence him, then she can seek his help to influence him and tell him about his situation, if there is the hope that this will help to rectify his condition.\nWhat appears to us to be the case is that if your sister shows patience, which is indicative of her rational mind and far-sightedness, no one should interfere by advising her to leave him, which could cause greater harm than the harm that results from her staying with this husband despite the problems he has.\nBut if she fears for her life, her faith or her children, then let her do that; there is nothing wrong with her seeking separation from him in that case.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Wife refusing to fulfil her duties towards her husband because he is not spending on her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is obligatory for a man to spend on his wife, and your father did spend on her when he was able to, for twenty years, as you explained in your question.\nAccording to Islamic teachings, your father is still regarded as spending on your mother, because spending on her has nothing to do with the issue of where he is getting the money from that he spends on her.\nThe other issue is that the sons\u2019 spending on their mother is to be regarded as being like the father spending on her, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cYou and your wealth belong to your father.\u201d Ahmad (6902); classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa\u2019 (1625).\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe best food that you eat is what you earn by your own hands, and your children are part of your earnings.\u201d At-Tirmidhi (1358); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The father is obliged to spend on his wife, if her children cannot take care of her. But if her children are covering her expenses and they have been covering all her needs, then that is sufficient, because the children are his children too, and his rights over them are great. The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cYou and your wealth belong to your father.\u201d So if they are covering their mother\u2019s needs and spending on her, that is sufficient, praise be to Allah.\nBut if they are not covering her needs, and she is asking for maintenance, she has a choice: if she wishes, she may be patient, or if she wishes, she may say: Divorce me. She may ask for divorce if she cannot be patient, otherwise she should be patient. If her children spend on her and cover her needs, praise be to Allah, and there is no blame on the husband\u2026 If his children spend on her, then she has no right to complain or ask her husband to spend on her, because his children\u2019s spending on her is like his spending on her. If they spend on her what is sufficient for her needs, praise be to Allah. If they do not spend on her and he does not spend on her either, then she may ask for divorce. (From the shaykh\u2019s website.)\nBased on that, so long as you and your brother are spending on her and covering her needs, she has no right after that to ask for more maintenance from your father, and he is entitled to all his rights over her in full.\nOnce this is established, then it becomes clear that your mother\u2019s refusing intimacy on the grounds that the father is not spending on her is not permissible, and as a result she is regarded as defiantly disobedient and is sinning.\nShe must fear Allah, for this is a grievous sin. It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as is stated in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses to come, the angels will curse her until morning.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari (3065).\nAccording to another hadith, \u201cThere is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is in heaven will be angry with her, until he is pleased with her.\u201d Narrated by Muslim (1436).\nSecondly:\nFrom your question, it seems that your father was not falling short with regard to your mother\u2019s rights or your rights when he was able to spend on you. When his circumstances changed and he was no longer able to spend, your mother forgot his kindness. This is ingratitude towards the husband concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned the woman who does that of Hell. According to the hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI was shown Hell, and I saw that most of its inhabitants are women who are ungrateful (yakfurna).\u201d It was said: Do they disbelieve (yakfurna) in Allah? He said: \u201cThey are ungrateful (yakfurna) to their husbands and are ungrateful for kind treatment. If you show kindness to one of them for a lifetime, then she sees something from you, she says: I have never seen anything good from you.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari (29).\nIbn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This refers to the husband. Allah enjoined His Messenger to show gratitude for blessings. It says in the hadith: \u201cHe does not thank Allah who does not thank people.\u201d Gratitude for the kindness of the husband comes under the heading of gratitude for the blessings of Allah, because every favour the husband does to his family is a blessing from Allah that He caused to come at his hands.\"(Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari by Ibn Battal (1/89).\nWhat the hadith means is that they are denying kind treatment\u2026 This indicates that the one who denies the kindness of the one who was kind to him is blameworthy. Al-Karmani said: That is, you [women] deny the kind treatment of the husband and think little of whatever he gives you. We may understand from the warning of hellfire for being ungrateful and cursing a great deal that these are major sins. See: Sharh Ibn Majah by as-Suyuti, et al. (p. 289).\nHence it is important to advise your mother regarding this matter, and tell her that showing kindness to her husband is one of the means of a woman attaining the pleasure of Allah, and is one of the means of her attaining happiness in this world and the hereafter.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "What is the ruling on using an artificial womb to have children?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the wife is not able to get pregnant in the natural manner, there is nothing wrong with using artificial insemination or what is known as \u201ctest-tube babies\u201d. This refers to fertilising the egg in a test tube, then implanting it in the wife\u2019s uterus. That is subject to the condition that the sperm and egg come from the husband and wife respectively, and the fertilised egg is not implanted in the womb of another woman (surrogate pregnancy).\nIt says in a statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council during its seventh session in 1404 AH:\n\u201cThe third method is that in which the semen and egg from a man and woman who are married to one another are taken and fertilisation occurs externally, in a test tube, then the fertilised egg is implanted in the uterus of the wife, from whom the egg was taken. This method is acceptable in principle from an Islamic perspective, but it is not completely free of problems that could give rise to doubts concerning the procedure and the circumstances in which it is done. So it should not be resorted to except in cases of extreme necessity, after all the conditions referred to above are met.\u201d\nThese conditions include:\n\u201cC. In the case where uncovering the \u2018awrah of the woman is permitted for a legitimate reason in front of someone with whom sexual intercourse is not permissible, the one who is providing treatment should be a Muslim woman, if possible. Otherwise, it should be a non-Muslim woman; if that is not possible then it should be a trustworthy male Muslim doctor; and if that is not possible, it may be a non-Muslim male. This is the order of preference.\nIt is not permissible for the treatment provider to be alone with the woman whom he is treating; rather her husband or another woman should also be present.\nThe Council has affirmed that the need of a married woman who cannot have children and the need of the husband to have children are regarded as legitimate needs that make it permissible to treat the woman in a permissible manner, using one of the methods of artificial insemination.\"(Qararat al-Majma\u2018 al-Fiqhi bi Makkah al-Mukarramah, p. 149).\nSecondly:\nIf it is not possible to implant the fertilised egg in the uterus of the wife because she is suffering from uterine cancer, for example, then there comes to mind the idea of an artificial womb.\nDr. Muhammad ibn Ha\u2019il al-Madhaji said: The idea [of the artificial womb] may be summed up as allowing the fertilised human egg to settle in an artificial womb by re-creating the natural environment of the woman\u2019s uterus in a plastic incubator to enable the foetus to go through all the stages of development until it reaches the point of birth, whereby the foetus is placed in artificial fluid and its blood is supplied with oxygen. The foetus remains in that incubator, which guarantees all that is required for life and survival outside the uterus, until it is fully developed and the time comes for it to emerge.\"(Ahkam an-Nawazil fi\u2019l-Injab, p. 587).\nHe researched the ruling on this issue and mentioned different scholarly views, noting that most contemporary scholars who researched this issue were of the view that it is permissible. He quoted the evidence given by the two groups, and reached the following conclusions:\n1.. This idea is something that could never happen, because it is not possible to produce an environment that may be described as \u201ca safe repository\u201d (al-Mu\u2019minun 23:13) like the natural womb, for the foetus to grow in. Even if science were able to produce such a thing, it is unlikely that the foetus would be safe and free from harm.\n2.. The view that it is haram is more likely to be correct, because it is contrary to the natural way that has been decreed by Allah, and there is great potential for harm.\nThe doctor mentioned that the goat foetuses that were subjected to experiments of this nature died a few days after birth, even though they grew in their mothers\u2019 wombs except for the last three weeks before birth.\nSee: Ahkam an-Nawazil fi\u2019l-Injab, p. 862.\nConclusion:\nThis method has not yet been proven to have been tried on humans as far as we know, let alone having been proven to be free of harm.\nWhat appears to be the case is that if it is proven to have been tried on humans, then in order for it to be permissible, the following conditions must be met:\n1.. It must meet the conditions of artificial insemination referred to above.\n2.. The tissues that are used to create the artificial womb must be permissible tissues and not haram; they should not be taken from anyone other than the husband and wife.\n3.. The procedure must be free of anything that could harm the foetus.\n4.. It should be not possible to implant the fertilised egg in the wife\u2019s womb.\nWe re-affirm that surrogate pregnancy is haram, as stated previously in the answer to question no. 22126 .\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is Marriage Half of the Religion?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah indicates that it is prescribed to get married , and that it is one of the Sunnahs of the Messengers . By getting married a person can, with the help of Allah, overcome many of the traps of evil, for marriage helps him to lower his gaze and guard his chastity.\u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in the Hadith, \u201cO young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married , for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity\u2026\u201d (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\u00a0\nAl-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Al-Mustadrak from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhomever Allah blesses with a righteous wife, He has helped him with half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.\u201d\u00a0\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Shu`ab Al-Iman from Al-Raqashi (may Allah have mercy on him): \u201cWhen a person gets married he has completed half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.\u201d Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said of these two Hadiths in Sahih At-Targhib wat-Tarhib (1916): \u201c(They are) sound.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength."

        "question": "What is the ruling on taking from the husband\u2019s wealth without his knowledge to buy a house for the family?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nA house is something essential for humans, and if the father has provided accommodation for his wife and children to live in like that of their peers, then he is not obliged to do anything further from an Islamic point of view, unless he wants to buy a bigger house for them, if he can afford that. This is something that is recommended and encouraged according to Islamic teachings. It was narrated that Nafi\u2018 ibn \u2018Abd al-Harith (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cPart of a man\u2019s happiness is a good neighbour, a comfortable means of transportation and a spacious house.\u201d Narrated by Ahmad (15409); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami\u2018 (3029).\nSo long as he is providing them with accommodation that is appropriate for them, even if that is by renting, or it is something granted by the government for them to live in, then the requirement is met, and owning the house one lives in is not a necessity or urgent need, so long as accommodation is available to him by renting or as a gift or loan.\nSecondly:\nIf the husband is spending on obligatory maintenance such as accommodation, clothing, food and drink, within reasonable limits, then it is not permissible for his wife to take anything from his money, because it is haram to take a person\u2019s wealth without his willing consent, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent}\u00a0[an-Nisa\u2019 4:29].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIndeed your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Let the one who is present convey it to the one who is absent.\u201d Al-Bukhari (67).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIt is not permissible to take a man\u2019s wealth except with his willing consent.\u201d Ahmad (20172); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa\u2019 al-Ghalil (1495).\nBased on the above:\nWhat your mother collected from your father\u2019s money and bought land with it does not come under the heading of wealth that it is permissible to take without the husband\u2019s knowledge, because the wealth that it is permissible for a wife to take without the knowledge of her husband is limited to when he is failing to provide basic necessities.\nBut as this has already happened, it is essential to tell the father and put this land in his name and under his possession, if the father is still alive.\nIf it was bought in your mother\u2019s name or in the name of one of you, then that must be changed, even if that is by means of a sale to the father.\nIf your father has passed on, then the house becomes part of his estate which is to be divided among the heirs, unless you all agree on something specific with the consent of all the heirs.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Parents Making Marriage Difficult",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat we see for you, honorable questioner, is that it is necessary to confront your parents - no matter the cost - with the fact that you are not convinced by their refusal, and that you are not prepared to wait for a long time, as you might miss the opportunity and the man your parents are waiting for may not come. The reason for their refusal is not legitimate, as looking down upon non-Arabs is a form of pre-Islamic tribalism that Islam has warned against. Allah Almighty says (interpretation of the meaning): O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted. [Quran 49:13].\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings\u00a0be upon him)\u00a0set religion and character as the criteria for accepting a spouse. Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"If someone with whose religion and character you are satisfied asks for your daughter in marriage, comply with his request. If you do not do so, there will be temptation on Earth and extensive corruption.\" [At-Tirmidhi 1084, Al-Albani classified it as sound in \"Sahih at-Tirmidhi\"].\nLet the confrontation be in a wise manner, perhaps through a detailed and impactful letter you write to him (your father), while persistently supplicating to Allah to soften his heart and guide him to the right path.\nSecondly:\nThere is no fault on you at all for your eagerness to marry. It is incumbent upon the families of every man and woman who desire to marry to assist them in this matter as much as they can. A woman needs this assistance more than a man; because the decision is not in her hands, as she cannot, according to custom and tradition, propose to a man, even though it is permissible from a Shariah perspective. Since a woman is sought after and cannot be the seeker, she needs her family's help to enable her social availability. For example, her brother could recommend her to his friends whose\u00a0religion and character he is satisfied with, and her mother could suggest her to her acquaintances who have sons suitable for marriage, and so on.\n`Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him)\u00a0proposed his daughter Hafsah for marriage after her husband died, offering her to `Uthman and Abu Bakr, then the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) married her, as in Sahih Al-Bukhari (4005).\nAnd `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) offered his daughter Umm Kulthum to `Umar ibn Al-Khattab, and he married her.\nThirdly:\nWe do not recommend marriage through internet sites, as there are many undesirable individuals there, and it is easy to deceive people through these sites. On the internet, a person can pretend to be ideal, and it is very difficult to know the truth of the matter. It might be the opposite of what you imagine. Therefore, we must restrain our emotions with the bridle of reason, unlike marriages based on real-life acquaintances.\nFourthly:\nRegarding your request for advice for your mother on the subject - which is the focus of your question - we in turn direct this message to your honorable mother, may Allah make her one of the keys to goodness.\nHonorable Mother...\nPeace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allah.\nOur honorable mother, one of the greatest responsibilities that Allah will question parents about, and which they are obligated towards their children, especially daughters, is facilitating their marriage. Delaying it for an illegitimate reason is non-compliance with the command of Allah Almighty who says (Interpretation of the meaning): And marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves. [Quran 24:32]; meaning facilitate the marriage of those who are not married and marry them off. The commentators said: The verse commands guardians to marry off their daughters and not to leave them single - unmarried - because that is more chaste for them. So, we must comply with the command of Allah.\nKnow that looking at people based on nationality or ethnicity is due to customs dominating people's minds more than Shariah and reason.\nAnd all the good is in following the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him): \"If someone with whose religion and character you are satisfied asks for your daughter in marriage, comply with his request. If you do not do so, there will be temptation on Earth and extensive corruption.\" Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (1048) and others, and Al-Albani classified it as good.\nHow many a girl whose family refused to marry her off, and she became the temptation that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) warned against. So, be keen to marry her to the one she desires, if he is someone whose religion and character are satisfactory, and do not pay attention to customs that erode society. And may Allah take care of you.\nThe pre-Islamic customs that look at people based on nationality or ethnicity are ignorant customs with no basis in the religion of Allah; rather, Islam came to purify souls from them. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Indeed, Allah has removed from you the pride of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic tribalism) and boasting about one's lineage. [A person is either] a pious believer or a miserable sinner. All of you are children of Adam, and Adam was created from dust.\" Narrated by Abu Dawud (5116) and others, and Al-Albani classified it as good.\nIf anyone should be strict about such matters and refuse to marry his daughter to someone who is not from his people or skin color, then this should be discarded from the wise consideration (especially) in Western countries, where Muslims live as minorities, and the choices from \"nationalities\" are greatly reduced, and people's circumstances are constrained. Rather, Muslims in such countries should be more united than their normal circumstances in their home countries.\nMay Allah guide us and you to what is good for Muslims, and improve the conditions of Muslims, their homes, and their offspring.\nAnd Allah knows best."

They share the fundamental principle that marriage is prescribed, which is from the guidance and practice of the Prophet, peace be upon him. Then, its importance varies in some cases more than others.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nWith regard to marriage , people are of three types:\u00a0\n\nSome fear that they may commit prohibited things if they do not get married. Such a person is obliged to get married, according to the majority of jurists, because he has to keep himself chaste and protect himself against engaging in prohibited actions, and the way to do that is getting married.\u00a0\nFor some, marriage is recommended. This is the one who feels desire but there is no danger of his committing prohibited things. It is better for him to get married than to devote himself to optional acts of worship. This is the view of Ashab Ar-Ra`y and it is the view\u00a0 and practice of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).\u00a0\n\nIbn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If I only had ten days to live and I knew that I would die at the end of them, and I had any desire to get married, I would get married, for fear of Fitnah (temptation).\u00a0\nSa`id ibn Jubayr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cIbn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said to me: \u201cHave you gotten married?\u201d \u00a0\nI said: \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cGet married, for the best of this Ummah are the ones with the most wives.\u201d (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5069)\u00a0\nIbrahim ibn Maysarah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cTawus said to me: \u201cEither get married, or I will say to you what `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said to Abu Az-Zawa\u2019id (may Allah have mercy on him): Nothing is keeping you from getting married except impotence or immorality.\u201d \u00a0\n\nThose who have no desire, either because they were not created with any desire, such as one who is impotent, or they had desire but it has disappeared due to old age, sickness and so on. There are two opinions:\u00a0\n\n\nIt is recommended to get married because of the general meaning of what we have discussed.\nIt is better for him to remain single because he cannot achieve the purpose of marriage, and he would be preventing his wife from becoming chaste by marrying someone else. Also, he would be harming her by keeping her for himself, and he is exposing himself to obligations and duties that perhaps he cannot fulfil, and he is distracting himself from seeking knowledge and worship with something that is of no benefit to him.\n\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cThe apparent meaning of the words of Ahmad is that there is no difference between the one who can afford it and the one who cannot. He said: a man should get married and if he can afford to spend he should spend, and if he cannot then he should be patient. \u00a0\nThis applies to one who is able to get married. As for the one who cannot, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His Bounty\u201d [An-Nur 24:33].\u201d (Al-Mughni, 9/341-344)\u00a0\nReasons why marriage is so important\nAt this point, we would like to ask you about the reason for this aversion to marriage.\u00a0\n\nIf you think that not getting married is an act of worship by means of which you can draw closer to the Lord of the Worlds, and you think that if you avoid marriage this will raise you in status before Allah, you are mistaken and there is the fear that you may be sinning.\u00a0\n\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u201cThree people came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asking about the worship of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When they were told, it was as if they regarded it as too little. They said: Who are we in comparison to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Allah has forgiven his past and future sins. One of them said: As for me, I will pray all night forever. Another said: I shall fast all my life and never break my fast. Another said: I shall keep away from women and never get married. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and said: \u201cAre you the ones who said such and such? By Allah, I am the one who fears Allah the most among you and I am the most pious , but I fast and I break my fast, I pray and I sleep, and I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me.\u201d (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5063, and Muslim, 1401)\n\nIf you do not want to get married because you have no sexual desire, or you think that you are not able to fulfil the duties of marriage, and you are afraid of falling short in meeting a wife`s needs, I say to you: In that case there is no sin on you if you do not get married, but do not rely on your thoughts and notions. Rather you should consult a specialist doctor and ask him for advice, for he is most able to diagnose your condition, and he may have some advice for treatment that has never crossed your mind. So do not hesitate to visit him and do not let shyness stop you, for matters of medical treatment are not the place for shyness.\u00a0\nIf you say that you are afraid because you are poor and do not have enough wealth to look after a family, I say to you: Try your best to earn a living and be content and think positively of Allah, for He has promised on the lips of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that He will help the one who wants to be chaste and seeks that which is halal by getting married.\u00a0\n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThere are three whom Allah is bound to help: the Mujahid who strives (in Jihad) for the sake of Allah, the Mukatib (a slave who has made a contract of manumission with his master) who wants to pay off his manumission, and a man who gets married, seeking to remain chaste.\u201d (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (1655), classed as sound by Al-Albani in Saheeh At-Tirmidhi) \u00a0\n\nIf you have something that you want to achieve \u2013 such as a certificate, a position, a project and so on \u2013 and you say that you want to achieve that first, then you will get married, we say to you: Why are you ignoring marriage for that reason?\u00a0\n\nMarriage has never been a barrier to achieving things, rather in most cases it is a support and a help. That is just the whisperings of the satan, which he has instilled in the minds of many young men so that it has become prevalent in our culture and society, and you hear many of those who have delayed their own marriages or the marriages of their sons and daughters saying such things, and our society has become burdened with problems resulting from large numbers of single men and women, and the delay of marriage. However, despite that we have not seen any achievement, development or progress, whereas the first generation of Muslims used to hasten to do good and they did not delay marriage, and their achievements were the greatest and most complete of achievements.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (20/421):\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is required is to hasten to get married, and no young man or young woman should delay marriage for the sake of studies, because marriage does not prevent any such thing. It is possible for a young man to get married in order to protect his religious commitment and morals, and enable him to lower his gaze . Marriage serves many purposes, especially in this day and age. Because delaying it is harmful for both young women and young men, every young man and every young woman should hasten to get married if there is a man who is compatible with the woman, and if a man can find the right woman.\u201d\n\nOver and above all that, how about if you realise that marriage will protect half of your religion?\u00a0\n\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhomever Allah has blessed with a righteous wife, He has helped him with half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.\u201d (Narrated by Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak, 2/175), At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat, 1/294) and Al-Bayhaqi in Shu`ab Al-Iman, 4/382) Al-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cThis is a Hadith with an authentic Isnad (chain of narrators), although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not narrate it.\u201d Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Talkhis: it is authentic. It was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib, 2/192)\n\nHow about if you realise that by getting married, you will have followed the advice of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said:\u00a0 \u201cO young men, whoever among you can afford it , let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one`s chastity.\u201d (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5065, and Muslim, 1400)\nHow about if you realise that by producing a righteous child, you will have ongoing charity (Sadaqah Jariyah), if you raise him with good morals and upon faith, and you will be rewarded for your marriage if you seek reward with Allah for that .\u00a0\nBy getting married, you will be protecting yourself, lowering your gaze , and closing the door to one of the greatest means by which the devil deceives people. You may not feel the seriousness of that now, but Fitnah (temptation) may come from places a person does not realise, so you should be keen to close the door before it is opened without you realising it.\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI have not left after me any Fitnah more harmful to men than women.\u201d (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5096, and Muslim, 2741).\n\nMarriage is a source of tranquillity and peace, and it is the best of the pleasures of this world. In it, is that which Allah has made a sign for His slaves, and He has mentioned it in His Book so that they may think and ponder the greatness of His Might, may He be glorified and exalted. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.\u201d [Ar-Rum 30:21]\nCan there be any hesitation after this?\u00a0\nBe resolved and put your trust in Allah, and Allah will help you, and will provide you with a righteous wife who will help you to obey your Lord and He will bless you with righteous offspring who will be a stored treasure for you with Allah in the Hereafter.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "What is the ruling on repeating the marriage contract if it was done over the Internet?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the marriage contract that was done over the Internet met all the necessary conditions, then it is a valid marriage. It is valid to do the marriage contract over the Internet so long as it meets all the necessary conditions. The senior scholars have issued fatwas stating that a marriage contract done over the telephone is valid, if we have verified the identity of the parties to the marriage contract and it fulfils the necessary conditions, namely the consent of the woman\u2019s guardian (wali), two witnesses, and the proposal and acceptance. If a marriage contract done in this way is valid, then if it is done over the Internet, in which it is possible to verify the voice and the image directly, it is more appropriate that it should be valid.\nSee the fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz in question no. 2201 , and also question no. 297344 .\nSecondly:\nIf the first marriage contract met the necessary conditions, then repeating it a second time will not invalidate the first marriage contract; rather it is by way of confirming it in front of the family, or for the purpose of documenting the first marriage contract. So the rulings on marriage will apply from the time of the first contract. Hence it is not valid to impose new conditions in it, or to stipulate a mahr (dowry) other than that which was agreed upon in the first contract. But if the first marriage contract did not meet the necessary conditions, then it is deemed invalid and a new marriage contract must be done with a new mahr, and it is permissible to stipulate new conditions in it.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on vasectomy and reversal thereof",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: it is not permissible for a man or woman to undergo any surgical or other procedure that will permanently prevent them from having children.\nOne of these means that is forbidden is vasectomy, which is a surgical procedure in which the vas deferens (the two channels through which sperm travels to the bladder and then to the penis) is cut.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council: It is haram to permanently remove the ability to produce offspring for a man or a woman, which is what is known as sterilization, so long as there is no necessary reason, according to Islamic standards, for doing that.\nThis has been explained previously in the answers to questions no. 111969 and 47196 .\nSecondly: With regard to reversing the vasectomy, this is a matter concerning which one must refer to medical specialists. If the doctors determine that there is no harm that would result from that, then you must undergo this procedure and restore the vas deferens to its natural state.\nBut if that is not possible, or it will result in harm, then you do not have to do anything, because harm cannot be removed by further harm.\nAs you did that as a result of ignorance of the ruling, then Allah, may He be exalted, will pardon you and there is no sin on you. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but [only for] what your hearts intended} [al-Ahzaab 33:5].\nAnd you did not deliberately intend to commit sin."

        "question": "How can the second wife prove her marriage after her husband dies, as the marriage was not officially registered?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In a number of questions we have stated that it is obligatory to officially register marriages, because that will protect people\u2019s rights so that they will not be lost.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 129851 .\nBut a man may be forced to forego registering a marriage because he lives in a western country where plural marriage is not allowed and the one who does that will be penalised. In that case, we may say:\nIf the husband married a second wife in accordance with Islamic teachings, then it is easy for the second wife and her children to prove that, because when she got married there must have been her guardian and two men \u2013 at least \u2013 who acted as witnesses or he must have announced the marriage to some of his friends or relatives.\nThe husband may have left behind something in his handwriting confirming this second marriage, or he may have registered his children from his second wife in his name, and so on.\nSo the second wife should take some of these witnesses and whatever proof or other circumstantial evidence she has to prove the validity of her claim, and present it to those in charge of the Islamic centre in her city, and they can present it to the family of the deceased and prove to them that there are other parties who have rights in this regard, and they are entitled to their share of the estate.\nThe first wife of the deceased and her children must accept that, and beware of cutting off ties of kinship and refuse to give what rightfully belongs to their brothers, because Allah has ordained that all wives and all children have rights to the estate, so there should be no differentiation between one wife and another, or between one son and another. They are all children of the deceased and are all entitled to their share of the inheritance. The prohibition [on denying them their rights] is further emphasized if any of the heirs are minors (orphans), because devouring the wealth of orphans is a major sin for which the one who does that deserves punishment in hell.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire. And they will be burned in a Blaze}\u00a0[an-Nisa\u2019 4:10].\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Using contraception because of having a low income",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to use contraceptives for fear of low income, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Provider. This is akin to the actions of the people of Jahiliyyah who killed their children for fear of poverty. Rather you should think positively of Allah and put your trust in Him, may He be glorified and exalted.\nAllah is the Provider, the Almighty, may He be glorified and exalted, and it is He, may He be glorified and exalted, Who says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no creature that lives on the earth but its sustenance is guaranteed by Allah}\u00a0[Hud 11:6].\nSo what is required is for both husband and wife to think positively of Allah and not use contraceptives.\nBut if the contraceptive is used for a different reason, such as if the mother is sick or if there is\u00a0 the risk of harm to her health or her uterus, or there is fear of harm to both of them; or because they already have a lot of children, and without contraception there will be one pregnancy after another, without a break, so she wants to use contraception for a short period, such as a year or two, so that it will not be too difficult to raise the children and so that she will not become unable to do that \u2013 then there is nothing wrong with that, as it is in the best interests of the children, and it is not due to thinking negatively of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. The same applies if having another pregnancy could harm her and she is unable to cope. But if the matter has to do with provision (rizq), then the Provider is Allah; regardless of whether you are sick or healthy, it is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, Who provides for you and in His hand is the control of all things. So you must think positively of Allah and put your trust in Allah, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Provider, Lord of Might, the Powerful. End quote."

        "question": "He did the marriage contract with her in the court without her family\u2019s knowledge in order to force her wali (guardian) to accept the marriage. What must he do now?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for anyone to do a marriage contract with a woman except with the permission of her guardian. There is a great deal of evidence to this effect, such as the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): \u201cThere can be no marriage contract except with a guardian.\u201d Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1101), Abu Dawood (2085) and Ibn Maajah (1881) from Abu Moosa al-Ash\u2018ari (may Allah be pleased with him). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi.\nThe majority of scholars are of the view \u2013 and it is the correct view \u2013 that a marriage contract done without a guardian is invalid, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAny woman who gets married without the permission of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.\u201d Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1102), Abu Dawood (2038) and Ibn Maajah (1879) from the hadith of \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa\u2019 al-Ghaleel (1840).\nThe Hanafis are of the view that it is valid for a woman to get married without a guardian.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not valid to do a marriage contract except with a guardian. A woman does not have the authority to give herself or any other woman in marriage, or to appoint anyone except her guardian to act on her behalf regarding her marriage, so if she does that, the marriage is not valid.\nThis was narrated from \u2018Umar, \u2018Ali, Ibn Mas\u2018ood, Ibn \u2018Abbaas, Abu Hurayrah and \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with them).\nIt is also the view of Sa\u2018eed ibn al-Musayyib, al-Hasan, \u2018Umar ibn \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeez, Jaabir ibn Zayd, ath-Thawri, Ibn Abi Layla, Ibn Shubrumah, Ibn al-Mubaarak, \u2018Ubaydullah al-\u2018Anbari, ash-Shaafa\u2018i, Ishaaq and Abu \u2018Ubayd\u2026 Abu Haneefah said: She has the right to give herself and others in marriage, and to appoint someone to act on her behalf regarding her marriage.\nThen Ibn Qudaamah stated that the view of the majority is more likely to be correct, and he quoted as evidence the hadiths quoted above.\" (Al-Mughni\u00a0 9/345).\nGiven that there is a difference of opinion among the leading scholars regarding this matter, and that it is an issue that is subject to ijtihad, if a Muslim lives in a country which follows the Hanafi madhhab and regards a marriage contract done without a guardian as valid, and the marriage contract was done on that basis, then it may be deemed to be valid in that case, and the ruling of the court is not to be annulled.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a judge rules that this marriage contract is valid, or the one who did the marriage contract is a judge, it is not permissible to annul it. The same applies to all marriages that are done in an inappropriate way.\nAl-Qaadi was of the view that it could be annulled.\nThis is also the view of al-Istakhri among the companions of ash-Shaafa\u2018i, because the marriage was done in a manner that is contrary to a religious text.\nBut the first view is more likely to be correct [that is, that it is not to be annulled], because it is a matter concerning which there is a difference of scholarly opinion and it is subject to ijtihad. So it is not permissible to annul the ruling. Moreover, this text is open to interpretation, and there are some reservations about its soundness, and there may be other evidence that contradicts it.\" (Al-Mughni\u00a09/347).\nBased on that, what we think is that the marriage should be deemed to be valid, even though what you did was a mistake. Therefore you must repent from that, and strive to seek the approval of your wife\u2019s father, if he is still not happy with this marriage, because you mistreated him badly.\nIf you renew the marriage contract with her, with her father acting as her guardian in the marriage contract, in the presence of two witnesses of good character, that would be better and more prudent.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What your wife did of inserting the sperm of a stranger is a grave sin and a betrayal of her husband, and is introducing a child who is not his. What she must do is repent to Allah, may He be exalted.\nWhat you must do is deny that this child is yours and not attribute him to yourself, because if you do not deny that he is yours, he may inherit from you and inherit from your relatives, and look at your mother and your sister, and your womenfolk will not observe hijab in front of him, and he may be alone with them, and all of that is prohibited.\nThere is no way to deny that he is yours except by means of li\u2018aan.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Accusing the woman of zina is of three types: obligatory, which is when he sees his wife committing zina during a period of purity in which he has not had intercourse with her \u2013 in that case, he must keep away from her until her \u2018iddah ends, then if she produces a child six months from the time of committing zina and he can deny that it is his child, he must accuse her of zina and deny that her child is his, because in that case it is almost certain that the child is from the adulterer. If he does not deny that the child is his, the child will be attributed to him, and may inherit from him and his relatives, and they may inherit from him, and the child will look at his daughters and sisters, when that is not permissible. So he must deny that the child is his so as to avoid all of that.\nIf his wife admits committing zina and he believes her, it is as if he saw her do that.\" (Al-Mughni\u00a0 8/71).\nAr-Ramli said in Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj (7/111): \u2026 He must deny that the child is his, otherwise if he keeps quiet the child will be attributed to him when he is not his child, which is not allowed, just as it is prohibited to deny a child who is his, for reasons that we will mention below, because there is a stern warning to the one who does that. \u00a0Because of the evil consequences that result in both cases, these are regarded as very abhorrent major sins, and in fact they are referred to as kufr (disbelief) in the sound reports, even though some of the scholars said that it is only kufr if the doer believes that it is permissible; or the reports may be interpreted as meaning that these actions are a cause that will lead to kufr; or the word kufr may be understood in the sense of being ungrateful for Allah\u2019s blessings.\nIf he came to know of her zina in the sense of being certain or thinking that it is most likely, he should accuse her of it and should engage in the process of li\u2018aan in order to deny\u00a0 that the child is his. Doing so is obligatory in both cases.\nOtherwise, he may limit it to denying that the child is his through the process of li\u2018aan, because it is possible that the child is the result of a dubious marriage or a previous marriage. End quote.\nFor a description of li\u2018aan and how it is done, please see the answer\u00a0to question\u00a0no. 33615 \u00a0.\nIn the process of li\u2018aan, you may limit it to denying that the child is yours and swearing by Allah four times that this child is not your child, and you should say on the fifth time: May the curse of Allah be upon you if you are lying.\nThe wife should not swear an oath at that point, if she admits her sin.\nIn that case, the child cannot be attributed to you and you are not obliged to spend on him. He should be given a random name, and his mother must take care of him; she may inherit from him and he may inherit from her.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Are rizq (provision) and marriage written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Everything from when Allaah created the Pen until the Day of Resurrection is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz, because when Allaah first created the Pen, He said to it: \u201cWrite.\u201d It said: \u201cMy Lord, what should I write?\u201d He said: \u201cWrite what is to be. So at that moment it began to write what would be until the Day of Resurrection. And it is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that when the foetus in its mother\u2019s womb is four months old, Allaah sends an angel to breathe the soul into it and write down its provision, its lifespan and its deeds, and whether it is doomed or blessed.\u00a0\u00a0\nProvision is also written down and connected to its means, and it does not increase or decrease. Among those means are that man should work to seek provision, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cHe it is Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e. easy for you to walk, to live and to do agriculture on it); so walk in the path thereof and eat of His provision. And to Him will be the Resurrection\u201d\u00a0[al-Mulk 67:15]\nOther means are: \u00a0\nupholding ties of kinship, such as honouring one\u2019s parents and upholding ties with relatives. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever would like his provision to be abundant and his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship.\u201d\u00a0\nFearing Allaah (taqwa), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\n3.\u00a0And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things\u201d\u00a0[al-Talaaq 65:2-3]\nDo not say \u201cProvision is foreordained and limited and I will not do any of the things that lead to it,\u201d because this is helplessness; smartness and resolve mean striving to seek provision and that which will benefit you in religious and worldly terms. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe smart man is the one who takes stock of himself and strives to do that which will benefit him after death, and the helpless one is the one who follows his own whims and desires and engages in wishful thinking, (assuming that Allaah will forgive him regardless of what he does and that he does not need to strive to good deeds).\u201d\u00a0\nJust as provision is written and connected to its means, so too marriage is also written and preordained. For both spouses it is written that he or she will be the spouse of this particular person. Nothing is hidden from Allaah on earth or in heaven.

That begins with the Muslim society in which he lives, then with choosing pious friends, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined: \u201cDo not keep company with anyone but a believer.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawud (4832); classed as hasan (good) by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami\u2018.\nThen finally he should choose a righteous wife who he hopes will be the best companion to help him attain eternal happiness in Paradise with Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nBest qualities of a good wife\nThe righteous wife is one who is good in many aspects.\nShe is the one who it is thought will guard her chastity and her honour in the husband\u2019s presence and absence, and be diligent with regard to both minor and major issues.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cTherefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband\u2019s) absence what Allah would have them guard\u201d [an-Nisa 4:34].\nShe is the one who is of good character and has good manners. She is not known for foul speech, meanness or bad manners; rather she is good-natured, pure of soul and clean of heart, speaks in a gentle manner and treats people kindly.\nMore important than all of that, she accepts advice and listens to it attentively and wholeheartedly; she is not one of those who are used to arguing stubbornly and arrogantly.\nAl-Asma\u2018i said:\u00a0\n\u201cAn elder from the tribe of Banu\u2019l-\u2018Anbar said: It was said that women are of three types: one who is easy-going, gentle, chaste and dignified, Muslim, a help to her family, and not a burden on them; one who is merely a vessel for childbearing; and one who is like a heavy yoke that Allah places on the neck of whomever He wills, and takes it away from whomever He wills.\u201d\nOne of the scholars said: \u201cThe best of women is the one who, if she is given she is grateful, and if she is deprived she is patient; you feel happy when you look at her, and she obeys you if you instruct her to do something.\u201d\nShe is the one who upholds her connection to her Lord and always strives to increase her level of faith and piety. She does not omit any obligatory duty, and she is keen to do some nafl (supererogatory) deeds. She gives precedence to pleasing Allah, may He be glorified, over everything else.\nConcerning that, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cChoose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhari (4802) and Muslim (1466).\nThe righteous wife is the one whom you see is serious about caring for and raising your children, teaching them Islam, good manners and the Quran, and instilling in them love for Allah, love for His Messenger, and love of good for people. Her main concern is not what they may attain in this world of prominence, wealth and degrees; rather she is concerned that they should attain a high level of piety, religious commitment, good character and knowledge.\nIn addition to all of that, the Muslim should choose a wife who gives him comfort when he sees her, and he feels joy in his heart when she is present, so she fills his house and his life with ease, joy and happiness.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what type of wife is best? He said: \u201cThe one who makes (her husband) happy when he looks at her, and she obeys him if he instructs her to do something, and she does not do anything with regard to herself or his wealth in a manner of which he does not approve.\u201d\nNarrated by Ahmad (2/251); classed as hasan (good) by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (1838).\nIt was said to \u2018Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her): Which type of woman is best? She said: The one who does not know about saying bad things, and she is not crafty like men; her focus is on adorning herself for her husband and taking care of her family.\nFor more information, please see questions no.\u00a06585 ,\u00a08391 ,\u00a026744 , and\u00a083777 .\nReferences\nMuhadarat al-Udaba by ar-Raghib al-Asfahani, 1/410.\u00a0\n\u2018Uyoon al-Akhbar by Ibn Qutaybah, 1/375.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is Contraception Haram?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is it obligatory for a couple to produce children?\nWe hope that our brother will be certain that not one of the scholars said that it is obligatory for a couple to produce children, and that if they do not produce twenty children then they are sinning and deserve to be punished by Allah!\u00a0\nSimilarly, not one of the earlier or contemporary scholars \u2013 as far as we know \u2013 has said that it is the fate of the wife to have a baby and breastfeed every single year, or that if the couple choose to delay pregnancy and having children, that is haram.\u00a0\nWe mention these facts to you, and ward off doubts based on illusion, so that we can introduce the Islamic ruling, first of all, and so as to highlight that everything that you mentioned in your question is not an argument that has any sound basis, because the Islamic ruling is far removed from what you mentioned in your question.\u00a0\nIs it permissible to delay having children?\nIn fact, the Islamic evidence indicates that it is permissible to delay having children. As Jabir ibn \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with said): \u201cWe used to engage in \u2018azl [coitus interruptus, a form of contraception] at the time when the Quran was being revealed. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5208) and Muslim , 1440) \u2018Azl (coitus interruptus) means ejaculating outside the woman\u2019s vagina in order to avoid pregnancy.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted this hadith as evidence for it being permissible to space having children in order to give them a proper Islamic upbringing, when he said:\u00a0\n\u201cIf a woman has a lot of children, and it is difficult for her to give them a proper Islamic upbringing because they are so many, then there is nothing wrong with her taking something to space her pregnancies in order to achieve this important purpose, so that pregnancy will not adversely affect her or her children, as Allah has permitted \u2018azl for this and similar purposes.\u201d (Fatawa Nur \u2018ala ad-Darb by Ibn Baz ed. by ash-Shuway\u2018ir, 21/394)\u00a0\nIs contraception haram?\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cTaking contraceptive measures is permissible in principle, because the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used the method of \u2018azl (coitus interruptus) during the time of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he did not forbid them to do that. But it is contrary to what is preferable, because having a lot of children is something that is prescribed and is desirable.\u201d (Fatawa Nur \u2018ala ad-Darb by al-\u2018Uthaymin, 22/2)\nWe have previously stated that it is encouraged to have a lot of righteous children .\u00a0\u00a0\nThe ruling on different considerations for delaying having children\u00a0\nSo you may rest assured that if you and your wife decide to delay having children, as you mentioned in your question, that is not regarded as a sin or disobedience in principle, unless there are other considerations that have an impact on this individual or personal choice, which may be dictated by present-day circumstances:\u00a0\n\nIf the decision to delay having children is widespread, at the societal, national or ummah-wide level, then in this case it becomes a destructive and negative choice, and in that case the ruling is that it is not allowed, because it has moved from being a permissible and natural matter to one that is imposed from without and will lead to negative consequences, and is therefore blameworthy.\u00a0\n\n\nIf the motive for delaying having children is fear for their provision and livelihood , then this reflects a serious doubt concerning our belief in the will and decree of Allah and our belief in the abundant provision of Allah and that He will help those who strive to earn a living in the land. It reflects an unjustified fear of the future and a failure to produce and strive. In that case it is blameworthy and is not allowed, and there are clear fatwas that speak of it.\u00a0\n\n\nIf the reason for not having children is arguments and conflict between the spouses , where one of them does not want children and the other one does, then the one who is refusing does not have the right to do so, because having children is a right of both spouses, and it is not permissible for one of them to refuse with no excuse or good reason.\n\n\nIf the motive for delaying having children, or ceasing to do so, is to follow the cultural norms of non-Muslims and imitate them blindly, out of admiration for their culture and infatuation with their way of life, then undoubtedly the ruling in this case is that it is not allowed. One of the great principles of Islamic teaching is that the individual Muslim should be independent in his thinking and think within the framework of Islamic teaching; he should weigh up pros and cons objectively in the light of the circumstances that he lives in, and base his decisions on the Islamic principles in which he believes and with which he grew up, far removed from the illusionary psychological influences that are imposed by the media that represents the corporate powers that exist today, and should free himself from feelings of inferiority in the face of what he sees of the attitudes, customs and actions of the disbelieving nations.\u00a0\n\n\nIf the means of delaying having children is medicine or surgical procedures that will prevent having children altogether (sterilisation), so that the woman or her husband will lose the ability to ever have children, then this is a serious transgression and is ingratitude for the blessing of Allah that He has bestowed upon His slaves, and it is destruction of a great blessing that Allah has instilled and created in them on the basis of great wisdom.\u00a0\n\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade such things. This is the case concerning which there is no difference of opinion among the scholars that it is prohibited, for it is the undermining of one of the most important aims of Shari`ah and a blatant violation of one of the five necessities that Islam came to protect, which are: religious commitment, life, honour, wealth, and offspring.\u00a0\nThese five cases are what the scholars refer to when they speak about spacing or limiting the number of children . They are the reason why they spoke in strict terms in many cases, so that no one would take undue advantage of the fatwas which say that contraception is permissible .\u00a0\nThat is why we have mentioned these five cases here, so as to draw attention to them. In any other case, where a couple takes an individual decision on the basis of a genuine need, there is no blame on them for that.\u00a0\nAnyone who reflects on the statement of the International Islamic Fiqh Council no. 39 (1/5), which has to do with family planning, will clearly understand that the way in which it is drafted is very careful and clear, as we have explained above. It says in the statement:\u00a0\nThe session of the Islamic Fiqh Council held during its fifth conference in Kuwait, 1-6 Jumada al-Akhir 1409 AH/10-15 December 1988 AH.\u00a0\nAfter studying the research papers presented by council members and experts on the topic of family planning, and listening to the discussion that took place on the topic,\u00a0\nAnd based on the fact that one of the aims of marriage according to Islamic teaching is to produce children and preserve the human race, and that it is not permissible to undermine this aim, because undermining it is contrary to the texts of Islam and their teachings which call for having a lot of offspring, protecting them and caring for them because protecting offspring is one of the five holistic principles that are promoted by Islamic teaching,\u00a0\nThe council determined the following:\u00a0\n\nFirstly: it is not permissible to promulgate laws restricting the freedom of couples to have children.\u00a0\nSecondly: it is prohibited to completely eradicate the ability to have children in the case of either the man or the woman, which is known as sterilisation, so long as there is no necessary reason, according to Islamic standards, for doing so.\u00a0\nThirdly: it is permissible to use temporary methods of birth control for the purpose of spacing pregnancies, or preventing pregnancy for a specific length of time, if there is a valid reason, according to Islamic teachings, for doing so, according to what a couple decide on the basis of mutual consultation and consent, on condition that this does not lead to any harm and that the method used is Islamically permissible and does not cause harm to any existing pregnancy.

        "question": "Books that speak about the rulings on marriage, women, and ways of making the marriage successful",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Islamic texts encourage marriage and state that it is the way of the Prophets and Messengers. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), and made for them wives and offspring\u201d\u00a0[ar-Ra\u2018d 13:38]\n\u201cAnd marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Salihoon (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves).

        "question": "She refuses to get married for fear that her husband might force her to work",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We are very happy to see among the youth of our ummah people with enlightened minds and pure hearts, both young men and young women, who are able to cast off the chains and fetters of division and differences, and return to the purity of Islam as Allah revealed it to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). That is an immense and incomparable blessing, because the people became divided after the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) into sects and parties, each of them adhering to the call of their shaykhs and imams, until Islam became like a stranger among these groups and sects, despite the fact that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cVerily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects (all kinds of religious sects), you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) have no concern in them in the least. Their affair is only with Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do\u201d\u00a0[al-An\u2018aam 6:159].\u00a0\nWe congratulate you and commend your way of thinking and focusing on the most important questions in life, those that have to do with religious commitment and beliefs, and what a person should believe in and adhere to with regard to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\u00a0\nThis path begins with the first step, which you have taken on the basis of what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has blessed you with of a mind that is able to ponder and reflect, far removed from all previous intellectual and social influences. Hence you read the Holy Qur\u2019an far removed from sectarian distortions and interpretations that detract from the clarity of the text and deprive the reader of its benefits. So you ponder the word of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, that He sent down to guide mankind and enlighten humanity, and you will inevitably find therein guidance and enlightenment for yourself too, in clear and straightforward words in most of its verses and chapters. So you read therein the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd this is a blessed Book (the Qur\u2019an) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. saved from the torment of Hell)\u201d\u00a0[al-An\u2018aam 6:155]\n\u201c(This is the) Book (the Quran) sent down unto you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), so let not your heart be troubled about it, that you warn thereby, and a reminder unto the believers.\n(Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) to these idolaters (pagan Arabs) of your folk:) Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur\u2019an and Prophet Muhammad\u2019s Sunnah), and follow not any Awliya (protectors and helpers, etc. who order you to associate partners in worship with Allah), besides Him (Allah). Little do you remember\u201d\u00a0[al-A\u2018raaf 7:2-3].\u00a0\nAs guidance is connected to following the Holy Qur\u2019an and following Allah\u2019s noble Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then what guidance could you find after that in the opinions and views of human beings? What happiness could we seek other than in the noble Book and the Prophet\u2019s Sunnah?\u00a0\nWhy would we introduce intermediaries between us and these two lights? Do we not have minds with which to think? Has Allah may He be glorified and exalted, not created for us hearts with which to distinguish between truth and falsehood? So why do we persist in imitating that with which we may have grown up of sectarian notions or esoteric factions?\u00a0\nWhere do we find these factions in the Book of Allah, and where do we find them in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?\u00a0\nDo you think that we will enter Hell if we do not believe in a particular imam or a particular sect?\u00a0\nDoes it make sense to suggest that we will enter Hell if we do not believe in things that neither the Holy Qur\u2019an nor the noble Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught us?\u00a0\nThese are very few simple questions that will lead us to cast away all these sects and factions and weird beliefs, and to become certain of the path that we follow, far away from them and closer to the pure Tawheed (affirmation of the Oneness of Allah) that is the religion of all of the Prophets (peace be upon them).\u00a0\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cSay: \u2018Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, but if you turn away, he (Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) is only responsible for the duty placed on him (i.e. to convey Allah\u2019s Message) and you for that placed on you. If you obey him, you shall be on the right guidance. The Messengers duty is only to convey (the message) in a clear way (i.e. to preach in a plain way).\u2019\u201d\u00a0[an-Noor 24:54]\n\u201cAnd whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it) , and fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment\u201d\u00a0[al-Hashr 59:7].\u00a0\nMoreover you should understand that the teachings of Islam do not instruct you to give up studying for fear that your husband may force you to work. The husband has no right to force his wife to do that, and by the same token he has no right to your wealth or property. Rather you can stipulate (in your marriage contract) whatever is appropriate for you and your situation. If you both agree that you can work in an appropriate environment, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as you strive to adhere to Islamic guidelines.\u00a0\nIf you yourself do not want to work, then no one has the right to stipulate that you must do that, and you have the right to state that and stipulate whatever you wish to anyone who proposes marriage to you, so long as you do not make that a barrier that prevents you from getting married. Rather you should strive to maintain your chastity by getting married and choose for yourself a righteous husband who will take you from the environment, beliefs and traditions with which you have grown up and help you to adhere to the true and pure religion. It is not essential that his outward appearance should be such that it would cause your family to reject him; rather it is sufficient that he should be of good character and generally acceptable in terms of religious commitment, one who is keen to follow his religion and who prays regularly.\u00a0\nIf you want to delay postgraduate study until after marriage, then you know best what is appropriate for you. But if you want to complete your studies, whilst striving to reduce things that are contrary to Islamic teachings to the best of your ability, and you are keen to pray on time so that the time for prayer does not end before you offer the prayer, except in exceptional circumstances and emergencies, then do that, and we hope that there will be nothing wrong with you doing that, in sha Allah.\u00a0\nGoing out of the house does not require a mahram; rather it is in the case of travel that that is required, especially if you adhere to hijab and proper conduct, and there is no danger posed by aggressors.\u00a0\nBut if you fear for yourself, that you may be subject to aggression, or you fear losing your religious commitment, or you are not able to observe hijab or adhere to the guidelines of your religion, then give precedence to all of that over the interests of work.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "I do not want to get married but my parents want me to; am I Islamically obliged to agree?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that marriage is part of the teachings and practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rebuked those who wanted to remain unmarried. He said: \u201cAs for me, I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sunnah (my way) is not of me.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4776) and Muslim (1401). What is meant by \u201cmy Sunnah\u201d is his guidance and path. No one has the right to forsake the path, guidance and Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for the sake of some worldly matter because he is keen to pursue further studies or earn more money or seek some social position, or because of some specious argument of the evil doers that comes to his mind, and so on.\u00a0\nThis teaching is more emphasized at times of fitnah (turmoil or temptation) when a person fears for himself (that he may give into temptation) because there is no control and no one is watching him. So the Muslim is enjoined to seek help in controlling his evil inclinations and in resisting the Shaytaan by all possible means, and he is enjoined to seek and attain chastity. If he fears that he may give in to temptation, then it is obligatory for him to get married, so as to ward off temptation and corruption from his religious commitment.\u00a0\nYou should understand that some younger women may be sought in marriage at a specific age, when compatible and righteous men propose marriage to them, but they refuse on the grounds that they want to complete their studies, or they are looking for someone who is more rich, and so on. Then they grow older and spend the rest of their lives waiting. By doing so, they go against the command of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to accept a righteous husband who is religiously committed and of good character.\u00a0\n\u201cIf there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then give [your daughter or other female relative under your care] to him in marriage, for if you do not do that there will be fitnah in the land and a great deal of mischief.\u201d [Hadeeth narrated by at-Tirmidhi]\u00a0\nBy doing that, the woman forgets her true role in life, the purpose for which Allah created mankind in two halves, male and female, and made that one of the signs of His might and power, and of His Oneness, may He be exalted.\u00a0\nTherefore we do not agree that you should disregard the idea of marriage altogether on the grounds of pursuing further study or seeking material gains. If you do have a clear reason for that, then explain it to your parents and come to some mutual understanding about it, so long as you are not using that as an excuse to forgo marriage altogether and ignore one of the greatest means of maintaining a sound way of life and establishing true servitude (\u2018uboodiyyah) to Allah in this world.\u00a0\nBut if what you meant is that you do not want to marry a particular individual, for some reason, although you accept the principle if a compatible man proposes to you, then this is your right and there is nothing wrong with that; your parents do not have the right to force you to marry a particular person.\u00a0\nPlease see also the answer to question no. 163990\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "He committed zina with a married woman who was estranged from her husband; can he marry her if her husband divorces her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a woman leaves her husband or a man leaves his wife for one or two years, or for more or less time than that, the marriage remains valid until the man actually divorces his wife. So long as that has not happened, and the man has not uttered the word of divorce (talaaq) to his wife, or has not written words to that effect with the intention of divorcing her, then the woman is still his wife, even if the separation has gone on for a long time.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: When is a woman regarded as divorced? He said: The woman is regarded as divorced if her husband issues a divorce (talaaq) to her when he is of sound mind and does so by choice, with no impediment to divorce such as insanity, intoxication and the like, and the woman is pure (i.e., not menstruating), during a period of purity in which he has not had intercourse with her, or she is pregnant or postmenopausal.\nEnd quote from Fataawa at-Talaaq, 1/35\u00a0\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 11681\nSecondly:\u00a0\nZina (fornication or adultery) is one of the major sins; the degree of sin is worse and the punishment is multiplied if the woman is married, because that is a betrayal of her husband \u2026 Hence the punishment for an unmarried zaani is one hundred lashes, and the punishment for a previously married zaani is stoning to death.\u00a0\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)), and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him)\u201d\nAl-Isra\u2019 17:32].\u00a0\nShaykh as-Sa\u2018di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The prohibition on approaching it or coming near it is more eloquent than merely prohibiting the action, because that includes the prohibition on all the things that may lead to it or promote it, because the one who approaches a forbidden area will soon find himself wandering in it, especially in the case of this matter which is very tempting for many people.\u00a0\nAllah described zina and its abhorrent nature as a \u201cfaashishah\u201d (something that transgresses its limits); in other words it is a sin that is regarded as immoral and odious in terms of sharee\u2018ah, rational thought and sound human nature, because it implies transgression of the sacred limits with regard to the rights of Allah, the rights of the woman and the rights of her family or husband, betrayal of marriage, confusion of lineage, and other negative consequences.\u00a0\nThe words \u201cand an evil way\u201d mean: what an evil way is the way of the one who dares to commit this grave sin.\nEnd quote from Tafseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan fi Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan, 1/457\u00a0\nWhat they must both do is repent sincerely, turn back to Allah and keep away from the things that lead to zina. Whoever repents, Allah will accept his repentance.\u00a0\nFor more information on the crime of zina and repentance therefrom, please see the answer to question no. 47924 and 138270\nSecondly:\u00a0\nThe basic principle is that it is not permissible for the zaani to marry the zaaniyah until after they have repented sincerely, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThe adulterer marries not but an adulteress or a Mushrikah and the adulteress none marries her except an adulterer or a Muskrik (and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely he is either an adulterer, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater, etc.) And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress, etc.)). Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism)\u201d\n[an-Noor 24:3].\u00a0\nRepentance is attained by regretting (what one has done) and resolving not to go back to the sin. So long as they have repented and regretted what they fell into of sin, it is valid for them to marry according to most of the scholars.\u00a0\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nIf a woman commits zina, it is not permissible for the one who knows of that to marry her unless two conditions are met:\n1.That her \u2018iddah has ended\n2.That she has repented from zina.\nIf these two conditions are met, it is permissible for the zaani or anyone else to marry her, according to the opinion of most of the scholars, including Abu Bakr, \u2018Umar, Ibn \u2018Umar, Ibn \u2018Abbaas, Jaabir, Sa\u2018eed ibn al-Musayyab, Tawoos, Jaabir ibn Zayd, \u2018Ata\u2019, al-Hasan, \u2018Ikrimah, az-Zuhri, ath-Thawri, ash-Shaafa\u2018i, Ibn al-Mundhir, and ashaab ar-ra\u2019y.\u00a0\nIt was narrated from Ibn Mas\u2018ood, al-Bara\u2019 ibn \u2018Aazib and \u2018Aa\u2019ishah that she is not permissible (in marriage) for the zaani under any circumstances. They said: They are still zaanis whenever they are together, because of the general meaning of the verse and the report.\u00a0\nIt may be that what they meant by that was the period before they repent or before it is established that she is not pregnant, in which case it is the same as our view.\u00a0\nWith regard to it being forbidden in absolute terms, that is not correct, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAll others are lawful, provided you seek (them in marriage) with Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) from your property\u201d [an-Nisa\u2019 4:24].\u00a0\nBecause she is permissible (in marriage) for someone other than the one who committed zina with her, she is also permissible to him, like any other woman.\u00a0\nEnd quote from al-Mughni, 7/108.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim to turn a woman against her husband because that leads to the breakup of families, even if there was a bitter dispute between the spouses. Some scholars regarded this as a major sin. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cHe is not one of us who turns a woman against her husband.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2175; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\nAbu Dawood (5170) also narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever turns a man\u2019s wife or slave against him is not one of us.\u201d\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\nShaykh \u2018Abd al-\u2018Azeem Abaadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cWhoever turns a woman against her husband\u201d (means) by mentioning the husband\u2019s bad qualities to his wife, or mentioning the good qualities of another man to her.\u00a0\n\u2018Awn al-Ma\u2018bood, 6/159\u00a0\nAnd he said \u201cWhoever turns a man\u2019s wife\u201d means: he deceives her and corrupts her, or makes the idea of divorce attractive to her so that he or someone else can marry her, and so on.\n\u2018Awn al-Ma\u2018bood, 14/52\u00a0\nAl-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our shaykh, ash-Sha\u2018raawi, said: That also includes the case where a woman who is angry with her husband comes to him so that he can reconcile between them, for example, so he offers her abundant food and wants to spend on her and honour her, even if that is in order to honour her husband, then her heart may be inclined to someone else and she starts to look down on her husband. This is also included in this hadeeth. The wise man should be careful with regard to such matters, even if his intention is good.\u00a0\nHe said: I did this several times; I put pressure on the woman who was angry with her husband, and I advised my family to leave her hungry, so that she would go back and would appreciate how blessed she was with her husband.\nEnd quote from Fayd al-Qadeer Sharh al-Jaami\u2018 al-Kabeer, 6/159\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nIf a person turns a woman against her husband and spoils her for him so that she leaves him, then he marries her, his marriage is not valid and they must be separated, according to the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him). This is also the view of the Maalikis. For more information on the ruling on this issue and what is meant by turning a woman against her husband, please see the answer to question no. 84849\nBased on the above, if this man is the one who turned the woman against her husband, so that she would get divorced for his sake, it is not permissible for him to marry her, especially when he has committed zina with her. There is a difference of opinion concerning marriage of the zaani to the woman with whom he committed zina. In this case he has combined two evils: turning a woman against her husband and zina.\u00a0\nBut if he is not the one who turned her against her husband, as appears to be the case from the question, and he only got to know her and meet her after she had left her husband and she had left his house, then his marriage to her is valid, if she has got divorced from her first husband, on condition that they both repent to Allah, may He be exalted, from what occurred between them.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Is Divorce in Anger Valid?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is divorce in anger valid?\nIf the anger reached a level where the individual did not know what he was saying, or it was extreme anger that made him issue the divorce , and were it not for the anger he would not have issued the divorce, then it does not count as a divorce .\u00a0\nDoes triple divorce count as one divorce?\nThe jurists differed concerning the threefold divorce , and the most correct opinion is that it counts as one divorce , whether it was uttered in a single phrase, such as saying \u201cyou are thrice divorced\u201d, or it was uttered in separate phrases such as saying, \u201cyou are divorced, you are divorced, you are divorced.\u201d\u00a0\nBy the same token, if he issued a divorce then he repeated it during the `Iddah, the divorce before taking her back is part of the first divorce, because it only happens once, and divorce can only happen again after a marriage contract or after taking the wife back.\u00a0\nDo you need witnesses for divorce?\nIt is not essential or obligatory to have witnesses to the divorce. If a man utters the word of divorce, then divorce has taken place, even if it is in the absence of the wife or no one else was present. The same applies if he writes the word of divorce in a message or on a piece of paper with the intention of divorce; divorce has taken place in this case.\u00a0\nIt was narrated that there was scholarly consensus that it is not essential to have witnesses to divorce.\u00a0\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the issue of having witnesses to taking the wife back:\u00a0\n\u201cAmong the evidence that it is not essential is the fact that there was scholarly consensus that it is not essential to have witnesses to divorce, as was narrated by Al-Muwazi\u2018i in Taysir Al-Bayan. And taking back the wife is of a similar nature, so it (having witnesses) is not essential in that case as it is not essential in the case of divorce.\u201d (Nayl Al-Awtar, 6/300)\u00a0\nAllah has enjoined having witnesses to divorce and taking back the wife in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cThen when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims),\u201d [At-Talaq 65:2]\nThis command is by way of recommendation and preference according to the majority of jurists.\u00a0\nAbu Dawud (2188) narrated that `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about a man who divorced his wife, then had intercourse with her but he had not called witnesses to the divorce or to his taking her back, and he said: Your divorce was not in accordance with the Sunnah and your taking her back was not in accordance with the Sunnah; bring witnesses to the divorce and to taking her back, and do not do (this mistake) again. It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.\u00a0\nIt may also be understood as meaning that it is recommended to have witnesses.\u00a0\nThe words \u201cbring witnesses to the divorce and to taking her back, and do not do (this mistake) again\u201d indicate that witnessing divorce or taking back the wife may come after the fact, hence he told him to bring witnesses to both even though they had happened previously.\u00a0\nShaykh `Abd Al-Muhsin Al-`Abbad (may Allah preserve him) said:\u00a0\n\u201cThis indicates that witnessing may come later and that it does not have to be at the time of the divorce or at the time of taking the wife back; rather a man may issue a divorce and then have it witnessed or he may take back his wife and then have it witnessed. And the taking back may be in the form of intercourse, because if a man has intercourse with his divorced wife during her \u2018Iddah, that constitutes taking her back. Or it may be done verbally, but having it witnessed is required so that it will be known that the divorce has ended with the taking back. And the same applies to divorce.\u201d (Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud)\u00a0\nTo sum up, your divorce issued in the state of extreme anger does not count as such, and the threefold divorce counts as one divorce; it is not essential to have divorce witnessed and the same applies to taking the wife back.\u00a0\nWe advise you to be careful and avoid using the word divorce (Talaq) altogether.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on a man kissing his adult daughter and hugging her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    For a man to embrace and hug his daughter, or kiss her on the \n    head or cheek or between the eyes by way of showing compassion, kindness and \n    love is permissible, even if she is an adult, on condition that there be no \n    fear of fitnah or provocation of desire. Excluded from that is kissing on \n    the mouth, which is only for spouses, and which usually provokes desire.\u00a0\n\n    Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Can a man \n    kiss a woman who is his mahram? He said: If he has come home from a journey \n    and does not fear (temptation) for himself.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Muflih said: But he should never do that on the mouth, \n    only on the forehead or head. \n\n    End quote from al-Adaab al-Shar\u2018iyyah, 2/256. See also\n    al-Iqnaa\u2018, 3/156; al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 13/130\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\u00a0\n\n    Is it permissible for a man to kiss his daughter when she has \n    grown up and passed the age of puberty, whether she is married or not, and \n    whether the kissing is on her hand or mouth or so on? If she kisses him in \n    those places, what is the ruling?\u00a0\n\n    He replied (may Allah have mercy on him):\u00a0\n\n    There is nothing wrong with a man kissing his daughter, \n    whether she is older or younger, without desire so long as that is on her \n    cheek once she has grown up, because it is proven from Abu Bakr (may Allah \n    be pleased with him) that he kissed his daughter \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be \n    pleased with her) on her cheek. And because kissing on the mouth may lead to \n    provocation of sexual desire, so it is better and safer not to do that. \n    Similarly, a daughter may kiss her father on his nose or head, without \n    desire. But if there is desire then that is haraam for all concerned, so as \n    to avoid temptation and so as to block means that may lead to immorality. \n    And Allah is the source of strength.\n\n    End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/78, 79.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    Embracing sons and daughters when they are small, hugging \n    them, smelling them and kissing them are all part of the compassions and \n    warmth that people should give in abundance to their children and not \n    deprive them of it, because it is compassion that Allah has created in the \n    hearts of His slaves, and Allah only shows mercy to those of His slaves who \n    are merciful.\u00a0\n\n    We advise fathers and mothers not to deprive them of this \n    parental gesture, because it is a basic psychological need, especially in \n    small children, as is proven in all psychological and educational studies, \n    both contemporary and classical.\u00a0\n\n    It is proven in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (5997) that Abu \n    Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) kissed al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali, when \n    al-Aqra\u2018 ibn Haabis al-Tameemi was sitting with him. al-Aqra\u2018 said: I have \n    ten children and I have never kissed one of them. The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) looked at him, then he said: \u201cThe \n    one who does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (3704) it also says: al-Bara\u2019 \n    entered with Abu Bakr upon his family -- after he reached Madinah as a \n    migrant. \u2018Aa\u2019ishah was lying down as she was suffering a fever. I [al-Bara\u2019] \n    saw her father kiss her cheek and say: How are you, O my daughter?\u00a0\n\n    And Allah knows best."

        "question": "He divorced her three times and she wants to marry a man who is on his deathbed so that she can go back to the first husband",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a man divorces his wife three times, she is not permissible for him until she has been married to another husband, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband. Then, if the other husband divorces her, it is no sin on both of them that they reunite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by All\u00e2h. These are the limits of All\u00e2h, which He makes plain for the people who have knowledge\u201d\n[al-Baqarah 2:230].\u00a0\nAnd it is essential that the second husband have intercourse with her; if no intercourse takes place between them, she does not become permissible for the first husband.\u00a0\nThe scholars are unanimously agreed on that, and the evidence for that from the Sunnah is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (2639) and Muslim (1433) from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that Rifaa\u2018ah divorced his wife for the third time, and after that she married \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan ibn al-Zubayr, and claimed that he had not consummated the marriage with her and she wanted to get divorced from him and go back to her first husband.

No, not until you taste his (\u2018Abd al-Rahmaan\u2019s) sweetness and he tastes your sweetness.\u201d\u00a0\nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThe words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), \u201cnot until you taste his sweetness and he tastes your sweetness\u201d are a metaphor for intercourse, likening its pleasure to the sweetness of honey.\u00a0\nIn this hadeeth we see that the woman who has been divorced three times is not permissible for the one who divorced her until she has been married to another husband, and he has intercourse with her, then he divorces her and her \u2018iddah comes to an end. As for merely doing the marriage contract with her, that does not make her permissible for the first husband. This is the view of all the scholars among the Sahaabah and Taabi\u2018een and those who came after them, except Sa\u2018eed ibn al-Musayyib; perhaps this hadeeth did not reach him.

The woman does not become permissible to her first husband by means of this haraam marriage, even if the second husband has intercourse with her.\u00a0\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nTahleel marriage is haraam and is invalid according to most scholars. \u2026 If it is stipulated that it is tahleel before the marriage contract is done, but it is not mentioned in the marriage contract, or he intended it as a tahleel marriage without that being stipulated, then the marriage is also invalid.\nEnd quote from al-Mughni, 10/49-51\u00a0\nIf the intention is on the part of the woman only, and no agreement to that effect was made with the second husband and he did not intend it to be a tahleel marriage, then the marriage is valid and she becomes permissible thereby for the first husband, if the second husband consummates the marriage with her then divorces her or dies, and the woman\u2019s intention does not have any effect on that.\u00a0\nThis has been explained in the answer to question no. 159041.\u00a0\nBut the fact that she is giving money to this man so that he will agree to this marriage contract indicates that he is aware of the intention of tahleel and that he does not want to marry her at all, so by accepting that he is like a borrowed billy-goat, who comes between the divorced spouses to make her permissible for her first husband.\u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 76324.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "He did the marriage contract with her but she does not have any accommodation and he wants to be intimate with her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nIf the \n    marriage contract has been done, then you have become his wife and it is \n    permissible for a husband to be intimate with his wife however he wants. But \n    she can refuse to let him have his way with her until he gives her the mahr \n    and prepares a suitable marital home for her.\u00a0\nIbn \n    al-Mundhir (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated that the scholars were \n    unanimously agreed that a woman has the right to refuse to let her husband \n    consummate the marriage with her until he gives her the mahr.\u00a0\nAl-Mughni \n    (7/200).\u00a0\nAl-Kasaani \n    said in Badaa\u2019i\u2019 al-Sanaa\u2019i\u2019 (4/19) that a woman has the right to \n    refuse to let her husband have his way with her until he provides her with a \n    home.\u00a0\nThis is the \n    shar\u2019i ruling on this matter.\u00a0\nWhat we are \n    afraid of is that this man is not serious about providing a home and \n    striving to settle in it and build a family, and that he is content to get \n    his pleasure from meeting you. Hence we advise you not to answer his demand \n    and not to let him be intimate with you, until he provides you with a home. \n    This will encourage him to pay attention and hasten to consummate the \n    marriage, and protect you. For intercourse may take place as the result of \n    pressure on his part and weakness on yours, then pregnancy may occur, and \n    that may lead to bad consequences in the event of divorce or delay of \n    consummation of the marriage and announcement thereof to the people.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nIf your work \n    is permissible and free of any haraam things, then we do not advise you to \n    give it up, and the husband has no right to prevent you from working so long \n    as he did the marriage contract with you at the time when you were doing \n    this job and he did not stipulate that you should leave it. At the very \n    least you should keep your job even if you take a temporary leave of absence \n    until you find out what your husband is really like.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nAttention \n    must be paid to the religious commitment and character of a husband, and one \n    should find out whether he prays regularly and keeps away from haraam \n    things. From your question it seems to us that this is not a man who is good \n    in these ways, hence it is easy for him to insult your parents and to \n    threaten to cheat on you. We do not know how such things could be said by a \n    wise man who understands how things are. Is this a proper way of putting \n    pressure on his wife \u2013 threatening to commit zina as a punishment to her? \n    This is indicative of a severe lack of religious commitment and \n    intelligence. If we had been consulted about the matter before the marriage \n    contract was done, we would have advised you not to marry him. But as the \n    contract has been done, we say: If he is careless about prayer, then you \n    should advise him time after time. If he does not improve, then separate \n    from him, for there is nothing good for you in marriage to a man who is \n    careless about prayer.\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nIf it \n    becomes clear to you that he is messing about and is not serious about \n    preparing a home etc, and that he may mistreat you and your family \u2013 even if \n    he does pray regularly \u2013 then we advise you to leave him, even if you free \n    yourself from the marriage by giving up some of your rights (i.e., khula\u2019).\u00a0\nYou say that \n    your family and everyone around you thinks that he is not suitable for you. \n    The family\u2019s opinion in such matters is usually closest to the truth, \n    because they look at the matter with a measure of wisdom, far removed from \n    emotion which may sometimes blind one to the truth. They also have knowledge \n    and experience of such matters. Hence we think that you should discuss the \n    matter with your family, and do what they advise you, as well as praying to \n    Allaah for guidance (istikhaarah), for He does not betray the one who seeks \n    guidance and the one who asks for advice will not regret it.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to make things easy for you and to take away your distress and to guide you to good things.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "The situation of one who is illegitimate and the ruling on marrying him",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    There are some ahaadeeth that condemn the illegitimate child, \n    but most of these ahaadeeth are da\u2019eef (weak) and are not saheeh (sound). It \n    was narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (4/39) and by Ahmad in \n    al-Musnad (2/311) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) \n    that the Prophets  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u201cThe illegitimate child is the most evil of the three\u201d meaning more evil \n    than his parents. Among the scholars who classed this as hasan were Ibn \n    al-Qayyim in al-Manaar al-Muneef (133) and al-Albaani in \n    al-Silsilat al-Saheehah (672).\u00a0\n\n    The scholars interpreted this hadeeth in a number of ways, \n    the most famous of which was that suggested by Sufyaan al-Thawri, who said: \n    it means he is the most evil of the three if he does the same action as his \n    parents did (i.e., zina or adultery).\u00a0\n\n    This was narrated from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah, who said that the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cHe is the most evil \n    of the threeif he does the same action as \n    his parents did \u2013 meaning the illegitimate child.\u201d Although its isnaad is \n    da\u2019eef, it was interpreted in this manner by the salaf, as stated above.\u00a0\n\n    This interpretation is supported by the report narrated by \n    al-Haakim (4/100) \u2013 with an isnaad of which al-Albaani said, \u201cIt may be \n    regarded as hasan\u201d \u2013 from \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), that \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe \n    illegitimate child does not bear any part of his parents\u2019 burden of sin.\n    \u2018and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of \n    another\u2019 [al-An\u2019aam 6:164 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning].\u201d \n    (al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 2186)\u00a0\n\n    Some scholars said that this hadeeth is to be interpreted as \n    meaning that there is some evil in most illegitimate children because they \n    are created from an evil nutfah (sperm drop), and usually nothing good is \n    created from an evil nutfah. If a good soul comes out of this nutfah then it \n    will enter Paradise. This hadeeth is to be taken as a general rule to which \n    there may be exceptions. (See al-Manaar al-Muneef, 133).\u00a0\n\n    Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on \n    him) said: \u201cIf an illegitimate child believes and does righteous deeds, he \n    will enter Paradise, otherwise he will be punished for his deeds just like \n    anyone else. The punishment is for the deeds, not for the lineage. Rather \n    the illegitimate child is condemned because he is expected to do evil deeds, \n    as often happens. By the same token, good lineages are regarded as \n    praiseworthy because such people are expected to do good deeds. But when a \n    person does a deed, then the reward or punishment is based on that, and the \n    most noble of people before Allaah are those who are most pious. (al-Fataawa \n    al-Kubra, 5/83).\u00a0\n\n    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah: \u201cIf an \n    illegitimate child dies in Islam (as a Muslim), he will enter Paradise, and \n    his being illegitimate does not have any effect on that, because that was \n    not due to his own actions, rather it was the action of someone else. Allaah \n    says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u2018and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of \n    another\u2019 \n\n    [al-An\u2019aam 6:164]\n\n    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u2018Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned\u2019\n\n    [al-Toor 52:21]\n\n    And there are other similar verses.\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the words narrated from the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \u2018No illegitimate child will \n    enter Paradise,\u2019 this hadeeth is not saheeh. It was mentioned by al-Haafiz \n    Ibn Jawzi in al-Mawdoo\u2019aat, but it is one of the ahaadeeth that were \n    fabricated against the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him). And Allaah is the Source of strength.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    With regard to the ruling on marrying one who is \n    illegitimate, none of the reputable fuqaha\u2019 have stated that this is haraam. \n    However there was some difference of opinion among the Hanbalis as to \n    whether such a person is compatible with a woman of good lineage. Some of \n    them said that he is compatible with her, and othesr did not agree with that \n    because that will be a source of shame for the woman, because he will be her \n    guardian, and that would also affect her child. (See al-Mughni, \n    7/28).\n\n    (al-Mawsoo\u2019ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 34/282).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked \n    about a man who married his daughter to a person who was apparently \n    illegitimate \u2013 what was the ruling on that? He answered as follows:\u00a0\n\n    \u201cIf he is Muslim, then the marriage is sound, because the sin \n    of his mother and the one who committed zina with her does not rest on him. \n    Allaah says \u2018and no bearer of burdens shall bear \n    the burden of another\u2019 [al-An\u2019aam 6:164 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning].\u00a0 \n    And there is no shame on him because of their action, if he adheres \n    steadfastly to the religion of Allaah and develops good characteristics, \n    because Allaah says\n\n    \u2018O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, \n    and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, \n    the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa \n    [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]. Verily, Allaah is \n    All-Knowing, All-Aware\u2019\n\n    [al-Hujuraat 49:13]\n\n    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said, when he was asked who is the most noble of people, \u2018Those who are \n    most pious.\u2019 And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    \u2018If a person\u2019s actions make him less worthy than others, his lineage will \n    not make him more worthy.\u2019\u201d \n\n    From Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/166.\n\n    \u00a0And Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Is it permissible for a Muslim woman to appear in front of a kaafir woman without hijab?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with a woman looking at a man; hence men, whether they are Muslim or kaafirs, are not enjoined to cover their faces. Women are enjoined to cover themselves but men are not. Similarly, there is nothing wrong with a woman looking at another woman if one of them is not Muslim. That is because the prohibition on looking is due to the fear of desire being provoked, and it is well known that a woman will not be stirred by desire if she looks at another woman.\u00a0\nAs for the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cIt is no sin on them (the Prophet\u2019s wives, if they appear unveiled) before their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brother\u2019s sons, or the sons of their sisters, or their own women\u201d [al-Ahzaab 33:55], the word nisa\u2019ihinna (their own women) does not apply exclusively to believing women; rather it also includes disbelieving women. If a woman looks at a non-Muslim woman that will not result in evil, so there is nothing wrong with her looking at a non-Muslim woman, especially if she needs to meet with her, such as if she is a teacher or a doctor and so on. It would be too difficult for her to observe hijab before her or to look away from her."

It is essential to note that that which we have said of these qualities and deeds is not the same with all women, rather there are different degrees thereof, and that is well known. The more modest, knowledgeable and devoted to worship a woman is, the more desirable she is as a wife.\u00a0\nWhatever the case, the woman who is religiously committed is the one who will help a man to protect his own religious commitment, and help him with regard to his Hereafter; she will make him happy when he looks at her and she will protect him when he is absent, and she will raise his children well.\u00a0\nSee the answer to question no. 83777 for information on proposing to a girl who is religiously committed but not beautiful; you will find useful information there that is complementary to this answer.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on Caesarean births",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nCaesarean section is an operation in which the abdomen is cut in order to bring the child out of the mother. It is said that it is so called after Julius Caesar, because he was the first one to be born in this manner, when his mother died during labour, after which the doctor cut open her stomach and brought him out of her, and Caesar lived to become the emperor of Rome.\u00a0\nSecondly:\nNatural childbirth is better for the mother, but this does not mean that Caesarean section should not be used when necessary. Among such cases of necessity are: when the placenta is in the lower part of the uterus (placenta praevia), when the foetus is deprived of oxygen, when there are tumours in the pelvis, when there is high blood pressure, when there is haemorrhaging that threatens the life of the mother and baby, when there are conjoined (\u201cSiamese\u201d) twins, when the foetus is abnormally large, and other cases of necessity where Caesarean section is indicated. This is one of the great blessings of Allah, an example of His mercy towards His creation.\u00a0\nMany doctors take the matter of resorting to Caesarean section lightly, because they want to earn more money or because they cannot be patient with the mother during natural childbirth. Some women ask for this surgery in order to preserve the gracefulness of their bodies or so as to avoid the pain of childbirth.\u00a0\nUndoubtedly doing this leads to the loss of numerous benefits, and also has effects on the mother and on future births, as referred to by the brother in his question.\u00a0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nI would like to take this opportunity to point out a phenomenon that has been mentioned to us, which is that many obstetricians, male and female, in the hospitals are too keen for birth to take place by surgical means, which is known as a Caesarean. I am afraid that this may be a plot against the Muslims, because the more births take place in this manner, the more the skin of the abdomen is weakened and pregnancy becomes more dangerous for the woman, and she becomes unable to get pregnant. Some of the people who work in private hospitals have told me that many women come to the hospitals and their specialists tell them that there is no alternative to a caesarean,\u00a0 then they go to this private hospital and give birth naturally. He mentioned that there were about eighty such cases in one month. This means that the issue is serious, and attention must be drawn to it. It should be noted that in this case some pain and exhaustion is inevitable.\u00a0\n\u201cHis mother bears him with hardship. And she brings him forth with hardship\u201d\u00a0[al-Ahqaaf 46:15]\nIt is not something to be done as soon as the woman feels a contraction, so that she may avoid pain. Natural childbirth is better than a caesarean. End quote.\u00a0\nLiqaa\u2019aat al-Baab il-Maftoohah (2/question no. 42).\u00a0\nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked:\u00a0\nAllah says in Soorat \u2018Abasa (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cThen He makes the Path easy for him\u201d\u00a0[\u2018Abasa 80:20]\nSo Allah guarantees to make it easy for this newborn. Many men and women have noticed that there is haste in performing caesarean sections. Is this a sign of weak trust in Allah, may He be glorified and exalted?\u00a0\nHe replied:\u00a0\nI think that this method which people use nowadays when the woman feels the contractions and goes to the hospital, and they do a caesarean section for her, I think that this is inspired by the shaytaan, and that the harm caused is far greater than any benefits, because a woman is bound to feel pain when in labour, but this pain has a number of benefits:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 It is an expiation for sin\u00a0\n2 \u2013 It raises her in status if she is patient and seeks reward.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 The woman understands the extent of the pain suffered by other mothers.\u00a0\n4 \u2013 She will appreciate the extent of the blessing of good health that Allah bestows on her.\u00a0\n5 \u2013 It will increase her love towards her child, because the more difficult it is to attain something, the dearer it becomes.\u00a0\n6 \u2013 If the child is born by via the usual, well-known route, this is better for him and the woman.\u00a0\n7 \u2013 Damage may be expected from this surgery, because this operation weakens the wall of the uterus etc, which may tear. And it may be successful or unsuccessful.\u00a0\n8 \u2013 The woman who gets used to having caesareans is unlikely to give birth in the natural manner, because that is not possible, and there is the risk that the site of the surgery may rupture.\n9 \u2013 Having surgery results in having fewer children, because if the abdomen is cut three times in different places, it becomes weak and future pregnancy becomes dangerous.\u00a0\n10 \u2013 This is a kind of luxury, and luxury is a thing that leads to doom, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u201cVerily, before that, they indulged in luxury\u2026\u201d\u00a0[al-Waaqi\u2019ah 56:45]\nWomen should be patient and seek reward, and should continue to give birth in the natural way, because that is better for them in this world and in the Hereafter. Men should also pay attention to this issue, for we do not know, perhaps our enemies are the ones who have made these operations easy for us so that we will lose these benefits and be subject to these losses.\u00a0\nQuestion: What is meant by luxury?\u00a0\nAnswer: Luxury includes avoiding the natural pain of childbirth. This is a kind of luxury. If luxury does not help one to obey Allah, then it is either blameworthy or at the very least permissible.\u00a0\nLiqaa\u2019aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (86/question no. 17).\u00a0\nTo sum up: Caesarean section should not be resorted to except in cases of necessity, when natural childbirth is not possible, or it poses a danger to the mother or the child.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

What you must do is cut off ties with this man who is toying with the rulings of Allaah, and regarding as permissible that which Allaah has forbidden. His claim that this is a marriage means that he regards it as permissible to do with you what a man does with his wife. Wouldn\u2019t any adulterer on the face of the earth be able to do such a marriage with the immoral adulteress who is his partner in sin, so that she would be his wife and they would not be committing adultery?! \u00a0\nWe are afraid that he may gradually make you take off your hijab in front of him or do something even worse, and take a picture of you and try to threaten you with this picture. It is easy nowadays to combine pictures with one another and threaten you using these pictures if you do not do what he wants. Many such cases have happened. See the answer to question no. 91868 and learn a lesson from it.\u00a0\nHow many heedless women have been gradually tricked in such ways by treacherous \u201cwolves\u201d until they lost their honour and chastity, then these men leave them, forgetting about the so-called marriage, and there is no maintenance and no rights, not even a divorce!\u00a0\nIn a valid marriage it is essential that the woman\u2019s guardian be present, along with two witnesses of good character from among the Muslims. Any marriage that is conducted without a guardian is invalid, and a woman who gives herself in marriage without her guardian is a zaaniyah (adulteress), as Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \u201cThe one who gives herself in marriage is a zaaniyah.\u201d Narrated by al-Daaraqutni. \u00a0\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThere is no marriage except with a guardian and two witnesses.\u201d Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019 no. 7557.\u00a0\nAnd he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAny woman who gives herself in marriage without the permission of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.\u201d Narrated by Ahmad (24417), Abu Dawood (2083) and al-Tirmidhi (1102); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019 (2709).\u00a0\nIts seems to us from your question that you fear Allaah, may He be exalted, and you do not want to fall into haraam and be exposed to the wrath of the Almighty. Hence we advise you strongly to forget about this man and to cut off all ties with him, via the internet or otherwise, for every word, smile and moment of desire will be recorded against you, and tomorrow you will be questioned about it before your Lord.

A \n    number of scholars are of the view that it is obligatory for everyone who is \n    able for it, and they quoted as evidence the apparent meaning of the words \n    of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \u201cO young \n    men, whoever among you can afford to get married, then let him do so, for it \n    is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity. And whoever is \n    not able to do that, then let him fast, for that will be a shield for him.\u201d \n    Narrated in al-Saheehayn from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas\u2019ood.\u00a0\n\n    In is narrated in al-Sunan via more than one isnaad \n    that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: \u201cMarry and produce offspring for I will be proud of your numbers \n    on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Ayyim (translated here as \u201csingle\u201d) refers to the woman who \n    has no husband or the man who has no wife, whether they were married then \n    separated or were never married. End quote.\u00a0\n\n    Secondly:\u00a0\n\n    The son should tell his father clearly of his wish to get \n    married, and the father should understand the importance of that, and he \n    should help his son to get married. Many of the fuqaha\u2019 are of the view that \n    that is obligatory if he is able for it.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Our \n    companions said: The father must keep his son chaste if he is obliged to \n    spend on him and if he needs to be kept chaste.\u00a0 This is the view of some of \n    the companions of al-Shaafa\u2019i. End quote from al-Mughni (8/172).\u00a0\n\n    Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: A \n    person\u2019s need to get married is urgent, and in some cases it may be like his \n    need for food and drink. Hence the scholars said: It is obligatory for the \n    one who has to spend on a person to arrange his marriage if he can afford to \n    get married, so it is obligatory for fathers to arrange the marriages of \n    their sons, if the sons needs to get married but cannot afford to do so. But \n    I heard that some fathers who forget how they were when they were young, \n    when the sons ask them to arrange their marriage, they say: Get married at \n    your own expense. This is not permissible and it is haraam if he able to \n    arrange his marriage. His son will dispute with him on the Day of \n    Resurrection if he does not arrange his marriage when he is able to do so. \n    End quote from Majmoo\u2019 Fataawa Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen (18/410).\u00a0\n\n    A widespread mistake is when the father refuses to listen to \n    his son concerning this matter, and ignores the son\u2019s need. His need for \n    marriage may be urgent, and as a result of delaying marriage he may fall \n    into some kind of deviation. It is well known that people vary with regard \n    to this need and their level of self-control in this matter. The father may \n    be sinning by preventing his son from getting married if he needs that, as \n    stated above.\u00a0\n\n    Some fathers give precedence to study and work over marriage \n    in all cases, and they never consider arranging their son\u2019s marriage before \n    that. This is also wrong. Rather they should study the matter and weigh up \n    the pros and cons. They should find out how much their son needs to get \n    married, and how able he is to combine marriage and study, and which should \n    be given priority if it is not possible to do both. Protecting one\u2019s \n    religious commitment is important, and takes precedence over protecting \n    one\u2019s physical health and wealth, so naturally it takes precedence over \n    studying.\u00a0\n\n    Thirdly:\u00a0\n\n    The father may be excused for refusing to arrange his son\u2019s \n    marriage before he completes his studies, either because he sees that the \n    son is not well-organized in handling his affairs and cannot take \n    responsibility for himself, let alone anyone else, or he thinks that he is \n    neglecting his studies and would neglect them even more after marriage, or \n    he does not think that he really needs to get married, and it is only a \n    passing fancy or he wants to imitate someone else. The son should excuse his \n    father and strive to convince him, and explain to him the extent of his need \n    for marriage and how able he is to take care of his wife after that.\u00a0\n\n    We ask Allaah to guide you.\u00a0\n\n    And Allaah knows best."

By Allaah, I am the one who \n    fears Allaah the most among you and I am the most pious, but I fast and I \n    break my fast, I pray and I sleep, and I marry women. Whoever turns away \n    from my Sunnah is not of me.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5063) and Muslim \n    (1401).\u00a0\u00a0\nThus is it \n    clear that no one has the right to forbid women (marriage) to himself.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nWhoever has \n    done that has to repent to Allaah, may He be exalted, and he has to offer \n    expiation for breaking an oath, because Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO \n    Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allaah has allowed to \n    you, seeking to please your wives?

Whoever cannot do that must fast for three days.\u00a0\nThis has \n    been explained in detail in the answer to question no. \n    45676.\u00a0\nFourthly: \u00a0\nThe ruling \n    on marriage varies from one person to another, according to financial and \n    physical ability and how much a person needs to get married.

        "question": "Can a person with AIDS masturbate?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nA person who is a carrier \n    of the virus or who has AIDS may get married to a woman who is healthy or \n    who also has the disease, if she accepts that after coming to know of his \n    condition and to what extent he is affected, and they may agree not to have \n    children, or not to have intercourse. The husband may be masturbated by his \n    wife, and there is no sin on him for that.\u00a0\nBut it is not permissible \n    for him to get married without informing the woman of his sickness, because \n    concealing it is deceit and is haraam. If he conceals it then the wife finds \n    out, she has the right to annul the marriage.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nMasturbation is haraam, as \n    has been explained in question no.\n    329.\u00a0\nBut if the person who has \n    AIDS cannot get married, and he is afraid that he may fall into zina \n    (fornication), it is permissible for him to masturbate, so as to choose the \n    lesser of two evils.\u00a0\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn \n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard to ejaculating by \n    choice, if he masturbates with his hand, this is haraam according to most of \n    the scholars, and it is one of the two reports narrated from Ahmad, in fact \n    it is the more correct of the two. According to another report it is \n    makrooh, but if he is compelled to do that, such as one who fears that he \n    may fall into zina if he does not masturbate, or he fears that he may become \n    ill, then in this case there are two well known scholarly views and in this \n    case a number of the earlier and later scholars granted a concession, \n    whereas others forbade it. And Allaah knows best. End quote from \n    al-Fataawa al-Kubra (1/302).\u00a0\nIt says in Sharh \n    al-Muntaha (3/366): Whoever masturbates with no need, man or woman, his \n    action is forbidden and he should be disciplined for that because it is a \n    sin. But if he does it for fear of committing zina or homosexuality, then \n    there is no punishment, and if he does it for fear of physical harm the same \n    applies, and more so. But it is not permissible for a man to masturbate with \n    his hand unless he is unable to get married, because if he is able to get \n    married there is no need for that.

        "question": "She is asking about marrying a man who plays soccer (football)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nPlaying soccer is permissible subject to certain conditions.\u00a0\n1 \u2013 That it should not be for money, whether it is paid by the two teams, one of them or by a third party, because it is not permissible to give prizes except for competitions which help prepare one for jihad, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThere should be no (money) prizes for competitions except archery competitions and races with camels and horses.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1700), al-Nasaa\u2019i (3585), Abu Dawood (2575) and Ibn Maajah (2878); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\nSome scholars added to these three anything that helps in jihad and propagating Islam, such as competitions in knowledge of Qur\u2019aan, hadeeth and fiqh, in which is permissible to offer prizes.\u00a0\nTherefore it is not permissible to give or take the prizes that are given to those who win soccer matches and tournaments between two or more teams, and they come under the heading of forbidden betting.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 The game should not be accompanied by anything haraam, such as uncovering the \u2018awrah. The man\u2019s \u2018awrah is the area from the navel to the knee, and it is well known that most of those who play this game uncover their thighs, but this is haraam and is not permitted.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 The game should not lead to anything that is haraam, such as missing prayers, or missing Jumu\u2019ah prayer or prayers in congregation. Unfortunately we say that many of those who play this game in clubs miss the prayers because of the matches. It is well known that delaying the prayer beyond its time with no excuse is a major sin, and it is narrated from a number of scholars that the one who does that deliberately is a kaafir, so we must be very careful.\u00a0\nThis has to do with the game itself. But if there are tournaments on which money is spent and people are distracted by them, and waste time because of them, and they provoke factionalism and both Muslims and kaafirs, righteous and evildoers are glorified to the extent that a player becomes a role model for one\u2019s sons and daughters, then this definitely should not be allowed, because among the ummah there are enough calamities, ignorance and backwardness to distract them from games on which millions of the people\u2019s wealth are spent.\u00a0\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The basic principle concerning such games and sports is that they are permissible if they serve an innocent purpose, as was referred to by Ibn al-Qayyim in his book al-Faroosiyyah and as was mentioned by Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen Ibn Taymiyah and others. If that is done as training for jihad and attack and retreat, or for physical fitness, or to ward off chronic diseases and strengthen the spirit, then it comes under the heading of permissible things, if the one who does it has a sound intention. In all cases it is essential that there be no harm caused to bodies or minds, and that it does not lead to the grudges and hatred that usually occur between players, and that it does not distract them from things that are more important, and that it does not prevent them from remembrance of Allaah (dhikr) or prayer.\u00a0\nBut whoever thinks about these sports as they are played nowadays will find that they are involve evil things which dictate that they should be disallowed, in addition to the fact that it is in the nature of the game to create factionalism and stir up resentment and hatred between the victors and the losers, this team and that team, as is quite apparent. They are also accompanied by physical danger for the players as the result of collisions and fisticuffs. Games hardly ever end without one of them breaking a bone or being injured or losing consciousness. This is why ambulances are always present.\u00a0\nThe games also continue during the times of prayer, which results in people not praying or offering the prayer late.\u00a0\nThe players also uncover their \u2018awrah, which is forbidden. The man\u2019s \u2018awrah is the area from the navel to the knee. But you will find that their clothes end at mid-thigh, and some of them are shorter than that. It is well known that the thigh is part of the \u2018awrah because of the hadeeth: \u201cCover your thigh for the thigh is part of the \u2018awrah.\u201d Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2797) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to \u2018Ali: \u201cDo not uncover your thigh and do not look at the thigh of anyone, living or dead.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood (4015). And Allaah knows best.\u00a0\nEnd quote from Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, vol. 8, question no. 1948.\u00a0\nAnd he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nPlaying football nowadays is accompanied by reprehensible things which mean that playing it should be disallowed. These things may be summed up as follows:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 It is proven to us that play continues during the times of prayer, which results in the players and spectators missing prayers or prayers in congregation, or they delay performing prayers until the time for them is over. Undoubtedly any action that interferes with performance of prayers on time or leads to missing prayers in congregation with no valid shar\u2019i excuse is haraam.\u00a0\u00a0\n2 \u2013 The nature of this game leads to factionalism, stirring up fitnah and hatred. These results are the opposite of what Islam promotes of tolerance, friendship and brotherhood, and cleaning hearts and souls of hatred, resentment and grudges.\u00a0\u00a0\n3 \u2013 The game involves physical danger for the players as a result of collisions and injuries. Usually the players do not end the game without some of them falling on the pitch unconscious or with broken arms or legs. Nothing is more indicative of that than the fact that there must always be an ambulance present throughout the game.\u00a0\u00a0\n4 \u2013 The purpose behind allowing sports is to make people become physically active and to train them for fighting and to ward off chronic disease. But playing football nowadays has no such aim. As well as the things mentioned above, it is now also taking people\u2019s money for false purposes, let alone the danger of physical injury and the generation of hatred in the hearts of players and spectators, and the stirring up of fitnah. It has even gone so far that some spectators attack some players, which could go as far as murder, as happened in a match a few months ago. This alone is sufficient reason to disallow it. And Allaah is the source of strength. End quote.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe also said:\u00a0\nIf it is done in an organized manner [as in the clubs] it seems that it should be banned altogether, because people becomes deeply involved in it and that prevents people from remembering Allaah, and it more akin to gambling. They call it \u201csport\u201d but it is just a game, and matters of jihad are not like this, and even if the players have some agility and nimbleness, they are not able to strive hard in any other field.\u00a0\nIt also involves other things. Some of them offer prizes for it, and this is gambling. Islam does not allow prizes for anything except competitions which support the religion and strengthen one for that. If it strengthens Islam then it is permissible to engage in competitions. In the hadeeth it says: \u201cThere should be no (money) prizes for competitions except archery competitions and races with camels and horses.\u201d And this applies by analogy with these three to anything that supports Islam. End quote. Question no. 1950.\u00a0\nHe also said: As for one or two people playing with a ball in an unorganized fashion, there is nothing wrong with that, because it does not involve anything haraam. And Allaah knows best. End quote. Question no. 1949.\u00a0\n\u00a0Secondly:\u00a0\nHaving established this, we do not advise you to marry this soccer player unless he gives it up, whether he is playing for a local club or a foreign one, especially since that will result in your moving to live with him in a kaafir country where there is the risk of temptation for oneself or one\u2019s children, and it is difficult for a person to maintain his religious commitment in the environment of that game and in a kaafir country.\u00a0\nYou may also refer to question no. 13363 for more information on living in the land of the mushrikeen.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on marrying a sufi woman",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nSufis are of \n    various kinds with various schools of thought, most of which follow \n    innovation and deviant ways of various kinds. Some of them exceed the proper \n    bounds to the extent of associating others with Allaah, may He be exalted, \n    such as praying to the dead, turning to them to relieve distress and ward \n    off calamity. Some of them follow a great deal of innovation in their deeds, \n    in dhikr and in worship. See question no.\n    4983 for more \n    information on some of the deviations of the Sufis, and question no.\n    34817 for \n    information on shirk and its types.\u00a0\nIt says in\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah: Most of those who are called Sufis \n    nowadays follow innovations of shirk, as well as other innovations, such as \n    what some of them say, \u201cMadad ya sayyid (Help, O Master)\u201dand their \n    calling upon the aqtaab (highest ranking awliya\u2019 or \u201csaints\u201d), reciting \n    dhikr in unison and calling upon Allaah by names that He has not called \n    Himself, such as \u201cHuwa Huwa (He, He)\u201d and \u201cAh, ah (a \n    contraction of the name of Allaah)\u201d. Anyone who reads their books will \n    notice a lot of their innovations of shirk as well as other evils. End \n    quote.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nMarriage to \n    a Sufi woman is subject to further discussion.\u00a0\n1 \u2013 If she \n    is one of those who commits shirk in belief or in deeds, such as one who \n    believes that the awliya\u2019 (\u201csaints\u201d) have knowledge of the unseen and have \n    control over the universe, or she believes in incarnation of the divine or \n    the unity of all things, or she devotes worship to something other than \n    Allaah, such as du\u2019aa\u2019, seeking help, sacrifices or vows, then it is not \n    permissible to marry such a woman, because she has committed major shirk \u2013 \n    Allaah forbid.\n2 \u2013 If she \n    has not fallen into shirk, but she does some acts of innovation such as \n    celebrating the Mawlid (Prophet\u2019s birthday) or invented forms of dhikr, or \n    reciting a certain number of dhikrs for which there is no basis, or a \n    certain manner of dhikr that is not proven in sharee\u2019ah, then it is better \n    not to marry such a woman, because the danger of innovation is great, and \n    the harm caused by it is severe. It is dearer to Iblees than sin, because \n    one may repent from sin, unlike innovation, for the one who does it regards \n    it as part of religion by means of which he may draw closer to Allaah, so \n    how can he give it up? Moreover, marriage to a woman who follows bid\u2019ah \n    presents a danger to the children and to the whole family, especially if the \n    woman speaks well or is of a good attitude, so that others may be deceived \n    by her. Imam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Do not marry the \n    people of innovation, or give your womenfolk to them in marriage, or greet \n    them with salaam\u2026 al-Mudawwanah (1/84).\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nIf he did \n    not know that the woman was a follower of Sufism until he married her, then \n    if she is of the first type that commits shirk in word and deed and belief, \n    he should call her (to the proper way) and advise her and explain to her. If \n    she responds, then praise be to Allaah, otherwise it is obligatory to \n    separate from her, because it is not permissible to marry a mushrik woman or \n    to remain in such a marriage, because Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd do \n    not marry Al-Mushrikaat (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allaah \n    Alone)\u201d\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:221]\nBut if she \n    is of the second type, which does some innovated actions that do not reach \n    the extent of kufr, then each case should be examined separately \u2013 to what \n    extent does the woman adhere or not to the innovation that she believes in, \n    and what effect will that have on the household and the children?\u00a0\nHe should \n    also look at the consequences of divorcing her, and he should do that which \n    is in the best interests of Islam in each case, and which will ward off harm \n    or reduce it as much as possible.\u00a0\nMay Allaah \n    help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah \n    knows best."

        "question": "She claims that she was divorced by her husband. Is it permissible to arrange her marriage without any proof of that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nIf the woman \n    says that she was married then she got divorced and her \u2018iddah ended, should \n    her word be accepted or is it essential to have proof to confirm that she is \n    divorced? There is a difference of opinion among the scholars concerning \n    that.\u00a0\nSome of them \n    say that her word should be accepted and she should be believed, because she \n    is responsible for herself. \u00a0\nOthers say \n    that if it is thought most likely that she is telling the truth, it is \n    permissible to believe her.\u00a0\nOthers make \n    a distinction between one who is a stranger and one who is living in her own \n    city. The word of the former should be accepted ,whereas the one who is in \n    her own city should not get married until proof of her divorce is brought.\u00a0\nSome of them \n    make a distinction between her telling of her divorce from a specific \n    husband, such as saying, \u201cSo and so married me then he divorced me\u201d and her \n    speaking of marriage to an unspecified person. In the former case it is \n    essential to bring proof that she has been divorced by him.\u00a0\nThere \n    follows a brief look at the comments of the fuqaha\u2019:\u00a0\nIt says in\n    al-Mabsoot (5/151): If she says: My husband divorced me or died, and \n    my \u2018iddah has ended, it is permissible for her fianc\u00e9 to marry her and \n    believe her, because the issue of halaal and haraam is something that is \n    determined by sharee\u2019ah and every Muslim is responsible for himself and his \n    words may be accepted with regard to issues that are decided by sharee\u2019ah, \n    but his word is not to be accepted with regard to someone else if the other \n    person says that he is lying. Hence it is permissible to accept her word \n    concerning that. And Allaah knows best what is correct. End quote.\u00a0\nIt says in\n    al-Habr al-Raa\u2019iq (4/64): He indicated that the word of a divorced \n    woman may be accepted when he said: If a (previously) married woman said to \n    another man: My husband divorced me and my \u2018iddah has ended, then it is \n    permissible for him to believe her if he thinks it most likely that she is \n    telling the truth. End quote.\u00a0\n\u2018Aleesh \n    al-Maaliki (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked, as it says in Fath \n    al-\u2018Aliy al-Maalik fi\u2019l-Fatwa \u2018ala Madhhab al-Imam Maalik (2/78): What \n    is your opinion about a woman who came from Fayyoom to al-Qalyoobiyyah and \n    says: I was married in al-Fayoom, and my husband divorced me two months ago, \n    and she has a document confirming a divorce, dated and sealed with the seal \n    of the qaadi in the city where she used to be, and she wants to get married \n    after her \u2018iddah ends based on the date of the document. May she be allowed \n    to do that? Please answer. \u00a0\nThe answer \n    was: Praise be to Allaah and peace and blessings be upon our Master \n    Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah. Yes, she may be allowed to do that \n    because she is to be believed in her claim to be divorced and her claim that \n    the \u2018iddah has ended in the manner described, especially since her claim is \n    supported by the document from the qaadi. This is what is indicated by the \n    texts. But further proof should be established because of what we see \n    nowadays of many women cheating and having several husbands at once. We ask \n    Allaah to keep us safe and sound. End quote.\u00a0\nAl-Zarkashi \n    said in al-Manthoor fi\u2019l-Qawaa\u2019id (1/171): If she says: My husband So \n    and so divorced me and my \u2018iddah is over, and she asks the judge to conduct \n    a marriage for her, in Adab al-Qadaa\u2019 by al-Dubayli it says: If she \n    is a stranger and her (former) husband is absent, then her word should be \n    accepted with no proof or oath. If the husband is in the same city and she \n    is not a stranger, then the judge should not conduct a new marriage until \n    her claim has been proven.\u00a0\nIn Fasl \n    al-Tahleel, al-Raafa\u2019i said that her word should be accepted if it is \n    plausible, and he quoted from Fataawa al-Baghawi: If a man and a woman \n    appear before the qaadi, and she asks him to marry her to this man, and says \n    that she was the wife of So and so but he divorced her or died, the qaadi \n    should not proceed with the marriage until proof of the divorce or death has \n    been established, because she has admitted to being married to So and so. \n    End quote.\u00a0\nAl-Ramli \n    al-Shaafa\u2019i was asked about a woman who said that her husband So and so \n    divorced her or died, and her \u2018iddah has ended; can the judge conduct her \n    marriage without any proof? He replied that the judge cannot conduct her \n    marriage until proof of what she says has been established, because she \n    admitted to being married and marriage in principle is still valid (unless \n    there is evidence to the contrary). This is unlike the case if she admits \n    having been married without specifying a person.\u00a0 This is what is indicated \n    by what al-Dubayli said in Adab al-Qadaa\u2019, [and he quoted the words of \n    al-Zarkashi mentioned above], and what al-Qaadi mentioned in his fatwa that \n    if the woman claims that her husband has died or has divorced her in front \n    of her wali, and the wali denies it, she may swear an oath and the judge may \n    tell him to arrange her marriage, or the judge may arrange her marriage. \n    (3/161).\u00a0\nHe also said \n    (3/153): To conclude: if a woman claims that she is divorced from a specific \n    marriage, the judge should not let her remarry until it has been proven. If \n    the marriage is not specified then he may accept her word, and there are \n    other views on this issue. End quote.\u00a0\nIt seems \n    that caution is required in this matter, especially at times of corruption \n    and when there have been many incidents in which marriage contracts have \n    turned out to have been done for women who are already married and are \n    lying. But the judge still has the right to make the decision in such cases. \n    If he thinks that her word is acceptable, he may arrange her marriage, and \n    if he thinks otherwise he should ask her for proof, or he does not think \n    that she is telling the truth, he should not conduct her marriage until the \n    divorce has been proven.\u00a0\nWhat is done \n    now is that the qaadi or registrar does not conduct the marriage of a woman \n    who is proven to have been married before and claims that she is divorced, \n    until she brings proof of the divorce. We do not know how the marriage \n    contract with the man mentioned was done.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nIf there is \n    some doubt as to whether the woman is divorced or if she is still married to \n    her first husband, then the sons of the person in question should strive to \n    ask about her and her first husband. If it is proven that she was not \n    divorced from her first husband, then their father must be told about that \n    and the couple must be separated until her \u2018iddah from both is over. The \n    matter should be referred to the qaadi to decide on the matter, and it is \n    not permissible for them to be quiet if they know about that, because \n    marriage to a woman who is already married to someone else before she gets \n    divorced and completes her \u2018iddah is an invalid marriage, and the one who \n    does that is committing zina if he knew the real situation.\u00a0\nBut here we \n    should point out two things:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 The \n    children should respect their father and recognize his status and not offend \n    him by speaking of this matter. If we assume that they found out something \n    reprehensible, they should look for a suitable means of advising their \n    father, and if they ask someone else to intervene that is better, so to \n    avoid offending him and to preserve the love that exists between them.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 The \n    motive for this doubt and accusing should not be hatred of their father\u2019s \n    wife because she is a foreigner or because their father married her when he \n    was old, or for some other reason that is not hidden from the Knower of the \n    unseen, may He be glorified. Let them speak good words and beware of \n    accusing one who is innocent; they should try to think in positive terms and \n    refrain from saying anything that may hurt them or their father, so long as \n    there is nothing that they cannot keep silent about.\u00a0\nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever intercedes \n    to prevent one of the hadd punishments of Allaah has opposed Allaah in His \n    command; and whoever dies owing a debt, it is not (going to be settled by) \n    dinars and dirhams, but rather by good and bad deeds; and whoever argues \n    about falsehood knowingly will remain subject to the wrath of Allaah until \n    he gives it up; and whoever says something about a believer that is not \n    true, Allaah will cause him to dwell in the mud of the juice of the people \n    of Hell\u00a0 until he recants what he said.\u201d Narrated by Abu Dawood (5129) from \n    the hadeeth of Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him).\u00a0 Classed as \n    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.\u00a0\nMay Allaah \n    help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah \n    knows best."

        "question": "Should he marry someone who is above him in terms of social status?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nIf a man is \n    able to provide the mahr (dowry) and can afford the expenses of marriage and \n    the maintenance of his wife and household, then he is compatible with her, \n    according to the majority of scholars, both those who regard wealth as a \n    condition of compatibility, such as the Hanafis and Hanbalis, and those who \n    do not, such as the Maalikis and the Shaafa\u2019is according to the more correct \n    view among them.\u00a0\nAs for the \n    view that the husband must be rich on the same level as the wife, this is a \n    less correct view that was held by some of the fuqaha\u2019.\u00a0\nBut the \n    correct view, based on the evidence, is that compatibility does not matter \n    except with regard to religious commitment, as is the view of Maalik (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said: Chapter on the ruling of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) on compatibility in marriage. Allaah, may He be exalted, \n    says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cO \n    mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into \n    nations and tribes, that you may know one another.

The people are from Adam, and Adam is from dust.\u201d Narrated \n    by al-Tirmidhi (3270); classed as hasan by al-Albaani.\u00a0\nIn \n    al-Tirmidhi (1085) it is narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIf there comes to you one with whose religious \n    commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your female relative \n    under your care) to him, for if you do not do that there will be tribulation \n    in the land and great mischief.\u201d They said: O Messenger of Allaah, even if \n    he is such and such? He said: \u201cIf there comes to you one with whose \n    religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your female \n    relative under your care) to him,\u201d three times. Classed as hasan by \n    al-Albaani.\u00a0\nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Banu Bayaadah: \n    \u201cGive (your female relative) to Abu Hind in marriage and ask for his \n    daughters in marriage\u201d and he was a cupper.\u00a0\nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married Zaynab bint Jahsh \n    al-Qurashiyyah to his freed slave Zayd ibn Haarithah, and he married \n    Faatimah bint Qays al-Fahriyyah al-Qurashiyyah to Usaamah, the son of Zayd, \n    and he married Bilaal ibn Rabaah to the sister of \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan ibn \u2018Awf.\u00a0\nAllaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cGood \n    statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people \n    for good statements (or good men for good women)\u201d\n[al-Noor \n    24:26]\u00a0\n\u201cthen \n    marry (other) women of your choice\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 \n    4:3]\nWhat is \n    implied by the ruling of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) is that attention should be paid to compatibility in religious \n    commitment first and foremost. So a Muslim woman should not be given in \n    marriage to a kaafir, or a chaste woman to an immoral man. The Qur\u2019aan and \n    Sunnah do not pay attention to any compatibility beyond that. It is haraam \n    for a Muslim woman to marry an evil adulterer. No attention is paid to \n    lineage, profession, wealth, or whether the man is free or a slave. It is \n    permissible for a lowly slave to marry a free woman of noble birth, if he is \n    chaste and Muslim. And it is permissible for a non-Qurashi to marry a \n    Qurashi woman, and for a non-Haashimi to marry a Haashimi woman, and for \n    poor men to marry rich women.\u00a0\nAnd he said: \n    The fuqaha\u2019 differed as to the definition of compatibility. Maalik said, \n    according to the apparent view of his madhhab, that it refers to religious \n    commitment. According to a report narrated from him: It means three things: \n    Being similar in terms of religious commitment; both being slaves or both \n    being free; and compatibility with regard to physical soundness. End quote \n    from Zaad al-Ma\u2019aad (5/144). See also al-Mughni (7/27) and \n    al-Mawsoo\u2019ah al-Fiqhiyyah (34/271).\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nSocial level \n    may refer to lineage, wealth, education, profession or job, or it may mean \n    all of them.\u00a0\nIf a man\u2019s \n    religious commitment and character are pleasing, then he is compatible with \n    the woman, no matter what her social level, according to the more correct \n    view, as noted above. This is the basic principle and the ruling of \n    sharee\u2019ah. But it remains to examine the situation of each suitor and \n    whether he is suitable to marry one whose social level is above him, or \n    not.\u00a0\nIt seems \u2013 \n    and Allaah knows best \u2013 that if the difference is great in terms of lineage, \n    wealth, education and profession, that it is not advisable to go ahead with \n    this marriage, because there are usually problems from the woman or her \n    family. There may be differences in lifestyle and the ways in which they do \n    things, which may put the spouses off one another.\u00a0\nBut if the \n    difference is small, or it has to do with one area but can be made up for in \n    another area, then there is nothing wrong with it in that case, such as if \n    the husband is poor but he is highly qualified, or he is qualified for a \n    decent job, or some of his family are of high standing and so on.\u00a0\nThen there \n    are cases in which the woman and her family are so righteous that they are \n    above looking at material concerns and measuring people thereby, and they \n    may want to choose a husband who is poor because of his righteousness and so \n    on. But it is better if the husband is the one who is of a higher status.\u00a0 \u00a0\nWhatever the \n    case, the precise advice in each case depends on complete knowledge of both \n    parties and their families. Perhaps you can seek advice from someone whom \n    you trust in your community.\u00a0\nWe ask \n    Allaah to help you and guide you.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah \n    knows best."

        "question": "Is he obliged to attend the waleemah when there is someone there who will offend him with his words and actions?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nIf the \n    waleemah is for a wedding, then it is obligatory to attend it, for the one \n    who is invited personally, according to the majority of fuqaha\u2019.\u00a0\nBut if the \n    invitation is general, and he is not invited by name, then he does not have \n    to attend.\u00a0\nIbn Qudaamah \n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Ibn \u2018Abd al-Barr said: There is no \n    difference of opinion among the scholars concerning the fact that it is \n    obligatory to attend a waleemah for the one who is invited to it, so long as \n    there is no idle entertainment in it. This is the view of Maalik, \n    al-Shaafa\u2019i and Abu Haneefah.\u00a0\nIt was \n    narrated from Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger \n    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIf one of \n    you is invited to a waleemah, let him attend.\u201d According to another version: \n    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: \u201cAccept this invitation when you are invited.\u201d Abu Hurayrah said: \u201cThe \n    worst of food is the food of a waleemah to which the rich are invited and \n    the poor are ignored. Whoever does not attend has disobeyed Allaah and His \n    Messenger.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari.\u00a0\nWhat is \n    meant \u2013 and Allaah knows best \u2013 by the words \u201cthe worst of food is the food \n    of a waleemah\u201d is the food of a feast to which the rich are invited and the \n    poor are ignored. It dos not mean that the food of any waleemah is the worst \n    of food.\u00a0\nBut it is \n    only obligatory to attend for one who is invited specifically, when a man or \n    a group is invited by name. But if someone issues an invitation and says, \u201cO \n    people, come to the waleemah,\u201d it is not obligatory to respond, and it is \n    not mustahabb to do so. Rather it is permissible to accept because one is \n    included in the general invitation. End quote from al-Mughni \n    (7/213).\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nIf there are \n    people at the waleemah who will cause offence, it is not obligatory to \n    attend. This is an excuse not to attend.\u00a0\nThis was \n    stated by some of the fuqaha\u2019. In that case he has to apologize to the one \n    who gave the invitation, or attend for a short while and leave quickly.\u00a0\nIt says in\n    Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (7/430), where the conditions of it being \n    obligatory to accept an invitation are mentioned: There should not be in the \n    place where he is to attend anyone who will offend the invited one by means \n    of outward hostility or destructive envy (hasad), or anyone with whom it is \n    not appropriate to sit, such as vile and despicable people. End quote.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nIf the \n    waleemah is not for a wedding, it is not obligatory to attend, even if one \n    is especially invited to it.\u00a0\nIbn Qudaamah \n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/218): The ruling \n    on accepting invitations to circumcision waleemahs and all other invitations \n    except to weddings, is that it is mustahabb, because it involves offering \n    food to people. But accepting the invitation is mustahabb, not waajib \n    (obligatory). This is the view of Maalik, al-Shaafa\u2019i, and Abu Haneefah and \n    his companions. End quote.\u00a0\nBased on \n    this, there is no sin on you if you do not attend these waleemahs, if they \n    are not for weddings.\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nFor a woman \n    to uphold ties of kinship with her brothers and sisters is something that is \n    confirmed in sharee\u2019ah, because of the commands to uphold the ties of \n    kinship that are mentioned in the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah, and the prohibition on \n    severing those ties. This upholding of family ties may be achieved through \n    visits, phone calls and asking after family members, depending on what one \n    is able to do.\u00a0\nYou should \n    not fall short in this great act of worship, and not let your brothers\u2019 \n    coldness and lack of kindness push you to do that. You will be rewarded for \n    upholding ties with them, even if they fall short towards you, because the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe one who \n    upholds the ties of kinship is not the one who reciprocates, rather the one \n    who upholds the ties of kinship is the one who upholds those ties even if \n    his relatives cut him off.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5645).\u00a0\nThe one who \n    reciprocates his relatives, and returns favours and treats them well if they \n    treat him well, is not the one who is upholding ties of kinship as required \n    by sharee\u2019ah. Rather the upholding of kinship ties that is required in \n    sharee\u2019ah is that which involves treating relatives well even when they \n    treat you badly. \u00a0\nBut if \n    meeting often will cause annoyance, there is no sin in reducing the \n    frequency, whilst remaining in touch at infrequent intervals or by phone, \n    etc.\u00a0\nBut it is \n    better to hasten to remove the misunderstanding between you and your \n    brothers, and try hard to improve your relationship with them. That is \n    better for all of you in this world and in the Hereafter.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah \n    knows best."

        "question": "Is she sinning by attending wedding parties that involve reprehensible things if she sits far away and helps them with cooking etc?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:\u00a0\n\n    It is not permissible to attend wedding parties that include \n    reprehensible things such as singing accompanied by drums or other musical \n    instruments, apart from the daff, or mixing between men and women, or other \n    evils, except for one who is able to denounce that and thinks it most likely \n    that he will be able to put a stop to the evil by denouncing it.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person \n    is invited to a waleemah in which there is sin, such as alcohol and musical \n    instruments, etc, and he can denounce it and put an end to the evil, then he \n    must attend and denounce it, because then he will be fulfilling two \n    obligations: accepting the invitation of his Muslim brother and putting a \n    stop to evil. But if he is unable to denounce it, then he should not attend. \n    If he does not know of the evil until he gets there, then he should put a \n    stop to it, and if he is not able to, then he should leave. Something \n    similar to this was said by al-Shaafa\u2019i. End quote from al-Mughni, \n    7/214.\u00a0\n\n    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah: If the \n    wedding party is free of evils such as mixing between men and women, \n    promiscuous singing and so on, or if she attends she will be able to change \n    the evils, then it is permissible for her to attend in order to share in the \n    joy. Rather attendance is obligatory if there is some evil that she is able \n    to put a stop to.\u00a0\n\n    But if the party involves evils that she cannot denounce, \n    then it is haraam for her to attend, because of the general meaning of the \n    verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd leave alone those who take their religion as play and \n    amusement, and whom the life of this world has deceived. But remind (them) \n    with it (the Qur\u2019aan) lest a person be given up to destruction for that \n    which he has earned, when he will find for himself no protector or \n    intercessor besides Allaah\u201d\n\n    [al-An\u2019aam 6:70] \u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. \n    music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, \n    and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur\u2019aan) by way of \n    mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell\u2011fire)\u201d\n\n    [Luqmaan 31:6]\nAnd there are very many \n    ahaadeeth which condemn singing and musical instruments. End quote from \n    Fataawa al-Mar\u2019ah, compiled by Muhammad al-Musnad, p. 92\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nIf your going to the \n    wedding and taking part in the cooking etc will not result in your listening \n    to the evils, or approving of them or helping in them, such as if the place \n    where the evil actions are being committed is far away from you, or you will \n    be able to leave before they start the reprehensible actions, then there is \n    nothing wrong with your going in that case, but you should offer them advice \n    and explain to them the rulings on these evils, and tell them that it is \n    haraam to take part in them.\u00a0\nIn his commentary on the \n    verse (interpretation of the meaning): \u00a0\n\u201cAnd it has already \n    been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur\u2019aan) that when you hear the \n    Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until \n    they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) \n    certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect \n    the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell\u201d\n[al-Nisa\u2019 4:140]\nal-Qurtubi (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \u201cthen sit not with them, until they engage in a \n    talk other than that\u201d means, talk other than kufr; \u201ccertainly in that \n    case you would be like them\u201d. This indicates that it is obligatory to \n    avoid those who commit sin if they openly commit an evil action, because \n    whoever does not avoid them is approving of what they are doing, and \n    approving of kufr is itself kufr. Allaah says \u201ccertainly in that case you \n    would be like them\u201d. So whoever sits in a gathering where sin is \n    committed and does not denounce it has a burden of sin just like them.\u00a0\nThey should be denounced \n    if they speak of or do sinful things; if a person is not able to denounce \n    them, then he should get up and leave them, so that he will not be one of \n    those mentioned in this verse. End quote.\u00a0\nAl-Sa\u2019di (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said:\u00a0\nThis also includes \n    attending gatherings where sin and immorality take place, where the commands \n    and prohibitions of Allaah are taken lightly and the limits that He has set \n    for His slaves are transgressed. It is forbidden to sit with them \u201cuntil \n    they engage in a talk other than that\u201d, i.e., other than disbelieving in \n    the verses of Allaah and mocking them. \u201ccertainly in that case\u201d \n    means, if you sit with them in those circumstances, \u201cyou would be like \n    them\u201d because you have approved of their kufr and mockery of Islam, and \n    the one who approves of a sin is like the one who does it.\u00a0\nTo conclude, the one who \n    attends a gathering in which Allaah is disobeyed is obliged to denounce them \n    if he is able to, or to leave if he is not.

It is permissible to take temporary measures to space pregnancies or prevent them for a limited period of time, if there is a legitimate shar\u2019i need to do so, so long as this decision is made on the basis of mutual consultation and approval between the spouses.

        "question": "He wants to get married but his parents want him to delay that",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It is narrated in al-Bukhaari (5065) and Muslim (3384) that \n    \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mas\u2019ood said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to us: \u201cO young men, whoever among you \n    can afford to get married, let him do so, for it is more effective in \n    lowering the gaze and preserving chastity. Whoever cannot afford it, let him \n    fast, for that will be a shield for him\u201d \u2013 i.e., it will reduce and weaken \n    his desire.\u00a0\n\n    Based on this, if a person can afford to get married then he \n    should hasten to do so, because of the many benefits that this brings, as \n    mentioned by the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \n    namely it helps him to lower his gaze and protect his chastity, increases \n    the numbers of the ummah and offers protection against temptation and \n    mischief.\u00a0\n\n    Ibn Mas\u2019ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \u201cIf I only \n    had ten days left to live and I knew that I was going to die on the last of \n    them, and I could afford to get married, I would get married, for fear of \n    fitnah (temptation).\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u201cCelibacy has \n    nothing to do with Islam at all.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    If you fear hardship for yourself and that you may and fall \n    into sin, then in that case it is obligatory for you to get married.\u00a0\n\n    In this case parents are advised to arrange their son\u2019s \n    marriage and not to stand in the way of his remaining chaste and protecting \n    himself from temptation.\u00a0\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \u201cWith regard to marriage, people fall into three \n    categories. Some of them fear that they may fall into sin if they do not get \n    married, in which case it is obligatory to marry, according to the view of \n    most of the fuqaha\u2019, because this will make a person remain chaste and \n    protect him from committing haraam actions; the only way to do is to get \n    married.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    Al-Mughni, 9/341.\u00a0\n\n    You have to deal gently and kindly with your parents and try \n    to convince them of your need to get married, and tell them that this will \n    never conflict with what they want for you in the future. You can also seek \n    the help of wise people among your relatives to convince your parents.\u00a0\n\n    The questioner is to be commended for not going out to places \n    of fitnah (temptation) and not fulfilling his desires by haraam means.

        "question": "There is nothing wrong with a woman wearing a white wedding dress",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with a woman wearing a white wedding dress on condition that she does not appear in it in front of men who are not her mahrams, because usually wedding dresses are adorned and decorated, and we have already stated in the answer to question no.  39570 that one of the conditions of women\u2019s hijab is that it should not be an adornment in and of itself.\u00a0\nIt is also essential that this dress does not reveal any of the woman\u2019s charms, even if she is only going to appear in front of women in it. See question no.  6569 and 34745.\u00a0\nWith regard to it being the dress of kaafir women, that is not the case. Rather many Muslim women nowadays, if not most of them, wear this kind of dress.\u00a0\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen was asked:\u00a0\nWhat is the ruling on a woman wearing white for her wedding as it is known that this is an imitation of the kuffaar?\u00a0\nHe replied:\u00a0\nIt is permissible for a woman to wear white so long as it is not in the same form as men\u2019s clothing. With regard to it being an imitation of the kuffaar, that is no longer the case, because now all Muslim women wear such clothes when they are getting married. The ruling depends on whether the reason for it is present or not. If it is no longer an imitation of the kuffaar and this has now become something that is common to both Muslims and kaafirs, then the ruling no longer applies, unless something is haraam in and of itself and not because it is an imitation of others. Such things are haraam in all cases.\u00a0\nMajmoo\u2019at As\u2019ilat tahumm al-Mar\u2019ah, p. 92."

        "question": "Attending wedding parties which involve some evils",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.1 \u2013 It is not permissible to attend wedding parties that involve evil actions, such as singing that is accompanied by music or that includes indecent words. The fact that this is widespread among people does not mean that it is permissible and should not be denounced.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 Not attending these parties is not regarded as severing the ties of kinship, rather it is protecting oneself from seeing or hearing evil. Your family and relatives should understand that you would be keen to attend and take part, were it not for the evil things that they do.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 If a person who is invited to such an event knows that there will be evil things happening and that he is not able to denounce them, it is not permissible for him to attend.\u00a0\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/214): If a person is invited to a wedding feast in which evil things will take place, such as wine, musical instruments, etc, and he is able to attend and remove those evils, then he must attend and denounce them, because then he will be fulfilling two duties: accepting the invitation of his Muslim brother and removing evil. But if he is not able to denounce them then he should not attend. If he does not know about the evils until he gets there, he should remove them. If he cannot, then he should go away. Something similar was stated by al-Shaafa\u2019i.\u00a0\nIt says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah:\u00a0\nIf wedding parties are free of evils such as men mixing with women and indecent songs, or if you attend then these evils will be changed, then it is permissible to attend, so as to share in the occasion of joy. Rather it is obligatory to attend if there is some evil that you can remove.\u00a0\nBut if there are evil things in these parties that you cannot denounce, then it is haraam to attend them because of the general meaning of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd leave alone those who take their religion as play and amusement, and whom the life of this world has deceived. But remind (them) with it (the Qur\u2019aan) lest a person be given up to destruction for that which he has earned, when he will find for himself no protector or intercessor besides Allaah\u201d [al-An\u2019aam 6:70]\u00a0\n\u201cAnd of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur\u2019aan) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire)\u201d\n[Luqmaan 31:6]\nAnd because of the many ahaadeeth which condemn singing and musical instruments.\u00a0\nFrom Fataawa al-Mar\u2019ah, compiled by Muhammad al-Musnad, p. 92.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "The reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married \u2018Aa\u2019ishah despite the age difference",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) after he married Sawdah bint Zam\u2019ah (may Allah be pleased with her). She \u2013 \u2018Aa\u2019ishah \u2013 was the only virgin whom he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married. And he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine years old.\u00a0\nAmong her virtues was the fact that the Revelation did not descend when he under one cover with any of his wives other than her. She was one of the dearest of all people to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and news of her innocence was revealed from above the seven heavens. She was one of the most knowledgeable of his wives, and one of the most knowledgeable women of the ummah as a whole. The senior companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to refer to her opinion and consult her.\u00a0\nWith regard to the story of her marriage, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had grieved over the death of the Mother of the Believers Khadeejah, who had supported him and stood by his side, and he called the year in which she died The Year of Sorrow. Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married Sawdah, who was an older woman and was not very beautiful; rather he married her to console her after her husband had died and she stayed among mushrik people. Four years later the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and he was over fifty. Perhaps the reasons for the marriage were as follows:\u00a0\n1 \u2013 He saw a dream about marrying her. It is proven in al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her: \u201cYou were shown to me twice in a dream. I saw that you were wrapped in a piece of silk, and it was said, \u2018This is your wife.\u2019 I uncovered her and saw that it was you. I said, \u2018If this is from Allah then it will come to pass.\u2019\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 3682). As to whether this is a prophetic vision as it appears to be, or a regular dream that may be subject to interpretation, there was a difference of opinion among the scholars, as mentioned by al-Haafiz in Fath al-Baari, 9/181.\u00a0\n2 \u2013 The characteristics of intelligence and smartness that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had noticed in \u2018Aa\u2019ishah even as a small child, so he wanted to marry her so that she would be more able than others to transmit reports of what he did and said. In fact, as stated above, she was a reference point for the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) with regard to their affairs and rulings.\u00a0\n3 \u2013 The love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for her father Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), and the persecution that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) had suffered for the sake of the call of truth, which he bore with patience. He was the strongest of people in faith and the most sincere in certain faith, after the Prophets.\u00a0\nIt may be noted that among his wives were those who were young and old, the daughter of his sworn enemy, the daughter of his closest friend. One of them occupied herself with raising orphans, another distinguished herself\u00a0 from others by fasting and praying qiyaam a great deal\u2026 They represented all kinds of people, through whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was able to set out a way for the Muslims showing how to deal properly with all kinds of people. [See al-Seerah al-Nabawiyyah fi Daw\u2019 al-Masaadir al-Asliyyah, p. 711].\u00a0\nWith regard to the issue of her being young and your being confused about that, you should note that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) grew up in a hot country, the Arabian Peninsula. Usually in hot countries adolescence comes early and people marry early. This is how the people of Arabia were until recently. Moreover, women vary greatly in their development and their physical readiness for marriage.\u00a0\nIf you think \u2013 may Allah guide you \u2013 that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not marry any virgin other than \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and that all his other wives had been previously married, this will refute the notion spread by many hostile sources, that the basic motive behind the Prophet\u2019s marriages was physical desire and enjoyment of women, because if that was his intention he would have chosen only those who were virgins and beautiful etc.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nSuch slanders against the Prophet of Mercy (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by kaafirs and others of their ilk, are indicative of their inability to find fault with the law and religion that he brought from Allah, so they try to find ways to criticize Islam with regard to issues that are not related to sharee\u2019ah.\u00a0\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.\u00a0\nFor more information see Zaad al-Ma\u2019aad, 1/106."

        "question": "Does Islam Encourage Large Families?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Blessings of having children\nAbu Dawud (2050) narrated that Ma\u2019qil ibn Yasar said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, \u201cI have found a woman who is of good lineage and is beautiful, but she does not bear children. Should I marry her?\u201d He said, \u201cNo.\u201d Then he came again with the same question and he told him not to marry her. Then he came a third time with the same question and he said: \u201cMarry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations.\u201d (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 1784).\u00a0\nThis hadith indicates that it is encouraged to marry women who are fertile, so that the numbers of the ummah will increase, and so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will feel proud of his ummah before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children.\u00a0\nWill you be rewarded for having children?\nAl-Ghazali said that when a man gets married, intending thereby to have children , that this is an act of worship for which he will be rewarded because of his good intention. He explained that in several ways:\u00a0\n\nThis is in accordance with what Allah wants, which is to perpetuate the human race.\u00a0\nSeeking the love of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in having many children, so that he will feel proud of them before the other Prophets and nations on the Day of Resurrection.\u00a0\nSeeking barakah (blessing) and a great deal of reward, and forgiveness of sins through the du`a of a righteous child after one dies.\u00a0\n\nHaving children was the hope of the Prophets and Messengers\nIt is well known that since ancient times children have been the hope of the Prophets and Messengers and all of the righteous slaves of Allah, and that will continue to be the case so long as man\u2019s innate nature (fitrah) remains sound. Children are a blessing whom people love and on whom they pin their hopes.\u00a0\nIbrahim (peace be upon him) prayed to his Lord, saying (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cMy Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous\u201d [al-Saffat 37:100]\nAnd Allah says of Zakariyya (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cWhen he called out to his Lord (Allah) a call in secret.\nHe said: \u2018My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble, and grey hair has spread on my head, and I have never been unblest in my invocation to You, O my Lord!\nAnd verily, I fear my relatives after me, and my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an heir.\nWho shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya\u2019qub (Jacob) (inheritance of the religious knowledge and Prophethood, not of wealth). And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are Well-Pleased!\u2019\n(Allah said) \u2018O Zakariyya (Zachariah)! Verily, We give you the glad tidings of a son, whose name will be Yahya (John). We have given that name to none before (him)\u2019\u201d [Maryam 19:3-7]\nAllah praises His righteous slaves in many ways, such as when He said (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd those who say: \u2018Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqun (the pious)\u2019\u201d [al-Furqan 25:74]\nAnd Allah tells us that Shu\u2019ayb (peace be upon him) commanded his people to remember Allah\u2019s blessing to them when He made them many after they had been few. He said (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd remember when you were but few, and He multiplied you\u201d [al-A\u2019raf 7:86]\nHe regarded their being multiplied after they had been few as a great blessing which obliged them to obey Allah and obey His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\u00a0\nUndoubtedly the benefits of increasing the nation\u2019s offspring are obvious to everyone who thinks about the matter. Hence nations who understand this matter have been keen to encourage their people to increase their numbers and also to make their enemies reduce their numbers by means of specious arguments and sometimes by using means that lead to infertility and having few children, by means of drugs, contaminated food stuffs that reduce fertility and so on. This is one of the means of war used against the Muslim ummah by its enemies.\u00a0\nWe ask Allah to ward off the evil of those who disbelieve and to thwart their plots against the Muslims.\u00a0\nFor more, please see this category: Fiqh of the Family\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "She married without a wali (guardian) and wants to repeat the marriage contract, but her husband refuses",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islam forbids a woman to get married without a wali (guardian), and it regards a marriage contract done without a wali as invalid. A kaafir cannot be the wali of a Muslim woman, so if none of her family are Muslims, then the leader or mufti of the Muslims, or the imam of the Islamic center, should stand in as her wali.\u00a0\nIbn Qudaamah said: A kaafir cannot be the wali of a Muslim woman under any circumstances, according to scholarly consensus.\u00a0\nAl-Mughni, 7/356\u00a0\nWe have discussed all of the above, with evidence and the comments of the scholars, please see the answers to questions no. 7989 and 2127.\u00a0\nSo the marriage contract is not valid, and it must be annulled and you have to keep away from your husband. The husband has to repeat the marriage contact in the manner prescribed in sharee\u2019ah, if he wants to be married to you. Try to get some good and righteous people to intervene and convince him to do that, and to correct his mistake, as this is in your interests and the interests of your child. If he does not respond, then our advice is to forget about him, because his words are not the words of a trustworthy man. His saying that he is \u201cnot ready for marriage\u201d indicates that he only wanted to have intercourse with you, and he did not want to adhere to the commands and laws of Allaah, and the commands to be the protector and maintainer of his wife. \u00a0\nSee also the answer to question no. 13501\u00a0\nIt is not permissible for him to tell you to have an abortion, and it is not permissible for you to have an abortion if the foetus has reached the stage where the soul has been breathed into it. If you do that you will be killing a soul.\u00a0\nSee also questions no 12118 and 13319 and 4038.\u00a0\nWith regard to the child, it is valid to call him after his father and he is not regarded as an illegitimate child, rather the scholars regard him as the child of a marriage contract with some faults in it, and the child born of such a marriage is to be attributed to his father. See al-Mughni, 11/196\u00a0\nRemember that Allaah has guaranteed provision for His slaves, and has promised that whoever fears Allaah, He will give him a way out.\u00a0\nSo fear Allaah, put your trust in Him and repent to him\u2026 Part of repenting means separating from this man, because the marriage contract is invalid, for there is no marriage without a wali, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. And when you do that you will be doing it only because it is the command of Allaah. \u00a0\nKnow that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him or her with something better\u2026 May Allaah give you strength and make things easy for you.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cIf there comes to you one with whose \n    religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry [your daughter or female relative under your care] to him.\u201d Undoubtedly your \n    father\u2019s preventing you from marrying one who is suitable is something that is haraam. Marriage is more important than study, and it does not mean \n    that you cannot study, because the two can be combined. What I advise my brothers who are the guardians of women to do, is to let them complete \n    their studies; a woman may stipulate as a condition of her marriage that she be able to continue studying until her studies are complete.\u00a0\nFataawa al-Mar\u2019ah al-Muslimah, 2/704-705.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWith regard to what you mention about the situation of the one who has proposed \n    marriage and that he is still a student, being a student is not regarded as an impediment to marriage if he can afford to get married and to spend \n    on his wife on a reasonable basis.\u00a0\nBut if his being a student means that he cannot afford to get married and spend on \n    his wife \u2013 apart from the unreasonable demands that some families make in the conditions that they stipulate \u2013 this is addressed by the words of \n    Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves \n    chaste, until Allaah enriches them of His Bounty\u201d\n[al-Noor 24:33]\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: In this verse, Allaah commands everyone who is \n    unable to get married and cannot find any means of doing so to keep himself chaste, because the most common obstacle to marriage is lack of money. \n    So Allaah promises independence of means by His bounty, so that He will provide what one needs to get married or to find a woman who will accept a \n    small mahr, or else remove from him the desire to marry.\u201d Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 12/242\u00a0\nIt should be noted that the mahr and maintenance are the rights of the woman, not \n    of her guardians. She has the right to agree to a little and to marry one whom she knows is poor, but it has to be pointed out that many woman may \n    agree to marry a man even though he is poor when he proposes to her, then shortly after marriage the woman may start to complain, and that leads \n    to arguments and divorce. This should be taken into consideration.\u00a0\nThirdly:\u00a0\nWe advise families and guardians not to be an obstacle to keeping their daughters \n    and female relatives chaste because of the unreasonable conditions that they stipulate regarding spending on the basis that they want to be \n    reassured about their daughters\u2019 future. This puts off the men who want to marry them, which leads to them being left on the shelf and the evils \n    that result from that, especially nowadays when fitnah (temptation) is so widespread. Thus they harm themselves and their daughters when their \n    intention is to do good.\u00a0\nWe ask Allaah to set the affairs of the Muslims straight.\u00a0\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with a woman letting a man know that in principle, however the woman should not propose herself, rather it is better if that is done via her wali (guardian) or someone else who can let the man know. This is indicated by the fact that \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) offered his daughter Hafsah in marriage to Abu Bakr and \u2018Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with them)."

        "question": "Can a woman look for her life partner herself?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\u00a0\nThe Muslim woman must know that she is obliged to wear hijaab and observe proper Islamic hijaab at all times. It is not permissible for a woman to make a wanton display of herself (tabarruj). Tabarruj is a major sin for which the one who does it deserves the wrath and punishment of Allah.\u00a0 A woman, as the saying goes, is a jewel, and when she is shown to people and makes a wanton display of herself she loses her value.\u00a0\nSo I advise the questioner and every Muslim woman to adhere to proper Islamic hijaab, which is pleasing to Allah and is an act of obedience to Him, and is a means of Allah guiding His slave and making things easier for him.\u00a0\nSecondly:\u00a0\nWith regard to marriage, it may be obligatory if a man or woman longs for marriage and fears falling into immoral ways. It is also the Sunnah of the Prophets (peace be upon them).\u00a0\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad), and made for them wives and offspring\u201d\u00a0[al-Ra\u2019d 13:38]\nThirdly:\u00a0\nThere is a difference between a Muslim woman looking for a husband and her mixing with and talking to men for that purpose, and meeting by accident a man who she thinks is a potential husband. The former is contrary to modesty, for a woman is required to be of modest character and shy, which is an adornment and beauty for women; the virgin is the epitome of modesty as it says in the hadeeth of Abu Sa\u2019eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him): \u201cThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to be more shy than the virgin in her seclusion, and if he disliked something it would be known from his face.\u201d\u00a0\nNarrated by al-Bukhari, 5751; Muslim, 2320\u00a0\nA woman can do something better than that, which is to make du\u2019aa\u2019 asking Allah to give her a good and righteous husband. Du\u2019aa\u2019 is one of the best things with which a Muslim may equip himself and the best way in which a Muslim may seek to meet his needs. She can also speak to some of her Muslim sisters whose religious commitment and honesty she trusts to tell her of someone who can tell a young Muslim man who wants to get married about a Muslim girl. This is better than her doing something that is contrary to modesty.\u00a0\nFourthly:\u00a0\nUndoubtedly the one who told you to take off the hijab and that that is better than wearing it is wrong. How can a woman give up her religious commitment and hijab and ignore something that Allah has enjoined upon her and said that if she forsakes it then she will deserve the wrath and punishment of Allah and will not be granted His support?\u00a0\nThe Muslim woman must adhere to this virtue which many Muslim women have forsaken, for it is the symbol of the Muslim woman, a sign of her commitment, sincere faith and piety.\u00a0 \u00a0\nI advise the sister to fear Allah and to adhere to hijab, and Allah will help her and make her life easier for her. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.\u00a0\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "\u2018Azl (coitus interruptus) and using birth control pills",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly, what the Muslims should do is to try to have as many \n    children as they can, because this is the command of the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: \u201cMarry the one who is loving \n    and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the nations.\u201d \n    (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2050; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh \n    Abi Dawood, 1805).\u00a0\n\n    Having more children increases the numbers of the ummah, and \n    increasing the numbers of the ummah is a source of its glory, as Allaah \n    says, reminding the Children of Israel of His blessings:\u00a0\n\n    \u201cand made you more numerous in man-power\u201d\n\n    [al-Isra\u2019 15:6 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\n\n    And Shu\u2019ayb said to his people:\u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd remember when you were but few, and He multiplied \n    you\u201d\n\n    [al-A\u2019raaf 7:86 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning]\n\n    No one can deny that having a large number is a source of \n    pride and strength for the ummah, contrary to what those pessimists think \n    who say that large numbers causes poverty and starvation in a nation.\u00a0\n\n    If the ummah increases in number, puts its trust in Allaah \n    and believes His promises as mentioned in the aayah, \u00a0\n\n    \u201cAnd no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its \n    provision is due from Allaah\u201d\n\n    [Hood 11:6 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning], \n    then Allaah will make things easy for them and will grant them independence \n    of means from His bounty. Based on that, the answer to your question is as \n    follows:\u00a0\n\n    Birth control pills:\u00a0\n\n    A woman should not use birth control pills, unless the \n    following conditions are met:\u00a0\n\n    1-She should need to use them, \n    for example if she is ill and cannot cope with a pregnancy every year, or \n    she is physically unfit, or there is some other reason that getting pregnant \n    every year may harm her.\n\n    2-Her husband should give his \n    permission, because the husband has the right to have children. There must \n    also be consultation with the doctor, to find out whether these pills are \n    harmful or not. \n\n    If these two conditions are met, there is nothing wrong with \n    taking these pills, but that should not be on a permanent basis, because \n    that means preventing having children. \n\n    \u00a0With regard to \u2018azl (coitus interruptus), or withdrawing \n    during intercourse, the correct scholarly view is that there is nothing \n    wrong with it, because of the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him): \u201cWe used to practise \u2018azl at the time when the Qur\u2019aan was being \n    revealed\u201d \u2013 i.e., at the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him). If that action had been haraam, the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have forbidden it. But the \n    scholars say that one should not engage in \u2018azl with a free woman except \n    with her permission, because she has the right to have children. Moreover, \n    withdrawing without her permission diminishes her pleasure, because the \n    woman\u2019s pleasure can only be completed after ejaculation. So not asking her \n    permission causes her to lose out on pleasure and on the possibility of \n    having children. Hence we state the condition that this may only be done \n    with her permission.\n\n    \u00a0From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn \u2018Uthaymeen.\n\n    \u00a0From Fataawa Islamiyyah, vol. 3, p. 190.\n\n    \u00a0Thirdly: the reason why the Sahaabah engaged in \u2018azl was \n    because they did not want the woman \u2013 especially a slave woman \u2013 to get \n    pregnant, so that they could continue to enjoy a physical relationship with \n    them and the woman would still be able to do their work. Abu Dawood narrated \n    that a man said, \u201cO Messenger of Allaah, I have a slave woman and I engage \n    in \u2018azl with her, because I do not want her to get pregnant, but I want what \n    men want. But the Jews say that \u2018azl is a lesser form of infanticide.\u201d He \n    said, \u201cThe Jews are lying. If Allaah wants to create (a child) you cannot \n    prevent that.\u201d (Narrated by Abu Dawood, Kitaab al-Nikaah, 1856; \n    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1903)."

        "question": "His family want him to marry a girl who is not religious and they say that she will change in time",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    commanded the one who wants to get married to look for a religious woman. He \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\u00a0 \u201cA woman may be \n    married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty or her \n    religious commitment. Look for the one who is religious, may your hands be \n    rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).\u201d\u00a0\n\n    A wife is a life-long companion, and she will take care of \n    his household and all his affairs. She will be the one to bring up and teach \n    his children. Religious commitment is the thing that makes a woman chaste \n    and keeps her away from bad things. So you must choose a wife from among \n    those women who are religiously-committed and fear Allaah.\u00a0\n\n    What I think you should do is to strive to influence her and \n    make da\u2019wah to her through your family or some of your mahrams so that she \n    will improve and adhere to the straight path. If she adheres to the straight \n    path and improves, then marry her.\u00a0\n\n    Otherwise, I think that you should look for someone else, for \n    you have no guarantee that you will be able to influence her; she may not \n    respond, or you may be influenced by her, for no matter how much faith and \n    taqwa (piety) a person may have, he is still human and is still subject to \n    change or influence."

        "question": "Are Wedding Rings Permissible?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can men wear gold?\nWith regard to men wearing gold , whether it is a ring or anything else, it is not permissible under any circumstances. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade gold for the males of this ummah. He saw a man wearing a ring of gold and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took it from his hand and said, \u201cWould any one of you take a coal from the fire and hold it in his hand?\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, al-Libas wa\u2019l-Zinah, 3897)\nSo it is not permissible for the Muslim male to wear a gold ring.\u00a0\nBut with regard to rings of silver or any other kind of metal, it is permissible for men to wear them even if they are precious metals.\u00a0\nAre wedding rings haram?\nWith regard to the wedding ring, which is worn on the occasion of marriage, this is not one of the customs of the Muslims. If it is believed that it generates love between the spouses, and that taking it off and not wearing it will have an effect on the marital relationship, then this is regarded as a form of shirk and is a kind of jahili belief. Based on the above, it is not permissible to wear a wedding ring under any circumstances.\u00a0\nWhy are wedding rings haram?\n\nFirstly, because it is an imitation of those who are no good; it is a custom that has come to the Muslims from the non-Muslims.\nSecondly, if that is accompanied by the belief that it has an effect on the marital relationship, then this is a kind of shirk. La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (there is no power and no strength except with Allah).\u00a0(From a fatwa issued by Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan).\u00a0\n\nShaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin was asked about the ruling on wearing engagement rings. He said:\u00a0\n\u201cThe engagement ring is a kind of ring, and there is nothing wrong with rings in principle, unless that is accompanied by some belief, as some people do when the man writes his name on the ring that he gives to his fianc\u00e9e, and she writes her name on the ring that she gives to him, believing that this will create strong bonds between the couple. In this case, this ring is haram, because it is an attachment to something for which there is no basis in Islam and which makes no sense. Similarly, with regard to the engagement ring, it is not permissible to the man to put it on his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s hand, because she is not his wife yet and she is still a stranger (non-mahram) to him, because she is not his wife until after the marriage contract has been done.\u201d (Al-Fatawa al-Jami\u2019ah li\u2019l-Marah al-Muslimah, vol. 3, p. 914-915)\u00a0\nFor more, please see these answers: 76413 , 20069 , and 11446\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cO young men, whoever among you can afford to marry, let him get married, and whoever cannot do that, then he should fast, for it will be a protection for him.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4677)\u00a0\nIbn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari: With respect to marriage, the scholars have divided men into several categories.\u00a0\nThe first is those who have the desire to get married and who have the financial means to do so and who fear for themselves. It is recommended for such a person to get married according to all the scholars; according to one report the Hanbalis said that it is obligatory. The well-known view of Ahmad is that it is not obligatory for the one who is able and has the desire, unless he fears hardship.\u00a0\nIbn Daqeeq al-\u2018Eid said: Some of the fuqaha\u2019 divided marriage into five rulings. They said that it is obligatory in cases where there is the fear of hardship, where a man is able for marriage and it is difficult to find a concubine. This was narrated by al-Qurtubi from one of their scholars, namely al-Maaziri, who said: it is obligatory in the case of one who cannot keep away from zinaa otherwise, as stated above.\u00a0\nHe said: it is forbidden in the case of one who will not take care of his wife with regard to intercourse and spending on her, who is not able for marriage and has no desire for it. Al-Safaareeni said: the poor man who cannot spend on a wife and has no income, and has no desire \u2013 in this case it is said that marriage is makrooh for him, because he is cannot afford it and he cannot provide his wife with enjoyment to protect her, and he has no need for it.\u00a0\nSee Ghidhaa\u2019 al-Albaab, vol. 2, p. 434\u00a0\n\u2018Iyaad said: it is recommended in the case of everyone who hopes for offspring even if he has no desire for intercourse, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cI will be proud of your great numbers.\u201d And because of the encouragement for marriage and the commands to marry. The same applies to the one who has any desire for other kinds of enjoyment of women besides intercourse. But in the case of one who is sterile or has no desire for women or for physical pleasure, marriage is permissible for him if the woman knows and accepts that.\u00a0\nThe hadeeth indicates that masturbation is haraam, because if it were prescribed the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have indicated that. See also Question no. 329\u00a0\nIf a person is patient in abstaining from that which Allah has forbidden and gives it up because he is seeking the pleasure of Allah, then Allah will reward him abundantly on the Day of Resurrection, because whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better.\u00a0\nAnd Allah says, describing the believers (interpretation of the meaning):\u00a0\n\u201cAnd those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)\u201d [al-Mu\u2019minoon 23:5]\nThe Muslim has to follow the path prescribed by Islam, as taught by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which is fasting.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:\nIt is not makrooh, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concluded the marriage contract with \u2018Aa\u2019ishah when she was six years old, and consummated the marriage with her when she was nine. The prospective husband may do that sometimes because he is keen to get married and is afraid that the woman or her family may change their minds, so he hastens to conclude the marriage contract. There is nothing wrong with that from the point of view of sharee\u2019ah, but I think that the marriage contract should be concluded at the same time as the marriage is to be consummated, or shortly before, because that helps to avoid problems that may arise, such as differences that lead to divorce, or death of one of the spouses, etc\u2026 And Allaah is the source of strength."

        "question": "Is Intimacy an Act of Worship in Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is Intimacy an Act of Worship in Islam?\n\u00a0If a man has intercourse with his wife , he will be rewarded for that, because he is doing something permissible and avoiding something forbidden. This is what is stated in the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):\n\u00a0It was narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that some people from among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \u201cO Messenger of Allah, the rich people will get more reward. They pray as we pray, and they fast as we fast, but they give in charity from their excess wealth.\u201d He said, \u201cHas not Allah given you things with which you can give charity? Every Tasbihah (saying `Subhan Allah\u2019 (Glory be to Allah)) is a charity. Every \u2018Takbirah\u2019 (saying `Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)) is a charity. Every \u2018Tahmidah\u2019 (saying `Al-hamdu-Lillah\u2019 (praise be to Allah)) is a charity. Every Tahlilah (saying `La ilaha ill-Allah\u2019 (there is none worthy of worship but Allah)) is a charity. Enjoining what is good is a charity. Forbidding what is evil is a charity. Having intercourse (with one\u2019s wife) is a charity.\u201d They said, \u201cO Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?\u201d He said, \u201cDo you not see that if he does it in a haram way he will have the burden of sin? So if he does it in a halal way, he will have a reward for that.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 1674)\u00a0\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u201cThe phrase, `Having intercourse is a charity\u2019 \u2013 the word bud\u2019 (translated here as `having intercourse\u2019 ) may mean intercourse, or it may refer to the private part itself\u2026\nThis indicates that permissible actions may become acts of worship, if there is a sincere intention. Intercourse may be an act of worship if the intention behind it is to fulfil the rights of one's wife, to treat her kindly as enjoined by Allah, to seek a righteous child, to keep oneself or one\u2019s wife chaste, to prevent both partners from looking towards or thinking of haram things, and other good intentions. `O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?\u2019\u201d (Sharh Muslim, 7/92)\nIs the reward of sex in Islam equivalent to 70 Sunnah prayers?\n\u00a0With regard to your comment that the reward of sex in Islam is equivalent to seventy optional prayers\u201d\nPerhaps this question about the reward for having intercourse with one\u2019s wife comes from your reading of Imam An-Nawawi\u2019s commentary on Sahih Muslim (Sharh An-Nawawi `ala Sahih Muslim). It is a comment which we will quote below, where the Shaykh (An-Nawawi \u2013 may Allah have mercy on him) was discussing the issue of enjoining what is good and saying that it is obligatory. Then he discussed the issue of saying Tasbih and Dhikr, which he noted is Sunnah. Then he explained that the obligatory act of worship is equivalent to seventy times the Sunnah act, and said: they reached this conclusion from a Hadith\u2026 Then at the end of this discussion he referred to the phrase \u201cHaving intercourse\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nIf this is indeed the case, then you should note that the first comment has nothing to do with what follows it. The phrase \u201cfrom a Hadith\u201d means from some Hadith, but Imam An-Nawawi does not quote it. When he finishes discussing the issue of obligatory and Sunnah acts of worship, and the status of each, he then starts his discussion of the phrase \u201cHaving intercourse...\u201d So the confusion has arisen from this juxtaposition.\nThis is what we think. But if you mean that the reward for obligatory acts of worship is equivalent to the reward for seventy Sunnah acts, then An-Nawawi did discuss this point and said that there was a Hadith about it, but he did not quote it.\n\u00a0We know what An-Nawawi was referring to, and this is what was pointed out by Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him).\n\u00a0Al-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\u00a0\u201cNote:\nIn Ziyadat Ar-Rawdah, An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from the Imam of the Haramayn from some of the scholars that the reward for an obligatory act of worship is seventy times more than the reward for a Sunnah act. An-Nawawi said: they reached this conclusion from a Hadith.\u201d\n\u00a0The Hadith in question was quoted by Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) in An-Nihayah. It is the Marfu` Hadith of Salman concerning the month of Ramadan: \u201cWhoever seeks to draw closer to Allah during (this month) by doing some good deeds will be like one who does an obligatory action at any other time, and one who does an obligatory action (during Ramadan) will be like one who does seventy obligatory actions at any other time.\u201d\n\u00a0This is an inauthentic Hadith which was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah (may Allah have mercy on him), but he was uncertain as to whether it was sound or not.\u201d ((At-Talkhis Al-Habir, 3/118)\n\u00a0What he meant (may Allah have mercy on him) by saying that Ibn Khuzaymah was uncertain as to whether it was sound or not may be understood more clearly by referring to Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (3/191), where he includes it under the chapter heading, Bab Fada\u2019il Sharh Ramadan in Sahha Al-Khabr (Chapter on the virtues of the month of Ramadan, if the report is authentic).\n\u00a0And the chain of transmission of this Hadith includes `Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad`an, who is a weak narrator.\n\u00a0And Allah knows best."

Surely, the killing of them is a great sin\u201d [al-Israa\u2019 \n          17:31] \n\u00a0Allaah has commanded His slaves to put \n          their trust in Him in all their affairs, and He is Sufficient for those \n          who put their trust in Him.

        "question": "validity of a marriage",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Your wife\u2019s brother can assume\n      the (wali) position. If there is not a brother then an uncle would do. He\n      second eldest son would also do, if he is an adult. In the absence of all\n      of these, an Islamic judge or the head of the Islamic center can renew the\n      contract. You don\u2019t have to tell anyone about the reason. You can say\n      that you just want to renew it because you don\u2019t feel good about the\n      first one. Publicity is not needed at all. There was an addition to my\n      answer to you, but apparently it was lost for one reason or another. Here\n      is the full answer once again:\nThe marriage\n      contract is void because it was made without fulfilling its necessary\n      conditions. One of these conditions is the readiness of the womb. This\n      means that the woman whom is to get married must have her womb unoccupied.\n      For example, a man may not marry a woman who is pregnant. He may not marry\n      a woman who was divorced until she is out of her idd\u2019ah (a period where\n      a widow or a divorced woman may not marry). Also a man may not marry a\n      woman he has been having intercourse with until they both repent and she\n      gets her monthly period. This is a sign that her womb is clean. The\n      Prophet forbade Muslims to have intercourse with female slaves they bought\n      recently until they are certain that their wombs are clear from any\n      pregnancy. Waiting for the monthly period does this. In your case, the\n      marriage contract must be renewed. This is not a difficult thing to do.\n      The first boy is not Islamicly your son, as he was not created in his\n      mother\u2019s womb through a valid marriage contract. Some scholars say he is\n      not to be called after you as he is born out of adultery. He is to be\n      called after his mother\u2019s family. He is not to inherit you and you are\n      not to inherit him. As for the remaining children, they are yours and they\n      carry your name. Other scholars, such as Ibn Taymiyah and Ibn AlQayyim say\n      that if the woman is not married at the time of committing adultery, then\n      the adulteress father may give his name to this boy and that he may be\n      treated as his son. In your case, this last opinion may be the most\n      suitable for you and your family. Yet you must renew your marriage\n      contract at any Islamic center, and Allah knows best."

        "question": "The wife\u2019s    family want to do forbidden things during the wedding party",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What the girls family wants to do is undoubtedly haraam and is unacceptable. It is not permissible to please people by doing something that angers Allaah. We do not advise you at all to start your married life with haraam actions. The Muslim should disassociate himself and his family from the idea that his wife is a cheap product to be looked at by all and sundry when she is wearing all her make-up and jewellery etc.\nWe advise you to deal with the situation by doing the following:\n\n\nYou should advise them, politely, and explain to them the Islamic ruling concerning what they are planning to do. Warn them of the wrath of Allaah, and explain to them that music and mixing are haraam. Tell them that they could still have a successful wedding without these haraam things, and it is not in their interests at all in this world or in the Hereafter to respond to the blessing of Allaah, i.e., their daughters marriage, by disobeying Him and going against His commands and doing things that anger Him.\n\n\nIf that does not work, look for some wise people among their family and relatives, and from your own family too, who they think highly of and who you hope can help. Perhaps Allaah will decree that you will find a way out through them, and they will give up these evil things even if it is through pressure and embarrassment.\n\n\nIf that does not work, look for intervention on the part of someone who is knowledgeable and wise, whom they respect and look up to. Perhaps he will make them feel ashamed, or will be able to convince them that what they want to do is wrong, so they will give it up.\n\n\nIf none of this works, perhaps you can threaten them with divorce or separation. They might pay attention to that, because it would make them look bad in front of other people, so they will give up that which has been forbidden by Allaah. Perhaps leaving a long time between the nikaah (marriage contract) and the wedding party will have the result of convincing these people.\nIf they do not respond at all, then we would seriously warn you against getting involved with these people. But if the girl is religious and good-mannered, and she does not agree with what her family are doing, and you and she are able not to be present when the haraam things are happening, and you can leave the party when they start doing things that anger Allaah, and also announce your objections and state that you are disassociating yourselves from what is going to happen, (this is fine). Remember the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): then sit not with them (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them [al-Nisaa 4:140]. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it\nAnd Allaah is the source of help; to Him we complain and in Him we put our trust.\nAnd Allaah knows best."

One of these rulings is that it is permissible for you to marry her. But we should note an important point, which is that even though love is something nice, and it is mustahabb for a man to marry a woman whom he loves, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: there is nothing better for two who love one another than marriage\n(Saheeh al-Jaami, no 5200), nevertheless, this love should not be overwhelming and cause a person to forget other characteristics which he should look for in the person he wants to marry. The most important characteristic is religious commitment. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A woman may be married for four things her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her commitment to religion. Choose the one who is religious, may your hands be rubbed with dust [i.e., may you prosper]! (Agreed upon). If your cousin is religious and has a good attitude, then you have chosen well and we ask Allaah to fulfil your hopes and bring you together in a good way.

        "question": "Attributes    of the ideal Muslim husband",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your eagerness to find out the attributes which will help you to choose a righteous husband, in shaa Allah. There follows a description of the most important qualities which should be present in the man whom you choose or accept to be your husband and the father of your children, if Allah decrees that you will have children.\nReligious commitment. This is the most important thing to look for in the man you want to marry. The husband should be a Muslim who adheres to all the laws and teachings of Islam in his daily life. The woman\u2019s guardian (wali) should strive to check out this matter and not rely only on outward appearances. One of the most important things to ask about is the man\u2019s prayer (salaah); the one who neglects the rights of Allah is more likely to neglect the rights of others. The true believer does not oppress or mistreat his wife; if he loves her, he honours her, and if he does not love her, he does not mistreat or humiliate her. It is very rare to find this attitude among those who are not sincere Muslims. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):\n\u201cand verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:221]\n\u201cVerily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwaa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]\u201d [al-Hujuraat 49:13]\n\u201cGood statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or good men for good women)\u201d [al-Noor 24:26]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n\u201cIf there comes to you one whose religious commitment and attitude pleases you, then marry [your female relative who is under your care] to him, for if you do not do that, there will be tribulation on earth and much corruption.\u201d (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1084).\nAs well as being religiously committed, it is preferable that he should come from a good family and a known lineage. If two men come to propose marriage to one woman, and they are equal in terms of religious commitment, then preference should be given to the one who comes from a good family that is known for its adherence to the commands of Allah, so long as the other person is not better than him in terms of religious commitment \u2013 because the righteousness of the husband\u2019s close relatives could be passed on to his children and his good origins and lineage may make him refrain from many foolish and cheap actions. The righteousness of the father and grandfather are beneficial to the children and grandchildren. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cAnd as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the town; and there was under it a treasure belonging to them; and their father was a righteous man, and your Lord intended that they should attain their age of full strength and take out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord\u201d [al-Kahf 18:82].\nSee how Allah protected their father\u2019s wealth for the two boys after the father died, as an honour to him because of his righteousness and taqwaa. By the same token, if the husband comes from a righteous family and his parents are good, Allah will make things easy for him and protect him as an honour to his parents.\nIt is good if he has sufficient wealth to keep him and his family from having to ask people for anything, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her), when she came to consult him about three men who had proposed marriage to her, \u201cAs for Mu\u2019aawiyah, he is a poor man who has no wealth\u2026\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 1480). It is not essential that he should be a businessman or rich, it is sufficient for him to have an income that will keep him and his family from having to ask people for anything. If there is a choice between a man who is religiously committed and a man who is wealthy, then the religious man should be given preference over the wealthy man.\nIt is preferable that he should be kind and gentle towards women, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Qays, in the hadeeth quoted above, \u201cAs for Abu Jaham, his stick never leaves his shoulder\u201d, referring to the fact that he used to beat women a lot.\nIt is good if he is sound of body and healthy, free of faults, sickness, etc., and not disabled or sterile.\nIt is preferable that he should have knowledge of the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah; if you find someone like this it is good, otherwise you should realize that this is something rare.\nIt is permissible for the woman to look at the man who comes to propose marriage, and for him to look at her. This should be in the presence of her mahram, and it is not permitted to look more than is necessary, or for him to see her alone, or for her to go out with him on her own, or to meet repeatedly for no reason.\nAccording to Islam, the woman\u2019s wali (guardian) should check on the man who proposes marriage to the woman who is under his guardianship; he should ask those whom he trusts among those who mix with him and who know him, about his commitment to Islam and his trustworthiness. He should ask them for an honest opinion and sincere, sound advice.\nBefore and during all of this, you must turn towards Allah and pray to Him to make it easy for you and help you to make a good choice and to grant you wisdom. Then after all these efforts, when you have decided on a particular person, you should pray Istikhaarah, asking Allah for that which is good. For more details on Salaat al-Istikhaarah, please see Question \u00a02217. Then after you have done your utmost, put your trust in Allah, for He is the best of helpers, may He be glorified.\nAdapted from Jaami\u2019 Ahkaam al-Nisaa\u2019 by Shaykh Mustafaa al-\u2018Adawi.\nWe ask Allah, the Exalted, the Powerful, to make things easy for you, to help you make a wise choice, and to bless you with a righteous husband and good offspring, for He is Able to do all that. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It was reported in a saheeh hadeeth that the child belongs \n  to the bed and the stone is for the adulterer, so it is not permissible for \n  the child to be given the name of the adulterer or of the mothers husband. \n  Rather, she should be called after her mother, so that her name will be So and \n  so the daughter of So and so [her mother]. Otherwise, her guardian should choose \n  for her a common name that cannot be attributed to any specific person. For \n  the girl who is asking this question, there is no sin on her at all because \n  of her parents sin, and if she is patient in putting up with any annoyance \n  as a result of it, she will be rewarded for that, in sha Allaah.

        "question": "Does Anal Sex Break Nikah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\u201cYour wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (Have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus ), when or how you will, and send (good deeds, or ask Allah to bestow upon you pious offspring) for your ownselves beforehand. And fear Allah, and know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give good tidings to the believers (O Muhammad).\u201d [Al-Baqarah 2:223]\nFrom the word Harth (tilth) we understand that what is permissible is only in the vagina (the front passage), especially because this is what will produce children. The semen that is planted in the womb from which offspring come is likened to the seeds which are planted in the ground, from which vegetation comes, as both of them are substances from which something else is produced.\nThe phrase translated as when or how you will means, in any manner you wish, from behind or from the front, sitting or with the wife lying on her back or on her side, so long as it is in the place of tilth (i.e., the vagina, the place from which a baby is born).\nThe poet said:\nThe wombs are lands for us to till; we have to plant the seeds and whatever grows is up to Allah.\nIt was reported from Khuzaymah ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAllah is not too shy to tell you the truth: do not have intercourse with your wives in the anus .\u201d (Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 5/213; a good Hadith)\nIbn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \u201cThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAllah will not look at a man who has intercourse with his wife in her anus .\u201d (Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 3/529; narrated and classed as authentic by At-Tirmidhi, 1165) (See Nayl Al-Maram by Siddiq Hasan Khan, 1/151-154)\nIf a man does this, his wife is not considered to be divorced as many people think, because there is no Shar`i evidence at all that indicates this. But the scholars said that if a man habitually does this, his wife has the right to ask for a divorce, because he is an evildoer who is causing harm by his action, and also because the purpose of marriage cannot be achieved through this action. The wife has to resist this evil action and remind her husband about Allah and about the punishment for transgressing the limits set by Allah. If the husband repents to Allah from this deed, there is no reason why she should not stay with him, and there is no need to renew the marriage contract.\u00a0\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 5560 , 10053 , 23339 , and 1202 .\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not essential to be married in order to enter Paradise, but if a person fears that he may do something forbidden, then he has to get married. If he does not get married in this case, then he is making a mistake.\nWith regard to your second point, it is possible for a person to be pious without being married, but this is rare. Usually no one forgoes getting married except one who is either impotent or promiscuous, as \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) said to a man who had not got married: \u201cNothing is keeping you from getting married except either impotence or immorality.\u201d\nIn any case, Islam urges people to get married and considers marriage to be one of the ways of the Messengers; it is forbidden to forego getting married even if the intention is to devote oneself to worship. \u201cThere is no monasticism in Islam.\u201d\nAnd Allah knows best."

It is mustahabb (recommended) for women in particular to sing\n    at weddings and to use the daff (hand-drum), but not any other kind of\n    musical instruments.\nIt is not permissible for men and women to mix, at weddings\n    or at any other time, or for the groom to sit with his bride in front of the\n    women.\nIf the women are alone and no men can see them, it is\n    permissible for them to dance, so long as this will not cause undue\n    provocation of desires.\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The information you have stated about this\n    second person is not encouraging. The fact that he calls a non-mahram woman on a daily\n    basis is cause for suspicion. It is not necessary to call her every in order to find out\n    her opinion and her response. The promises that he spoke about may be genuine or may not\n    be. Hence our advice to you is as follows:\nTry to ask others about him, and about the new situation he claims to be\n    in. Maybe you will find that he has some righteous female relatives who will be able to\n    give you some useful pointers. Of course, asking questions and checking information will\n    take time, but that does not matter, because of the seriousness of the issue. If, after\n    you have found out about the mosque where he prays, the classes he attends, or the books\n    and tapes he reads and listens to, you feel that he is most likely sincere and if you feel\n    that you are able to cope with the possibility of a second failed marriage \u2013 Allaah\n    forbid \u2013 and that it would not be too great a loss if you were to leave him after\n    discovering that he is a hypocrite and a cheat, then we see no reason why you should not\n    marry him. You can set out conditions and make clear requests in the marriage contract,\n    such as requiring that he do all the prayers on time, and give up major sins like drinking\n    alcohol, committing immoral actions, and so on. Tell him that you are going to take him at\n    face value and deal with him on that basis. Also, do not forget to pray Istikhaarah. We\n    ask Allaah to help you make the right decision and to guide you. May Allaah bless our\n    Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace."

        "question": "He wants to commit suicide because they rejected his marriage proposal",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\"And do not kill yourselves. Surely, Allaah is Most merciful to you. And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire\" [al-Nisa' 4:29-30]\n\nNo matter what psychological pressure or extreme distress befalls him, the Muslim cannot go ahead and kill himself, because he knows that the punishment for that is Hell and a painful torment, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\n\"Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself, he will be in the Fire of Hell throwing himself down for ever and ever. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will have the poison in his hand, drinking it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron [a weapon] will have that piece of iron in his hand, stabbing himself in the stomach with it in the Fire of Hell forever and ever.\" (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5778).\n\nStarving oneself to death by refusing food is also a kind of suicide and deliberately killing oneself. How can a Muslim who believes in Allaah and the Last Day think of trying to move from the suffering of this world to the suffering of the Hereafter, which is more severe and more long-lasting? No sane person would do this. And for what? For a woman, when you could always find another woman to marry, for there are many women besides this one. Moreover, circumstances may change, and they may change their minds and agree to the marriage after a while. You could look for a college or school in your country that is only for women, which your wife could join, and that would solve a part of the problem. Whatever the case, you have to seek the help of Allaah and persevere with sabr (patience).\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\"And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\" [al-Talaaq 65:2]\n\"Allaah will grant after hardship, ease.\" [al-Talaaq 65:7]\n\nWe also suggest that you refer to the book \"Alhomoom - Dealing with Worries and Stress\", which is to be found on this web-site, and put into practise some of the things described therein, to calm you down and restore your equilibrium. Allaah is the One Whom We ask to relieve your distress and grief. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace."

        "question": "Her husband did\r\n    not respect her family and divorced her after the nikaah but before the wedding party",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The parents have great rights, but the husband has a\n    greater right. It is not permissible for either party to abuse the rights of the other. If\n    the wife thinks that her husband has wronged her parents, she should advise him and remind\n    him that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning),  and live with them\n    [wives] honourably [al-Nisa 4:19] includes treating her family well\n    too, because that makes her happy, and it includes not harming them, because that upsets\n    her. By the same token, if one or both of her parents abuse her husbands rights, she\n    should advise them and remind them of the seriousness of backbiting, wrongdoing and\n    aggression. If they order her to do something and her husband orders her to do the\n    opposite, then her husband takes precedence, because his rights are greater in\n    shareeah. This does not mean that she should forget about their rights; this is the\n    guideline she should follow in cases where there is a conflict.\nWith regard to your second question, it is not haraam according to\n    shareeah for a man to have intercourse with his wife after the nikaah (conclusion of\n    the marriage contract) and before the wedding party. Whatever happened after the nikaah is\n    halaal (permissible), so there is no scandal involved and no need to fear the\n    consequences. If a man divorces his wife after the marriage has been consummated, then she\n    is entitled to keep the entire mahr (dowry)\nIf it is possible for mediators to try to bring you back together in\n    accordance with shareeah and following the proper etiquette, then this is better.\n    And Allaah is the source of strength."

This is included in\n    the words of the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning):  then marry\n    (other) women of your choice, two or three or four [al-Nisa 4:3]. If\n    you fear that you will not be able to treat them equally and fairly, then be content with\n    one wife, whether it is the first or the second, because Allaah says (interpretation of\n    the meaning): if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly (with\n    them), then [marry] only one [al-Nisa 4:3].

This will solve \n  all the problems, from making the marriage valid, through giving a united direction \n  to the future upbringing of the children, to attaining success and happiness \n  in the Hereafter. Your feelings of unease about taking this step may be due \n  to the difficulty of leaving behind what you are used to and the religion that \n  you have grown up in, or reluctance to go against your family and relatives, \n  or fear of hostility and criticism from others, or concern about losing some \n  worldly advantages. But all these issues will be easily overcome when you seek \n  the help of Allaah and are determined to follow the truth. The wise person is \n  prepared to make sacrifices and put up with difficulties for the sake of following \n  the truth, because the truth is worth pursuing. Any difficulties encountered \n  will become easy because the result is happiness in this world and the next, \n  and Paradise the width of heaven and earth. Moreover, your marriage will help \n  you to live in love and harmony with your husband (if he repents to Allaah for \n  the forbidden relationship and becomes a religious person of good morals) and \n  his Muslim family. There will be no dispute as to which religion the children \n  will be raised in, and they will not feel that there is any conflict in the \n  family, so they will be able to grow up free of the psychological complexes \n  that result from the parents difference of religion. Other people have \n  felt something similar to the feelings that you are experiencing now, as is \n  reflected in the following story, which happened at the time of the Prophet \n  of Islam  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n  him). Anas reported that the Messenger of Allaah  \n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to a man, Become Muslim. \n  He said, I feel that I dont want to. He said, Become \n  Muslim, even if you feel that you dont really want to. (Reported \n  by Imaam Ahmad, 11618; Saheeh al-Jaami, 974). This is the correct approach \n  which people should have towards the true religion. For more information on \n  the topic of marriage, please see Questions #3025 \n  and #2527.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n Wed them with the permission of their own folk and \n  give them their mahr (dowry) according to what is reasonable; they should be \n  chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends [al-Nisaa 4:25]\nIn his commentary on this aayah, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have \n  mercy on him) said: \nMuhsanaat [translated as chaste] means \n  that they should be pure, not indulging in zinaa (unlawful sexual conduct), \n  hence they are described as not being musaafihaat, which means promiscuous \n  women who do not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them \n  Ibn Abbaas said: muttakhidhaati akhdaan means lovers. \n   Al-Hasan al-Basri said: It means a (male) friend.  \n  Allaah has also forbidden this, meaning marrying her so long as she is in that \n  situation\nNow that you know the Islamic ruling on this matter and are sure \n  that what you have done is haraam and sinful, we will now move on to what Allaah \n  says about despising others for their origins. Allaah says (interpretation of \n  the meaning):\nO you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, \n  it may be that the latter are better than the former; nor let (some) women scoff \n  at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former \n  [al-Hujuraat 49:11]\nAllaah has not created mankind in nations and tribes so that they \n  may be proud and despise one another, but so that they may be distinguished \n  from one another and thus get to know one another. Allaah says (interpretation \n  of the meaning):\nO mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, \n  and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, \n  the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has taqwa (i.e. \n  is one of the muttaqeen  the pious). Verily Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. \n  [al-Hujuraat 49:13]\nIbn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in his commentary \n  on this aayah:\nHere Allaah is telling mankind that He created them from \n  one soul, from which He created its mate  this refers to Aadam and Hawwa \n  (Adam and Eve)  and made them into nations, which are bigger than tribes. \n  Beyond the tribe there are other smaller units and divisions, such as families \n  and clans. An alternative interpretation is that nations refers \n  to the non-Arabs and tribes refers to the Arabs. All people are \n  equal with regard to lineage because of their descent from Aadam and Hawwa, \n  upon whom be peace, but some may be better than others in religious matters, \n  i.e., in obedience to Allaah and in following His Messenger  \n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). For this reason, after forbidding \n  envy and scornful attitudes towards others, Allaah pointed out their equality \n  as human beings: O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, \n  and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another  \n  i.e., that they may know one another by referring to their tribes. Mujaahid \n  said that this meant by calling a person So-and-so the son of So-and-so, \n  from such-and-such a tribe.  Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger \n  of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n  him) was asked, Which people are the most honourable? He said: The \n  most honourable in the sight of Allaah are the most pious (those who have most \n  taqwa). They said, That is not what we were asking about. \n  He said: The most honourable of people is Yoosuf the Prophet of Allaah, \n  the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son \n  of the Friend (khaleel) of Allaah. They said: That is not \n  what we were asking about. He said, Are you asking about which lineage \n  of the Arabs is most honourable? They said, Yes.

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased \n  with him) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah  \n  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah does not look \n  at your outward appearance or your wealth, He looks at your hearts and your \n  deeds.\nFurther information that is relevant to your question may be found \n  under #1805 and #1114. \n  We ask Allaah to bless us and you with strength and goodness, and to keep us \n  all away from that which is forbidden.

Firstly, to\n    your father, who you say is preventing you from marrying this girl whom you describe as\n    religious and well-mannered. He has to allow you to marry her, unless he has some\n    legitimate Islamic reason, which he should explain to you to convince you and put your\n    mind at rest. He should also put himself in your shoes: if his own father prevented him\n    from marrying a religious and well-mannered girl whom he liked, would he not feel\n    resentful about this denial of his freedom? If he would not like his father to do such a\n    thing to him, how can he do this to his son? As the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of\n    Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cNone of you truly believes until he likes for his brother\n    what he likes for himself.\u201d\nIt is not right for your father to prevent you from marrying this girl\n    with no legitimate Islamic reason. If there is a reason, he should explain it to you so\n    that you will understand what is going on. \nOur advice to you is this: if you can possibly change your mind and\n    find another girl to marry, in order to please your father, maintain family unity and\n    avoid division, then do so.\nBut you may find that you cannot do that, because your heart is\n    attached to this girl, and you cannot bear the thought of marrying anyone else. You may\n    also be afraid that if you choose another girl, your father might object to that marriage\n    too, because some parents may try to force their son to marry a relative, or a woman whose\n    qualities the father likes but the son does not. Some parents may feel jealousy or envy\n    even towards their own children, so they prevent them from doing what they want to do. If\n    this is the case, then there is no sin on you if you marry her, even if your father\n    objects. Perhaps after you are married, your father may change his mind. We ask Allaah to\n    help you make the right choice."

I came to him and invited him to see her (uncover her face). So he came and sat beside her, and a large cup of milk was brought to him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drank some, then offered it to her, but she lowered her head and felt shy. I rebuked her and said: \u2018Take it from the hand of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\u2019 So she took it and drank a little, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her, \u2018Give some to your companion (meaning himself).\u2019\u201d (Reported by Imam Ahmad and deemed sahih by al-Albani)\n\nHe should place his hand on his bride\u2019s head and pray for her, saying \u201cBismillah\u201d and asking for barakah (blessing), saying the words reported in the hadith narrated by \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018As, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhen one of you marries a woman or buys a servant, let him say: \u2018Allahumma inni as-aluka khayraha wa khayra ma jabaltaha \u2018alayhi wa a\u2019udhu bika min sharriha wa min sharri ma jabaltaha \u2018alayhi (O Allah, I ask You for her goodness and the goodness which You have created in her, and I seek refuge with You from her evil and the evil which You have created in her).\u2019\u201d Abu Dawud said that Abu Sa\u2019id added: \u201cThen let him take hold of her forelock and pray for blessing from this woman or servant.\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Nikah, Bab fi jami\u2019 al-nikah; classed as hasan in Sahih al-Jaami\u2019, no. 341)\n\nHe should pray two rak\u2019ahs with her, leading her in prayer, because this is reported as being the practice of the salaf (early generations). There are two reports concerning this. (i) from Abu Sa\u2019id, the freed slave of Abu Usayd, which states that a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught him and told him: \u201cWhen your wife comes in to you, pray two rak\u2019ahs and ask Allah for the goodness of what has come to you, and seek refuge with Him from its evil.\u201d (ii) from Shaqiq, who said: \u201cA man called Abu Hariz came and said (to \u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2019ud, may Allah be pleased with him): \u2018I have married a young virgin girl, but I am afraid that she may hate me.\u2019 \u2018Abdullah said: \u2018Love comes from Allah and hatred comes from Shaytan, who wants to make you hate what Allah has made permissible. When she comes to you, tell her to pray two rak\u2019ahs behind you.\u2019\u201d (These two reports were narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah; see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani).\nWhen he wants to consummate the marriage , he should say the words reported in the hadith reported by Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: \u201cWhen one of you wants to approach (have intercourse with) his wife, if he says: \u2018Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna al-Shaytan wa jannib al-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from Shaytan and protect whatever You give to us from Shaytan)\u2019 \u2013 then if they are given a child, Shaytan will not harm it.\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 3271) (For more information, see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani, p. 91)\n\nIs there a limit to the number of guests in a wedding feast?\nThere is no limit to the number of guests one can invite to a wedding feast (walimah), so invite whoever you wish of your relatives, the bride\u2019s relatives, your friends and anyone you have a good reason to invite.\nMusic in a wedding ceremony: Haram?\nIt is not permitted in Islam to do anything that is haram such as having music , letting men and women mix, or letting women dance in front of men, or other things that earn the wrath of Allah. How can the blessing of Allah be exchanged for disobedience and immorality?\u00a0\nAt weddings , women can do whatever is allowed in Islam, such as singing acceptable songs with good words or entertaining themselves by playing the daff (a certain kind of drum, resembling a tambourine without the rattles) only, so long as no men are present.\nWho should give the wedding walimah?\nProviding the wedding feast (walimah) is the husband\u2019s responsibility . The sunnah is to slaughter one sheep or more for the guests, if he is able to, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to \u2018Abd al-Rahman ibn \u2018Awf, \u201cGive a wedding feast, even if it is only one sheep.\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, no. 2048).\nWe ask Allah to bless you and your bride and to grant you a happy marriage.\nAnd Allah knows best."

        "question": "Premarital sex, and is it the parents\u2019 obligation to arrange marriage for their\r\n    children?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In answer to your second question, to say that it is permissible for a man\n    to engage in a premarital physical relationship (even if it does not include intercourse)\n    with a woman who is not permissible for him, claiming that he intends to marry her in the\n    future, is total and utter nonsense. This can never be allowed by sharee\u2019ah, and\n    there can be no legitimate relationship until after the completion of a legal marriage\n    contract according to Islamic law (i.e., nikaah).\nI sent your first question to Shaykh \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn \u2018Abd\n    al-Rahmaan al-Jibreen, and he wrote back to me with the following answer: \nYes, it is a duty on the father to keep his children\n    chaste by arranging their marriages, and spending on them and clothing them, if he is able\n    to do so. If he is not able to, but the mother, grandfather or grandmother is able, it\n    becomes that person\u2019s duty to arrange the marriage. If the son cannot afford it but\n    he has the ability to earn a living, it is his obligation to do so, in order to keep\n    himself chaste. And Allaah knows best."

But if\n    your mother does not agree, and you cannot be patient and you fear that you will fall into\n    sin if you do not marry her, then it is still permissible for you to marry her.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The relationship of an engaged man with his fianc\u00e9e is the same as a\n    man\u2019s relationship with any woman to whom he is not related: he is not allowed to\n    enjoy any kind of physical relationship with her whatsoever, until the marriage contract\n    with her has been completed.\nIf it is asked what kind of relationship the husband can have with his\n    wife after the contract has been completed and before the wedding party, the answer is\n    that he may enjoy a full husband-wife relationship, including looking at her, kissing her,\n    being alone with her, travelling with her, having intercourse with her, etc. (al-Lajnah\n    al-Daa\u2019imah li\u2019l-iftaa: Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/154).\n    For more information on the Sunnah (way of the Prophet\n    \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in weddings, and what is done during the\n    celebrations, you can refer to the questions under the heading of Nikaah (marriage) in the\n    Fiqh (Jurisprudence and Islamic rulings) section of this Website.

        "question": "Fighting for love",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.A Muslim man is permitted to marry anyone he likes of the women whom\n    Allaah has allowed him to marry, but he is encouraged to marry a Muslim woman who is\n    religious and has a good moral character (because this is the basis of true happiness).\n    Similarly, he is permitted to marry a chaste woman of the People of the Book, i.e., Jews\n    and Christians. Another basis for a happy marriage is that his parents should be pleased\n    with his choice of bride, and part of the way in which parents show their love and\n    kindness towards their son is by helping him to get married, whether financially or in\n    other ways. As regards what you say about striving and fighting for the sake of love, we\n    should stop and think about this matter carefully. We believe that feeling love for a\n    particular woman is not the be-all and end-all in a Muslim\u2019s life, for which he\n    should give up everything that matters to him. No way! The Muslim is wise and pays\n    attention to everything that is in his interests, such as the woman\u2019s religious\n    commitment and moral character, his parents\u2019 approval, his own honour and reputation\n    among people, the future of the marriage and its potential to endure, whether any bad\n    things will result from his marriage to a particular woman and whether this outweighs his\n    interests, the environment in which the children of the marriage will grow up, the nature\n    of his future in-laws with whom he will have to mix, etc. It is not the matter of a\n    fleeting desire, rather it is the matter of one\u2019s future and eventual destiny. \nFinally, we say that the love of a woman is not\n    some god to be worshipped, rather it is a matter that is governed by the laws of the One\n    God, Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds."

        "question": "A Christian woman got married in a church then\r\n    became Muslim",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Who has guided them to Islam. We ask Allaah to help us\n    and them to be steadfast in adhering to His religion. In response to your question, if the\n    marriage was contracted through an offer or proposal (eejaab) from the walee\n    (guardian) of the bride and acceptance (qabool) on the part of the groom, with the\n    consent of the bride, in front of two Muslim witnesses of good character (as regards\n    piety, attitude, conduct, etc.), then the marriage contract is valid. Ibn Qudaamah (may\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u201cA marriage is not properly contracted unless there\n    are two Muslim witnesses, regardless of whether the bride and groom are both Muslims or\n    only the groom is. This is what Ahmad stated, and it is also the opinion of\n    al-Shaafi\u2019i.\u201d (Al-Mughni, 9/349; al-Mufaddal fi Ahkaam\n    al-Mar\u2019ah, 6/120).\n    If the marriage was conducted as described above, then it is valid,\n    otherwise it must be repeated. It is permissible for a non-Muslim woman to be married by\n    her non-Muslim guardian, but if she becomes Muslim, this role can only be played by a\n    Muslim. If she has no Muslim walee, then this role can be delegated to the director of the\n    Islamic Centre or whoever is acting in his stead. As regards the children who were born\n    during this time, they are the children of the man and should be given his name, as is the\n    ruling in cases where there is uncertainty of this nature.\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Asking about a person\u2019s past",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If you want to look for a wife for someone, or a husband for a woman, then\n    you can ask him about his wishes, such as the desired age, level of education, employment\n    situation, country and origin and position of the family, and whether he has any\n    preferences about her general appearance, such as skin colour, height, etc. The most\n    important characteristic to ask about is a person\u2019s level of commitment to Islam.\n    This kind of useful question is fine.\nBut asking for details of a person\u2019s past and wanting to know what\n    sins they might have committed when they were ignorant about Islam \u2013 this is not\n    right at all. Allaah covers people\u2019s sins and loves to see them covered (i.e., not\n    dragged out into the open). So long as a person has repented, his sins have been wiped\n    out. Islam deletes whatever came before, so why should we ask questions that will only\n    embarrass people? Allaah accepts people\u2019s repentance without their having to confess\n    or expose their sins to any other person. A number of the Sahaabah had committed adultery\n    and murder repeatedly, or had buried infant girls alive, or stolen things, but when they\n    entered Islam they were the best of people. No one needs to be reminded of a shameful\n    past; it is over and done with, and Allaah is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. What\n    matters when considering a person for marriage is how that person is now: is he righteous\n    or not? Has he cut all ties with his past and his wrong deeds, or not? If he is clearly\n    living a good and righteous life now, then it is wrong to dig up the past. If there is any\n    fear of anything that could have future implications, such as certain diseases and so on,\n    then there are medical tests which can give the answer and put your mind at rest.\nAs far as giving a detailed description of a prospective wife to someone\n    is concerned, this can be done in writing: one of her mahram relatives (i.e. a blood\n    relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden) or a woman who knows her can write\n    down a description, then a trustworthy person can deliver it to one who is seriously\n    considering a marriage proposal. The Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\n    him) said: \u201cNo woman should describe another woman to her husband as if he can see\n    her.\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4839)\n    The wisdom behind this prohibition is the fact that a\n    husband might like the sound of what he hears, so he may divorce the one who described the\n    other to him, or there may be temptation to do wrong. (Commentary on the above\n    hadeeth in Fath al-Baari).\n    We ask Allaah to help us all to do that which He loves and\n    will earn His pleasure. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

Allaah \nis the Provider and those brothers and sisters are part of His creation; He will never \nforsake them. Allaah has promised to help the one who gets married in order to keep \nhimself chaste. He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\"And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and a \nwoman who has no husband) and (also marry) the saalihoon (pious, fit and \ncapable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be \npoor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His \ncreatures\u2019 needs, All-Knowing (about the state of the people).\"\n[al-Noor 24:32]\nThe Messenger of Allaah \n said: \"There are three to whom Allaah\u2019s help is due: the \nmujaahid who goes out to fight for the sake of Allaah; the slaves who makes a \ncontract with his master to pay installments towards his freedom; and the one who \ngets married because he wants to remain chaste.\" (al-Tirmidhi, no. 1566. Abu \u2018Eesaa said: this \nis a hasan hadeeth. See also Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, no. 3050).\nBut if the son is able to be patient and give himself up to working and helping his \nfather to provide for his brothers and sisters, then he will be rewarded, for Allaah \nnever allows the reward of those who do good to be lost.\nAnd Allaah knows best."

        "question": "Ruling on Intercourse with a Woman in her rectum",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\u00a0\n\nYour apology is accepted. Striving to understand the rulings of Sharee'ah in this and similar matters is not haraam or shameful; it is necessary.\n\nAs regards your question, anal intercourse with one's wife is a major sin, whether it occurs at the time of menstruation or not. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) cursed the one who does this: \"Cursed is the one who approaches his wife in her rectum\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 2/479; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5865).\n\nThe Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) also said: \"The one who has intercourse with a menstruating woman, or with a woman in her rectum, or who goes to a fortune-teller, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1/243; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5918).\n\nIn spite of the fact that many wives of sound nature refuse this, there are some husbands who threaten their wives with divorce if they do not obey them (in this matter), and some even deceive their wives, who are too shy to ask scholars about it, into thinking that it is permissible. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said that a man may approach his wife in any way he likes, from the front or the back, so long as intercourse takes place in the place from through which a child is born. There is no doubt that the rectum is the place from which waste matter is expelled, not the place from which a child is born.\n\nAnother reason why some may commit this immoral act is that they enter upon what should be a clean married life with some jaahili (ignorant) traditions and odd practices, or with memories of scenes from indecent movies, for which they have not repented to Allaah.\n\nIt is known that this act is forbidden even if both partners agree to it. Mutual consent to a haraam deed does not make it halaal.\n\nI ask Allah to bestow upon us a proper understanding of His religion and to make us adhere to its limits, for He is the All-Hearing, the One Who answers prayers."

There is no period prescribed by Islamic shari'ah\nbetween the contract and consummation of the marriage, so this issue is up\nto the two partners as to what they decide is most appropriate and in their\nbest interests. \n\nIt is incumbent upon both parties to consider, respect, and ensure the\nother one's personal comfort and ease.  Thus, if the husband sees that the\nwife needs some time to become acclimated and develop their relationship\nand level of intimacy before consummation, such as 3 months, for example,\nhe should do so, and vice versa.  Likewise, it is incumbent upon the wife\nif she sees that her husband feels an urgent need to guard his chastity by\nconsummating the marriage that she should not prolong the period so that he\ndoes not fall into a state of awkward discomfort and difficulty, and vice\nversa."
