        "question": "Is it permissible for the mother to take some of the wealth of her children who are in her custody?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe basic principle is that the mother who has custody of her children does not have the right to take anything from her children’s maintenance money in return for taking care of them; rather she is entrusted with the money that is sent for her children’s maintenance and is expected to dispose of it according to what is in their best interests.\nAd-Dardir al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said: She does not have the right to spend any of her child’s maintenance money on herself in return for taking care of the child. End quote from Bulghat as-Salik li Aqrab al-Masalik (2/765).\nSecondly:\nIt is permissible for the father and mother to take from their children’s wealth for their needs, so long as it does not harm the children.\nIt was narrated from ‘A’ishah, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “A man’s son is part of his earnings, among the best of his earnings, so you may take from their wealth.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3529); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nIbn al-Amir as-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is soundly narrated from Abu’z-Zubayr that he heard Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah say: The father and mother may take from their child’s wealth without his permission.\nEnd quote from Risalah Latifah fi Sharh Hadith Anta wa Maluka li Abik (p. 24). The report was narrated by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla with his isnad (6/385).\nIt was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your children are a gift from Allah to you, {He gives to whom He wills female [children], and He gives to whom He wills males} [al-Shoora 42:49]. They and their wealth are yours if you need it.” Narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (3123), who said: It is sahih according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim. Also narrated by al-Bayhaqi in al-Kubra (15745). Classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (2564). See the commentary of Shu‘ayb al-Arna’ut et al. on Sunan Ibn Majah, hadith no. 2137.\nAs-Sawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that it is permissible for the mother to take from her child’s wealth, if she is in difficulty, and she does not regard it as being in return for looking after the child:\nShe does not have the right to spend on herself in return for looking after the child.\nBut if it is for another reason – meaning that she takes it for a reason other than looking after the child – and is in difficulty, then she may spend on herself from the child’s wealth, whether what she takes is less than the going rate for looking after the child or more than that, because she is entitled to maintenance even if she does not look after the child.\nEnd quote from Hashiyat as-Sawi ‘ala ash-Sharh as-Saghir (2/765).\nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: The father has the right to take from his child’s wealth so long as it will not harm the child or take what the child needs, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of what you consume is your earnings, and your children are among your earnings.” And he said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” This undoubtedly refers to the father’s rights, but it also includes the mother’s rights, because she is like the father according to the correct view. So she may take from her child’s wealth that which will benefit her and meet her needs, so long as that will not be detrimental to the child and what she takes is not needed by him.\nEnd quote from al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan.\nBased on the above:\nIt is permissible for you to take from your children’s wealth to pay for medical treatment, on condition that that will not harm the children. In other words, that should only be after ensuring that the children have enough.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, a mother can take care of her children's wealth, particularly if she is their guardian and responsible for their upbringing, but certain conditions apply. Generally, it is not permissible for a mother to take her children's wealth without a legitimate reason.\n\nAccording to Islamic teachings, if the wealth is necessary for the children's welfare, such as for their basic needs or education, the mother may use that wealth responsibly. However, she should be cautious and ensure that any use of the children's wealth is in their best interest and is justified.\n\nShe should also be transparent about her actions and aim to eventually return any wealth she might have taken or ensure that it benefits the children. If there is any doubt about her intentions or the appropriateness of her actions, it is advisable for the mother to seek counsel from a knowledgeable scholar or authority in her community to ensure that she is acting within the bounds of Islamic law.\n\nIn summary, while a mother may access her children's wealth under certain circumstances for their well-being, she must do so with care, ensuring it aligns with Islamic ethics and principles."

        "question": "My sister is suffering because of her husband; can I advise her to seek a divorce?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the situation is as described in the question, undoubtedly this is one of the troubles of life. It is not appropriate for a man whom Allah has enjoined to be in charge of his household, spend on them and shoulder the responsibility of raising his children to be like this. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care. A man is in a position of responsibility over his household and is answerable for those under his care. A woman is in a position of responsibility over her husband’s house and children and is answerable for those under her care. Indeed, each of you is in a position of responsibility and each of you is answerable for those under his care.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2278).\nIt is well known that the woman has the right to ask for divorce (talaq) or khul‘ if there is a reason for that. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I do not find any fault with Thaabit ibn Qays in his character or his religious commitment, but I do not want to commit any act of disbelief after becoming a Muslim.” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to her, “Will you give back his garden [that he had given to her as the mahr]?” She said, “Yes.” So the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Thaabit: “Take back your garden, and divorce her.” \nWhat is meant by her words “but I do not want to commit any act of disbelief after becoming a Muslim” is: I do not want to do any actions that are contrary to the rulings of Islam, such as despising my husband, disobeying him, not fulfilling his rights, and so on.\nSee: Fath al-Bari (9/400).\nShaykh Ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining what justifies seeking khul‘:\nIf the woman dislikes her husband’s characteristics, such as if he is harsh, strict, short-tempered, filled with anger, criticizes the slightest action and rebukes her for the slightest shortcoming, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nSecondly: if she dislikes his appearance, such as a flaw, a defect, or a deficiency in his senses, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nThirdly: if he is lacking in religious commitment, such as if he does not pray or is careless about attending prayers in congregation, or he breaks the fast of Ramadan with no excuse, or he goes to places where haram activities take place, such as zina, drinking, listening to music and entertainment, and the like, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nFourthly: If he deprives her of her rights, such as maintenance, clothing or essential needs, when he is able to provide those things, then she has the right to seek khul‘.\nFifthly: If he does not give her her right to regular intimacy in a way that will keep her chaste because he is impotent, or has no interest in her, or he prefers someone else, or he is not fair in sharing his time [among co-wives], then she has the right to seek khul‘. And Allah knows best. End quote.\nSee also the answer to question no. 1859 .\nSecondly:\nAs your sister is the one who is in charge, and she knows her husband’s condition better than anyone, she is the one who should decide whether it is better to stay with him for the sake of the children despite these annoyances, because the presence of the father and the sense of family unity has a positive psychological impact on the children, gives them a good social standing and it helps in giving them a good upbringing, and in many cases it is better than separation.\nWe should also note that our advice should differ, depending on whether the couple have children or not. Making sacrifices for the sake of the children’s safety, their social standing, their psychological wellbeing and sense of family is worth patience and sacrifice.\nShe should also persist in calling upon Allah, asking Him to rectify his condition, and she should ask sincere and knowledgeable people to advise him. For hearts fluctuate, and they are in the hand of Allah. How many people have come back to their senses and settled down after having gone astray and misbehaved.\nIf there is anyone among his family and relatives who is rational and mature in thinking, and is held in high esteem by him and can influence him, then she can seek his help to influence him and tell him about his situation, if there is the hope that this will help to rectify his condition.\nWhat appears to us to be the case is that if your sister shows patience, which is indicative of her rational mind and far-sightedness, no one should interfere by advising her to leave him, which could cause greater harm than the harm that results from her staying with this husband despite the problems he has.\nBut if she fears for her life, her faith or her children, then let her do that; there is nothing wrong with her seeking separation from him in that case.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, advising someone to seek a divorce is a sensitive matter that requires careful consideration of the specific circumstances involved. If your sister is suffering in her marriage due to her husband's actions or behavior that compromise her well-being, it is permissible for you to advise her to seek a divorce after weighing the situation thoroughly.\n\nHere are a few points to consider when approaching this delicate matter:\n\n1. **Empathy and Support**: Show empathy towards your sister's feelings and experiences. Listen to her concerns thoughtfully before giving advice.\n\n2. **Encouragement of Communication**: Before suggesting divorce, it may be beneficial to encourage her to communicate with her husband and seek counseling if possible. Sometimes, issues in marriage can be resolved through dialogue and understanding.\n\n3. **Islamic Perspective**: Islam advocates for the preservation of family and encourages efforts to resolve marital issues. However, if the marriage is causing physical or emotional harm, seeking divorce may be a valid option. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) acknowledged that in some cases, separation is better than remaining in a harmful situation.\n\n4. **Consult Local Scholars**: If you or your sister are unsure, it may be wise to consult with a knowledgeable scholar or imam who can provide guidance based on Islamic teachings and the specific circumstances involved.\n\n5. **Empower Your Sister**: Whatever decision she makes, ensure that she feels empowered and supported, recognizing her right to seek what is best for her well-being.\n\nUltimately, the decision to pursue a divorce should be made by your sister, and she should feel comfortable and supported in making that choice based on her situation."

        "question": "Wife refusing to fulfil her duties towards her husband because he is not spending on her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is obligatory for a man to spend on his wife, and your father did spend on her when he was able to, for twenty years, as you explained in your question.\nAccording to Islamic teachings, your father is still regarded as spending on your mother, because spending on her has nothing to do with the issue of where he is getting the money from that he spends on her.\nThe other issue is that the sons’ spending on their mother is to be regarded as being like the father spending on her, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” Ahmad (6902); classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa’ (1625).\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best food that you eat is what you earn by your own hands, and your children are part of your earnings.” At-Tirmidhi (1358); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The father is obliged to spend on his wife, if her children cannot take care of her. But if her children are covering her expenses and they have been covering all her needs, then that is sufficient, because the children are his children too, and his rights over them are great. The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You and your wealth belong to your father.” So if they are covering their mother’s needs and spending on her, that is sufficient, praise be to Allah.\nBut if they are not covering her needs, and she is asking for maintenance, she has a choice: if she wishes, she may be patient, or if she wishes, she may say: Divorce me. She may ask for divorce if she cannot be patient, otherwise she should be patient. If her children spend on her and cover her needs, praise be to Allah, and there is no blame on the husband… If his children spend on her, then she has no right to complain or ask her husband to spend on her, because his children’s spending on her is like his spending on her. If they spend on her what is sufficient for her needs, praise be to Allah. If they do not spend on her and he does not spend on her either, then she may ask for divorce. (From the shaykh’s website.)\nBased on that, so long as you and your brother are spending on her and covering her needs, she has no right after that to ask for more maintenance from your father, and he is entitled to all his rights over her in full.\nOnce this is established, then it becomes clear that your mother’s refusing intimacy on the grounds that the father is not spending on her is not permissible, and as a result she is regarded as defiantly disobedient and is sinning.\nShe must fear Allah, for this is a grievous sin. It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as is stated in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses to come, the angels will curse her until morning.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (3065).\nAccording to another hadith, “There is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is in heaven will be angry with her, until he is pleased with her.” Narrated by Muslim (1436).\nSecondly:\nFrom your question, it seems that your father was not falling short with regard to your mother’s rights or your rights when he was able to spend on you. When his circumstances changed and he was no longer able to spend, your mother forgot his kindness. This is ingratitude towards the husband concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned the woman who does that of Hell. According to the hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I was shown Hell, and I saw that most of its inhabitants are women who are ungrateful (yakfurna).” It was said: Do they disbelieve (yakfurna) in Allah? He said: “They are ungrateful (yakfurna) to their husbands and are ungrateful for kind treatment. If you show kindness to one of them for a lifetime, then she sees something from you, she says: I have never seen anything good from you.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (29).\nIbn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This refers to the husband. Allah enjoined His Messenger to show gratitude for blessings. It says in the hadith: “He does not thank Allah who does not thank people.” Gratitude for the kindness of the husband comes under the heading of gratitude for the blessings of Allah, because every favour the husband does to his family is a blessing from Allah that He caused to come at his hands.\"(Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari by Ibn Battal (1/89).\nWhat the hadith means is that they are denying kind treatment… This indicates that the one who denies the kindness of the one who was kind to him is blameworthy. Al-Karmani said: That is, you [women] deny the kind treatment of the husband and think little of whatever he gives you. We may understand from the warning of hellfire for being ungrateful and cursing a great deal that these are major sins. See: Sharh Ibn Majah by as-Suyuti, et al. (p. 289).\nHence it is important to advise your mother regarding this matter, and tell her that showing kindness to her husband is one of the means of a woman attaining the pleasure of Allah, and is one of the means of her attaining happiness in this world and the hereafter.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is considered a partnership that involves mutual rights and responsibilities. Both spouses have obligations towards each other based on Islamic teachings.\n\nIf a wife is refusing to fulfill her duties because she feels that her husband is not providing for her adequately, this situation should ideally be approached with understanding and communication. It is important for both partners to discuss their needs and concerns openly.\n\nFrom an Islamic perspective:\n\n1. **Financial Responsibility**: The husband is generally required to provide for his wife according to his means. This includes spending on food, clothing, shelter, and other basic necessities. If he is not meeting this obligation, it may cause genuine concern.\n\n2. **Wife’s Duties**: The wife has certain rights over her husband, but she also has responsibilities towards him. Islam encourages spouses to support one another and to strive to fulfill each other’s rights.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**: If there are issues regarding financial support, it is encouraged for couples to seek solutions through dialogue. They could involve family members or seek mediation from respected individuals in the community if needed.\n\n4. **Seeking Help**: If the financial situation is genuinely beyond the husband's control, it may be useful for the wife to reflect on her responsibilities and consider the context before refusing to fulfill her duties.\n\n5. **Islamic Guidance**: It is advisable for both partners to engage in mutual consultation and seek guidance from knowledgeable individuals or scholars who can provide insights based on their specific circumstances.\n\nUltimately, both spouses should strive to maintain a balanced and compassionate approach, working together to fulfill their obligations and enhancing their relationship."

        "question": "What is the ruling on using an artificial womb to have children?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the wife is not able to get pregnant in the natural manner, there is nothing wrong with using artificial insemination or what is known as “test-tube babies”. This refers to fertilising the egg in a test tube, then implanting it in the wife’s uterus. That is subject to the condition that the sperm and egg come from the husband and wife respectively, and the fertilised egg is not implanted in the womb of another woman (surrogate pregnancy).\nIt says in a statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council during its seventh session in 1404 AH:\n“The third method is that in which the semen and egg from a man and woman who are married to one another are taken and fertilisation occurs externally, in a test tube, then the fertilised egg is implanted in the uterus of the wife, from whom the egg was taken. This method is acceptable in principle from an Islamic perspective, but it is not completely free of problems that could give rise to doubts concerning the procedure and the circumstances in which it is done. So it should not be resorted to except in cases of extreme necessity, after all the conditions referred to above are met.”\nThese conditions include:\n“C. In the case where uncovering the ‘awrah of the woman is permitted for a legitimate reason in front of someone with whom sexual intercourse is not permissible, the one who is providing treatment should be a Muslim woman, if possible. Otherwise, it should be a non-Muslim woman; if that is not possible then it should be a trustworthy male Muslim doctor; and if that is not possible, it may be a non-Muslim male. This is the order of preference.\nIt is not permissible for the treatment provider to be alone with the woman whom he is treating; rather her husband or another woman should also be present.\nThe Council has affirmed that the need of a married woman who cannot have children and the need of the husband to have children are regarded as legitimate needs that make it permissible to treat the woman in a permissible manner, using one of the methods of artificial insemination.\"(Qararat al-Majma‘ al-Fiqhi bi Makkah al-Mukarramah, p. 149).\nSecondly:\nIf it is not possible to implant the fertilised egg in the uterus of the wife because she is suffering from uterine cancer, for example, then there comes to mind the idea of an artificial womb.\nDr. Muhammad ibn Ha’il al-Madhaji said: The idea [of the artificial womb] may be summed up as allowing the fertilised human egg to settle in an artificial womb by re-creating the natural environment of the woman’s uterus in a plastic incubator to enable the foetus to go through all the stages of development until it reaches the point of birth, whereby the foetus is placed in artificial fluid and its blood is supplied with oxygen. The foetus remains in that incubator, which guarantees all that is required for life and survival outside the uterus, until it is fully developed and the time comes for it to emerge.\"(Ahkam an-Nawazil fi’l-Injab, p. 587).\nHe researched the ruling on this issue and mentioned different scholarly views, noting that most contemporary scholars who researched this issue were of the view that it is permissible. He quoted the evidence given by the two groups, and reached the following conclusions:\n1.. This idea is something that could never happen, because it is not possible to produce an environment that may be described as “a safe repository” (al-Mu’minun 23:13) like the natural womb, for the foetus to grow in. Even if science were able to produce such a thing, it is unlikely that the foetus would be safe and free from harm.\n2.. The view that it is haram is more likely to be correct, because it is contrary to the natural way that has been decreed by Allah, and there is great potential for harm.\nThe doctor mentioned that the goat foetuses that were subjected to experiments of this nature died a few days after birth, even though they grew in their mothers’ wombs except for the last three weeks before birth.\nSee: Ahkam an-Nawazil fi’l-Injab, p. 862.\nConclusion:\nThis method has not yet been proven to have been tried on humans as far as we know, let alone having been proven to be free of harm.\nWhat appears to be the case is that if it is proven to have been tried on humans, then in order for it to be permissible, the following conditions must be met:\n1.. It must meet the conditions of artificial insemination referred to above.\n2.. The tissues that are used to create the artificial womb must be permissible tissues and not haram; they should not be taken from anyone other than the husband and wife.\n3.. The procedure must be free of anything that could harm the foetus.\n4.. It should be not possible to implant the fertilised egg in the wife’s womb.\nWe re-affirm that surrogate pregnancy is haram, as stated previously in the answer to question no. 22126 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The use of artificial wombs and other reproductive technologies in Islam is a complex issue that can depend on several factors, including the specific circumstances, the methods used, and the potential implications of such technologies. \n\nGenerally, Islamic scholars consider the following aspects when discussing artificial wombs:\n\n1. **Intent and Necessity**: If the use of an artificial womb is pursued for legitimate reasons, such as medical complications that prevent a woman from carrying a pregnancy, it may be viewed more favorably.\n\n2. **Parentage and Lineage**: Islamic rules regarding parentage are very clear. Any child born from an artificial womb must have a clear lineage, typically through the genetic material of the intended parents. The implications for lineage and inheritance must also be considered.\n\n3. **Ethical Considerations**: Scholars often deliberate on the ethical implications of new reproductive technologies. Issues concerning the sanctity of life, the dignity of the unborn, and the potential for exploitation in the use of such technologies are critical.\n\n4. **Halal vs. Haram**: The methods used in creating embryos, whether they align with Islamic teachings (such as avoiding the mixing of sperm from different men, for example) must also be examined. \n\n5. **Consultation with Experts**: Given the fast-paced advancements in reproductive technology, it is crucial for individuals to consult knowledgeable scholars and experts in both Islamic jurisprudence and medical ethics to seek clear guidance tailored to their specific situations.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all ruling regarding artificial wombs in Islam, and it can be appropriate to seek advice from knowledgeable Islamic scholars for specific cases."

        "question": "Is Marriage Half of the Religion?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah indicates that it is prescribed to get married , and that it is one of the Sunnahs of the Messengers . By getting married a person can, with the help of Allah, overcome many of the traps of evil, for marriage helps him to lower his gaze and guard his chastity. \nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in the Hadith, “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married , for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity…” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) \nAl-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Al-Mustadrak from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whomever Allah blesses with a righteous wife, He has helped him with half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.” \nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Shu`ab Al-Iman from Al-Raqashi (may Allah have mercy on him): “When a person gets married he has completed half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.” Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said of these two Hadiths in Sahih At-Targhib wat-Tarhib (1916): “(They are) sound.” \nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase \"Marriage is half of the religion\" is commonly attributed to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and it emphasizes the significant role marriage plays in the lives of Muslims. While the exact wording may not be found in authentic Hadith, the concept reflects the importance of marriage in Islam.\n\nMarriage is seen as a means of fulfilling one's spiritual and social responsibilities. It is a way to experience companionship, maintain moral values, and fulfill the desire for procreation within the framework of Islamic teachings. In this context, the idea of marriage being \"half of the religion\" suggests that it is essential for a balanced and complete Islamic life.\n\nThe Hadith often cited to support this concept is: \"When a man marries, he has fulfilled half of his religion; so let him fear Allah regarding the remaining half.” (This hadith is found in various collections, but scholars have differing opinions on the authenticity of the exact wording.)\n\nIn conclusion, while the phrase may not be directly quoted from the most authentic sources, the underlying message about the significance of marriage in Islam is well acknowledged among scholars and believers. It highlights the importance of family and the moral and spiritual obligations that come with it."

        "question": "What is the ruling on taking from the husband’s wealth without his knowledge to buy a house for the family?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nA house is something essential for humans, and if the father has provided accommodation for his wife and children to live in like that of their peers, then he is not obliged to do anything further from an Islamic point of view, unless he wants to buy a bigger house for them, if he can afford that. This is something that is recommended and encouraged according to Islamic teachings. It was narrated that Nafi‘ ibn ‘Abd al-Harith (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Part of a man’s happiness is a good neighbour, a comfortable means of transportation and a spacious house.” Narrated by Ahmad (15409); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘ (3029).\nSo long as he is providing them with accommodation that is appropriate for them, even if that is by renting, or it is something granted by the government for them to live in, then the requirement is met, and owning the house one lives in is not a necessity or urgent need, so long as accommodation is available to him by renting or as a gift or loan.\nSecondly:\nIf the husband is spending on obligatory maintenance such as accommodation, clothing, food and drink, within reasonable limits, then it is not permissible for his wife to take anything from his money, because it is haram to take a person’s wealth without his willing consent, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent} [an-Nisa’ 4:29].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Let the one who is present convey it to the one who is absent.” Al-Bukhari (67).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to take a man’s wealth except with his willing consent.” Ahmad (20172); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (1495).\nBased on the above:\nWhat your mother collected from your father’s money and bought land with it does not come under the heading of wealth that it is permissible to take without the husband’s knowledge, because the wealth that it is permissible for a wife to take without the knowledge of her husband is limited to when he is failing to provide basic necessities.\nBut as this has already happened, it is essential to tell the father and put this land in his name and under his possession, if the father is still alive.\nIf it was bought in your mother’s name or in the name of one of you, then that must be changed, even if that is by means of a sale to the father.\nIf your father has passed on, then the house becomes part of his estate which is to be divided among the heirs, unless you all agree on something specific with the consent of all the heirs.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, taking from someone else's wealth without their knowledge or permission is generally considered a form of dishonesty or theft, regardless of the intended purpose. This includes taking from a husband's wealth without his knowledge to buy a house for the family.\n\nIn the context of a marriage, it is important for both spouses to communicate openly and make financial decisions together. If the intent is to benefit the family, it would be more appropriate for the wife to discuss her intentions with her husband and seek his permission or input regarding any financial matters.\n\nIf there are legitimate concerns about the family's living situation, it would be advisable to approach the husband with these concerns and discuss potential solutions together. Open communication and mutual consent are essential in maintaining trust and harmony within a marriage.\n\nIf there are specific circumstances that complicate the situation, it may be beneficial to seek guidance from a knowledgeable scholar or an imam who can provide personalized advice based on the details of the case."

        "question": "Parents Making Marriage Difficult",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat we see for you, honorable questioner, is that it is necessary to confront your parents - no matter the cost - with the fact that you are not convinced by their refusal, and that you are not prepared to wait for a long time, as you might miss the opportunity and the man your parents are waiting for may not come. The reason for their refusal is not legitimate, as looking down upon non-Arabs is a form of pre-Islamic tribalism that Islam has warned against. Allah Almighty says (interpretation of the meaning): O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted. [Quran 49:13].\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) set religion and character as the criteria for accepting a spouse. Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"If someone with whose religion and character you are satisfied asks for your daughter in marriage, comply with his request. If you do not do so, there will be temptation on Earth and extensive corruption.\" [At-Tirmidhi 1084, Al-Albani classified it as sound in \"Sahih at-Tirmidhi\"].\nLet the confrontation be in a wise manner, perhaps through a detailed and impactful letter you write to him (your father), while persistently supplicating to Allah to soften his heart and guide him to the right path.\nSecondly:\nThere is no fault on you at all for your eagerness to marry. It is incumbent upon the families of every man and woman who desire to marry to assist them in this matter as much as they can. A woman needs this assistance more than a man; because the decision is not in her hands, as she cannot, according to custom and tradition, propose to a man, even though it is permissible from a Shariah perspective. Since a woman is sought after and cannot be the seeker, she needs her family's help to enable her social availability. For example, her brother could recommend her to his friends whose religion and character he is satisfied with, and her mother could suggest her to her acquaintances who have sons suitable for marriage, and so on.\n`Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) proposed his daughter Hafsah for marriage after her husband died, offering her to `Uthman and Abu Bakr, then the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) married her, as in Sahih Al-Bukhari (4005).\nAnd `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) offered his daughter Umm Kulthum to `Umar ibn Al-Khattab, and he married her.\nThirdly:\nWe do not recommend marriage through internet sites, as there are many undesirable individuals there, and it is easy to deceive people through these sites. On the internet, a person can pretend to be ideal, and it is very difficult to know the truth of the matter. It might be the opposite of what you imagine. Therefore, we must restrain our emotions with the bridle of reason, unlike marriages based on real-life acquaintances.\nFourthly:\nRegarding your request for advice for your mother on the subject - which is the focus of your question - we in turn direct this message to your honorable mother, may Allah make her one of the keys to goodness.\nHonorable Mother...\nPeace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allah.\nOur honorable mother, one of the greatest responsibilities that Allah will question parents about, and which they are obligated towards their children, especially daughters, is facilitating their marriage. Delaying it for an illegitimate reason is non-compliance with the command of Allah Almighty who says (Interpretation of the meaning): And marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves. [Quran 24:32]; meaning facilitate the marriage of those who are not married and marry them off. The commentators said: The verse commands guardians to marry off their daughters and not to leave them single - unmarried - because that is more chaste for them. So, we must comply with the command of Allah.\nKnow that looking at people based on nationality or ethnicity is due to customs dominating people's minds more than Shariah and reason.\nAnd all the good is in following the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him): \"If someone with whose religion and character you are satisfied asks for your daughter in marriage, comply with his request. If you do not do so, there will be temptation on Earth and extensive corruption.\" Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (1048) and others, and Al-Albani classified it as good.\nHow many a girl whose family refused to marry her off, and she became the temptation that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) warned against. So, be keen to marry her to the one she desires, if he is someone whose religion and character are satisfactory, and do not pay attention to customs that erode society. And may Allah take care of you.\nThe pre-Islamic customs that look at people based on nationality or ethnicity are ignorant customs with no basis in the religion of Allah; rather, Islam came to purify souls from them. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Indeed, Allah has removed from you the pride of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic tribalism) and boasting about one's lineage. [A person is either] a pious believer or a miserable sinner. All of you are children of Adam, and Adam was created from dust.\" Narrated by Abu Dawud (5116) and others, and Al-Albani classified it as good.\nIf anyone should be strict about such matters and refuse to marry his daughter to someone who is not from his people or skin color, then this should be discarded from the wise consideration (especially) in Western countries, where Muslims live as minorities, and the choices from \"nationalities\" are greatly reduced, and people's circumstances are constrained. Rather, Muslims in such countries should be more united than their normal circumstances in their home countries.\nMay Allah guide us and you to what is good for Muslims, and improve the conditions of Muslims, their homes, and their offspring.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the institution of marriage is highly regarded, and it is encouraged to foster a harmonious relationship between families. However, there can be situations where parents may make the process of marriage difficult for their children, often due to various reasons such as cultural expectations, financial concerns, or differing opinions about potential partners.\n\nHere are some Islamic perspectives on handling such situations:\n\n1. **Communication**: It is essential for the young adults to communicate openly with their parents about their intentions and feelings regarding marriage. Understanding the parents' concerns can sometimes alleviate tensions.\n\n2. **Respect for Parents**: Islam emphasizes the importance of respecting parents. Even if their demands or expectations seem unreasonable, efforts should be made to approach the situation with kindness and respect.\n\n3. **Seek Advice**: Consulting trusted family members, community leaders, or scholars can provide guidance on how to navigate the challenges posed by parents. They might offer solutions or ways to mediate the situation.\n\n4. **Balance Rights and Responsibilities**: While children have a right to choose their spouses, parents also have concerns that should be considered. Finding a balance between fulfilling parental expectations and personal happiness is crucial.\n\n5. **Prayer and Patience**: In difficult times, turning to prayer (dua) and being patient can provide solace and clarity. Seeking guidance from Allah is an integral part of the Islamic faith.\n\n6. **Community Support**: Engaging with a supportive community or extending family can sometimes help bridge gaps and ease parental concerns, especially if they see the positive opinions from others.\n\n7. **Re-affirming Family Values**: Sometimes parents may be influenced by societal norms or misconceptions about marriage. Reaffirming the values of family and community can help them see marriage as a positive step.\n\nIn summary, it is essential to approach the difficulties surrounding marriage with respect, communication, and an understanding of both parental concerns and personal desires. Islam encourages families to work together and resolve conflicts amicably, ensuring that the sacred institution of marriage is honored and celebrated."

        "question": "Is It Prohibited in Islam to Not Get Married?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is marriage compulsory in Islam?\nYou should note that people are not equal in the matter of marriage. They share the fundamental principle that marriage is prescribed, which is from the guidance and practice of the Prophet, peace be upon him. Then, its importance varies in some cases more than others.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWith regard to marriage , people are of three types: \n\nSome fear that they may commit prohibited things if they do not get married. Such a person is obliged to get married, according to the majority of jurists, because he has to keep himself chaste and protect himself against engaging in prohibited actions, and the way to do that is getting married. \nFor some, marriage is recommended. This is the one who feels desire but there is no danger of his committing prohibited things. It is better for him to get married than to devote himself to optional acts of worship. This is the view of Ashab Ar-Ra`y and it is the view  and practice of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). \n\nIbn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If I only had ten days to live and I knew that I would die at the end of them, and I had any desire to get married, I would get married, for fear of Fitnah (temptation). \nSa`id ibn Jubayr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said to me: “Have you gotten married?”  \nI said: “No.” He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Get married, for the best of this Ummah are the ones with the most wives.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5069) \nIbrahim ibn Maysarah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Tawus said to me: “Either get married, or I will say to you what `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said to Abu Az-Zawa’id (may Allah have mercy on him): Nothing is keeping you from getting married except impotence or immorality.”  \n\nThose who have no desire, either because they were not created with any desire, such as one who is impotent, or they had desire but it has disappeared due to old age, sickness and so on. There are two opinions: \n\n\nIt is recommended to get married because of the general meaning of what we have discussed.\nIt is better for him to remain single because he cannot achieve the purpose of marriage, and he would be preventing his wife from becoming chaste by marrying someone else. Also, he would be harming her by keeping her for himself, and he is exposing himself to obligations and duties that perhaps he cannot fulfil, and he is distracting himself from seeking knowledge and worship with something that is of no benefit to him.\n\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The apparent meaning of the words of Ahmad is that there is no difference between the one who can afford it and the one who cannot. He said: a man should get married and if he can afford to spend he should spend, and if he cannot then he should be patient.  \nThis applies to one who is able to get married. As for the one who cannot, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His Bounty” [An-Nur 24:33].” (Al-Mughni, 9/341-344) \nReasons why marriage is so important\nAt this point, we would like to ask you about the reason for this aversion to marriage. \n\nIf you think that not getting married is an act of worship by means of which you can draw closer to the Lord of the Worlds, and you think that if you avoid marriage this will raise you in status before Allah, you are mistaken and there is the fear that you may be sinning. \n\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Three people came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asking about the worship of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When they were told, it was as if they regarded it as too little. They said: Who are we in comparison to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Allah has forgiven his past and future sins. One of them said: As for me, I will pray all night forever. Another said: I shall fast all my life and never break my fast. Another said: I shall keep away from women and never get married. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and said: “Are you the ones who said such and such? By Allah, I am the one who fears Allah the most among you and I am the most pious , but I fast and I break my fast, I pray and I sleep, and I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5063, and Muslim, 1401)\n\nIf you do not want to get married because you have no sexual desire, or you think that you are not able to fulfil the duties of marriage, and you are afraid of falling short in meeting a wife`s needs, I say to you: In that case there is no sin on you if you do not get married, but do not rely on your thoughts and notions. Rather you should consult a specialist doctor and ask him for advice, for he is most able to diagnose your condition, and he may have some advice for treatment that has never crossed your mind. So do not hesitate to visit him and do not let shyness stop you, for matters of medical treatment are not the place for shyness. \nIf you say that you are afraid because you are poor and do not have enough wealth to look after a family, I say to you: Try your best to earn a living and be content and think positively of Allah, for He has promised on the lips of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that He will help the one who wants to be chaste and seeks that which is halal by getting married. \n\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whom Allah is bound to help: the Mujahid who strives (in Jihad) for the sake of Allah, the Mukatib (a slave who has made a contract of manumission with his master) who wants to pay off his manumission, and a man who gets married, seeking to remain chaste.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (1655), classed as sound by Al-Albani in Saheeh At-Tirmidhi)  \n\nIf you have something that you want to achieve – such as a certificate, a position, a project and so on – and you say that you want to achieve that first, then you will get married, we say to you: Why are you ignoring marriage for that reason? \n\nMarriage has never been a barrier to achieving things, rather in most cases it is a support and a help. That is just the whisperings of the satan, which he has instilled in the minds of many young men so that it has become prevalent in our culture and society, and you hear many of those who have delayed their own marriages or the marriages of their sons and daughters saying such things, and our society has become burdened with problems resulting from large numbers of single men and women, and the delay of marriage. However, despite that we have not seen any achievement, development or progress, whereas the first generation of Muslims used to hasten to do good and they did not delay marriage, and their achievements were the greatest and most complete of achievements. \nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (20/421): \n“What is required is to hasten to get married, and no young man or young woman should delay marriage for the sake of studies, because marriage does not prevent any such thing. It is possible for a young man to get married in order to protect his religious commitment and morals, and enable him to lower his gaze . Marriage serves many purposes, especially in this day and age. Because delaying it is harmful for both young women and young men, every young man and every young woman should hasten to get married if there is a man who is compatible with the woman, and if a man can find the right woman.”\n\nOver and above all that, how about if you realise that marriage will protect half of your religion? \n\nAnas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whomever Allah has blessed with a righteous wife, He has helped him with half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.” (Narrated by Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak, 2/175), At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat, 1/294) and Al-Bayhaqi in Shu`ab Al-Iman, 4/382) Al-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This is a Hadith with an authentic Isnad (chain of narrators), although they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not narrate it.” Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Talkhis: it is authentic. It was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib, 2/192)\n\nHow about if you realise that by getting married, you will have followed the advice of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said:  “O young men, whoever among you can afford it , let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one`s chastity.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5065, and Muslim, 1400)\nHow about if you realise that by producing a righteous child, you will have ongoing charity (Sadaqah Jariyah), if you raise him with good morals and upon faith, and you will be rewarded for your marriage if you seek reward with Allah for that . \nBy getting married, you will be protecting yourself, lowering your gaze , and closing the door to one of the greatest means by which the devil deceives people. You may not feel the seriousness of that now, but Fitnah (temptation) may come from places a person does not realise, so you should be keen to close the door before it is opened without you realising it.\n\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have not left after me any Fitnah more harmful to men than women.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5096, and Muslim, 2741).\n\nMarriage is a source of tranquillity and peace, and it is the best of the pleasures of this world. In it, is that which Allah has made a sign for His slaves, and He has mentioned it in His Book so that they may think and ponder the greatness of His Might, may He be glorified and exalted. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.” [Ar-Rum 30:21]\nCan there be any hesitation after this? \nBe resolved and put your trust in Allah, and Allah will help you, and will provide you with a righteous wife who will help you to obey your Lord and He will bless you with righteous offspring who will be a stored treasure for you with Allah in the Hereafter. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is highly encouraged and regarded as a noble act. It is viewed as a way to fulfill one's natural instincts, promote social stability, and establish a family unit. However, it is not strictly prohibited to remain unmarried. \n\nThe scholars of Islam have different interpretations regarding marriage. Some argue that it is recommended (mustahabb) or even obligatory (wajib) for those who have the means and the desire to marry, especially if they fear falling into sinful behavior. Others hold that it is permissible to remain single if one has valid reasons, such as personal choice, the desire for independence, or a focus on career or education.\n\nUltimately, the decision to marry or remain unmarried is a personal one and should be made with consideration of one’s circumstances, intentions, and ability to fulfill the responsibilities that marriage entails. It is important to consult with knowledgeable individuals or scholars for personal guidance."

        "question": "What is the ruling on repeating the marriage contract if it was done over the Internet?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIf the marriage contract that was done over the Internet met all the necessary conditions, then it is a valid marriage. It is valid to do the marriage contract over the Internet so long as it meets all the necessary conditions. The senior scholars have issued fatwas stating that a marriage contract done over the telephone is valid, if we have verified the identity of the parties to the marriage contract and it fulfils the necessary conditions, namely the consent of the woman’s guardian (wali), two witnesses, and the proposal and acceptance. If a marriage contract done in this way is valid, then if it is done over the Internet, in which it is possible to verify the voice and the image directly, it is more appropriate that it should be valid.\nSee the fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz in question no. 2201 , and also question no. 297344 .\nSecondly:\nIf the first marriage contract met the necessary conditions, then repeating it a second time will not invalidate the first marriage contract; rather it is by way of confirming it in front of the family, or for the purpose of documenting the first marriage contract. So the rulings on marriage will apply from the time of the first contract. Hence it is not valid to impose new conditions in it, or to stipulate a mahr (dowry) other than that which was agreed upon in the first contract. But if the first marriage contract did not meet the necessary conditions, then it is deemed invalid and a new marriage contract must be done with a new mahr, and it is permissible to stipulate new conditions in it.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the validity of a marriage contract (nikah) depends on certain essential conditions being met, such as the consent of both parties, the presence of witnesses, and the offer (ijab) and acceptance (qabul). \n\nIf the marriage contract was conducted authentically over the Internet, meaning both parties clearly expressed their consent and the necessary conditions were fulfilled, then it can be considered valid. However, if there are concerns about the presence of witnesses or the clear expression of consent, it is advisable to repeat the contract in a more formal setting where all the conditions can be met easily.\n\nIt is recommended to seek advice from a knowledgeable scholar or local religious authority who can provide guidance based on the specific circumstances of the marriage and the cultural context, as practices and rulings can vary in different communities."

        "question": "Ruling on vasectomy and reversal thereof",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: it is not permissible for a man or woman to undergo any surgical or other procedure that will permanently prevent them from having children.\nOne of these means that is forbidden is vasectomy, which is a surgical procedure in which the vas deferens (the two channels through which sperm travels to the bladder and then to the penis) is cut.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council: It is haram to permanently remove the ability to produce offspring for a man or a woman, which is what is known as sterilization, so long as there is no necessary reason, according to Islamic standards, for doing that.\nThis has been explained previously in the answers to questions no. 111969 and 47196 .\nSecondly: With regard to reversing the vasectomy, this is a matter concerning which one must refer to medical specialists. If the doctors determine that there is no harm that would result from that, then you must undergo this procedure and restore the vas deferens to its natural state.\nBut if that is not possible, or it will result in harm, then you do not have to do anything, because harm cannot be removed by further harm.\nAs you did that as a result of ignorance of the ruling, then Allah, may He be exalted, will pardon you and there is no sin on you. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but [only for] what your hearts intended} [al-Ahzaab 33:5].\nAnd you did not deliberately intend to commit sin.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the ruling on vasectomy and its reversal can vary among different scholars and schools of thought. Generally, here are some key points:\n\n1. **Vasectomy**: Many scholars view vasectomy as a form of permanent contraception, which is not permissible in Islamic law, especially if it is done without a valid reason. The main principle in Islam is the encouragement of procreation, and altering one's ability to have children permanently can be seen as contrary to that principle.\n\n2. **Temporary Contraception**: Temporary methods of contraception, such as withdrawal or the use of contraceptive pills, are usually considered permissible with the mutual consent of both spouses.\n\n3. **Reversal**: If a man has undergone a vasectomy and wishes to reverse it, the permissibility can depend on the intention behind it. Scholars may have differing opinions on whether attempting to reverse a vasectomy is acceptable or if it implies that the initial decision was wrong.\n\n4. **Medical Necessity**: If a vasectomy is performed due to a medical condition or necessity (such as health risks for the mother or child), some scholars may be more lenient in permitting it.\n\nUltimately, it's crucial for individuals to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars or local religious authorities who can provide advice based on the specific circumstances and interpretations of Islamic law."

        "question": "How can the second wife prove her marriage after her husband dies, as the marriage was not officially registered?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In a number of questions we have stated that it is obligatory to officially register marriages, because that will protect people’s rights so that they will not be lost.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 129851 .\nBut a man may be forced to forego registering a marriage because he lives in a western country where plural marriage is not allowed and the one who does that will be penalised. In that case, we may say:\nIf the husband married a second wife in accordance with Islamic teachings, then it is easy for the second wife and her children to prove that, because when she got married there must have been her guardian and two men – at least – who acted as witnesses or he must have announced the marriage to some of his friends or relatives.\nThe husband may have left behind something in his handwriting confirming this second marriage, or he may have registered his children from his second wife in his name, and so on.\nSo the second wife should take some of these witnesses and whatever proof or other circumstantial evidence she has to prove the validity of her claim, and present it to those in charge of the Islamic centre in her city, and they can present it to the family of the deceased and prove to them that there are other parties who have rights in this regard, and they are entitled to their share of the estate.\nThe first wife of the deceased and her children must accept that, and beware of cutting off ties of kinship and refuse to give what rightfully belongs to their brothers, because Allah has ordained that all wives and all children have rights to the estate, so there should be no differentiation between one wife and another, or between one son and another. They are all children of the deceased and are all entitled to their share of the inheritance. The prohibition [on denying them their rights] is further emphasized if any of the heirs are minors (orphans), because devouring the wealth of orphans is a major sin for which the one who does that deserves punishment in hell.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire. And they will be burned in a Blaze} [an-Nisa’ 4:10].\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In situations where a second marriage is not officially registered, proving the marriage after the husband's death can be challenging. However, there are several ways the second wife can substantiate her claim:\n\n1. **Witnesses**: If the marriage was conducted in accordance with Islamic traditions, there should be witnesses. The testimony of those who attended the marriage ceremony can serve as evidence of the union.\n\n2. **Marriage Contract (Nikah Nama)**: If there is a written marriage contract (nikah nama), even if not officially registered, it can serve as proof of the marriage.\n\n3. **Testimony of the Husband's Family**: The family of the deceased husband might support her claims regarding the marriage, especially if they were aware of the union.\n\n4. **Community Recognition**: If the marriage was known and recognized by the community, this can aid in establishing her status as the wife.\n\n5. **Bank Accounts or Joint Assets**: Any shared financial accounts or mutual property could demonstrate the marital relationship.\n\n6. **Documentation of Shared Life**: Evidence such as photographs, joint travel, or other documentation showing a shared life may help establish the authenticity of the marriage.\n\n7. **Legal Aid**: Consulting with legal counsel who understands both Islamic and local law can provide guidance on how to proceed with proving the marriage under the circumstances.\n\n8. **Islamic Court**: If available, the second wife can approach an Islamic court where her case can be presented according to Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nIn any case, it is strongly recommended to ensure that marriages are registered legally, where possible, to avoid complications in the future."

        "question": "Using contraception because of having a low income",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to use contraceptives for fear of low income, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Provider. This is akin to the actions of the people of Jahiliyyah who killed their children for fear of poverty. Rather you should think positively of Allah and put your trust in Him, may He be glorified and exalted.\nAllah is the Provider, the Almighty, may He be glorified and exalted, and it is He, may He be glorified and exalted, Who says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is no creature that lives on the earth but its sustenance is guaranteed by Allah} [Hud 11:6].\nSo what is required is for both husband and wife to think positively of Allah and not use contraceptives.\nBut if the contraceptive is used for a different reason, such as if the mother is sick or if there is  the risk of harm to her health or her uterus, or there is fear of harm to both of them; or because they already have a lot of children, and without contraception there will be one pregnancy after another, without a break, so she wants to use contraception for a short period, such as a year or two, so that it will not be too difficult to raise the children and so that she will not become unable to do that – then there is nothing wrong with that, as it is in the best interests of the children, and it is not due to thinking negatively of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. The same applies if having another pregnancy could harm her and she is unable to cope. But if the matter has to do with provision (rizq), then the Provider is Allah; regardless of whether you are sick or healthy, it is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, Who provides for you and in His hand is the control of all things. So you must think positively of Allah and put your trust in Allah, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Provider, Lord of Might, the Powerful. End quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the use of contraception is a nuanced topic and opinions among scholars may vary based on different interpretations of Islamic teachings. Generally, Islam permits the use of contraception under certain circumstances, especially if there are valid concerns regarding the well-being of the family.\n\nIf the primary reason for seeking contraception is financial constraints, many scholars may consider this a valid reason, as the financial burden can impact the quality of life for both the parents and the children. The importance of ensuring that children are raised in a stable and supportive environment is emphasized in Islam. \n\nHowever, it is crucial to approach the subject with the intent of seeking knowledge and being guided by a qualified scholar or Imam, as they can provide tailored advice based on individual circumstances. The recommended approach is always to balance one’s concerns with faith in Allah's provision and to consider prayer and consultation with knowledgeable individuals in the community.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be made thoughtfully, considering the physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being of the family."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for anyone to do a marriage contract with a woman except with the permission of her guardian. There is a great deal of evidence to this effect, such as the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “There can be no marriage contract except with a guardian.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (1101), Abu Dawood (2085) and Ibn Maajah (1881) from Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him).

A woman does not have the authority to give herself or any other woman in marriage, or to appoint anyone except her guardian to act on her behalf regarding her marriage, so if she does that, the marriage is not valid.\nThis was narrated from ‘Umar, ‘Ali, Ibn Mas‘ood, Ibn ‘Abbaas, Abu Hurayrah and ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with them).\nIt is also the view of Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyib, al-Hasan, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, Jaabir ibn Zayd, ath-Thawri, Ibn Abi Layla, Ibn Shubrumah, Ibn al-Mubaarak, ‘Ubaydullah al-‘Anbari, ash-Shaafa‘i, Ishaaq and Abu ‘Ubayd… Abu Haneefah said: She has the right to give herself and others in marriage, and to appoint someone to act on her behalf regarding her marriage.\nThen Ibn Qudaamah stated that the view of the majority is more likely to be correct, and he quoted as evidence the hadiths quoted above.\" (Al-Mughni  9/345).\nGiven that there is a difference of opinion among the leading scholars regarding this matter, and that it is an issue that is subject to ijtihad, if a Muslim lives in a country which follows the Hanafi madhhab and regards a marriage contract done without a guardian as valid, and the marriage contract was done on that basis, then it may be deemed to be valid in that case, and the ruling of the court is not to be annulled.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a judge rules that this marriage contract is valid, or the one who did the marriage contract is a judge, it is not permissible to annul it. The same applies to all marriages that are done in an inappropriate way.\nAl-Qaadi was of the view that it could be annulled.\nThis is also the view of al-Istakhri among the companions of ash-Shaafa‘i, because the marriage was done in a manner that is contrary to a religious text.\nBut the first view is more likely to be correct [that is, that it is not to be annulled], because it is a matter concerning which there is a difference of scholarly opinion and it is subject to ijtihad. So it is not permissible to annul the ruling. Moreover, this text is open to interpretation, and there are some reservations about its soundness, and there may be other evidence that contradicts it.\" (Al-Mughni 9/347).\nBased on that, what we think is that the marriage should be deemed to be valid, even though what you did was a mistake. Therefore you must repent from that, and strive to seek the approval of your wife’s father, if he is still not happy with this marriage, because you mistreated him badly.\nIf you renew the marriage contract with her, with her father acting as her guardian in the marriage contract, in the presence of two witnesses of good character, that would be better and more prudent.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, a marriage contract (nikah) requires the consent of the bride and the presence of her wali (guardian), typicallyher father or a close male relative. If a marriage contract is conducted without the consent of the wali, it is usually considered invalid according to most scholars.\n\nIn this case, if he married her without her family's knowledge or without the approval of the wali, he must take several steps:\n\n1. **Seek her family's permission**: It is essential for him to approach her wali and seek their approval for the marriage. This is important for the legitimacy and acceptance of the marriage in the eyes of the family and the community.\n\n2. **Discuss with her**: He should talk to the bride about the situation and ensure that both of them are in agreement about how to proceed. It is crucial for both parties to communicate openly.\n\n3. **Reconsider the marriage contract**: If the wali does not agree to the marriage, then the marriage contract may need to be annulled or re-conducted with the wali's consent. \n\n4. **Obtain advice from a knowledgeable person**: It is wise to consult a local scholar or imam who can provide guidance based on the specific context and circumstances.\n\n5. **Act with respect and understanding**: Since family dynamics are involved, it is important to handle the situation with care and respect for the bride's family.\n\nUltimately, the key point is to seek the wali's approval for the marriage so that it can be established according to Islamic principles. Marriage should be a source of harmony and respect, involving not just the bride and groom but also their families."

        "question": "Her husband is sterile and she used sperm from a donor and got pregnant. Does her husband have to deny the child is his by means of li‘aan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What your wife did of inserting the sperm of a stranger is a grave sin and a betrayal of her husband, and is introducing a child who is not his. What she must do is repent to Allah, may He be exalted.\nWhat you must do is deny that this child is yours and not attribute him to yourself, because if you do not deny that he is yours, he may inherit from you and inherit from your relatives, and look at your mother and your sister, and your womenfolk will not observe hijab in front of him, and he may be alone with them, and all of that is prohibited.\nThere is no way to deny that he is yours except by means of li‘aan.\nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Accusing the woman of zina is of three types: obligatory, which is when he sees his wife committing zina during a period of purity in which he has not had intercourse with her – in that case, he must keep away from her until her ‘iddah ends, then if she produces a child six months from the time of committing zina and he can deny that it is his child, he must accuse her of zina and deny that her child is his, because in that case it is almost certain that the child is from the adulterer. If he does not deny that the child is his, the child will be attributed to him, and may inherit from him and his relatives, and they may inherit from him, and the child will look at his daughters and sisters, when that is not permissible. So he must deny that the child is his so as to avoid all of that.\nIf his wife admits committing zina and he believes her, it is as if he saw her do that.\" (Al-Mughni  8/71).\nAr-Ramli said in Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj (7/111): … He must deny that the child is his, otherwise if he keeps quiet the child will be attributed to him when he is not his child, which is not allowed, just as it is prohibited to deny a child who is his, for reasons that we will mention below, because there is a stern warning to the one who does that.  Because of the evil consequences that result in both cases, these are regarded as very abhorrent major sins, and in fact they are referred to as kufr (disbelief) in the sound reports, even though some of the scholars said that it is only kufr if the doer believes that it is permissible; or the reports may be interpreted as meaning that these actions are a cause that will lead to kufr; or the word kufr may be understood in the sense of being ungrateful for Allah’s blessings.\nIf he came to know of her zina in the sense of being certain or thinking that it is most likely, he should accuse her of it and should engage in the process of li‘aan in order to deny  that the child is his. Doing so is obligatory in both cases.\nOtherwise, he may limit it to denying that the child is his through the process of li‘aan, because it is possible that the child is the result of a dubious marriage or a previous marriage. End quote.\nFor a description of li‘aan and how it is done, please see the answer to question no. 33615  .\nIn the process of li‘aan, you may limit it to denying that the child is yours and swearing by Allah four times that this child is not your child, and you should say on the fifth time: May the curse of Allah be upon you if you are lying.\nThe wife should not swear an oath at that point, if she admits her sin.\nIn that case, the child cannot be attributed to you and you are not obliged to spend on him. He should be given a random name, and his mother must take care of him; she may inherit from him and he may inherit from her.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the issue of paternity and the legitimacy of a child is a sensitive and complex matter. According to traditional Islamic jurisprudence, the child's lineage is established through the husband if the wife becomes pregnant during the marriage, unless there is clear evidence otherwise.\n\nIn the case where a wife uses donor sperm from another man to get pregnant without the husband's knowledge or consent, this action is considered deceitful and goes against the Islamic principle of trust between spouses. The husband has the right to know about the biological parentage of the child.\n\nRegarding the practice of li‘aan, it is a procedure that allows a husband to publicly deny paternity of a child under certain circumstances, especially in cases of suspected adultery. If the husband is unaware of the use of donor sperm and later learns of it, he would have grounds to initiate legal proceedings (like li‘aan) to disavow the child, since the act was done without his consent.\n\nHowever, it is important to approach such sensitive matters with care and to seek the advice of knowledgeable Islamic scholars or legal authorities within the community who can consider all aspects of the situation, including the emotional and social implications.\n\nTo summarize, if the husband finds out that the child is not biologically his due to the wife's use of donor sperm without his knowledge, he does have the right to deny paternity, and the procedure of li‘aan may be applicable in this context. Seeking guidance from qualified scholars is highly recommended for a case-specific analysis."

        "question": "Are rizq (provision) and marriage written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Everything from when Allaah created the Pen until the Day of Resurrection is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz, because when Allaah first created the Pen, He said to it: “Write.” It said: “My Lord, what should I write?” He said: “Write what is to be. So at that moment it began to write what would be until the Day of Resurrection. And it is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that when the foetus in its mother’s womb is four months old, Allaah sends an angel to breathe the soul into it and write down its provision, its lifespan and its deeds, and whether it is doomed or blessed.  \nProvision is also written down and connected to its means, and it does not increase or decrease. Among those means are that man should work to seek provision, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“He it is Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e. easy for you to walk, to live and to do agriculture on it); so walk in the path thereof and eat of His provision. And to Him will be the Resurrection” [al-Mulk 67:15]\nOther means are:  \nupholding ties of kinship, such as honouring one’s parents and upholding ties with relatives. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his provision to be abundant and his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship.” \nFearing Allaah (taqwa), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\n3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things” [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]\nDo not say “Provision is foreordained and limited and I will not do any of the things that lead to it,” because this is helplessness; smartness and resolve mean striving to seek provision and that which will benefit you in religious and worldly terms. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The smart man is the one who takes stock of himself and strives to do that which will benefit him after death, and the helpless one is the one who follows his own whims and desires and engages in wishful thinking, (assuming that Allaah will forgive him regardless of what he does and that he does not need to strive to good deeds).” \nJust as provision is written and connected to its means, so too marriage is also written and preordained. For both spouses it is written that he or she will be the spouse of this particular person. Nothing is hidden from Allaah on earth or in heaven. End quote. \nAnd Allaah knows best. \nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, it is understood that all aspects of a person's life, including their provisions (rizq) and marital status, are decreed and recorded in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz (the Preserved Tablet). This divine record contains knowledge of everything that will happen and has happened in the universe, including the sustenance and the destinies of individuals.\n\nThe concept is rooted in verses from the Qur'an and Hadith that emphasize Allah's omniscience and the predestined nature of both provision and marriage. For example, it is narrated in Sahih Muslim that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that all one's rizq is determined and written before the creation of a person.\n\nHowever, this does not negate the human capacity to make choices or the importance of effort. While the outcome is known by Allah and recorded, individuals are encouraged to work diligently, seek lawful provisions, and make choices, including in matters of marriage.\n\nIn summary, yes, from an Islamic perspective, rizq and marriage are considered to be written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz."

        "question": "What Are the Characteristics of a Good Wife in Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Significance of choosing a righteous companion \nAs this world is a stage that leads to the Hereafter, in which man is tested to see what he will do, so that he will be requited for it on the Day of Resurrection, what the wise Muslim must do is seek in this world everything that will help him to attain happiness and bliss in the Hereafter. \nThe most important help and support is righteous company. That begins with the Muslim society in which he lives, then with choosing pious friends, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined: “Do not keep company with anyone but a believer.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (4832); classed as hasan (good) by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘.\nThen finally he should choose a righteous wife who he hopes will be the best companion to help him attain eternal happiness in Paradise with Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nBest qualities of a good wife\nThe righteous wife is one who is good in many aspects.\nShe is the one who it is thought will guard her chastity and her honour in the husband’s presence and absence, and be diligent with regard to both minor and major issues.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband’s) absence what Allah would have them guard” [an-Nisa 4:34].\nShe is the one who is of good character and has good manners. She is not known for foul speech, meanness or bad manners; rather she is good-natured, pure of soul and clean of heart, speaks in a gentle manner and treats people kindly.\nMore important than all of that, she accepts advice and listens to it attentively and wholeheartedly; she is not one of those who are used to arguing stubbornly and arrogantly.\nAl-Asma‘i said: \n“An elder from the tribe of Banu’l-‘Anbar said: It was said that women are of three types: one who is easy-going, gentle, chaste and dignified, Muslim, a help to her family, and not a burden on them; one who is merely a vessel for childbearing; and one who is like a heavy yoke that Allah places on the neck of whomever He wills, and takes it away from whomever He wills.”\nOne of the scholars said: “The best of women is the one who, if she is given she is grateful, and if she is deprived she is patient; you feel happy when you look at her, and she obeys you if you instruct her to do something.”\nShe is the one who upholds her connection to her Lord and always strives to increase her level of faith and piety. She does not omit any obligatory duty, and she is keen to do some nafl (supererogatory) deeds. She gives precedence to pleasing Allah, may He be glorified, over everything else.\nConcerning that, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4802) and Muslim (1466).\nThe righteous wife is the one whom you see is serious about caring for and raising your children, teaching them Islam, good manners and the Quran, and instilling in them love for Allah, love for His Messenger, and love of good for people. Her main concern is not what they may attain in this world of prominence, wealth and degrees; rather she is concerned that they should attain a high level of piety, religious commitment, good character and knowledge.\nIn addition to all of that, the Muslim should choose a wife who gives him comfort when he sees her, and he feels joy in his heart when she is present, so she fills his house and his life with ease, joy and happiness.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It was said: O Messenger of Allah, what type of wife is best? He said: “The one who makes (her husband) happy when he looks at her, and she obeys him if he instructs her to do something, and she does not do anything with regard to herself or his wealth in a manner of which he does not approve.”\nNarrated by Ahmad (2/251); classed as hasan (good) by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (1838).\nIt was said to ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her): Which type of woman is best? She said: The one who does not know about saying bad things, and she is not crafty like men; her focus is on adorning herself for her husband and taking care of her family.\nFor more information, please see questions no. 6585 , 8391 , 26744 , and 83777 .\nReferences\nMuhadarat al-Udaba by ar-Raghib al-Asfahani, 1/410. \n‘Uyoon al-Akhbar by Ibn Qutaybah, 1/375.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the characteristics of a good wife are based on both spiritual and practical qualities that contribute to a harmonious and supportive marital relationship.

Her piety guides her actions and judgments within the household.\n\n2. **Supportive and Understanding**: A wife should be supportive of her husband in both his personal and religious endeavors. Understanding and compassion help in nurturing a positive atmosphere in the home.\n\n3. **Loyalty and Trustworthiness**: Loyalty to her husband and maintaining trust within the marriage is essential. This includes being faithful and maintaining confidentiality regarding personal matters.\n\n4. **Kindness and Patience**: A good wife is expected to exhibit kindness and patience, especially during times of difficulty or stress. This quality fosters a compassionate environment at home.\n\n5. **Good Character and Morality**: Upholding strong moral values, kindness, and respect towards others is a reflection of a good wife’s character and positively influences family dynamics.\n\n6. **Respect for Husband**: She should respect her husband as the head of the household, supporting him in his role while maintaining her own individuality and opinions.\n\n7. **Good Communication**: Effective communication is important for resolving conflicts and sharing feelings. A good wife should be able to express herself openly and listen to her husband.\n\n8. **Managing Household Affairs**: While roles may vary, a good wife often plays a significant role in managing household tasks and creating a nurturing environment for the family.\n\n9. **Motherhood and Care**: If they have children, a good wife is nurturing and caring, providing a loving and stable environment for her children.\n\n10. **Encouragement of Good**: A good wife encourages her husband and family members to engage in good deeds and maintain religious observance.\n\nThese characteristics not only apply to the wife but are often mutual expectations in a healthy Islamic marriage, where both partners support and complement each other in their journey through life. It's crucial to note that every relationship is unique, and partners should communicate and understand each other's needs and aspirations."

        "question": "Is Contraception Haram?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is it obligatory for a couple to produce children?\nWe hope that our brother will be certain that not one of the scholars said that it is obligatory for a couple to produce children, and that if they do not produce twenty children then they are sinning and deserve to be punished by Allah! \nSimilarly, not one of the earlier or contemporary scholars – as far as we know – has said that it is the fate of the wife to have a baby and breastfeed every single year, or that if the couple choose to delay pregnancy and having children, that is haram. \nWe mention these facts to you, and ward off doubts based on illusion, so that we can introduce the Islamic ruling, first of all, and so as to highlight that everything that you mentioned in your question is not an argument that has any sound basis, because the Islamic ruling is far removed from what you mentioned in your question. \nIs it permissible to delay having children?\nIn fact, the Islamic evidence indicates that it is permissible to delay having children. As Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with said): “We used to engage in ‘azl [coitus interruptus, a form of contraception] at the time when the Quran was being revealed. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5208) and Muslim , 1440) ‘Azl (coitus interruptus) means ejaculating outside the woman’s vagina in order to avoid pregnancy. \nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted this hadith as evidence for it being permissible to space having children in order to give them a proper Islamic upbringing, when he said: \n“If a woman has a lot of children, and it is difficult for her to give them a proper Islamic upbringing because they are so many, then there is nothing wrong with her taking something to space her pregnancies in order to achieve this important purpose, so that pregnancy will not adversely affect her or her children, as Allah has permitted ‘azl for this and similar purposes.” (Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn Baz ed. by ash-Shuway‘ir, 21/394) \nIs contraception haram?\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“Taking contraceptive measures is permissible in principle, because the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used the method of ‘azl (coitus interruptus) during the time of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he did not forbid them to do that. But it is contrary to what is preferable, because having a lot of children is something that is prescribed and is desirable.” (Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by al-‘Uthaymin, 22/2)\nWe have previously stated that it is encouraged to have a lot of righteous children .  \nThe ruling on different considerations for delaying having children \nSo you may rest assured that if you and your wife decide to delay having children, as you mentioned in your question, that is not regarded as a sin or disobedience in principle, unless there are other considerations that have an impact on this individual or personal choice, which may be dictated by present-day circumstances: \n\nIf the decision to delay having children is widespread, at the societal, national or ummah-wide level, then in this case it becomes a destructive and negative choice, and in that case the ruling is that it is not allowed, because it has moved from being a permissible and natural matter to one that is imposed from without and will lead to negative consequences, and is therefore blameworthy. \n\n\nIf the motive for delaying having children is fear for their provision and livelihood , then this reflects a serious doubt concerning our belief in the will and decree of Allah and our belief in the abundant provision of Allah and that He will help those who strive to earn a living in the land. It reflects an unjustified fear of the future and a failure to produce and strive. In that case it is blameworthy and is not allowed, and there are clear fatwas that speak of it. \n\n\nIf the reason for not having children is arguments and conflict between the spouses , where one of them does not want children and the other one does, then the one who is refusing does not have the right to do so, because having children is a right of both spouses, and it is not permissible for one of them to refuse with no excuse or good reason.\n\n\nIf the motive for delaying having children, or ceasing to do so, is to follow the cultural norms of non-Muslims and imitate them blindly, out of admiration for their culture and infatuation with their way of life, then undoubtedly the ruling in this case is that it is not allowed. One of the great principles of Islamic teaching is that the individual Muslim should be independent in his thinking and think within the framework of Islamic teaching; he should weigh up pros and cons objectively in the light of the circumstances that he lives in, and base his decisions on the Islamic principles in which he believes and with which he grew up, far removed from the illusionary psychological influences that are imposed by the media that represents the corporate powers that exist today, and should free himself from feelings of inferiority in the face of what he sees of the attitudes, customs and actions of the disbelieving nations. \n\n\nIf the means of delaying having children is medicine or surgical procedures that will prevent having children altogether (sterilisation), so that the woman or her husband will lose the ability to ever have children, then this is a serious transgression and is ingratitude for the blessing of Allah that He has bestowed upon His slaves, and it is destruction of a great blessing that Allah has instilled and created in them on the basis of great wisdom. \n\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade such things. This is the case concerning which there is no difference of opinion among the scholars that it is prohibited, for it is the undermining of one of the most important aims of Shari`ah and a blatant violation of one of the five necessities that Islam came to protect, which are: religious commitment, life, honour, wealth, and offspring. \nThese five cases are what the scholars refer to when they speak about spacing or limiting the number of children . They are the reason why they spoke in strict terms in many cases, so that no one would take undue advantage of the fatwas which say that contraception is permissible . \nThat is why we have mentioned these five cases here, so as to draw attention to them. In any other case, where a couple takes an individual decision on the basis of a genuine need, there is no blame on them for that. \nAnyone who reflects on the statement of the International Islamic Fiqh Council no. 39 (1/5), which has to do with family planning, will clearly understand that the way in which it is drafted is very careful and clear, as we have explained above. It says in the statement: \nThe session of the Islamic Fiqh Council held during its fifth conference in Kuwait, 1-6 Jumada al-Akhir 1409 AH/10-15 December 1988 AH. \nAfter studying the research papers presented by council members and experts on the topic of family planning, and listening to the discussion that took place on the topic, \nAnd based on the fact that one of the aims of marriage according to Islamic teaching is to produce children and preserve the human race, and that it is not permissible to undermine this aim, because undermining it is contrary to the texts of Islam and their teachings which call for having a lot of offspring, protecting them and caring for them because protecting offspring is one of the five holistic principles that are promoted by Islamic teaching, \nThe council determined the following: \n\nFirstly: it is not permissible to promulgate laws restricting the freedom of couples to have children. \nSecondly: it is prohibited to completely eradicate the ability to have children in the case of either the man or the woman, which is known as sterilisation, so long as there is no necessary reason, according to Islamic standards, for doing so. \nThirdly: it is permissible to use temporary methods of birth control for the purpose of spacing pregnancies, or preventing pregnancy for a specific length of time, if there is a valid reason, according to Islamic teachings, for doing so, according to what a couple decide on the basis of mutual consultation and consent, on condition that this does not lead to any harm and that the method used is Islamically permissible and does not cause harm to any existing pregnancy. End quote. \n\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether contraception is haram (forbidden) in Islam is a topic of debate among scholars and is not universally agreed upon. Generally, contraception is not considered inherently haram in Islam. Many scholars permit the use of contraceptive methods, provided that they meet certain conditions:\n\n1. **Intent and Purpose**: The intention behind using contraception should be justifiable, such as to space out childbirth for health reasons, financial stability, or emotional preparedness.\n\n2. **Mutual Agreement**: The decision to use contraception should ideally be made by both spouses, reflecting mutual consent and understanding.\n\n3. **Type of Contraception**: Some scholars express concerns with specific types of contraception, particularly those that may cause abortion or harm to a fetus after conception. Methods that prevent conception before pregnancy occurs are more widely accepted.\n\n4. **Temporary vs. Permanent**: Temporary contraceptive methods are generally more accepted than permanent methods (like sterilization), which may require stronger justification.\n\nIslam encourages family life and procreation, but it also recognizes circumstances in which contraception can be beneficial. It's important for individuals to consult knowledgeable scholars or trusted religious authorities in their community to get guidance tailored to their specific situation and beliefs."

        "question": "She refuses to get married for fear that her husband might force her to work",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We are very happy to see among the youth of our ummah people with enlightened minds and pure hearts, both young men and young women, who are able to cast off the chains and fetters of division and differences, and return to the purity of Islam as Allah revealed it to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). That is an immense and incomparable blessing, because the people became divided after the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) into sects and parties, each of them adhering to the call of their shaykhs and imams, until Islam became like a stranger among these groups and sects, despite the fact that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects (all kinds of religious sects), you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) have no concern in them in the least. Their affair is only with Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do” [al-An‘aam 6:159]. \nWe congratulate you and commend your way of thinking and focusing on the most important questions in life, those that have to do with religious commitment and beliefs, and what a person should believe in and adhere to with regard to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. \nThis path begins with the first step, which you have taken on the basis of what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has blessed you with of a mind that is able to ponder and reflect, far removed from all previous intellectual and social influences. Hence you read the Holy Qur’an far removed from sectarian distortions and interpretations that detract from the clarity of the text and deprive the reader of its benefits. So you ponder the word of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, that He sent down to guide mankind and enlighten humanity, and you will inevitably find therein guidance and enlightenment for yourself too, in clear and straightforward words in most of its verses and chapters. So you read therein the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’an) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. saved from the torment of Hell)” [al-An‘aam 6:155]\n“(This is the) Book (the Quran) sent down unto you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), so let not your heart be troubled about it, that you warn thereby, and a reminder unto the believers.\n(Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) to these idolaters (pagan Arabs) of your folk:) Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’an and Prophet Muhammad’s Sunnah), and follow not any Awliya (protectors and helpers, etc. who order you to associate partners in worship with Allah), besides Him (Allah). Little do you remember” [al-A‘raaf 7:2-3]. \nAs guidance is connected to following the Holy Qur’an and following Allah’s noble Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then what guidance could you find after that in the opinions and views of human beings? What happiness could we seek other than in the noble Book and the Prophet’s Sunnah? \nWhy would we introduce intermediaries between us and these two lights? Do we not have minds with which to think? Has Allah may He be glorified and exalted, not created for us hearts with which to distinguish between truth and falsehood? So why do we persist in imitating that with which we may have grown up of sectarian notions or esoteric factions? \nWhere do we find these factions in the Book of Allah, and where do we find them in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)? \nDo you think that we will enter Hell if we do not believe in a particular imam or a particular sect? \nDoes it make sense to suggest that we will enter Hell if we do not believe in things that neither the Holy Qur’an nor the noble Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught us? \nThese are very few simple questions that will lead us to cast away all these sects and factions and weird beliefs, and to become certain of the path that we follow, far away from them and closer to the pure Tawheed (affirmation of the Oneness of Allah) that is the religion of all of the Prophets (peace be upon them). \nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say: ‘Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, but if you turn away, he (Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) is only responsible for the duty placed on him (i.e. to convey Allah’s Message) and you for that placed on you. If you obey him, you shall be on the right guidance. The Messengers duty is only to convey (the message) in a clear way (i.e. to preach in a plain way).’” [an-Noor 24:54]\n“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it) , and fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment” [al-Hashr 59:7]. \nMoreover you should understand that the teachings of Islam do not instruct you to give up studying for fear that your husband may force you to work. The husband has no right to force his wife to do that, and by the same token he has no right to your wealth or property. Rather you can stipulate (in your marriage contract) whatever is appropriate for you and your situation. If you both agree that you can work in an appropriate environment, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as you strive to adhere to Islamic guidelines. \nIf you yourself do not want to work, then no one has the right to stipulate that you must do that, and you have the right to state that and stipulate whatever you wish to anyone who proposes marriage to you, so long as you do not make that a barrier that prevents you from getting married. Rather you should strive to maintain your chastity by getting married and choose for yourself a righteous husband who will take you from the environment, beliefs and traditions with which you have grown up and help you to adhere to the true and pure religion. It is not essential that his outward appearance should be such that it would cause your family to reject him; rather it is sufficient that he should be of good character and generally acceptable in terms of religious commitment, one who is keen to follow his religion and who prays regularly. \nIf you want to delay postgraduate study until after marriage, then you know best what is appropriate for you. But if you want to complete your studies, whilst striving to reduce things that are contrary to Islamic teachings to the best of your ability, and you are keen to pray on time so that the time for prayer does not end before you offer the prayer, except in exceptional circumstances and emergencies, then do that, and we hope that there will be nothing wrong with you doing that, in sha Allah. \nGoing out of the house does not require a mahram; rather it is in the case of travel that that is required, especially if you adhere to hijab and proper conduct, and there is no danger posed by aggressors. \nBut if you fear for yourself, that you may be subject to aggression, or you fear losing your religious commitment, or you are not able to observe hijab or adhere to the guidelines of your religion, then give precedence to all of that over the interests of work. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is a mutual contract based on consent, love, and cooperation between both partners. It is important for both individuals entering into a marriage to discuss their expectations and responsibilities openly.\n\nIf a woman is concerned about being forced to work by her husband, it is essential for her to communicate her feelings and preferences clearly. In Islam, a wife is not obligated to work outside the home, and her husband cannot compel her to do so. The responsibility of providing for the family generally falls on the husband, while the wife has the right to choose whether or not to work.\n\nIt is important for both partners to have open discussions about their roles, expectations, and any concerns they might have before getting married. If there are significant disagreements or concerns about personal autonomy and obligations, it may be wise for her to seek counsel from knowledgeable individuals or scholars within her community to explore her options and make an informed decision. Ultimately, both partners should feel comfortable and respected in the relationship."

It was also narrated by Ibn al-Jawzi in al-Mawdoo‘aat (2/274).

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the virtues of a righteous wife are highly emphasized. While there might not be a specific hadith that states the exact reward equivalent to that of one who fasts and prays Qiyaam (night prayer), there are a number of narrations that highlight the immense rewards for women who fulfill their roles as righteous wives.\n\nOne particular narration attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) states that a woman who fulfills her responsibilities to her husband and home is rewarded greatly. For instance, the Prophet said:\n\n**\"If a woman dies while her husband is pleased with her, she will enter Paradise.\"** (Ibn Majah)\n\nAdditionally, another hadith mentioned that the best among women are those who are devoted to their husbands and care for their household.\n\nIn summary, while the specific reward may not be numerically compared to fasting and Qiyaam, it is clear from Islamic teachings that the act of being a righteous and dutiful wife is highly meritorious and comes with great reward from Allah. Hence, such actions should not be undervalued, as they hold significant status in Islam."

        "question": "I do not want to get married but my parents want me to; am I Islamically obliged to agree?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that marriage is part of the teachings and practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rebuked those who wanted to remain unmarried. He said: “As for me, I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sunnah (my way) is not of me.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4776) and Muslim (1401). What is meant by “my Sunnah” is his guidance and path. No one has the right to forsake the path, guidance and Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for the sake of some worldly matter because he is keen to pursue further studies or earn more money or seek some social position, or because of some specious argument of the evil doers that comes to his mind, and so on. \nThis teaching is more emphasized at times of fitnah (turmoil or temptation) when a person fears for himself (that he may give into temptation) because there is no control and no one is watching him. So the Muslim is enjoined to seek help in controlling his evil inclinations and in resisting the Shaytaan by all possible means, and he is enjoined to seek and attain chastity. If he fears that he may give in to temptation, then it is obligatory for him to get married, so as to ward off temptation and corruption from his religious commitment. \nYou should understand that some younger women may be sought in marriage at a specific age, when compatible and righteous men propose marriage to them, but they refuse on the grounds that they want to complete their studies, or they are looking for someone who is more rich, and so on. Then they grow older and spend the rest of their lives waiting. By doing so, they go against the command of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to accept a righteous husband who is religiously committed and of good character. \n“If there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then give [your daughter or other female relative under your care] to him in marriage, for if you do not do that there will be fitnah in the land and a great deal of mischief.” [Hadeeth narrated by at-Tirmidhi] \nBy doing that, the woman forgets her true role in life, the purpose for which Allah created mankind in two halves, male and female, and made that one of the signs of His might and power, and of His Oneness, may He be exalted. \nTherefore we do not agree that you should disregard the idea of marriage altogether on the grounds of pursuing further study or seeking material gains. If you do have a clear reason for that, then explain it to your parents and come to some mutual understanding about it, so long as you are not using that as an excuse to forgo marriage altogether and ignore one of the greatest means of maintaining a sound way of life and establishing true servitude (‘uboodiyyah) to Allah in this world. \nBut if what you meant is that you do not want to marry a particular individual, for some reason, although you accept the principle if a compatible man proposes to you, then this is your right and there is nothing wrong with that; your parents do not have the right to force you to marry a particular person. \nPlease see also the answer to question no. 163990 \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is highly regarded and encouraged, but it is not considered obligatory for everyone. If you do not wish to get married, it is important to understand that your personal feelings and circumstances are valid. \n\nIslam emphasizes the importance of intention and personal choice in matters like marriage. While Islamic teachings encourage honoring and respecting your parents' wishes, you are not obligated to marry if that is not your desire. \n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: It is important to communicate your feelings to your parents. Sharing your perspective may help them understand your stance better.\n\n2. **Consultation**: Consider seeking counsel from someone knowledgeable, like an Imam or a trusted family member, who can mediate the conversation between you and your parents.\n\n3. **Personal Choice**: You have the right to make your own choices regarding marriage. If you feel that you are not ready or do not want to enter into a marriage, that should be respected.\n\n4. **Marriage in Islam**: While marriage is encouraged, it is ultimately a personal contract between two individuals and should be entered into willingly and with mutual consent.\n\n5. **Seek Alternatives**: If your parents are insistent, perhaps exploring alternatives, such as discussing the benefits of being single versus married or finding other ways to fulfill family expectations, might be beneficial.\n\nIn summary, you are not Islamically obliged to marry against your will, and it's important to approach the situation with respect and open communication with your parents."

        "question": "He committed zina with a married woman who was estranged from her husband; can he marry her if her husband divorces her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a woman leaves her husband or a man leaves his wife for one or two years, or for more or less time than that, the marriage remains valid until the man actually divorces his wife. So long as that has not happened, and the man has not uttered the word of divorce (talaaq) to his wife, or has not written words to that effect with the intention of divorcing her, then the woman is still his wife, even if the separation has gone on for a long time. \nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: When is a woman regarded as divorced? He said: The woman is regarded as divorced if her husband issues a divorce (talaaq) to her when he is of sound mind and does so by choice, with no impediment to divorce such as insanity, intoxication and the like, and the woman is pure (i.e., not menstruating), during a period of purity in which he has not had intercourse with her, or she is pregnant or postmenopausal.\nEnd quote from Fataawa at-Talaaq, 1/35 \nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 11681\nSecondly: \nZina (fornication or adultery) is one of the major sins; the degree of sin is worse and the punishment is multiplied if the woman is married, because that is a betrayal of her husband … Hence the punishment for an unmarried zaani is one hundred lashes, and the punishment for a previously married zaani is stoning to death. \nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)), and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him)”\nAl-Isra’ 17:32]. \nShaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The prohibition on approaching it or coming near it is more eloquent than merely prohibiting the action, because that includes the prohibition on all the things that may lead to it or promote it, because the one who approaches a forbidden area will soon find himself wandering in it, especially in the case of this matter which is very tempting for many people. \nAllah described zina and its abhorrent nature as a “faashishah” (something that transgresses its limits); in other words it is a sin that is regarded as immoral and odious in terms of sharee‘ah, rational thought and sound human nature, because it implies transgression of the sacred limits with regard to the rights of Allah, the rights of the woman and the rights of her family or husband, betrayal of marriage, confusion of lineage, and other negative consequences. \nThe words “and an evil way” mean: what an evil way is the way of the one who dares to commit this grave sin.\nEnd quote from Tafseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan fi Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan, 1/457 \nWhat they must both do is repent sincerely, turn back to Allah and keep away from the things that lead to zina. Whoever repents, Allah will accept his repentance. \nFor more information on the crime of zina and repentance therefrom, please see the answer to question no. 47924 and 138270\nSecondly: \nThe basic principle is that it is not permissible for the zaani to marry the zaaniyah until after they have repented sincerely, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The adulterer marries not but an adulteress or a Mushrikah and the adulteress none marries her except an adulterer or a Muskrik (and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely he is either an adulterer, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater, etc.) And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress, etc.)). Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism)”\n[an-Noor 24:3]. \nRepentance is attained by regretting (what one has done) and resolving not to go back to the sin. So long as they have repented and regretted what they fell into of sin, it is valid for them to marry according to most of the scholars. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nIf a woman commits zina, it is not permissible for the one who knows of that to marry her unless two conditions are met:\n1.That her ‘iddah has ended\n2.That she has repented from zina.\nIf these two conditions are met, it is permissible for the zaani or anyone else to marry her, according to the opinion of most of the scholars, including Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbaas, Jaabir, Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyab, Tawoos, Jaabir ibn Zayd, ‘Ata’, al-Hasan, ‘Ikrimah, az-Zuhri, ath-Thawri, ash-Shaafa‘i, Ibn al-Mundhir, and ashaab ar-ra’y. \nIt was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood, al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib and ‘Aa’ishah that she is not permissible (in marriage) for the zaani under any circumstances. They said: They are still zaanis whenever they are together, because of the general meaning of the verse and the report. \nIt may be that what they meant by that was the period before they repent or before it is established that she is not pregnant, in which case it is the same as our view. \nWith regard to it being forbidden in absolute terms, that is not correct, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “All others are lawful, provided you seek (them in marriage) with Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) from your property” [an-Nisa’ 4:24]. \nBecause she is permissible (in marriage) for someone other than the one who committed zina with her, she is also permissible to him, like any other woman. \nEnd quote from al-Mughni, 7/108. \nThirdly: \nIt is not permissible for a Muslim to turn a woman against her husband because that leads to the breakup of families, even if there was a bitter dispute between the spouses. Some scholars regarded this as a major sin. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who turns a woman against her husband.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2175; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. \nAbu Dawood (5170) also narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever turns a man’s wife or slave against him is not one of us.”\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. \nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeem Abaadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“Whoever turns a woman against her husband” (means) by mentioning the husband’s bad qualities to his wife, or mentioning the good qualities of another man to her. \n‘Awn al-Ma‘bood, 6/159 \nAnd he said “Whoever turns a man’s wife” means: he deceives her and corrupts her, or makes the idea of divorce attractive to her so that he or someone else can marry her, and so on.\n‘Awn al-Ma‘bood, 14/52 \nAl-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our shaykh, ash-Sha‘raawi, said: That also includes the case where a woman who is angry with her husband comes to him so that he can reconcile between them, for example, so he offers her abundant food and wants to spend on her and honour her, even if that is in order to honour her husband, then her heart may be inclined to someone else and she starts to look down on her husband. This is also included in this hadeeth. The wise man should be careful with regard to such matters, even if his intention is good. \nHe said: I did this several times; I put pressure on the woman who was angry with her husband, and I advised my family to leave her hungry, so that she would go back and would appreciate how blessed she was with her husband.\nEnd quote from Fayd al-Qadeer Sharh al-Jaami‘ al-Kabeer, 6/159 \nFourthly: \nIf a person turns a woman against her husband and spoils her for him so that she leaves him, then he marries her, his marriage is not valid and they must be separated, according to the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him). This is also the view of the Maalikis. For more information on the ruling on this issue and what is meant by turning a woman against her husband, please see the answer to question no. 84849\nBased on the above, if this man is the one who turned the woman against her husband, so that she would get divorced for his sake, it is not permissible for him to marry her, especially when he has committed zina with her. There is a difference of opinion concerning marriage of the zaani to the woman with whom he committed zina. In this case he has combined two evils: turning a woman against her husband and zina. \nBut if he is not the one who turned her against her husband, as appears to be the case from the question, and he only got to know her and meet her after she had left her husband and she had left his house, then his marriage to her is valid, if she has got divorced from her first husband, on condition that they both repent to Allah, may He be exalted, from what occurred between them. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, zina (adultery) is considered a serious sin. If a person engages in zina with a married woman, several factors come into play concerning her potential marriage to that person after her divorce.\n\n1. **Divorce Status**: If the woman's husband has legally and Islamically divorced her, she is no longer married, and she is allowed to remarry.\n\n2. **Repentance**: The person who committed zina should sincerely repent (tawbah) and seek forgiveness from Allah for his actions. Repentance in Islam involves feeling remorse for the sin, stopping the sin, and making a firm intention not to return to it.\n\n3. **Mahr (Dowry)**: If the woman is free to marry (after her divorce), and both parties wish to marry one another, the marriage can proceed. However, certain conditions and processes should typically be followed, such as ensuring the marriage contract is valid and the appropriate mahr is given.\n\n4. **Potential Consequences**: It is important for both parties to consider the social and familial implications that may arise from their past relationship and to ensure that their intentions align with Islamic principles.\n\nIn summary, if the woman has been divorced from her husband, and both individuals are willing, and the involved person has repented for his past actions, then they may marry. It is advisable for them to consult with a knowledgeable scholar or local imam to guide them through the process appropriately."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is divorce in anger valid?\nIf the anger reached a level where the individual did not know what he was saying, or it was extreme anger that made him issue the divorce , and were it not for the anger he would not have issued the divorce, then it does not count as a divorce . \nDoes triple divorce count as one divorce?\nThe jurists differed concerning the threefold divorce , and the most correct opinion is that it counts as one divorce , whether it was uttered in a single phrase, such as saying “you are thrice divorced”, or it was uttered in separate phrases such as saying, “you are divorced, you are divorced, you are divorced.” \nBy the same token, if he issued a divorce then he repeated it during the `Iddah, the divorce before taking her back is part of the first divorce, because it only happens once, and divorce can only happen again after a marriage contract or after taking the wife back. \nDo you need witnesses for divorce?\nIt is not essential or obligatory to have witnesses to the divorce. If a man utters the word of divorce, then divorce has taken place, even if it is in the absence of the wife or no one else was present. The same applies if he writes the word of divorce in a message or on a piece of paper with the intention of divorce; divorce has taken place in this case. \nIt was narrated that there was scholarly consensus that it is not essential to have witnesses to divorce. \nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the issue of having witnesses to taking the wife back: \n“Among the evidence that it is not essential is the fact that there was scholarly consensus that it is not essential to have witnesses to divorce, as was narrated by Al-Muwazi‘i in Taysir Al-Bayan. And taking back the wife is of a similar nature, so it (having witnesses) is not essential in that case as it is not essential in the case of divorce.” (Nayl Al-Awtar, 6/300) \nAllah has enjoined having witnesses to divorce and taking back the wife in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Then when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims),” [At-Talaq 65:2]\nThis command is by way of recommendation and preference according to the majority of jurists. \nAbu Dawud (2188) narrated that `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about a man who divorced his wife, then had intercourse with her but he had not called witnesses to the divorce or to his taking her back, and he said: Your divorce was not in accordance with the Sunnah and your taking her back was not in accordance with the Sunnah; bring witnesses to the divorce and to taking her back, and do not do (this mistake) again. It was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud. \nIt may also be understood as meaning that it is recommended to have witnesses. \nThe words “bring witnesses to the divorce and to taking her back, and do not do (this mistake) again” indicate that witnessing divorce or taking back the wife may come after the fact, hence he told him to bring witnesses to both even though they had happened previously. \nShaykh `Abd Al-Muhsin Al-`Abbad (may Allah preserve him) said: \n“This indicates that witnessing may come later and that it does not have to be at the time of the divorce or at the time of taking the wife back; rather a man may issue a divorce and then have it witnessed or he may take back his wife and then have it witnessed. And the taking back may be in the form of intercourse, because if a man has intercourse with his divorced wife during her ‘Iddah, that constitutes taking her back. Or it may be done verbally, but having it witnessed is required so that it will be known that the divorce has ended with the taking back. And the same applies to divorce.” (Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud) \nTo sum up, your divorce issued in the state of extreme anger does not count as such, and the threefold divorce counts as one divorce; it is not essential to have divorce witnessed and the same applies to taking the wife back. \nWe advise you to be careful and avoid using the word divorce (Talaq) altogether. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the validity of a divorce declared in anger can depend on several factors, including the intention of the person issuing the divorce and the circumstances surrounding it. \n\nThere are varying opinions among scholars:\n\n1. **Intention Matters:** Many scholars agree that if a person issues a divorce while genuinely angry but does not lose control of their faculties or utter words without consciousness of what they are saying, the divorce can still be considered valid.\n\n2. **State of Mind:** If the individual is in such a state of rage that he cannot think clearly or is not aware of what he is saying, it may impact the validity of the divorce. Some scholars argue that divorce in such a state may be invalid due to the lack of sound judgment, while others maintain that it is still valid.\n\n3. **Reconciliation Encouraged:** Islam encourages reconciliation and making efforts to resolve conflicts before resorting to divorce. Thus, even if a divorce is pronounced in anger, it is often recommended to seek forgiveness, communicate openly, and attempt to mend the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while divorce declared in anger can be valid, the specific circumstances, intentions, and state of mind at the moment of pronouncing the divorce are significant factors that should be considered. For personal cases, it is advisable to consult a knowledgeable scholar or an imam who can provide guidance based on the specifics of the situation and the relevant legal school of thought."

        "question": "Ruling on a man kissing his adult daughter and hugging her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    For a man to embrace and hug his daughter, or kiss her on the \n    head or cheek or between the eyes by way of showing compassion, kindness and \n    love is permissible, even if she is an adult, on condition that there be no \n    fear of fitnah or provocation of desire. Excluded from that is kissing on \n    the mouth, which is only for spouses, and which usually provokes desire. \n\n    Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Can a man \n    kiss a woman who is his mahram? He said: If he has come home from a journey \n    and does not fear (temptation) for himself. \n\n    Ibn Muflih said: But he should never do that on the mouth, \n    only on the forehead or head. \n\n    End quote from al-Adaab al-Shar‘iyyah, 2/256. See also\n    al-Iqnaa‘, 3/156; al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 13/130 \n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \n\n    Is it permissible for a man to kiss his daughter when she has \n    grown up and passed the age of puberty, whether she is married or not, and \n    whether the kissing is on her hand or mouth or so on? If she kisses him in \n    those places, what is the ruling? \n\n    He replied (may Allah have mercy on him): \n\n    There is nothing wrong with a man kissing his daughter, \n    whether she is older or younger, without desire so long as that is on her \n    cheek once she has grown up, because it is proven from Abu Bakr (may Allah \n    be pleased with him) that he kissed his daughter ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be \n    pleased with her) on her cheek. And because kissing on the mouth may lead to \n    provocation of sexual desire, so it is better and safer not to do that. \n    Similarly, a daughter may kiss her father on his nose or head, without \n    desire. But if there is desire then that is haraam for all concerned, so as \n    to avoid temptation and so as to block means that may lead to immorality. \n    And Allah is the source of strength.\n\n    End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/78, 79. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    Embracing sons and daughters when they are small, hugging \n    them, smelling them and kissing them are all part of the compassions and \n    warmth that people should give in abundance to their children and not \n    deprive them of it, because it is compassion that Allah has created in the \n    hearts of His slaves, and Allah only shows mercy to those of His slaves who \n    are merciful. \n\n    We advise fathers and mothers not to deprive them of this \n    parental gesture, because it is a basic psychological need, especially in \n    small children, as is proven in all psychological and educational studies, \n    both contemporary and classical. \n\n    It is proven in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (5997) that Abu \n    Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) kissed al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali, when \n    al-Aqra‘ ibn Haabis al-Tameemi was sitting with him. al-Aqra‘ said: I have \n    ten children and I have never kissed one of them. The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) looked at him, then he said: “The \n    one who does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.” \n\n    In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (3704) it also says: al-Bara’ \n    entered with Abu Bakr upon his family -- after he reached Madinah as a \n    migrant. ‘Aa’ishah was lying down as she was suffering a fever. I [al-Bara’] \n    saw her father kiss her cheek and say: How are you, O my daughter? \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the relationship between a parent and child, including adult children, is guided by principles of affection, respect, and maintaining boundaries. Hugging and kissing one's adult daughter is generally considered acceptable within the confines of familial love and respect.\n\nHowever, there are a few important considerations:\n\n1. **Cultural Norms**: Practices around physical affection can vary widely between cultures. What may be acceptable in one cultural context may not be seen the same way in another.\n\n2. **Intent and Comfort**: The intentions behind the act and the comfort level of both the father and daughter are paramount. If both parties are comfortable and it is done in a respectful manner, it is generally permissible.\n\n3. **Islamic Teachings**: There is no explicit prohibition in Islamic texts concerning a father kissing or hugging his adult daughter. However, Muslims are encouraged to maintain modesty and adhere to guidelines about physical contact, especially concerning non-mahram (those who are not closely related).\n\n4. **Boundaries**: It is essential to maintain appropriate boundaries as defined by Islamic teachings. Parents and children should ensure that their expressions of affection do not lead to any feelings of discomfort or misunderstanding.\n\nIn summary, a man may hug and kiss his adult daughter as an expression of love and affection, provided that both are comfortable with such gestures, and it is done within the context of respect and familial bond. If there are specific cultural or personal concerns, it may be beneficial to consult a local scholar for tailored advice."

        "question": "He divorced her three times and she wants to marry a man who is on his deathbed so that she can go back to the first husband",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a man divorces his wife three times, she is not permissible for him until she has been married to another husband, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband. Then, if the other husband divorces her, it is no sin on both of them that they reunite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allâh. These are the limits of Allâh, which He makes plain for the people who have knowledge”\n[al-Baqarah 2:230]. \nAnd it is essential that the second husband have intercourse with her; if no intercourse takes place between them, she does not become permissible for the first husband. \nThe scholars are unanimously agreed on that, and the evidence for that from the Sunnah is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (2639) and Muslim (1433) from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that Rifaa‘ah divorced his wife for the third time, and after that she married ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn al-Zubayr, and claimed that he had not consummated the marriage with her and she wanted to get divorced from him and go back to her first husband. The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you want to go back to Rifaa‘ah? No, not until you taste his (‘Abd al-Rahmaan’s) sweetness and he tastes your sweetness.” \nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “not until you taste his sweetness and he tastes your sweetness” are a metaphor for intercourse, likening its pleasure to the sweetness of honey. \nIn this hadeeth we see that the woman who has been divorced three times is not permissible for the one who divorced her until she has been married to another husband, and he has intercourse with her, then he divorces her and her ‘iddah comes to an end. As for merely doing the marriage contract with her, that does not make her permissible for the first husband. This is the view of all the scholars among the Sahaabah and Taabi‘een and those who came after them, except Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyib; perhaps this hadeeth did not reach him. End quote. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nAfter the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) clearly explained what was meant in the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and that she is not permissible for the first husband until the second husband tastes her sweetness and she tastes his sweetness, no differing view should be given any consideration and it is not permissible for anyone to follow a different view.\nEnd quote from al-Mughni, 10/549 \nIf there is an agreement with the second husband that he will marry her in order to make her permissible for her first husband, or if the second husband intends that without any prior agreement with anyone, and he does not want to marry her (except for this purpose) or stay with her, then this is a tahleel marriage, and the Messenger of Allah (sa) cursed the one who does that. The woman does not become permissible to her first husband by means of this haraam marriage, even if the second husband has intercourse with her. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nTahleel marriage is haraam and is invalid according to most scholars. … If it is stipulated that it is tahleel before the marriage contract is done, but it is not mentioned in the marriage contract, or he intended it as a tahleel marriage without that being stipulated, then the marriage is also invalid.\nEnd quote from al-Mughni, 10/49-51 \nIf the intention is on the part of the woman only, and no agreement to that effect was made with the second husband and he did not intend it to be a tahleel marriage, then the marriage is valid and she becomes permissible thereby for the first husband, if the second husband consummates the marriage with her then divorces her or dies, and the woman’s intention does not have any effect on that. \nThis has been explained in the answer to question no. 159041. \nBut the fact that she is giving money to this man so that he will agree to this marriage contract indicates that he is aware of the intention of tahleel and that he does not want to marry her at all, so by accepting that he is like a borrowed billy-goat, who comes between the divorced spouses to make her permissible for her first husband. \nSee also the answer to question no. 76324. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, if a woman has been divorced three times (known as \"triple talaq\"), she cannot remarry her first husband unless she has married another man and that marriage has been consummated, and the second husband then divorces her or passes away. This is known as \"halala.\"\n\nIn your scenario, if she plans to marry a man on his deathbed with the intention to divorce him afterward in order to return to her first husband, this is not permissible. This act would be considered deceptive and goes against the essence of marriage in Islam, which is meant to be a serious and binding contract. Such a marriage is invalid if it is intended only as a means to return to her first husband.\n\nFor her to return to her first husband legitimately, she needs to fulfill the conditions of halala under genuine circumstances, such as marrying another man for valid reasons and allowing the marriage to take its natural course without deceit. \n\nIt is always recommended to consult a qualified Islamic scholar for personalized guidance in such matters."

        "question": "He did the marriage contract with her but she does not have any accommodation and he wants to be intimate with her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIf the \n    marriage contract has been done, then you have become his wife and it is \n    permissible for a husband to be intimate with his wife however he wants. But \n    she can refuse to let him have his way with her until he gives her the mahr \n    and prepares a suitable marital home for her. \nIbn \n    al-Mundhir (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated that the scholars were \n    unanimously agreed that a woman has the right to refuse to let her husband \n    consummate the marriage with her until he gives her the mahr. \nAl-Mughni \n    (7/200). \nAl-Kasaani \n    said in Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’ (4/19) that a woman has the right to \n    refuse to let her husband have his way with her until he provides her with a \n    home. \nThis is the \n    shar’i ruling on this matter. \nWhat we are \n    afraid of is that this man is not serious about providing a home and \n    striving to settle in it and build a family, and that he is content to get \n    his pleasure from meeting you. Hence we advise you not to answer his demand \n    and not to let him be intimate with you, until he provides you with a home. \n    This will encourage him to pay attention and hasten to consummate the \n    marriage, and protect you. For intercourse may take place as the result of \n    pressure on his part and weakness on yours, then pregnancy may occur, and \n    that may lead to bad consequences in the event of divorce or delay of \n    consummation of the marriage and announcement thereof to the people. \nSecondly: \nIf your work \n    is permissible and free of any haraam things, then we do not advise you to \n    give it up, and the husband has no right to prevent you from working so long \n    as he did the marriage contract with you at the time when you were doing \n    this job and he did not stipulate that you should leave it. At the very \n    least you should keep your job even if you take a temporary leave of absence \n    until you find out what your husband is really like. \nThirdly: \nAttention \n    must be paid to the religious commitment and character of a husband, and one \n    should find out whether he prays regularly and keeps away from haraam \n    things. From your question it seems to us that this is not a man who is good \n    in these ways, hence it is easy for him to insult your parents and to \n    threaten to cheat on you. We do not know how such things could be said by a \n    wise man who understands how things are. Is this a proper way of putting \n    pressure on his wife – threatening to commit zina as a punishment to her? \n    This is indicative of a severe lack of religious commitment and \n    intelligence. If we had been consulted about the matter before the marriage \n    contract was done, we would have advised you not to marry him. But as the \n    contract has been done, we say: If he is careless about prayer, then you \n    should advise him time after time. If he does not improve, then separate \n    from him, for there is nothing good for you in marriage to a man who is \n    careless about prayer. \nFourthly: \nIf it \n    becomes clear to you that he is messing about and is not serious about \n    preparing a home etc, and that he may mistreat you and your family – even if \n    he does pray regularly – then we advise you to leave him, even if you free \n    yourself from the marriage by giving up some of your rights (i.e., khula’). \nYou say that \n    your family and everyone around you thinks that he is not suitable for you. \n    The family’s opinion in such matters is usually closest to the truth, \n    because they look at the matter with a measure of wisdom, far removed from \n    emotion which may sometimes blind one to the truth. They also have knowledge \n    and experience of such matters. Hence we think that you should discuss the \n    matter with your family, and do what they advise you, as well as praying to \n    Allaah for guidance (istikhaarah), for He does not betray the one who seeks \n    guidance and the one who asks for advice will not regret it. \nWe ask Allaah to make things easy for you and to take away your distress and to guide you to good things. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is a significant and sacred bond that includes certain rights and responsibilities for both spouses. If a man has completed the marriage contract (Nikah) with a woman, they are considered legally married, and he has the right to be intimate with her. However, there are some important considerations:\n\n1. **Accommodation**: It is generally expected that the husband should provide a suitable living arrangement for his wife. Islam encourages providing a place where the husband and wife can live together in safety and comfort. If he does not have accommodation, it is advisable for him to address this situation before expecting to be intimate with her.\n\n2. **Mutual Consent**: Intimacy should be based on the mutual consent of both partners. The husband should respect his wife's feelings and circumstances. Open communication is essential.\n\n3. **Support and Responsibility**: The husband has a responsibility to support his wife, not only financially but also emotionally and socially. Ensuring a proper living situation is part of fulfilling this obligation.\n\n4. **Consulting Scholars**: If there are any complications or doubts regarding their situation, it is beneficial to consult knowledgeable scholars or local Islamic authorities for guidance tailored to their specific circumstances.\n\nIn summary, while the marriage contract allows for intimacy, it is ideal for the husband to ensure a proper living arrangement and fulfill his responsibilities before pursuing intimacy with his wife."

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic culture and tradition, the practice of a bride sitting on a dais (a raised platform) during a wedding ceremony can vary in acceptance depending on cultural context and the interpretation of Islamic teachings by scholars.\n\nFrom a general Islamic perspective, there is no specific ruling in the Qur'an or Hadith that explicitly forbids or permits a bride sitting on a dais. However, there are some considerations that should be kept in mind:\n\n1. **Modesty**: The concept of modesty is paramount in Islam. If the dais allows the bride to be more visible and attract undue attention, it might be seen as inappropriate.\n\n2. **Simplicity**: Islam encourages moderation and simplicity in all aspects of life, including celebrations. Extravagance should be avoided.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**: In many cultures, a dais is a customary practice during weddings. If this tradition does not contradict Islamic principles of modesty and simplicity, many scholars may find it acceptable.\n\n4. **Avoiding Bid'ah (Innovation)**: Some scholars may be concerned about introducing practices that have no basis in Islamic tradition. If a dais is viewed as a practice associated with non-Islamic customs, it might be discouraged.\n\nIn conclusion, the ruling on a bride sitting on a dais can depend on cultural context, local customs, and adherence to Islamic principles of modesty and simplicity. It is advisable for those involved to consult knowledgeable scholars or local religious authorities to ensure that practices align with Islamic teachings and cultural sensitivities."

        "question": "The situation of one who is illegitimate and the ruling on marrying him",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    There are some ahaadeeth that condemn the illegitimate child, \n    but most of these ahaadeeth are da’eef (weak) and are not saheeh (sound). It \n    was narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (4/39) and by Ahmad in \n    al-Musnad (2/311) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) \n    that the Prophets  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    “The illegitimate child is the most evil of the three” meaning more evil \n    than his parents. Among the scholars who classed this as hasan were Ibn \n    al-Qayyim in al-Manaar al-Muneef (133) and al-Albaani in \n    al-Silsilat al-Saheehah (672). \n\n    The scholars interpreted this hadeeth in a number of ways, \n    the most famous of which was that suggested by Sufyaan al-Thawri, who said: \n    it means he is the most evil of the three if he does the same action as his \n    parents did (i.e., zina or adultery). \n\n    This was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah, who said that the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He is the most evil \n    of the threeif he does the same action as \n    his parents did – meaning the illegitimate child.” Although its isnaad is \n    da’eef, it was interpreted in this manner by the salaf, as stated above. \n\n    This interpretation is supported by the report narrated by \n    al-Haakim (4/100) – with an isnaad of which al-Albaani said, “It may be \n    regarded as hasan” – from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), that \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The \n    illegitimate child does not bear any part of his parents’ burden of sin.\n    ‘and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of \n    another’ [al-An’aam 6:164 – interpretation of the meaning].” \n    (al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 2186) \n\n    Some scholars said that this hadeeth is to be interpreted as \n    meaning that there is some evil in most illegitimate children because they \n    are created from an evil nutfah (sperm drop), and usually nothing good is \n    created from an evil nutfah. If a good soul comes out of this nutfah then it \n    will enter Paradise. This hadeeth is to be taken as a general rule to which \n    there may be exceptions. (See al-Manaar al-Muneef, 133). \n\n    Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on \n    him) said: “If an illegitimate child believes and does righteous deeds, he \n    will enter Paradise, otherwise he will be punished for his deeds just like \n    anyone else. The punishment is for the deeds, not for the lineage. Rather \n    the illegitimate child is condemned because he is expected to do evil deeds, \n    as often happens. By the same token, good lineages are regarded as \n    praiseworthy because such people are expected to do good deeds. But when a \n    person does a deed, then the reward or punishment is based on that, and the \n    most noble of people before Allaah are those who are most pious. (al-Fataawa \n    al-Kubra, 5/83). \n\n    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: “If an \n    illegitimate child dies in Islam (as a Muslim), he will enter Paradise, and \n    his being illegitimate does not have any effect on that, because that was \n    not due to his own actions, rather it was the action of someone else. Allaah \n    says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    ‘and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of \n    another’ \n\n    [al-An’aam 6:164]\n\n    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    ‘Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned’\n\n    [al-Toor 52:21]\n\n    And there are other similar verses. \n\n    With regard to the words narrated from the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), ‘No illegitimate child will \n    enter Paradise,’ this hadeeth is not saheeh. It was mentioned by al-Haafiz \n    Ibn Jawzi in al-Mawdoo’aat, but it is one of the ahaadeeth that were \n    fabricated against the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him). And Allaah is the Source of strength.” \n\n    With regard to the ruling on marrying one who is \n    illegitimate, none of the reputable fuqaha’ have stated that this is haraam. \n    However there was some difference of opinion among the Hanbalis as to \n    whether such a person is compatible with a woman of good lineage. Some of \n    them said that he is compatible with her, and othesr did not agree with that \n    because that will be a source of shame for the woman, because he will be her \n    guardian, and that would also affect her child. (See al-Mughni, \n    7/28).\n\n    (al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 34/282). \n\n    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked \n    about a man who married his daughter to a person who was apparently \n    illegitimate – what was the ruling on that? He answered as follows: \n\n    “If he is Muslim, then the marriage is sound, because the sin \n    of his mother and the one who committed zina with her does not rest on him. \n    Allaah says ‘and no bearer of burdens shall bear \n    the burden of another’ [al-An’aam 6:164 – interpretation of the meaning].  \n    And there is no shame on him because of their action, if he adheres \n    steadfastly to the religion of Allaah and develops good characteristics, \n    because Allaah says\n\n    ‘O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, \n    and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, \n    the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa \n    [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]. Verily, Allaah is \n    All-Knowing, All-Aware’\n\n    [al-Hujuraat 49:13]\n\n    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said, when he was asked who is the most noble of people, ‘Those who are \n    most pious.’ And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \n    ‘If a person’s actions make him less worthy than others, his lineage will \n    not make him more worthy.’” \n\n    From Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/166.\n\n     And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the status of being born illegitimately (i.e., out of wedlock) is viewed with compassion and should not lead to discrimination against the individual. The child is considered to have a right to love and respect, just like any other child. \n\nRegarding marriage, the fact that a person is born out of wedlock does not prohibit them from marrying or being married to others. Islamic law focuses on the character, piety, and compatibility of the individuals involved in a marriage rather than their lineage or the circumstances of their birth. \n\nHowever, it is essential for individuals to ensure that their marriage is built upon mutual respect, understanding, and shared values, which are fundamental principles in Islam.

        "question": "Talking to Fiancé before Marriage in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to talk to your fiancé except in a case where both parties trust one another and where the parents agree to the marriage and have no objections. In this case it is acceptable for them to speak to one another in a normal manner, discussing matters of life that concern them . But if they know that their parents do not agree to that, then it is not permissible for them to speak to one another in this case.\n Shaykh `Abullah ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The fiancée is still a non-Mahram woman and speaking to her is still speaking to a non-Mahram woman , so it must be done properly and only as much as is necessary, such as agreeing on specific matters to do with after they get married. Attention must also be paid to the following:\n\nIt must be done with the agreement of the woman’s guardian and with no objection on his part to the marriage.\nThe talk should not involve anything that may provoke desire or cause temptation.\nThere should be no other way of telling her what he wants to say, such as through his sister or her brother, or by letter.\nIt should not go beyond what is essential.”\n\n And Allah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of engaging in conversation with a fiancé before marriage is generally acceptable, provided that certain guidelines and principles are adhered to. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Purpose of Communication**: The primary aim of talking to a fiancé is to get to know each other better in order to assess compatibility for marriage. Conversations should focus on understanding values, beliefs, goals, and family expectations.\n\n2. **Islamic Etiquette**: Conversations should be conducted in a manner that is respectful and within the bounds of Islamic conduct. This means avoiding any inappropriate or intimate discussions that are not suitable until after marriage.\n\n3. **Presence of Mahram**: It is often recommended that discussions occur in the presence of a mahram (a non-marriageable relative, such as a parent or sibling) or in a way that maintains propriety, to ensure that both parties remain within Islamic boundaries.\n\n4. **Avoiding Seclusion**: Islam prohibits seclusion (khalwa) between non-mahram men and women. Therefore, it is important to have discussions in groups or public places, which minimizes the risk of inappropriate behavior.\n\n5. **Setting Boundaries**: Both individuals should set clear boundaries about what is acceptable in their conversations to ensure that they adhere to Islamic values.\n\n6. **Focus on Compatibility**: Practical aspects such as plans for the future, family values, and life goals are important topics that can help determine compatibility.\n\nUltimately, while it is permissible for a fiancé and fiancée to communicate before marriage, it should be done with the intention of fulfilling a religious duty and within the ethical framework of Islam. Each couple may also want to consult with knowledgeable individuals or scholars to ensure they are observing Islamic principles in their interactions."

        "question": "Is it permissible for a Muslim woman to appear in front of a kaafir woman without hijab?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with a woman looking at a man; hence men, whether they are Muslim or kaafirs, are not enjoined to cover their faces. Women are enjoined to cover themselves but men are not. Similarly, there is nothing wrong with a woman looking at another woman if one of them is not Muslim. That is because the prohibition on looking is due to the fear of desire being provoked, and it is well known that a woman will not be stirred by desire if she looks at another woman. \nAs for the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “It is no sin on them (the Prophet’s wives, if they appear unveiled) before their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brother’s sons, or the sons of their sisters, or their own women” [al-Ahzaab 33:55], the word nisa’ihinna (their own women) does not apply exclusively to believing women; rather it also includes disbelieving women. If a woman looks at a non-Muslim woman that will not result in evil, so there is nothing wrong with her looking at a non-Muslim woman, especially if she needs to meet with her, such as if she is a teacher or a doctor and so on. It would be too difficult for her to observe hijab before her or to look away from her.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the guidelines for hijab (modesty in dress and behavior) primarily pertain to interactions between Muslim women and men. When it comes to interactions with non-Muslim women (kaafir women), the requirement for a Muslim woman to wear hijab is generally less stringent, as the same level of modesty and separation applies primarily to interactions with men.\n\nHowever, while there isn't a strict obligation for a Muslim woman to wear hijab in front of a non-Muslim woman, it is still recommended for her to dress modestly and in a way that reflects her Islamic values. Modesty is an important aspect of a Muslim's conduct and appearance, regardless of the faith of those around them.\n\nUltimately, the decision can also be influenced by cultural practices, personal convictions, and the specifics of the situation. It is advisable for individuals to consult knowledgeable scholars or sources from their communities to understand the application of these principles in their specific context."

May Allaah make all good easy for you. End quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the marriage between a woman and a cousin is generally permissible. However, the requirement for a woman to fulfill her father's will regarding marriage is more nuanced.\n\n1. **Personal Choice**: A woman has the right to choose whom she wishes to marry. While she should respect her father's wishes and consider his guidance, her consent is essential in any marriage. Islam emphasizes the importance of mutual agreement between the couple.\n\n2. **Respecting the Will**: If the father has expressed a strong desire for her to marry her cousin, it may be seen as a matter of family preference and respect for parental authority. However, ultimately, the decision lies with the woman. If she does not wish to marry her cousin for valid reasons, she is under no obligation to fulfill her father's will.\n\n3. **Communication**: It is advisable for her to discuss her feelings with her father. Honest communication may help him understand her perspective and lead to a solution that respects both her desires and his wishes.\n\n4. **Seeking Guidance**: If uncertain, it may be beneficial for her to seek guidance from knowledgeable persons in her community, such as scholars or trusted family members, who can provide counsel based on Islamic teachings.\n\nIn summary, she is not obligated to execute her father's will regarding marriage if she does not wish to do so. She has the right to make her own choice while maintaining respect for her father's views."

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the issue of marriage and education should be approached with balance and consideration for both the rights and responsibilities involved. While it is important for individuals, especially women, to seek education and personal development, marriage is also recognized as a significant milestone in life.\n\nIn this case, if her father is concerned about her education before allowing her to marry, it is important to acknowledge his perspective, which often stems from a desire for his daughter to be equipped for her future. However, it is also essential for both parties to communicate openly about their desires and concerns.\n\nIslam encourages mutual consent between spouses, so the woman should express her wishes regarding marriage and education to her father. She may also wish to discuss her educational goals and how they can coexist with the prospect of marriage.\n\nUltimately, both education and marriage are important aspects of a person's life. Striking a balance where education can be completed alongside the responsibilities of marriage is encouraged. It is advisable for the young woman to seek guidance from knowledgeable members of her community, such as scholars or trusted family members, to navigate this situation respectfully and thoughtfully. \n\nIf the situation is particularly challenging, engaging in counseling or mediation may be beneficial to ensure that all parties' concerns are addressed respectfully and wisely."

        "question": "A woman asking for a divorce from her husband who is addicted to drugs",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The basic principle is that it is not permissible for a woman \n    to ask for divorce unless there is a reason for that. The Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who \n    asks her husband for a divorce with no reason, the fragrance of Paradise \n    will be forbidden to her.” Narrated by Ahmad (21874), Abu Dawood (2226) and \n    al-Tirmidhi (1187); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel \n    (2035). \n\n    And the words “with no reason” mean without there being any \n    hardship that compels her to ask for a divorce. \n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in \n    Fath al-Baari: \n\n    The reports which warn women against asking for divorce from \n    their husbands are to be understood as applying to cases where there is no \n    reason for that, because of the hadeeth of Thawbaan… then he mentioned the \n    hadeeth quoted above. End quote. \n\n    Undoubtedly addiction to drugs is a serious shortcoming, \n    which harms a woman in both religious and worldly terms, because there is no \n    guarantee that her husband will not enter upon her when he is intoxicated \n    and beat her or revile her, or ask her to do something at that time which it \n    is not permissible for her to do. \n\n    Such a thing is regarded as an excuse which makes it \n    permissible for a woman to ask for divorce, but what the woman should do is \n    be patient with her husband, and try to set him straight as much as she can. \n    If she is not able to do that, and she finds that staying with him will \n    cause her harm, then there is nothing wrong with asking for divorce in that \n    case. \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was asked: \n\n    What is the ruling on a woman seeking divorce from her \n    husband who uses drugs? What is the ruling on her staying with him? Please \n    note that there is no one who will provide for her and her children except \n    him. \n\n    He replied: \n\n    It is permissible for a woman to ask for a divorce from her \n    husband who is addicted to drugs, because her husband’s condition is not \n    acceptable. In this case, if she asks for a divorce from him, then the \n    children should stay with her, if they are younger than seven years, and the \n    father must spend on them. If she can stay with him to set him straight by \n    advising him, then that is better. End quote. \n\n    Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah \n    (2/745, 746). \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, a woman has the right to seek a divorce (Khula) if she finds herself in an intolerable situation, including one where her husband is addicted to drugs. Drug addiction can lead to various issues such as neglect, abuse, financial instability, and harm to the family’s well-being. \n\nThe conditions for a valid divorce can differ depending on the school of thought and specific circumstances, but here are several considerations:\n\n1. **Communication**: The woman should first attempt to address the issue with her husband, encouraging him to seek help for his addiction. Many scholars emphasize the importance of giving the spouse a chance to improve before pursuing divorce.\n\n2. **Seeking Help**: If the husband is willing, seeking counseling or treatment for his addiction can be beneficial for the marriage.\n\n3. **Islamic Grounds for Divorce**: If the husband's addiction is causing harm or is severely disrupting the marriage and family life, it can be considered valid grounds for divorce. The Islamic principle of compassion and the well-being of the family is paramount.\n\n4. **Legal and Community Guidance**: It may be beneficial for the woman to engage with a knowledgeable community leader or an Islamic scholar to guide her through the process and address her specific situation practically and religiously.\n\n5. **Islamic Law**: Under Islamic law, women have the right to initiate divorce (if the marriage contract allows for it) and are entitled to fair treatment, which includes the request for a divorce when experiencing harm.\n\nIn summary, if the situation is beyond repair and the addiction continues to pose a threat to her well-being or family stability, she may seek a divorce as permitted in Islam. Each case may be unique, so it is advisable for her to seek guidance from knowledgeable religious authorities."

        "question": "Muslim man marrying a chaste Christian woman",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islam does not prevent marriage to a Christian woman if she is chaste. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“…The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends…” [Al-Maa’idah 5:5]\nWhat is meant by chaste women is that they are free (not slaves) and chaste (not loose or immoral). \nSee also question no. 2527 \nBut if a woman is not chaste, and she has boyfriends or lovers with whom she is intimate, then Islam forbids marriage to her, whether she is a Muslim or a woman from among the People of the Book, just as it forbids marriage to a man who has girlfriends or lovers, to protect married life from collapse and to protect against mixing of lineages and to avoid causes of dispute, accusation and suspicion. \nWith regard to the Muslim husband attending marriage parties according to the Christian tradition, this is not permissible because there will be many things in these celebrations that are forbidden in Islam, such as free mixing between men and women, listening to music, drinking alcohol, dancing etc. \n \nIn the hadeeth the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him not sit at a table where wine is being drunk.” Narrated by Ahmad, 1/20; al-Bayhaqi, 7/366.

Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, a Muslim man is allowed to marry a chaste Christian or Jewish woman, as they are considered \"People of the Book\" (Ahl al-Kitab). This is based on verses from the Quran, specifically Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:5), which allows Muslim men to marry chaste women from these faiths provided certain conditions are met.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that:\n\n1. The woman should be chaste and of good character.\n2. The marriage should promote mutual respect and understanding, allowing for the practice of each partner's faith.\n3. The Muslim husband is encouraged to ensure that the upbringing of children is in accordance with Islamic values.\n4. Some scholars emphasize that it is preferable for a Muslim to marry within the faith to ensure unity in religious beliefs and practices.\n   \nOverall, while such marriages are permissible, the couple should be aware of the potential challenges that may arise from differing religious practices and beliefs.

        "question": "Who is the woman who is religiously committed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Advice to marry the woman who is religiously committed – who is the one who is religiously committed? \n(a)\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged marrying women who are religiously committed, as he said: “Women may be married for four things: their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may your prosper).” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5090; Muslim, 1466. \n‘Abd al-‘Azeem Abaadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWhat this means is that a man who is religiously committed and of noble character should make religion his focus in all things, especially with regard to long-term matters. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined finding a wife who is religiously committed, which is the ultimate goal. \n“may your hands be rubbed with dust” is urging him to strive hard and roll up his sleeves and seek that which is enjoined.  \n‘Awn al-Ma’bood (6/31). \n(b)\nWith regard to the attributes of religiously committed women, we may list many attributes which apply to women who are described as religiously committed. These include: \n1.     Sound belief  \nThis is the most important attribute. The woman who is from ahl al-sunnah wa’l-jamaa’ah will have achieved the highest and most precious characteristic of religiously-committed women, and the one who is a follower of bid’ah (innovation) and misguidance will not be one of the religiously committed women whom the Muslim is encouraged to marry, because of the bad effect that she will have on the husband or children, or on both. \n2.     Obedience to her husband, and not going against him if he enjoins something that is right \nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: It was said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Which of women is best? He said: “The one who makes (her husband) happy when he looks at her, obeys him when he tells her to do something, and does not disobey him with regard to herself or her wealth in a way that he dislikes.”\nNarrated by al-Nasaa’i (3131); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i. \nSo the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned together three important characteristics to be found in the good, righteous wife. They are:\n(i)                When he looks at her, he is happy with her religious commitment, attitude, behaviour and appearance.\n(ii)              When he is away from her, she protects his honour and his wealth.\n(iii)            If he tells her to do something, she obeys him, so long as he does not tell her to commit sin. \n3.     Helping her husband in his faith and religious commitment, telling him to do acts of obedience and stopping him from doing haraam things. \nIt was narrated that Thawbaan said: When there was revealed about silver and gold what was revealed, they said: So what kind of wealth should we acquire? ‘Umar said: I will find out about that for you. So he mounted his camel and caught up with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I was right behind him. He said: O Messenger of Allah, what kind of wealth should we acquire? He said: “Let one of you acquire a thankful heart, a tongue that remembers Allah and a believing wife who will help him with regard to the Hereafter.” \nNarrated and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi (3094). In another version it says: “who will help him with his faith.” Ibn Maajah (1856). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.   \nAl-Mubaarakfoori (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“A believing wife who will help him with his faith” means, with his religious commitment, by reminding him to pray, fast and do other acts of worship, and will keep him from committing zina and all other haraam deeds. \nTuhfat al-Ahwadhi (8/390). \n4.     She should be a righteous woman, and among the attributes of the righteous woman is that she is obedient to her Lord and fulfils her husband’s rights with regard to his wealth and herself, even when her husband is absent. \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity and their husband’s property)” [al-Nisa’ 4:34]. \nShaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  \n“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient” means: obedient to Allah, may He be exalted. \n“guard in the husband’s absence” means: they are obedient to their husbands and even in their absence they guard themselves and their husband’s wealth, seeking the help of Allah in that, because no one can do that by himself or herself, for the self is inclined towards evil, but the one who puts his trust in Allah, He will suffice him and help him in his religious and worldly affairs.\"(Tafseer al-Sa’di p. 177) \nIt was narrated that Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are four things that are essential for happiness: a righteous wife, a spacious home, a good neighbour and a sound means of transportation. And there are four things that make one miserable: a bad neighbour, a bad wife, a small house and a bad means of transportation.” \nNarrated by Ibn Hibbaan in al-Saheehah (1232); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (282) and Saheeh al-Targheeb (1914). \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  \nA righteous wife will be with her righteous husband for many years, and she is the one who is meant in the hadeeth in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “This world is temporary conveniences and the best of its comforts is a believing wife, who when you look at her she pleases you and if you tell her to do something she obeys you, and if you are away from her she protects you with regard to  herself and your wealth.”\n This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined when the Muhaajiroon asked him which kind of wealth they should acquire, and he said: “Let one of you acquire a tongue that remembers Allah, a thankful heart, and a believing wife who will help him with regard to the Hereafter.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi from Saalim ibn Abi’l-Ja’d, from Thawbaan. \nShe may offer the love and compassion that Allah speaks of in His Book, and the pain of separation may be harder for her than death in some cases, and harder than losing wealth or leaving one’s homeland, especially if one of them is fond of the other or they have children together who will be harmed by separation.  \nMajmoo’ al-Fatawa (35/299). \n5.     Good etiquette and knowledge \nIt was narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three who will be given a double reward: a man from among the people of the Book who believed in his Prophet, then lived to see the Prophet (S) and followed him and believed in him– he will have a double reward; and a slave who fulfils his duty towards Allah and towards his master – he will have a double reward; and a man who had a slave woman whom he fed and fed her well, and taught her and taught her well, then he set her free and married her – he will have a double reward.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (97) and Muslim (154). \nAl-Mubaarakfoori (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“and taught her” means he taught her good manners. \n“and taught her well” means teaching in a kind manner.  \nTuhfat al-Ahwadhi (4/218). \n6.     Doing acts of worship and obedience, and refraining from haraam things. \nThis is part of what being religiously committed means, that is mentioned in the saheeh hadeeth that we quoted at the beginning of our answer. \nAl-Khateeb al-Sharbeeni al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWhat is meant by religious commitment is acts of obedience and worship, and righteous deeds, and refraining from haraam things. \nMughni al-Muhtaaj (3/127). \nThe one who combines obedience to her Lord, doing the obligatory duties that are enjoined upon her, and avoiding the haraam things that she is forbidden to do, with obedience to her husband, has glad tidings from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that she will be highly honoured when she enters Paradise. \nAccording to the hadeeth: “If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (Ramadaan), guards her chastity and obeys her husband, it will be said to her: Enter Paradise by whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish.” Narrated by Ahmad (1664) and others; classed as hasan by al-Albaani because of another report in Saheeh al-Targheeb, as stated by al-Arna’oot in Takhreej al-Musnad. \n7.     She is a devout worshipper and one who fasts \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you __ Muslims (who submit to Allah), believers, obedient (to Allah), turning to Allah in repentance, worshipping Allah sincerely, given to fasting or emigrants (for Allah’s sake), previously married and virgins” [al-Tahreem 66:5] \nal-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “will give him instead of you, wives better than you Muslims” means who submit to Allah and obey Him. \n“believers” who believe in the Oneness of Allah (Tawheed). \n“obedient (to Allah)” means obedient, or it was said: who offer supplication (du’aa’), or who pray. \n“given to fasting or emigrants” those who fast often, or Zayd ibn Aslam said: women who migrated (for the sake of Allah), or it was said, who go with him wherever he goes.  \nTafseer al-Baghawi (8/168). \nThus it is known that “religious commitment” (deen) is a comprehensive word that includes different kinds of worship, obedience, characteristics and attitudes. It is essential to note that that which we have said of these qualities and deeds is not the same with all women, rather there are different degrees thereof, and that is well known. The more modest, knowledgeable and devoted to worship a woman is, the more desirable she is as a wife. \nWhatever the case, the woman who is religiously committed is the one who will help a man to protect his own religious commitment, and help him with regard to his Hereafter; she will make him happy when he looks at her and she will protect him when he is absent, and she will raise his children well. \nSee the answer to question no. 83777 for information on proposing to a girl who is religiously committed but not beautiful; you will find useful information there that is complementary to this answer. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, a woman who is religiously committed is often referred to as a \"Muminah\" (مؤمنة), which means a believer. This term signifies a woman who actively practices her faith, adheres to Islamic teachings, fulfills her religious obligations, and strives to develop her character in accordance with Islamic principles.\n\nAdditionally, women in Islam are encouraged to embody qualities such as piety (taqwa), sincerity (ikhlas), and devotion to Allah. Prominent examples from Islamic history include women like Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, the first wife of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and Aisha bint Abi Bakr, who was known for her intelligence and scholarship.\n\nReligious commitment can be demonstrated through daily prayers (Salah), fasting during Ramadan, giving charity (Zakat), and living a life of goodness and righteousness, contributing to both personal spiritual growth and the welfare of the community."

        "question": "She received a proposal from an engineer who works in a bank – should she accept?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    A woman should be keen to choose a righteous husband who will \n    fear Allaah with regard to her and will feed her and her children with \n    halaal income and help them to avoid that which is haraam. \n\n    Hence we appreciate this question from you, as it indicates \n    that you are concerned about this matter. We say: if the bank where this \n    person works is a riba-based bank which markets and sells its apartments and \n    buildings on the basis of riba, then it is not permissible to work there, or \n    to help it with its projects in any way whatsoever. \n\n    Similarly, it is not permissible to work in building \n    apartments or places for sin, such as leisure venues, places for gambling, \n    riba based banks and the like. \n\n    It is on this basis that this suitor should be accepted or \n    rejected. If his work is permissible and he is religiously committed and of \n    good character, then accept him. But if his work is haraam or he is not \n    religiously committed and of good character, then do not accept him, because \n    marrying him will result in harm that will affect you and your children. \n\n    We ask Allaah for guidance. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the decision to accept a marriage proposal involves several considerations, making it important to evaluate the individual's character, values, and compatibility rather than solely their profession. \n\n1. **Profession**: Working in a bank could be a concern if the bank is involved in transactions that go against Islamic principles, such as dealing with interest (riba). If the bank operates in accordance with Islamic finance principles (such as being a fully Islamic bank), that may be acceptable.\n\n2. **Character and Faith**: The character of the individual proposing is of utmost importance. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised that marriage should be considered based on piety and good character. If the engineer embodies these qualities and shares similar values and beliefs, it would be positive.\n\n3. **Consultation**: It is advisable for her to consult with her family or a trusted religious figure to seek guidance and ensure that the decision aligns with her beliefs.\n\n4. **Personal Readiness**: She should also reflect on her readiness and desire for marriage at this time.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be made with careful consideration of all these factors, ensuring that it aligns with her values and the teachings of Islam."

        "question": "Ruling on Caesarean births",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nCaesarean section is an operation in which the abdomen is cut in order to bring the child out of the mother. It is said that it is so called after Julius Caesar, because he was the first one to be born in this manner, when his mother died during labour, after which the doctor cut open her stomach and brought him out of her, and Caesar lived to become the emperor of Rome. \nSecondly:\nNatural childbirth is better for the mother, but this does not mean that Caesarean section should not be used when necessary. Among such cases of necessity are: when the placenta is in the lower part of the uterus (placenta praevia), when the foetus is deprived of oxygen, when there are tumours in the pelvis, when there is high blood pressure, when there is haemorrhaging that threatens the life of the mother and baby, when there are conjoined (“Siamese”) twins, when the foetus is abnormally large, and other cases of necessity where Caesarean section is indicated. This is one of the great blessings of Allah, an example of His mercy towards His creation. \nMany doctors take the matter of resorting to Caesarean section lightly, because they want to earn more money or because they cannot be patient with the mother during natural childbirth. Some women ask for this surgery in order to preserve the gracefulness of their bodies or so as to avoid the pain of childbirth. \nUndoubtedly doing this leads to the loss of numerous benefits, and also has effects on the mother and on future births, as referred to by the brother in his question. \nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nI would like to take this opportunity to point out a phenomenon that has been mentioned to us, which is that many obstetricians, male and female, in the hospitals are too keen for birth to take place by surgical means, which is known as a Caesarean. I am afraid that this may be a plot against the Muslims, because the more births take place in this manner, the more the skin of the abdomen is weakened and pregnancy becomes more dangerous for the woman, and she becomes unable to get pregnant. Some of the people who work in private hospitals have told me that many women come to the hospitals and their specialists tell them that there is no alternative to a caesarean,  then they go to this private hospital and give birth naturally. He mentioned that there were about eighty such cases in one month. This means that the issue is serious, and attention must be drawn to it. It should be noted that in this case some pain and exhaustion is inevitable. \n“His mother bears him with hardship. And she brings him forth with hardship” [al-Ahqaaf 46:15]\nIt is not something to be done as soon as the woman feels a contraction, so that she may avoid pain. Natural childbirth is better than a caesarean. End quote. \nLiqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftoohah (2/question no. 42). \nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: \nAllah says in Soorat ‘Abasa (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Then He makes the Path easy for him” [‘Abasa 80:20]\nSo Allah guarantees to make it easy for this newborn. Many men and women have noticed that there is haste in performing caesarean sections. Is this a sign of weak trust in Allah, may He be glorified and exalted? \nHe replied: \nI think that this method which people use nowadays when the woman feels the contractions and goes to the hospital, and they do a caesarean section for her, I think that this is inspired by the shaytaan, and that the harm caused is far greater than any benefits, because a woman is bound to feel pain when in labour, but this pain has a number of benefits: \n1 – It is an expiation for sin \n2 – It raises her in status if she is patient and seeks reward. \n3 – The woman understands the extent of the pain suffered by other mothers. \n4 – She will appreciate the extent of the blessing of good health that Allah bestows on her. \n5 – It will increase her love towards her child, because the more difficult it is to attain something, the dearer it becomes. \n6 – If the child is born by via the usual, well-known route, this is better for him and the woman. \n7 – Damage may be expected from this surgery, because this operation weakens the wall of the uterus etc, which may tear. And it may be successful or unsuccessful. \n8 – The woman who gets used to having caesareans is unlikely to give birth in the natural manner, because that is not possible, and there is the risk that the site of the surgery may rupture.\n9 – Having surgery results in having fewer children, because if the abdomen is cut three times in different places, it becomes weak and future pregnancy becomes dangerous. \n10 – This is a kind of luxury, and luxury is a thing that leads to doom, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  \n“Verily, before that, they indulged in luxury…” [al-Waaqi’ah 56:45]\nWomen should be patient and seek reward, and should continue to give birth in the natural way, because that is better for them in this world and in the Hereafter. Men should also pay attention to this issue, for we do not know, perhaps our enemies are the ones who have made these operations easy for us so that we will lose these benefits and be subject to these losses. \nQuestion: What is meant by luxury? \nAnswer: Luxury includes avoiding the natural pain of childbirth. This is a kind of luxury. If luxury does not help one to obey Allah, then it is either blameworthy or at the very least permissible. \nLiqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (86/question no. 17). \nTo sum up: Caesarean section should not be resorted to except in cases of necessity, when natural childbirth is not possible, or it poses a danger to the mother or the child. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, there is no explicit prohibition against Caesarean births (C-sections). In fact, the ruling is generally dependent on the circumstances surrounding the birth. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Health Considerations:** If a Caesarean section is deemed necessary for the health and safety of the mother or child, then it is considered permissible and even recommended. The preservation of life and health is a fundamental principle in Islam.\n\n2. **Consultation with Medical Professionals:** It is important for the pregnant woman to consult with qualified medical professionals to determine the best course of action based on her specific medical situation.\n\n3. **Islamic Principles:** Islam emphasizes the well-being of the mother and child. If a C-section is the safest option for delivery, it aligns with Islamic teachings prioritizing health and safety over natural childbirth.\n\n4. **Fatwa Variations:** Different scholars may have varying opinions based on their interpretation of Islamic texts, local customs, and medical context, so it is advisable to seek guidance from trusted and knowledgeable scholars or local authorities.\n\nIn summary, Caesarean births are generally considered acceptable in Islam, particularly when they are necessary for the health of the mother and the child."

        "question": "If he asks her to say “I accept So and so as a husband before Allaah”, does she become his wife?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is not a marriage, rather it is a deviation and calling it a marriage is lying and deceit. What you must do is cut off ties with this man who is toying with the rulings of Allaah, and regarding as permissible that which Allaah has forbidden. His claim that this is a marriage means that he regards it as permissible to do with you what a man does with his wife. Wouldn’t any adulterer on the face of the earth be able to do such a marriage with the immoral adulteress who is his partner in sin, so that she would be his wife and they would not be committing adultery?!  \nWe are afraid that he may gradually make you take off your hijab in front of him or do something even worse, and take a picture of you and try to threaten you with this picture. It is easy nowadays to combine pictures with one another and threaten you using these pictures if you do not do what he wants. Many such cases have happened. See the answer to question no. 91868 and learn a lesson from it. \nHow many heedless women have been gradually tricked in such ways by treacherous “wolves” until they lost their honour and chastity, then these men leave them, forgetting about the so-called marriage, and there is no maintenance and no rights, not even a divorce! \nIn a valid marriage it is essential that the woman’s guardian be present, along with two witnesses of good character from among the Muslims. Any marriage that is conducted without a guardian is invalid, and a woman who gives herself in marriage without her guardian is a zaaniyah (adulteress), as Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The one who gives herself in marriage is a zaaniyah.” Narrated by al-Daaraqutni.  \nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage except with a guardian and two witnesses.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ no. 7557. \nAnd he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who gives herself in marriage without the permission of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.” Narrated by Ahmad (24417), Abu Dawood (2083) and al-Tirmidhi (1102); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (2709). \nIts seems to us from your question that you fear Allaah, may He be exalted, and you do not want to fall into haraam and be exposed to the wrath of the Almighty. Hence we advise you strongly to forget about this man and to cut off all ties with him, via the internet or otherwise, for every word, smile and moment of desire will be recorded against you, and tomorrow you will be questioned about it before your Lord. So hasten to repent so that these sins will be erased. We ask Allaah to forgive you and to divert you away from this evildoer, and to protect the daughters of the Muslims. \nSee also questions no. 21933 and 84089. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, a marriage contract (Nikah) requires a few essential components to be valid. Among these components are the offer (Ijab) from one party and acceptance (Qabul) from the other party, preferably in the presence of witnesses. \n\nIf a man asks a woman to say, “I accept So and so as a husband before Allaah,” and she responds affirmatively, this can be considered a form of acceptance of the marriage proposal. However, for the marriage to be valid, other conditions must also be met, such as the presence of witnesses and the payment of the dower (Mahr), depending on the specific legal school of thought one is following.\n\nTherefore, while her verbal acceptance is a crucial part of the marriage process, additional conditions need to be fulfilled for her to officially become his wife in accordance with Islamic law. If these components are all met, then she becomes his wife. It is always advisable to consult with a knowledgeable scholar or authority in Islam for specific cases and further guidance."

        "question": "His father refuses to arrange his marriage until he has completed his studies",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It is mustahabb to hasten to get married for the one who is \n    able for it, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who \n    has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon \n    (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid‑servants \n    (female slaves)”\n\n    [al-Noor 24:32]\n\n    Ibn Katheer(may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on \n    this verse: This is a command to marry off those who need to get married. A \n    number of scholars are of the view that it is obligatory for everyone who is \n    able for it, and they quoted as evidence the apparent meaning of the words \n    of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “O young \n    men, whoever among you can afford to get married, then let him do so, for it \n    is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity. And whoever is \n    not able to do that, then let him fast, for that will be a shield for him.” \n    Narrated in al-Saheehayn from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood. \n\n    In is narrated in al-Sunan via more than one isnaad \n    that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: “Marry and produce offspring for I will be proud of your numbers \n    on the Day of Resurrection.” \n\n    Ayyim (translated here as “single”) refers to the woman who \n    has no husband or the man who has no wife, whether they were married then \n    separated or were never married. End quote. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    The son should tell his father clearly of his wish to get \n    married, and the father should understand the importance of that, and he \n    should help his son to get married. Many of the fuqaha’ are of the view that \n    that is obligatory if he is able for it. \n\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Our \n    companions said: The father must keep his son chaste if he is obliged to \n    spend on him and if he needs to be kept chaste.  This is the view of some of \n    the companions of al-Shaafa’i. End quote from al-Mughni (8/172). \n\n    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: A \n    person’s need to get married is urgent, and in some cases it may be like his \n    need for food and drink. Hence the scholars said: It is obligatory for the \n    one who has to spend on a person to arrange his marriage if he can afford to \n    get married, so it is obligatory for fathers to arrange the marriages of \n    their sons, if the sons needs to get married but cannot afford to do so. But \n    I heard that some fathers who forget how they were when they were young, \n    when the sons ask them to arrange their marriage, they say: Get married at \n    your own expense. This is not permissible and it is haraam if he able to \n    arrange his marriage. His son will dispute with him on the Day of \n    Resurrection if he does not arrange his marriage when he is able to do so. \n    End quote from Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (18/410). \n\n    A widespread mistake is when the father refuses to listen to \n    his son concerning this matter, and ignores the son’s need. His need for \n    marriage may be urgent, and as a result of delaying marriage he may fall \n    into some kind of deviation. It is well known that people vary with regard \n    to this need and their level of self-control in this matter. The father may \n    be sinning by preventing his son from getting married if he needs that, as \n    stated above. \n\n    Some fathers give precedence to study and work over marriage \n    in all cases, and they never consider arranging their son’s marriage before \n    that. This is also wrong. Rather they should study the matter and weigh up \n    the pros and cons. They should find out how much their son needs to get \n    married, and how able he is to combine marriage and study, and which should \n    be given priority if it is not possible to do both. Protecting one’s \n    religious commitment is important, and takes precedence over protecting \n    one’s physical health and wealth, so naturally it takes precedence over \n    studying. \n\n    Thirdly: \n\n    The father may be excused for refusing to arrange his son’s \n    marriage before he completes his studies, either because he sees that the \n    son is not well-organized in handling his affairs and cannot take \n    responsibility for himself, let alone anyone else, or he thinks that he is \n    neglecting his studies and would neglect them even more after marriage, or \n    he does not think that he really needs to get married, and it is only a \n    passing fancy or he wants to imitate someone else. The son should excuse his \n    father and strive to convince him, and explain to him the extent of his need \n    for marriage and how able he is to take care of his wife after that. \n\n    We ask Allaah to guide you. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is important to honor and respect parental authority, including their wishes regarding marriage. If a father is concerned about his child's education before allowing marriage, this is generally seen as a legitimate concern. Completing one’s studies can contribute to personal development and the ability to support a family in the future.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Respect for Parents**: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of respecting and obeying parents, as long as their requests do not contradict Islamic teachings.\n\n2. **Balancing Priorities**: Students can often find ways to balance their studies and personal life. It may be helpful to communicate openly with the father, expressing respect for his wishes while discussing the importance of marriage as well.\n\n3. **Seeking Knowledge**: Education is highly valued in Islam, and completing studies may also enhance one’s ability to be a good partner in marriage.\n\n4. **Patience and Understanding**: Patience is a virtue in Islam. It may be beneficial to focus on completing studies now while keeping future marriage plans in mind.\n\n5. **Dua (Supplication)**: In addition to these practical steps, making dua for guidance and easing this situation is always encouraged in Islam.\n\nUltimately, maintaining open communication with one’s parents about personal aspirations and showing respect for their decisions is essential. Seeking a thoughtful and respectful dialogue may help address the concerns both the father and child have regarding marriage and education."

        "question": "Ruling on one who forbids marriage for himself",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIt is not \n    permissible for anyone to forbid that which Allaah has made permissible, \n    such as women (marriage), food or anything else, because Allaah, may He be \n    exalted, said:  \n“O you \n    who believe! Make not unlawful the Tayyibaat (all that is good as regards \n    foods, things, deeds, beliefs, persons) which Allaah has made lawful to you, \n    and transgress not. Verily, Allaah does not like the transgressors”\n\n    [al-Maa’idah 5:87]\nSome of the \n    Sahaabah wanted to be celibate and keep away from women, but the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade them to do that, \n    and Allaah revealed this verse. \nIbn Jareer \n    narrated with his isnaad that Mujaahid (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \n    Some men, including ‘Uthmaan ibn Maz’oon and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr (may \n    Allaah be pleased with them) wanted to be celibate, and to castrate \n    themselves, then this verse was revealed.  \nAl-Bukhaari \n    (5074) and Muslim (1402) narrated that Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) forbade ‘Uthmaan ibn Maz’oon to be celibate. If he had \n    given him permission, we would have gotten ourselves castrated.  \nRemaining \n    celibate, getting castrated and regarding women as haraam are all haraam. \n    This is turning away from the Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), who got married and encouraged others to \n    get married. \nAl-Bukhaari \n    (5063) and Muslim (1401) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: Three people \n    came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) asking about the worship of the Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). When they were told, it was as if they \n    regarded it as too little. They said: Who are we in comparison to the \n    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? Allaah has forgiven his \n    past and future sins. One of them said: As for me, I will pray all night \n    forever. Another said: I shall fast all my life and never break my fast. \n    Another said: I shall keep away from women and never get married. The \n    Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came and \n    said: “Are you the ones who said such and such? By Allaah, I am the one who \n    fears Allaah the most among you and I am the most pious, but I fast and I \n    break my fast, I pray and I sleep, and I marry women. Whoever turns away \n    from my Sunnah is not of me.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5063) and Muslim \n    (1401).  \nThus is it \n    clear that no one has the right to forbid women (marriage) to himself. \nThirdly: \nWhoever has \n    done that has to repent to Allaah, may He be exalted, and he has to offer \n    expiation for breaking an oath, because Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \n“O \n    Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allaah has allowed to \n    you, seeking to please your wives? And Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most \n    Merciful.\n2. Allaah \n    has already ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths”\n    [al-Tahreem 66:1-2]\nAllaah has \n    described the forbidding of something permissible as an oath. \nSee: \n    al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (10/475). \nThe \n    expiation for breaking an oath is to free a slave, or to feed ten poor \n    persons with the average kind of food that he gives his own family, or to \n    clothe them. Whoever cannot do that must fast for three days. \nThis has \n    been explained in detail in the answer to question no. \n    45676. \nFourthly:  \nThe ruling \n    on marriage varies from one person to another, according to financial and \n    physical ability and how much a person needs to get married. In some cases \n    it is obligatory and in others it is mustahabb or makrooh. See question no. \n    36486. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is generally discouraged for a person to prohibit marriage for themselves without a valid reason. Marriage is viewed as a highly recommended and virtuous act in Islam, providing companionship, fulfilling one's physical and emotional needs, and allowing for the establishment of a family. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) encouraged marriage and stated that it completes half of one's faith.\n\nForbidding oneself from marriage without a legitimate reason, such as a commitment to a religious vocation (e.g., an Islamic scholar or dedicated service), is not considered commendable. Such self-imposed restrictions may sometimes stem from misunderstanding or misinterpreting the teachings of Islam regarding relationships and marriage.\n\nIf a person feels they cannot marry due to specific personal circumstances (such as financial issues or health problems), it is essential to seek guidance and consider the context rather than permanently forbidding oneself from marriage. It is advisable for individuals in such situations to consult with knowledgeable scholars or trusted advisors to discuss their feelings and challenges.\n\nOverall, while certain individuals may have valid reasons for delaying or refraining from marriage, asserting a blanket prohibition on oneself is generally not supported in Islamic teachings."

        "question": "Can a person with AIDS masturbate?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nA person who is a carrier \n    of the virus or who has AIDS may get married to a woman who is healthy or \n    who also has the disease, if she accepts that after coming to know of his \n    condition and to what extent he is affected, and they may agree not to have \n    children, or not to have intercourse. The husband may be masturbated by his \n    wife, and there is no sin on him for that. \nBut it is not permissible \n    for him to get married without informing the woman of his sickness, because \n    concealing it is deceit and is haraam. If he conceals it then the wife finds \n    out, she has the right to annul the marriage. \nSecondly: \nMasturbation is haraam, as \n    has been explained in question no.\n    329. \nBut if the person who has \n    AIDS cannot get married, and he is afraid that he may fall into zina \n    (fornication), it is permissible for him to masturbate, so as to choose the \n    lesser of two evils. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn \n    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard to ejaculating by \n    choice, if he masturbates with his hand, this is haraam according to most of \n    the scholars, and it is one of the two reports narrated from Ahmad, in fact \n    it is the more correct of the two. According to another report it is \n    makrooh, but if he is compelled to do that, such as one who fears that he \n    may fall into zina if he does not masturbate, or he fears that he may become \n    ill, then in this case there are two well known scholarly views and in this \n    case a number of the earlier and later scholars granted a concession, \n    whereas others forbade it. And Allaah knows best. End quote from \n    al-Fataawa al-Kubra (1/302). \nIt says in Sharh \n    al-Muntaha (3/366): Whoever masturbates with no need, man or woman, his \n    action is forbidden and he should be disciplined for that because it is a \n    sin. But if he does it for fear of committing zina or homosexuality, then \n    there is no punishment, and if he does it for fear of physical harm the same \n    applies, and more so. But it is not permissible for a man to masturbate with \n    his hand unless he is unable to get married, because if he is able to get \n    married there is no need for that. End quote.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the issue of masturbation is a debated topic among scholars, with differing opinions on its permissibility. However, when it comes to health concerns such as HIV/AIDS, there are some important considerations.\n\nFrom a medical perspective, individuals with HIV/AIDS can engage in masturbation safely, as it does not pose a risk of transmitting the virus. It can be a way to explore one's body and relieve sexual tension. However, it is essential for individuals to manage their health properly and consult with medical professionals regarding their condition.\n\nIslamically, if masturbation is viewed as permissible by an individual’s scholars, then a person with AIDS can partake in it as long as it does not lead to sinful thoughts or actions. It is important for individuals to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars in their community regarding spiritual and health-related matters. \n\nIn summary, the act itself may be viewed through different lenses in Islamic discourse, but from a health perspective, masturbation is generally considered safe for individuals with HIV/AIDS. Always consult both medical professionals and religious authorities for personal guidance."

        "question": "She is asking about marrying a man who plays soccer (football)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nPlaying soccer is permissible subject to certain conditions. \n1 – That it should not be for money, whether it is paid by the two teams, one of them or by a third party, because it is not permissible to give prizes except for competitions which help prepare one for jihad, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be no (money) prizes for competitions except archery competitions and races with camels and horses.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1700), al-Nasaa’i (3585), Abu Dawood (2575) and Ibn Maajah (2878); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. \nSome scholars added to these three anything that helps in jihad and propagating Islam, such as competitions in knowledge of Qur’aan, hadeeth and fiqh, in which is permissible to offer prizes. \nTherefore it is not permissible to give or take the prizes that are given to those who win soccer matches and tournaments between two or more teams, and they come under the heading of forbidden betting. \n2 – The game should not be accompanied by anything haraam, such as uncovering the ‘awrah. The man’s ‘awrah is the area from the navel to the knee, and it is well known that most of those who play this game uncover their thighs, but this is haraam and is not permitted. \n3 – The game should not lead to anything that is haraam, such as missing prayers, or missing Jumu’ah prayer or prayers in congregation. Unfortunately we say that many of those who play this game in clubs miss the prayers because of the matches. It is well known that delaying the prayer beyond its time with no excuse is a major sin, and it is narrated from a number of scholars that the one who does that deliberately is a kaafir, so we must be very careful. \nThis has to do with the game itself. But if there are tournaments on which money is spent and people are distracted by them, and waste time because of them, and they provoke factionalism and both Muslims and kaafirs, righteous and evildoers are glorified to the extent that a player becomes a role model for one’s sons and daughters, then this definitely should not be allowed, because among the ummah there are enough calamities, ignorance and backwardness to distract them from games on which millions of the people’s wealth are spent. \nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The basic principle concerning such games and sports is that they are permissible if they serve an innocent purpose, as was referred to by Ibn al-Qayyim in his book al-Faroosiyyah and as was mentioned by Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen Ibn Taymiyah and others. If that is done as training for jihad and attack and retreat, or for physical fitness, or to ward off chronic diseases and strengthen the spirit, then it comes under the heading of permissible things, if the one who does it has a sound intention. In all cases it is essential that there be no harm caused to bodies or minds, and that it does not lead to the grudges and hatred that usually occur between players, and that it does not distract them from things that are more important, and that it does not prevent them from remembrance of Allaah (dhikr) or prayer. \nBut whoever thinks about these sports as they are played nowadays will find that they are involve evil things which dictate that they should be disallowed, in addition to the fact that it is in the nature of the game to create factionalism and stir up resentment and hatred between the victors and the losers, this team and that team, as is quite apparent. They are also accompanied by physical danger for the players as the result of collisions and fisticuffs. Games hardly ever end without one of them breaking a bone or being injured or losing consciousness. This is why ambulances are always present. \nThe games also continue during the times of prayer, which results in people not praying or offering the prayer late. \nThe players also uncover their ‘awrah, which is forbidden. The man’s ‘awrah is the area from the navel to the knee. But you will find that their clothes end at mid-thigh, and some of them are shorter than that. It is well known that the thigh is part of the ‘awrah because of the hadeeth: “Cover your thigh for the thigh is part of the ‘awrah.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2797) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to ‘Ali: “Do not uncover your thigh and do not look at the thigh of anyone, living or dead.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (4015). And Allaah knows best. \nEnd quote from Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, vol. 8, question no. 1948. \nAnd he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nPlaying football nowadays is accompanied by reprehensible things which mean that playing it should be disallowed. These things may be summed up as follows: \n1 – It is proven to us that play continues during the times of prayer, which results in the players and spectators missing prayers or prayers in congregation, or they delay performing prayers until the time for them is over. Undoubtedly any action that interferes with performance of prayers on time or leads to missing prayers in congregation with no valid shar’i excuse is haraam.  \n2 – The nature of this game leads to factionalism, stirring up fitnah and hatred. These results are the opposite of what Islam promotes of tolerance, friendship and brotherhood, and cleaning hearts and souls of hatred, resentment and grudges.  \n3 – The game involves physical danger for the players as a result of collisions and injuries. Usually the players do not end the game without some of them falling on the pitch unconscious or with broken arms or legs. Nothing is more indicative of that than the fact that there must always be an ambulance present throughout the game.  \n4 – The purpose behind allowing sports is to make people become physically active and to train them for fighting and to ward off chronic disease. But playing football nowadays has no such aim. As well as the things mentioned above, it is now also taking people’s money for false purposes, let alone the danger of physical injury and the generation of hatred in the hearts of players and spectators, and the stirring up of fitnah. It has even gone so far that some spectators attack some players, which could go as far as murder, as happened in a match a few months ago. This alone is sufficient reason to disallow it. And Allaah is the source of strength. End quote.  \nHe also said: \nIf it is done in an organized manner [as in the clubs] it seems that it should be banned altogether, because people becomes deeply involved in it and that prevents people from remembering Allaah, and it more akin to gambling. They call it “sport” but it is just a game, and matters of jihad are not like this, and even if the players have some agility and nimbleness, they are not able to strive hard in any other field. \nIt also involves other things. Some of them offer prizes for it, and this is gambling. Islam does not allow prizes for anything except competitions which support the religion and strengthen one for that. If it strengthens Islam then it is permissible to engage in competitions. In the hadeeth it says: “There should be no (money) prizes for competitions except archery competitions and races with camels and horses.” And this applies by analogy with these three to anything that supports Islam. End quote. Question no. 1950. \nHe also said: As for one or two people playing with a ball in an unorganized fashion, there is nothing wrong with that, because it does not involve anything haraam. And Allaah knows best. End quote. Question no. 1949. \n Secondly: \nHaving established this, we do not advise you to marry this soccer player unless he gives it up, whether he is playing for a local club or a foreign one, especially since that will result in your moving to live with him in a kaafir country where there is the risk of temptation for oneself or one’s children, and it is difficult for a person to maintain his religious commitment in the environment of that game and in a kaafir country. \nYou may also refer to question no. 13363 for more information on living in the land of the mushrikeen. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the permissibility of marrying someone who plays soccer (football) is generally allowed, provided that the individual's character and behavior are in accordance with Islamic values. Islam encourages marriage for love, compatibility, and shared values.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Character and Conduct**: The man's character and adherence to Islamic principles should be a priority. If he maintains good ethics, respects others, and fulfills his religious obligations, then playing soccer does not negate his suitability as a husband.\n\n2. **Time Commitment**: Consider how his involvement in soccer may impact family life and religious duties. Balance is essential in Islam, so it’s important to ensure he prioritizes his responsibilities.\n\n3. **Environment and Influence**: Evaluate the environment of the sport. If he participates in an atmosphere that may lead to inappropriate behavior or goes against Islamic teachings, it may be a cause for concern.\n\n4. **Shared Values**: Ensure that both partners share similar values and visions for their future together, including family life, religious practices, and personal goals.\n\nUltimately, there is no inherent prohibition against marrying someone who plays soccer, as long as the individual conducts himself in a manner that is respectful and aligns with Islamic principles. It’s always helpful to seek counsel from knowledgeable individuals or religious leaders if there are any specific concerns."

        "question": "Ruling on marrying a sufi woman",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nSufis are of \n    various kinds with various schools of thought, most of which follow \n    innovation and deviant ways of various kinds. Some of them exceed the proper \n    bounds to the extent of associating others with Allaah, may He be exalted, \n    such as praying to the dead, turning to them to relieve distress and ward \n    off calamity. Some of them follow a great deal of innovation in their deeds, \n    in dhikr and in worship. See question no.\n    4983 for more \n    information on some of the deviations of the Sufis, and question no.\n    34817 for \n    information on shirk and its types. \nIt says in\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: Most of those who are called Sufis \n    nowadays follow innovations of shirk, as well as other innovations, such as \n    what some of them say, “Madad ya sayyid (Help, O Master)”and their \n    calling upon the aqtaab (highest ranking awliya’ or “saints”), reciting \n    dhikr in unison and calling upon Allaah by names that He has not called \n    Himself, such as “Huwa Huwa (He, He)” and “Ah, ah (a \n    contraction of the name of Allaah)”. Anyone who reads their books will \n    notice a lot of their innovations of shirk as well as other evils. End \n    quote. \nSecondly: \nMarriage to \n    a Sufi woman is subject to further discussion. \n1 – If she \n    is one of those who commits shirk in belief or in deeds, such as one who \n    believes that the awliya’ (“saints”) have knowledge of the unseen and have \n    control over the universe, or she believes in incarnation of the divine or \n    the unity of all things, or she devotes worship to something other than \n    Allaah, such as du’aa’, seeking help, sacrifices or vows, then it is not \n    permissible to marry such a woman, because she has committed major shirk – \n    Allaah forbid.\n2 – If she \n    has not fallen into shirk, but she does some acts of innovation such as \n    celebrating the Mawlid (Prophet’s birthday) or invented forms of dhikr, or \n    reciting a certain number of dhikrs for which there is no basis, or a \n    certain manner of dhikr that is not proven in sharee’ah, then it is better \n    not to marry such a woman, because the danger of innovation is great, and \n    the harm caused by it is severe. It is dearer to Iblees than sin, because \n    one may repent from sin, unlike innovation, for the one who does it regards \n    it as part of religion by means of which he may draw closer to Allaah, so \n    how can he give it up? Moreover, marriage to a woman who follows bid’ah \n    presents a danger to the children and to the whole family, especially if the \n    woman speaks well or is of a good attitude, so that others may be deceived \n    by her. Imam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Do not marry the \n    people of innovation, or give your womenfolk to them in marriage, or greet \n    them with salaam… al-Mudawwanah (1/84). \nThirdly: \nIf he did \n    not know that the woman was a follower of Sufism until he married her, then \n    if she is of the first type that commits shirk in word and deed and belief, \n    he should call her (to the proper way) and advise her and explain to her. If \n    she responds, then praise be to Allaah, otherwise it is obligatory to \n    separate from her, because it is not permissible to marry a mushrik woman or \n    to remain in such a marriage, because Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \n“And do \n    not marry Al-Mushrikaat (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allaah \n    Alone)”\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:221]\nBut if she \n    is of the second type, which does some innovated actions that do not reach \n    the extent of kufr, then each case should be examined separately – to what \n    extent does the woman adhere or not to the innovation that she believes in, \n    and what effect will that have on the household and the children? \nHe should \n    also look at the consequences of divorcing her, and he should do that which \n    is in the best interests of Islam in each case, and which will ward off harm \n    or reduce it as much as possible. \nMay Allaah \n    help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marrying a woman who identifies as a Sufi is generally permissible, as Sufism is considered a branch of Islamic spirituality. Sufis are often devoted to the pursuit of a deeper connection with God and may engage in practices such as dhikr (remembrance of God) and poetry. \n\nHowever, it's essential to consider the specific beliefs and practices of the individual Sufi, as various Sufi orders can have different interpretations and customs. As with any potential marriage, it's important to ensure that both partners share compatible values, beliefs, and practices.\n\nFrom an Islamic legal perspective, as long as the woman follows the fundamental tenets of Islam and does not engage in any practices that contradict the core teachings of Islam, marrying a Sufi woman is acceptable. The emphasis should always be on mutual respect, compatibility in faith, and shared understanding in the marriage relationship.\n\nAs with all important decisions, it's advisable for individuals to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars or trusted figures within their community to address any specific concerns they may have."

        "question": "She claims that she was divorced by her husband. Is it permissible to arrange her marriage without any proof of that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIf the woman \n    says that she was married then she got divorced and her ‘iddah ended, should \n    her word be accepted or is it essential to have proof to confirm that she is \n    divorced? There is a difference of opinion among the scholars concerning \n    that. \nSome of them \n    say that her word should be accepted and she should be believed, because she \n    is responsible for herself.  \nOthers say \n    that if it is thought most likely that she is telling the truth, it is \n    permissible to believe her. \nOthers make \n    a distinction between one who is a stranger and one who is living in her own \n    city. The word of the former should be accepted ,whereas the one who is in \n    her own city should not get married until proof of her divorce is brought. \nSome of them \n    make a distinction between her telling of her divorce from a specific \n    husband, such as saying, “So and so married me then he divorced me” and her \n    speaking of marriage to an unspecified person. In the former case it is \n    essential to bring proof that she has been divorced by him. \nThere \n    follows a brief look at the comments of the fuqaha’: \nIt says in\n    al-Mabsoot (5/151): If she says: My husband divorced me or died, and \n    my ‘iddah has ended, it is permissible for her fiancé to marry her and \n    believe her, because the issue of halaal and haraam is something that is \n    determined by sharee’ah and every Muslim is responsible for himself and his \n    words may be accepted with regard to issues that are decided by sharee’ah, \n    but his word is not to be accepted with regard to someone else if the other \n    person says that he is lying. Hence it is permissible to accept her word \n    concerning that. And Allaah knows best what is correct. End quote. \nIt says in\n    al-Habr al-Raa’iq (4/64): He indicated that the word of a divorced \n    woman may be accepted when he said: If a (previously) married woman said to \n    another man: My husband divorced me and my ‘iddah has ended, then it is \n    permissible for him to believe her if he thinks it most likely that she is \n    telling the truth. End quote. \n‘Aleesh \n    al-Maaliki (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked, as it says in Fath \n    al-‘Aliy al-Maalik fi’l-Fatwa ‘ala Madhhab al-Imam Maalik (2/78): What \n    is your opinion about a woman who came from Fayyoom to al-Qalyoobiyyah and \n    says: I was married in al-Fayoom, and my husband divorced me two months ago, \n    and she has a document confirming a divorce, dated and sealed with the seal \n    of the qaadi in the city where she used to be, and she wants to get married \n    after her ‘iddah ends based on the date of the document. May she be allowed \n    to do that? Please answer.  \nThe answer \n    was: Praise be to Allaah and peace and blessings be upon our Master \n    Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah. Yes, she may be allowed to do that \n    because she is to be believed in her claim to be divorced and her claim that \n    the ‘iddah has ended in the manner described, especially since her claim is \n    supported by the document from the qaadi. This is what is indicated by the \n    texts. But further proof should be established because of what we see \n    nowadays of many women cheating and having several husbands at once. We ask \n    Allaah to keep us safe and sound. End quote. \nAl-Zarkashi \n    said in al-Manthoor fi’l-Qawaa’id (1/171): If she says: My husband So \n    and so divorced me and my ‘iddah is over, and she asks the judge to conduct \n    a marriage for her, in Adab al-Qadaa’ by al-Dubayli it says: If she \n    is a stranger and her (former) husband is absent, then her word should be \n    accepted with no proof or oath. If the husband is in the same city and she \n    is not a stranger, then the judge should not conduct a new marriage until \n    her claim has been proven. \nIn Fasl \n    al-Tahleel, al-Raafa’i said that her word should be accepted if it is \n    plausible, and he quoted from Fataawa al-Baghawi: If a man and a woman \n    appear before the qaadi, and she asks him to marry her to this man, and says \n    that she was the wife of So and so but he divorced her or died, the qaadi \n    should not proceed with the marriage until proof of the divorce or death has \n    been established, because she has admitted to being married to So and so. \n    End quote. \nAl-Ramli \n    al-Shaafa’i was asked about a woman who said that her husband So and so \n    divorced her or died, and her ‘iddah has ended; can the judge conduct her \n    marriage without any proof? He replied that the judge cannot conduct her \n    marriage until proof of what she says has been established, because she \n    admitted to being married and marriage in principle is still valid (unless \n    there is evidence to the contrary). This is unlike the case if she admits \n    having been married without specifying a person.  This is what is indicated \n    by what al-Dubayli said in Adab al-Qadaa’, [and he quoted the words of \n    al-Zarkashi mentioned above], and what al-Qaadi mentioned in his fatwa that \n    if the woman claims that her husband has died or has divorced her in front \n    of her wali, and the wali denies it, she may swear an oath and the judge may \n    tell him to arrange her marriage, or the judge may arrange her marriage. \n    (3/161). \nHe also said \n    (3/153): To conclude: if a woman claims that she is divorced from a specific \n    marriage, the judge should not let her remarry until it has been proven. If \n    the marriage is not specified then he may accept her word, and there are \n    other views on this issue. End quote. \nIt seems \n    that caution is required in this matter, especially at times of corruption \n    and when there have been many incidents in which marriage contracts have \n    turned out to have been done for women who are already married and are \n    lying. But the judge still has the right to make the decision in such cases. \n    If he thinks that her word is acceptable, he may arrange her marriage, and \n    if he thinks otherwise he should ask her for proof, or he does not think \n    that she is telling the truth, he should not conduct her marriage until the \n    divorce has been proven. \nWhat is done \n    now is that the qaadi or registrar does not conduct the marriage of a woman \n    who is proven to have been married before and claims that she is divorced, \n    until she brings proof of the divorce. We do not know how the marriage \n    contract with the man mentioned was done. \nSecondly: \nIf there is \n    some doubt as to whether the woman is divorced or if she is still married to \n    her first husband, then the sons of the person in question should strive to \n    ask about her and her first husband. If it is proven that she was not \n    divorced from her first husband, then their father must be told about that \n    and the couple must be separated until her ‘iddah from both is over. The \n    matter should be referred to the qaadi to decide on the matter, and it is \n    not permissible for them to be quiet if they know about that, because \n    marriage to a woman who is already married to someone else before she gets \n    divorced and completes her ‘iddah is an invalid marriage, and the one who \n    does that is committing zina if he knew the real situation. \nBut here we \n    should point out two things: \n1 – The \n    children should respect their father and recognize his status and not offend \n    him by speaking of this matter. If we assume that they found out something \n    reprehensible, they should look for a suitable means of advising their \n    father, and if they ask someone else to intervene that is better, so to \n    avoid offending him and to preserve the love that exists between them. \n2 – The \n    motive for this doubt and accusing should not be hatred of their father’s \n    wife because she is a foreigner or because their father married her when he \n    was old, or for some other reason that is not hidden from the Knower of the \n    unseen, may He be glorified. Let them speak good words and beware of \n    accusing one who is innocent; they should try to think in positive terms and \n    refrain from saying anything that may hurt them or their father, so long as \n    there is nothing that they cannot keep silent about. \nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever intercedes \n    to prevent one of the hadd punishments of Allaah has opposed Allaah in His \n    command; and whoever dies owing a debt, it is not (going to be settled by) \n    dinars and dirhams, but rather by good and bad deeds; and whoever argues \n    about falsehood knowingly will remain subject to the wrath of Allaah until \n    he gives it up; and whoever says something about a believer that is not \n    true, Allaah will cause him to dwell in the mud of the juice of the people \n    of Hell  until he recants what he said.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (5129) from \n    the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him).  Classed as \n    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. \nMay Allaah \n    help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic law, the validity of a divorce (talaq) is significant when considering a woman's eligibility for remarriage. If a woman claims to have been divorced, it is generally advisable to confirm her claim, especially if the divorce was not documented or witnessed.\n\n1. **Verification**: If possible, it is best to have clear evidence or confirmation of the divorce from the husband to ensure there are no legal issues later. This may include written documentation or credible witnesses.\n\n2. **Trustworthiness**: If the woman is known to be trustworthy and has a good reputation, her claim may be accepted without additional proof, based on her word alone. \n\n3. **Counseling**: It may be beneficial to counsel the woman to seek clarification from her husband or to attempt to obtain a formal divorce certificate to avoid any potential complications.\n\n4. **Consent**: If there are no grounds to doubt her claim, then facilitating her marriage could be considered permissible, but it remains prudent to ensure that all parties involved are aware of her situation.\n\n5. **Consult with Scholars**: Whenever uncertainty exists, it is advisable to consult with knowledgeable scholars or an imam for guidance tailored to the specifics of the situation.\n\nOverall, while it may be permissible under certain conditions, emphasizing clarity and verification regarding her marital status is essential in upholding the principles of justice and sincerity in Islamic marriage."

        "question": "Should he marry someone who is above him in terms of social status?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIf a man is \n    able to provide the mahr (dowry) and can afford the expenses of marriage and \n    the maintenance of his wife and household, then he is compatible with her, \n    according to the majority of scholars, both those who regard wealth as a \n    condition of compatibility, such as the Hanafis and Hanbalis, and those who \n    do not, such as the Maalikis and the Shaafa’is according to the more correct \n    view among them. \nAs for the \n    view that the husband must be rich on the same level as the wife, this is a \n    less correct view that was held by some of the fuqaha’. \nBut the \n    correct view, based on the evidence, is that compatibility does not matter \n    except with regard to religious commitment, as is the view of Maalik (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said: Chapter on the ruling of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) on compatibility in marriage. Allaah, may He be exalted, \n    says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O \n    mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into \n    nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most \n    honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At‑Taqwa [i.e. he \n    is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]”\n\n    [al-Hujuraat 49:13]\n“The \n    believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic religion)”\n\n    [al-Hujuraat 49:10]\n“The \n    believers, men and women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, supporters, friends, \n    protectors) of one another”\n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:71]\nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no \n    superiority of an Arab over a non-Arab, or of a non-Arab over an Arab, or of \n    a white man over a black man, or of a black man over a white man, except in \n    terms of taqwa. The people are from Adam, and Adam is from dust.” Narrated \n    by al-Tirmidhi (3270); classed as hasan by al-Albaani. \nIn \n    al-Tirmidhi (1085) it is narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose religious \n    commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your female relative \n    under your care) to him, for if you do not do that there will be tribulation \n    in the land and great mischief.” They said: O Messenger of Allaah, even if \n    he is such and such? He said: “If there comes to you one with whose \n    religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your female \n    relative under your care) to him,” three times. Classed as hasan by \n    al-Albaani. \nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Banu Bayaadah: \n    “Give (your female relative) to Abu Hind in marriage and ask for his \n    daughters in marriage” and he was a cupper. \nThe Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married Zaynab bint Jahsh \n    al-Qurashiyyah to his freed slave Zayd ibn Haarithah, and he married \n    Faatimah bint Qays al-Fahriyyah al-Qurashiyyah to Usaamah, the son of Zayd, \n    and he married Bilaal ibn Rabaah to the sister of ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf. \nAllaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Good \n    statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people \n    for good statements (or good men for good women)”\n[al-Noor \n    24:26] \n“then \n    marry (other) women of your choice”\n[al-Nisa’ \n    4:3]\nWhat is \n    implied by the ruling of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) is that attention should be paid to compatibility in religious \n    commitment first and foremost. So a Muslim woman should not be given in \n    marriage to a kaafir, or a chaste woman to an immoral man. The Qur’aan and \n    Sunnah do not pay attention to any compatibility beyond that. It is haraam \n    for a Muslim woman to marry an evil adulterer. No attention is paid to \n    lineage, profession, wealth, or whether the man is free or a slave. It is \n    permissible for a lowly slave to marry a free woman of noble birth, if he is \n    chaste and Muslim. And it is permissible for a non-Qurashi to marry a \n    Qurashi woman, and for a non-Haashimi to marry a Haashimi woman, and for \n    poor men to marry rich women. \nAnd he said: \n    The fuqaha’ differed as to the definition of compatibility. Maalik said, \n    according to the apparent view of his madhhab, that it refers to religious \n    commitment. According to a report narrated from him: It means three things: \n    Being similar in terms of religious commitment; both being slaves or both \n    being free; and compatibility with regard to physical soundness. End quote \n    from Zaad al-Ma’aad (5/144). See also al-Mughni (7/27) and \n    al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (34/271). \nSecondly: \nSocial level \n    may refer to lineage, wealth, education, profession or job, or it may mean \n    all of them. \nIf a man’s \n    religious commitment and character are pleasing, then he is compatible with \n    the woman, no matter what her social level, according to the more correct \n    view, as noted above. This is the basic principle and the ruling of \n    sharee’ah. But it remains to examine the situation of each suitor and \n    whether he is suitable to marry one whose social level is above him, or \n    not. \nIt seems – \n    and Allaah knows best – that if the difference is great in terms of lineage, \n    wealth, education and profession, that it is not advisable to go ahead with \n    this marriage, because there are usually problems from the woman or her \n    family. There may be differences in lifestyle and the ways in which they do \n    things, which may put the spouses off one another. \nBut if the \n    difference is small, or it has to do with one area but can be made up for in \n    another area, then there is nothing wrong with it in that case, such as if \n    the husband is poor but he is highly qualified, or he is qualified for a \n    decent job, or some of his family are of high standing and so on. \nThen there \n    are cases in which the woman and her family are so righteous that they are \n    above looking at material concerns and measuring people thereby, and they \n    may want to choose a husband who is poor because of his righteousness and so \n    on. But it is better if the husband is the one who is of a higher status.   \nWhatever the \n    case, the precise advice in each case depends on complete knowledge of both \n    parties and their families. Perhaps you can seek advice from someone whom \n    you trust in your community. \nWe ask \n    Allaah to help you and guide you. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the choice of a spouse is an important decision and should be based on various factors, including religious commitment, character, and mutual respect. Social status, while it may be a consideration in some cultural contexts, is not the primary criterion for marriage in Islam.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized that the best criterion for choosing a spouse is their piety and good character. In a Hadith, he said: \"A woman is married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty, and her religion. So choose the one who is religious, may you be blessed!\" (Sahih Bukhari).\n\nMarriage should be founded on mutual understanding, love, and respect, rather than solely on social status. If someone is considering marrying someone of a higher social status, they should focus more on compatibility in values, beliefs, and personality rather than the social hierarchy. Overall, individual circumstances and the compatibility of the couple matter most. It is advisable to consult with family and seek guidance through prayer (Istikhara) for a wise decision."

        "question": "Is he obliged to attend the waleemah when there is someone there who will offend him with his words and actions?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIf the \n    waleemah is for a wedding, then it is obligatory to attend it, for the one \n    who is invited personally, according to the majority of fuqaha’. \nBut if the \n    invitation is general, and he is not invited by name, then he does not have \n    to attend. \nIbn Qudaamah \n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: There is no \n    difference of opinion among the scholars concerning the fact that it is \n    obligatory to attend a waleemah for the one who is invited to it, so long as \n    there is no idle entertainment in it. This is the view of Maalik, \n    al-Shaafa’i and Abu Haneefah. \nIt was \n    narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger \n    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If one of \n    you is invited to a waleemah, let him attend.” According to another version: \n    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    said: “Accept this invitation when you are invited.” Abu Hurayrah said: “The \n    worst of food is the food of a waleemah to which the rich are invited and \n    the poor are ignored. Whoever does not attend has disobeyed Allaah and His \n    Messenger.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. \nWhat is \n    meant – and Allaah knows best – by the words “the worst of food is the food \n    of a waleemah” is the food of a feast to which the rich are invited and the \n    poor are ignored. It dos not mean that the food of any waleemah is the worst \n    of food. \nBut it is \n    only obligatory to attend for one who is invited specifically, when a man or \n    a group is invited by name. But if someone issues an invitation and says, “O \n    people, come to the waleemah,” it is not obligatory to respond, and it is \n    not mustahabb to do so. Rather it is permissible to accept because one is \n    included in the general invitation. End quote from al-Mughni \n    (7/213). \nSecondly: \nIf there are \n    people at the waleemah who will cause offence, it is not obligatory to \n    attend. This is an excuse not to attend. \nThis was \n    stated by some of the fuqaha’. In that case he has to apologize to the one \n    who gave the invitation, or attend for a short while and leave quickly. \nIt says in\n    Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (7/430), where the conditions of it being \n    obligatory to accept an invitation are mentioned: There should not be in the \n    place where he is to attend anyone who will offend the invited one by means \n    of outward hostility or destructive envy (hasad), or anyone with whom it is \n    not appropriate to sit, such as vile and despicable people. End quote. \nThirdly: \nIf the \n    waleemah is not for a wedding, it is not obligatory to attend, even if one \n    is especially invited to it. \nIbn Qudaamah \n    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/218): The ruling \n    on accepting invitations to circumcision waleemahs and all other invitations \n    except to weddings, is that it is mustahabb, because it involves offering \n    food to people. But accepting the invitation is mustahabb, not waajib \n    (obligatory). This is the view of Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, and Abu Haneefah and \n    his companions. End quote. \nBased on \n    this, there is no sin on you if you do not attend these waleemahs, if they \n    are not for weddings. \nFourthly: \nFor a woman \n    to uphold ties of kinship with her brothers and sisters is something that is \n    confirmed in sharee’ah, because of the commands to uphold the ties of \n    kinship that are mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and the prohibition on \n    severing those ties. This upholding of family ties may be achieved through \n    visits, phone calls and asking after family members, depending on what one \n    is able to do. \nYou should \n    not fall short in this great act of worship, and not let your brothers’ \n    coldness and lack of kindness push you to do that. You will be rewarded for \n    upholding ties with them, even if they fall short towards you, because the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who \n    upholds the ties of kinship is not the one who reciprocates, rather the one \n    who upholds the ties of kinship is the one who upholds those ties even if \n    his relatives cut him off.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5645). \nThe one who \n    reciprocates his relatives, and returns favours and treats them well if they \n    treat him well, is not the one who is upholding ties of kinship as required \n    by sharee’ah. Rather the upholding of kinship ties that is required in \n    sharee’ah is that which involves treating relatives well even when they \n    treat you badly.  \nBut if \n    meeting often will cause annoyance, there is no sin in reducing the \n    frequency, whilst remaining in touch at infrequent intervals or by phone, \n    etc. \nBut it is \n    better to hasten to remove the misunderstanding between you and your \n    brothers, and try hard to improve your relationship with them. That is \n    better for all of you in this world and in the Hereafter. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, attending a waleemah (wedding feast) is generally considered a Sunnah (recommended act) for those who are invited. However, if a person fears that their attendance will lead to harm or offense, such as being insulted or provoked by someone present, they have the right to decline the invitation. \n\nIslam encourages maintaining one's dignity and protecting oneself from harm. If attending the waleemah would lead to discomfort or conflict, it is permissible to excuse oneself from attending. It's important, however, to consider the feelings of the hosts and the context of the situation. If possible, one might choose to attend briefly or find ways to manage the situation while still being respectful to the hosts.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be made based on the specific circumstances and what one believes will lead to the least harm while upholding Islamic principles. Consulting with a knowledgeable person or seeking advice from trusted peers can also be beneficial in such situations."

        "question": "Is she sinning by attending wedding parties that involve reprehensible things if she sits far away and helps them with cooking etc?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    It is not permissible to attend wedding parties that include \n    reprehensible things such as singing accompanied by drums or other musical \n    instruments, apart from the daff, or mixing between men and women, or other \n    evils, except for one who is able to denounce that and thinks it most likely \n    that he will be able to put a stop to the evil by denouncing it. \n\n    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person \n    is invited to a waleemah in which there is sin, such as alcohol and musical \n    instruments, etc, and he can denounce it and put an end to the evil, then he \n    must attend and denounce it, because then he will be fulfilling two \n    obligations: accepting the invitation of his Muslim brother and putting a \n    stop to evil. But if he is unable to denounce it, then he should not attend. \n    If he does not know of the evil until he gets there, then he should put a \n    stop to it, and if he is not able to, then he should leave. Something \n    similar to this was said by al-Shaafa’i. End quote from al-Mughni, \n    7/214. \n\n    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: If the \n    wedding party is free of evils such as mixing between men and women, \n    promiscuous singing and so on, or if she attends she will be able to change \n    the evils, then it is permissible for her to attend in order to share in the \n    joy. Rather attendance is obligatory if there is some evil that she is able \n    to put a stop to. \n\n    But if the party involves evils that she cannot denounce, \n    then it is haraam for her to attend, because of the general meaning of the \n    verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And leave alone those who take their religion as play and \n    amusement, and whom the life of this world has deceived. But remind (them) \n    with it (the Qur’aan) lest a person be given up to destruction for that \n    which he has earned, when he will find for himself no protector or \n    intercessor besides Allaah”\n\n    [al-An’aam 6:70]  \n\n    “And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. \n    music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, \n    and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur’aan) by way of \n    mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell‑fire)”\n\n    [Luqmaan 31:6]\nAnd there are very many \n    ahaadeeth which condemn singing and musical instruments. End quote from \n    Fataawa al-Mar’ah, compiled by Muhammad al-Musnad, p. 92 \nSecondly: \nIf your going to the \n    wedding and taking part in the cooking etc will not result in your listening \n    to the evils, or approving of them or helping in them, such as if the place \n    where the evil actions are being committed is far away from you, or you will \n    be able to leave before they start the reprehensible actions, then there is \n    nothing wrong with your going in that case, but you should offer them advice \n    and explain to them the rulings on these evils, and tell them that it is \n    haraam to take part in them. \nIn his commentary on the \n    verse (interpretation of the meaning):  \n“And it has already \n    been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the \n    Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until \n    they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) \n    certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect \n    the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:140]\nal-Qurtubi (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: “then sit not with them, until they engage in a \n    talk other than that” means, talk other than kufr; “certainly in that \n    case you would be like them”. This indicates that it is obligatory to \n    avoid those who commit sin if they openly commit an evil action, because \n    whoever does not avoid them is approving of what they are doing, and \n    approving of kufr is itself kufr. Allaah says “certainly in that case you \n    would be like them”. So whoever sits in a gathering where sin is \n    committed and does not denounce it has a burden of sin just like them. \nThey should be denounced \n    if they speak of or do sinful things; if a person is not able to denounce \n    them, then he should get up and leave them, so that he will not be one of \n    those mentioned in this verse. End quote. \nAl-Sa’di (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said: \nThis also includes \n    attending gatherings where sin and immorality take place, where the commands \n    and prohibitions of Allaah are taken lightly and the limits that He has set \n    for His slaves are transgressed. It is forbidden to sit with them “until \n    they engage in a talk other than that”, i.e., other than disbelieving in \n    the verses of Allaah and mocking them. “certainly in that case” \n    means, if you sit with them in those circumstances, “you would be like \n    them” because you have approved of their kufr and mockery of Islam, and \n    the one who approves of a sin is like the one who does it. \nTo conclude, the one who \n    attends a gathering in which Allaah is disobeyed is obliged to denounce them \n    if he is able to, or to leave if he is not.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, attending events that involve reprehensible actions or activities (such as music or mixing of genders inappropriately) can be problematic. If a person attends a wedding where such activities take place, even if they are not participating directly but are helping with cooking or sitting far away, it is still a matter of concern.\n\nThe principle in Islam is to avoid environments where sinful activities are taking place, as it can be a means of being influenced by those actions or condoning them. The scholars emphasize the importance of maintaining one's piety and steering clear of situations that could lead one to sin or diminish their Islamic values.\n\nIf the wedding is known to have elements that are clearly against Islamic teachings, it would be advisable for her to refrain from attending, even if her intentions are to assist. However, if she believes her presence can guide or influence positively, it might be a different scenario, but one must exercise extreme caution.\n\nUltimately, she should consult a knowledgeable scholar or imam she trusts for personalized guidance based on her specific situation. It’s important to weigh the factors involved, including the nature of the event, the activities taking place, and her personal ability to maintain her values in that environment."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islam encourages us to have many children, and the Prophet of Allah Shu’ayb (peace be upon him) reminded (his people) of this blessing and said to them: “And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied you” [al-A’raaf 7:86]. And it was narrated from Ma’qil ibn Yasaar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the nations.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2050; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. See also question no. 13492. \nBeing sterilized permanently may mean one of two things: \n1 – It may be done out of necessity, such as if it is determined by trustworthy medicinal evidence that pregnancy will pose a danger to the mother’s life, and there is no hope of a cure, so permanent sterilization will ward off that danger. In this case it is permissible to be sterilized. \n2 – When there is no need for it. Undoubtedly in this case it is a criminal act and a major sin, because it is a transgression against the creation of Allah for no reason, and preventing the production of offspring which was encouraged by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and being ungrateful for the blessing of children which Allah bestows upon His creation. \nIt says in al-Insaaf: It says in al-Faa’iq: And it is not permissible to do anything that will put a stop to pregnancy. (1/383). \nThe Islamic Fiqh Council stated the following in its report no. 39 (1/5): \nIt is haraam to sterilize both men and women, if there is no necessary reason for doing so unless there is a necessity which is to be determined according to the guidelines set out by sharee’ah. It is permissible to take temporary measures to space pregnancies or prevent them for a limited period of time, if there is a legitimate shar’i need to do so, so long as this decision is made on the basis of mutual consultation and approval between the spouses. That is subject to the condition that no harm should result from that, and that the means should be acceptable according to sharee’ah, and that there should be no harm caused to an existing pregnancy. End quote. \nBased on this, if your preventing pregnancy is for a legitimate reason as outlined above, then you do not have to do anything. But if it was not for a necessary reason, then you have done something which is haraam, and you have to repent sincerely to Allah and stop taking these injections immediately. If there is anything that will reverse their effect without causing harm, then you must take it.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the topic of infertility treatments, including the use of injections to prevent pregnancy, involves several considerations. Generally, the permissibility of such actions depends on the intent and the circumstances surrounding them.\n\n1. **Reversible Methods:** If the injections are a reversible contraceptive method, many scholars may consider it permissible as long as there is a valid reason. Common valid reasons could include health issues, financial concerns, or the ability to care for children.\n\n2. **Permanent Solutions:** If the injections are intended to cause permanent infertility (which would be the case with certain types of long-term contraceptives or sterilization methods), scholars differ in their opinions. Many scholars argue that permanently preventing childbirth without valid justification may not be permissible. It is important for individuals to seek guidance based on their specific circumstances and intentions.\n\n3. **Intention:** The intention behind taking such measures is very important in Islam. If the intention is to preserve health, manage family size responsibly, or due to current life situations, it may be viewed more favorably.\n\n4. **Consultation:** It is advisable for individuals considering such medical interventions to consult knowledgeable scholars or a trusted Islamic authority who can provide guidance based on personal circumstances and specific medical advice.\n\nUltimately, it's encouraged to engage in open discussions with family and health professionals, as well as seeking counsel from knowledgeable religious advisors to ensure that decisions align with Islamic principles."

        "question": "She wants to marry a man who has a contagious disease",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It states in sharee’ah that the Muslim should not expose \n    himself to harm. \n\n    That includes mixing with a person who has a contagious \n    disease, especially if that disease is serious and chronic, such as herpes. \n\n    The rulings of sharee’ah are addressed to everyone, sick and \n    healthy alike. \n\n    With regard to the one who is sick, Muslim (2221) narrated \n    from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The owner of \n    sick camels should not bring them to the healthy ones” – lest the disease be \n    transmitted to the healthy ones. \n\n    With regard to the one who is healthy, the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Flee from the leper as \n    you would flee from a lion.” Narrated by Ahmad, 9429; classed as saheeh by \n    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7530. \n\n    Leprosy is a well-known contagious disease – we ask Allaah to \n    keep us safe and sound. \n\n    Muslim (2231) narrated from ‘Amr ibn al-Shareed that his \n    father said: Among the delegation from Thaqeef there was a leper.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is a significant commitment that involves various considerations, including the health and well-being of both partners. If a woman is considering marrying a man who has a contagious disease, here are some important points to consider:\n\n1. **Informed Consent**: It is essential that both parties are fully informed about the man's health condition. Open communication is crucial in any marriage.\n\n2. **Health Considerations**: The nature of the contagious disease matters. If the disease is manageable and the woman is aware of the risks and the necessary precautions, she can make an informed decision. In some cases, medical advice may be necessary to understand the risks involved.\n\n3. **Compatibility and Support**: Marriage in Islam is also about compassion, care, and mutual support. If the woman feels equipped to handle the challenges that may arise from her husband's condition, and both feel a strong emotional and spiritual connection, this can influence her decision positively.\n\n4. **Seeking Guidance**: It is advisable for her to seek guidance from knowledgeable individuals (such as religious scholars or family members) and to pray for clarity in her decision.\n\n5. **Intention and Commitment**: If her intention is to support her husband and build a life together, and if both are committed to making the marriage work despite the challenges, this can be a strong basis for their relationship.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be made with careful consideration of all factors involved, keeping in mind the principles of Islam regarding compassion, social responsibility, and the well-being of all parties involved."

        "question": "He wants to get married but his parents want him to delay that",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It is narrated in al-Bukhaari (5065) and Muslim (3384) that \n    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to us: “O young men, whoever among you \n    can afford to get married, let him do so, for it is more effective in \n    lowering the gaze and preserving chastity. Whoever cannot afford it, let him \n    fast, for that will be a shield for him” – i.e., it will reduce and weaken \n    his desire. \n\n    Based on this, if a person can afford to get married then he \n    should hasten to do so, because of the many benefits that this brings, as \n    mentioned by the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \n    namely it helps him to lower his gaze and protect his chastity, increases \n    the numbers of the ummah and offers protection against temptation and \n    mischief. \n\n    Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “If I only \n    had ten days left to live and I knew that I was going to die on the last of \n    them, and I could afford to get married, I would get married, for fear of \n    fitnah (temptation).” \n\n    Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Celibacy has \n    nothing to do with Islam at all.” \n\n    If you fear hardship for yourself and that you may and fall \n    into sin, then in that case it is obligatory for you to get married. \n\n    In this case parents are advised to arrange their son’s \n    marriage and not to stand in the way of his remaining chaste and protecting \n    himself from temptation. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: “With regard to marriage, people fall into three \n    categories. Some of them fear that they may fall into sin if they do not get \n    married, in which case it is obligatory to marry, according to the view of \n    most of the fuqaha’, because this will make a person remain chaste and \n    protect him from committing haraam actions; the only way to do is to get \n    married.” \n\n    Al-Mughni, 9/341. \n\n    You have to deal gently and kindly with your parents and try \n    to convince them of your need to get married, and tell them that this will \n    never conflict with what they want for you in the future. You can also seek \n    the help of wise people among your relatives to convince your parents. \n\n    The questioner is to be commended for not going out to places \n    of fitnah (temptation) and not fulfilling his desires by haraam means. We \n    ask Allaah to make you steadfast and to help you to find a good wife who \n    will be a delight to you and your parents, for He is Ever-near and \n    Responsive.\n\n    And Allaah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the institution of marriage is highly valued, and it is encouraged for individuals to marry when they reach a suitable age and are able to fulfill the responsibilities that come with it. If someone wishes to get married but faces opposition from their parents, it is important to approach the situation with wisdom and understanding.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Respect for Parents**: Islam places great emphasis on maintaining good relations with parents and showing them respect. It is essential to listen to their concerns and understand their reasons for wanting to delay the marriage.\n\n2. **Open Communication**: Initiating a respectful dialogue with parents can help clarify any misunderstandings. Discuss your readiness for marriage, your plans, and how you intend to approach the responsibilities that come with it.\n\n3. **Seeking Guidance**: Encourage your parents to seek guidance from knowledgeable individuals, such as an Imam or a trusted family member, who can provide perspective on the importance of marriage and the appropriate timing.\n\n4. **Balancing Rights**: While parents have rights over their children and their concerns should be taken seriously, it is also important to balance this with personal readiness and Islamic teachings about marriage.\n\n5. **Prayer and Supplication**: Engage in prayer (dua), asking Allah for guidance and assistance in finding a way that pleases Him and aligns with both your desire to marry and your parents' concerns.\n\n6. **Patience and Understanding**: If the delay is necessary for valid reasons, practice patience and show understanding. Continue to demonstrate to your parents that you are responsible and have considered the implications of marriage.\n\nUltimately, if the individual feels strongly about marrying at that time and believes they are ready, they should continue to communicate openly with their parents and seek a resolution that honors both their desire to marry and their parents' wishes."

        "question": "There is nothing wrong with a woman wearing a white wedding dress",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with a woman wearing a white wedding dress on condition that she does not appear in it in front of men who are not her mahrams, because usually wedding dresses are adorned and decorated, and we have already stated in the answer to question no.  39570 that one of the conditions of women’s hijab is that it should not be an adornment in and of itself. \nIt is also essential that this dress does not reveal any of the woman’s charms, even if she is only going to appear in front of women in it. See question no.  6569 and 34745. \nWith regard to it being the dress of kaafir women, that is not the case. Rather many Muslim women nowadays, if not most of them, wear this kind of dress. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: \nWhat is the ruling on a woman wearing white for her wedding as it is known that this is an imitation of the kuffaar? \nHe replied: \nIt is permissible for a woman to wear white so long as it is not in the same form as men’s clothing. With regard to it being an imitation of the kuffaar, that is no longer the case, because now all Muslim women wear such clothes when they are getting married. The ruling depends on whether the reason for it is present or not. If it is no longer an imitation of the kuffaar and this has now become something that is common to both Muslims and kaafirs, then the ruling no longer applies, unless something is haraam in and of itself and not because it is an imitation of others. Such things are haraam in all cases. \nMajmoo’at As’ilat tahumm al-Mar’ah, p. 92.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, there is no specific prohibition against women wearing a white wedding dress, and many cultures, including Muslim communities, have adopted white as a symbol of purity and celebration. The choice of wedding attire often varies based on cultural traditions and personal preferences.

        "question": "Attending wedding parties which involve some evils",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.1 – It is not permissible to attend wedding parties that involve evil actions, such as singing that is accompanied by music or that includes indecent words. The fact that this is widespread among people does not mean that it is permissible and should not be denounced. \n2 – Not attending these parties is not regarded as severing the ties of kinship, rather it is protecting oneself from seeing or hearing evil. Your family and relatives should understand that you would be keen to attend and take part, were it not for the evil things that they do. \n3 – If a person who is invited to such an event knows that there will be evil things happening and that he is not able to denounce them, it is not permissible for him to attend. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/214): If a person is invited to a wedding feast in which evil things will take place, such as wine, musical instruments, etc, and he is able to attend and remove those evils, then he must attend and denounce them, because then he will be fulfilling two duties: accepting the invitation of his Muslim brother and removing evil. But if he is not able to denounce them then he should not attend. If he does not know about the evils until he gets there, he should remove them. If he cannot, then he should go away. Something similar was stated by al-Shaafa’i. \nIt says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: \nIf wedding parties are free of evils such as men mixing with women and indecent songs, or if you attend then these evils will be changed, then it is permissible to attend, so as to share in the occasion of joy. Rather it is obligatory to attend if there is some evil that you can remove. \nBut if there are evil things in these parties that you cannot denounce, then it is haraam to attend them because of the general meaning of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And leave alone those who take their religion as play and amusement, and whom the life of this world has deceived. But remind (them) with it (the Qur’aan) lest a person be given up to destruction for that which he has earned, when he will find for himself no protector or intercessor besides Allaah” [al-An’aam 6:70] \n“And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur’aan) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire)”\n[Luqmaan 31:6]\nAnd because of the many ahaadeeth which condemn singing and musical instruments. \nFrom Fataawa al-Mar’ah, compiled by Muhammad al-Musnad, p. 92. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, attending wedding parties that involve actions or activities contrary to Islamic teachings, such as sinful behavior, inappropriate mixing of genders, music deemed haram (forbidden), and other immoral practices, can be problematic.\n\nIslam places a strong emphasis on maintaining ethical conduct and adhering to the principles of modesty and morality. If a wedding party includes activities that promote sin or lead to actions that are not in line with Islamic values, it would be advisable for a Muslim to avoid attending.\n\nHowever, if the wedding is conducted in a manner that is compliant with Islamic principles, it can be considered permissible to attend, as it allows for the support of family and friends, strengthens community bonds, and celebrates a significant life event in a way that is consistent with Islamic ethics. \n\nIt's always recommended to consult knowledgeable scholars or personal imams to address specific situations, as individual circumstances may vary."

        "question": "The reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married ‘Aa’ishah despite the age difference",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) after he married Sawdah bint Zam’ah (may Allah be pleased with her). She – ‘Aa’ishah – was the only virgin whom he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married. And he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine years old. \nAmong her virtues was the fact that the Revelation did not descend when he under one cover with any of his wives other than her. She was one of the dearest of all people to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and news of her innocence was revealed from above the seven heavens. She was one of the most knowledgeable of his wives, and one of the most knowledgeable women of the ummah as a whole. The senior companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to refer to her opinion and consult her. \nWith regard to the story of her marriage, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had grieved over the death of the Mother of the Believers Khadeejah, who had supported him and stood by his side, and he called the year in which she died The Year of Sorrow. Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married Sawdah, who was an older woman and was not very beautiful; rather he married her to console her after her husband had died and she stayed among mushrik people. Four years later the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and he was over fifty. Perhaps the reasons for the marriage were as follows: \n1 – He saw a dream about marrying her. It is proven in al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her: “You were shown to me twice in a dream. I saw that you were wrapped in a piece of silk, and it was said, ‘This is your wife.’ I uncovered her and saw that it was you. I said, ‘If this is from Allah then it will come to pass.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 3682). As to whether this is a prophetic vision as it appears to be, or a regular dream that may be subject to interpretation, there was a difference of opinion among the scholars, as mentioned by al-Haafiz in Fath al-Baari, 9/181. \n2 – The characteristics of intelligence and smartness that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had noticed in ‘Aa’ishah even as a small child, so he wanted to marry her so that she would be more able than others to transmit reports of what he did and said. In fact, as stated above, she was a reference point for the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) with regard to their affairs and rulings. \n3 – The love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for her father Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), and the persecution that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) had suffered for the sake of the call of truth, which he bore with patience. He was the strongest of people in faith and the most sincere in certain faith, after the Prophets. \nIt may be noted that among his wives were those who were young and old, the daughter of his sworn enemy, the daughter of his closest friend. One of them occupied herself with raising orphans, another distinguished herself  from others by fasting and praying qiyaam a great deal… They represented all kinds of people, through whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was able to set out a way for the Muslims showing how to deal properly with all kinds of people. [See al-Seerah al-Nabawiyyah fi Daw’ al-Masaadir al-Asliyyah, p. 711]. \nWith regard to the issue of her being young and your being confused about that, you should note that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) grew up in a hot country, the Arabian Peninsula. Usually in hot countries adolescence comes early and people marry early. This is how the people of Arabia were until recently. Moreover, women vary greatly in their development and their physical readiness for marriage. \nIf you think – may Allah guide you – that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not marry any virgin other than ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and that all his other wives had been previously married, this will refute the notion spread by many hostile sources, that the basic motive behind the Prophet’s marriages was physical desire and enjoyment of women, because if that was his intention he would have chosen only those who were virgins and beautiful etc.    \nSuch slanders against the Prophet of Mercy (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by kaafirs and others of their ilk, are indicative of their inability to find fault with the law and religion that he brought from Allah, so they try to find ways to criticize Islam with regard to issues that are not related to sharee’ah. \nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. \nFor more information see Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/106.",
        "predicted_answer": "The marriage of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) to ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) is understood within the context of 7th-century Arabian society, where such marriages were not uncommon and were often influenced by various social, political, and personal factors.\n\nSeveral reasons can be noted regarding this marriage:\n\n1. **Cultural Context**: In the time and culture in which the Prophet lived, marriages often occurred at younger ages than what is commonly accepted today. This was a norm in many societies throughout history.\n\n2. **Divine Wisdom**: Muslims believe that the actions of the Prophet were guided by divine wisdom. His marriage to ‘Aa’ishah served to strengthen ties with her family (the powerful and respected Abu Bakr) and allowed for significant bonds of kinship within the early Muslim community.\n\n3. **Role in Islamic History**: ‘Aa’ishah became an important figure in Islamic history after the Prophet’s death, known for her intelligence, knowledge, and narrative of many hadiths (sayings and actions of the Prophet). Her contributions to the development of Islamic jurisprudence and scholarship were significant.\n\n4. **Personal Affection**: Historical accounts indicate that the Prophet and ‘Aa’ishah shared a loving relationship, characterized by mutual respect and affection. Their marriage provided a strong partnership in both personal and public matters.\n\n5. **Educational Influence**: ‘Aa’ishah was pivotal in educating others about the Prophet’s teachings. Her youth at the time of their marriage allowed her to engage actively in the transmission of knowledge for many years.\n\nIn discussions about this topic, it's important to approach it with a recognition of the historical and cultural context and regard the significance of the relationship in the early Muslim community."

        "question": "Does Islam Encourage Large Families?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Blessings of having children\nAbu Dawud (2050) narrated that Ma’qil ibn Yasar said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “I have found a woman who is of good lineage and is beautiful, but she does not bear children. Should I marry her?” He said, “No.” Then he came again with the same question and he told him not to marry her. Then he came a third time with the same question and he said: “Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 1784). \nThis hadith indicates that it is encouraged to marry women who are fertile, so that the numbers of the ummah will increase, and so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will feel proud of his ummah before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children. \nWill you be rewarded for having children?\nAl-Ghazali said that when a man gets married, intending thereby to have children , that this is an act of worship for which he will be rewarded because of his good intention. He explained that in several ways: \n\nThis is in accordance with what Allah wants, which is to perpetuate the human race. \nSeeking the love of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in having many children, so that he will feel proud of them before the other Prophets and nations on the Day of Resurrection. \nSeeking barakah (blessing) and a great deal of reward, and forgiveness of sins through the du`a of a righteous child after one dies. \n\nHaving children was the hope of the Prophets and Messengers\nIt is well known that since ancient times children have been the hope of the Prophets and Messengers and all of the righteous slaves of Allah, and that will continue to be the case so long as man’s innate nature (fitrah) remains sound. Children are a blessing whom people love and on whom they pin their hopes. \nIbrahim (peace be upon him) prayed to his Lord, saying (interpretation of the meaning): \n“My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous” [al-Saffat 37:100]\nAnd Allah says of Zakariyya (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): \n“When he called out to his Lord (Allah) a call in secret.\nHe said: ‘My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble, and grey hair has spread on my head, and I have never been unblest in my invocation to You, O my Lord!\nAnd verily, I fear my relatives after me, and my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an heir.\nWho shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya’qub (Jacob) (inheritance of the religious knowledge and Prophethood, not of wealth). And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are Well-Pleased!’\n(Allah said) ‘O Zakariyya (Zachariah)! Verily, We give you the glad tidings of a son, whose name will be Yahya (John). We have given that name to none before (him)’” [Maryam 19:3-7]\nAllah praises His righteous slaves in many ways, such as when He said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqun (the pious)’” [al-Furqan 25:74]\nAnd Allah tells us that Shu’ayb (peace be upon him) commanded his people to remember Allah’s blessing to them when He made them many after they had been few. He said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied you” [al-A’raf 7:86]\nHe regarded their being multiplied after they had been few as a great blessing which obliged them to obey Allah and obey His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nUndoubtedly the benefits of increasing the nation’s offspring are obvious to everyone who thinks about the matter. Hence nations who understand this matter have been keen to encourage their people to increase their numbers and also to make their enemies reduce their numbers by means of specious arguments and sometimes by using means that lead to infertility and having few children, by means of drugs, contaminated food stuffs that reduce fertility and so on. This is one of the means of war used against the Muslim ummah by its enemies. \nWe ask Allah to ward off the evil of those who disbelieve and to thwart their plots against the Muslims. \nFor more, please see this category: Fiqh of the Family\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Islam encourages the growth of families and values having children, as children are regarded as a blessing in many teachings of the Quran and Hadith. The Quran mentions the importance of procreation and the blessings that children bring to families. \n\nA few points to consider include:\n\n1. **Procreation as a Blessing**: Children are often mentioned in the Quran as a sign of Allah's mercy and a source of joy. For example, in Surah Al-Kahf (18:46), wealth and children are described as a test and a source of joy.\n\n2. **Encouragement of Marriage**: Islamic teachings highly value marriage, which is seen as a means to create a family. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) encouraged marriage, stating that it is part of his Sunnah and advised his followers to marry and have children.\n\n3. **Balance and Responsibility**: While having children is encouraged, Islam also emphasizes the responsibility of parents to provide for their offspring, both financially and morally. It is important to consider one’s capability to raise children properly.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices**: Different cultures within the Muslim world may have varying practices and family sizes, influenced by social, economic, and health factors. \n\nIn summary, while Islam does encourage having children and sees family as a significant element of life, it also emphasizes the responsibility that comes with parenting.

But if you do not fear that you may commit zina, then you should give priority to performing the obligatory Hajj and ‘Umrah over marriage. \nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, both marriage and Hajj hold significant importance, but they serve different purposes and fulfill different needs in a Muslim's life. \n\n**Marriage** is considered a Sunnah (a practice of the Prophet Muhammad) and is highly encouraged. It is viewed as a means of fulfilling one's natural desires, achieving companionship, and establishing a family, which plays a vital role in the social fabric of the Muslim community. The Prophet Muhammad said, \"Marriage is part of my Sunnah; whoever does not follow my Sunnah is not of me.\" (Ibn Majah)\n\n**Hajj**, on the other hand, is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and is obligatory for every Muslim who is physically and financially able to perform it at least once in their lifetime. It is a significant act of worship that holds immense spiritual reward and serves to cleanse the soul, promote unity among Muslims, and strengthen one's faith.\n\nIn evaluating which is better, it often depends on individual circumstances. For someone who is not yet married and has the means to perform Hajj, fulfilling this obligation may take precedence. However, for someone seeking companionship, marriage may be the more appropriate focus at that time.\n\nUltimately, both are important in a Muslim's life, and the relative priority can vary based on individual situations.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islam forbids a woman to get married without a wali (guardian), and it regards a marriage contract done without a wali as invalid. A kaafir cannot be the wali of a Muslim woman, so if none of her family are Muslims, then the leader or mufti of the Muslims, or the imam of the Islamic center, should stand in as her wali. \nIbn Qudaamah said: A kaafir cannot be the wali of a Muslim woman under any circumstances, according to scholarly consensus. \nAl-Mughni, 7/356 \nWe have discussed all of the above, with evidence and the comments of the scholars, please see the answers to questions no. 7989 and 2127. \nSo the marriage contract is not valid, and it must be annulled and you have to keep away from your husband. The husband has to repeat the marriage contact in the manner prescribed in sharee’ah, if he wants to be married to you. Try to get some good and righteous people to intervene and convince him to do that, and to correct his mistake, as this is in your interests and the interests of your child. If he does not respond, then our advice is to forget about him, because his words are not the words of a trustworthy man. His saying that he is “not ready for marriage” indicates that he only wanted to have intercourse with you, and he did not want to adhere to the commands and laws of Allaah, and the commands to be the protector and maintainer of his wife.  \nSee also the answer to question no. 13501 \nIt is not permissible for him to tell you to have an abortion, and it is not permissible for you to have an abortion if the foetus has reached the stage where the soul has been breathed into it. If you do that you will be killing a soul. \nSee also questions no 12118 and 13319 and 4038. \nWith regard to the child, it is valid to call him after his father and he is not regarded as an illegitimate child, rather the scholars regard him as the child of a marriage contract with some faults in it, and the child born of such a marriage is to be attributed to his father. See al-Mughni, 11/196 \nRemember that Allaah has guaranteed provision for His slaves, and has promised that whoever fears Allaah, He will give him a way out. \nSo fear Allaah, put your trust in Him and repent to him… Part of repenting means separating from this man, because the marriage contract is invalid, for there is no marriage without a wali, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. And when you do that you will be doing it only because it is the command of Allaah.  \nKnow that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him or her with something better… May Allaah give you strength and make things easy for you. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, a valid marriage contract (nikah) requires the presence of a wali (guardian) for the bride. The role of the wali is to ensure the marriage is in the best interest of the bride and that her rights are protected.\n\nIf a woman marries without the consent of a wali, the validity of that marriage can be contested depending on the school of thought. Some scholars consider such a marriage to be invalid, while others may view it as valid under certain circumstances.\n\nIf she wishes to repeat the marriage contract with the same husband but he refuses, there are a few considerations:\n\n1. **Consultation with Scholars**: The woman should seek advice from knowledgeable scholars or an Islamic authority in her area to discuss her specific situation and the implications of her initial marriage without a wali.\n\n2. **Attempt Reconciliation**: If the couple wishes to continue their relationship, they might try to discuss the matter openly. The husband may need to understand the importance of having a wali in accordance with Islamic teachings.\n\n3. **Possible Alternatives**: If the husband still refuses to repeat the contract and the situation remains unresolved, the woman may have to consider her options, which could include moving on from the relationship if it is deemed that her marriage lacks the required conditions to be valid.\n\nUltimately, it is crucial to act in accordance with Islamic teachings while considering the individual circumstances of both parties involved. Seeking the guidance of a knowledgeable and trusted scholar is recommended for personalized advice."

        "question": "She wants to marry a student like her and her family doesn’t agree",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah mercy on him) was asked a \n    similar question and said: \nThe ruling on that is that it is contrary to the command of the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose \n    religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry [your daughter or female relative under your care] to him.” Undoubtedly your \n    father’s preventing you from marrying one who is suitable is something that is haraam. Marriage is more important than study, and it does not mean \n    that you cannot study, because the two can be combined. What I advise my brothers who are the guardians of women to do, is to let them complete \n    their studies; a woman may stipulate as a condition of her marriage that she be able to continue studying until her studies are complete. \nFataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/704-705. \nSecondly: \nWith regard to what you mention about the situation of the one who has proposed \n    marriage and that he is still a student, being a student is not regarded as an impediment to marriage if he can afford to get married and to spend \n    on his wife on a reasonable basis. \nBut if his being a student means that he cannot afford to get married and spend on \n    his wife – apart from the unreasonable demands that some families make in the conditions that they stipulate – this is addressed by the words of \n    Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves \n    chaste, until Allaah enriches them of His Bounty”\n[al-Noor 24:33]\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: In this verse, Allaah commands everyone who is \n    unable to get married and cannot find any means of doing so to keep himself chaste, because the most common obstacle to marriage is lack of money. \n    So Allaah promises independence of means by His bounty, so that He will provide what one needs to get married or to find a woman who will accept a \n    small mahr, or else remove from him the desire to marry.” Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 12/242 \nIt should be noted that the mahr and maintenance are the rights of the woman, not \n    of her guardians. She has the right to agree to a little and to marry one whom she knows is poor, but it has to be pointed out that many woman may \n    agree to marry a man even though he is poor when he proposes to her, then shortly after marriage the woman may start to complain, and that leads \n    to arguments and divorce. This should be taken into consideration. \nThirdly: \nWe advise families and guardians not to be an obstacle to keeping their daughters \n    and female relatives chaste because of the unreasonable conditions that they stipulate regarding spending on the basis that they want to be \n    reassured about their daughters’ future. This puts off the men who want to marry them, which leads to them being left on the shelf and the evils \n    that result from that, especially nowadays when fitnah (temptation) is so widespread. Thus they harm themselves and their daughters when their \n    intention is to do good. \nWe ask Allaah to set the affairs of the Muslims straight. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is a significant and serious matter that involves both personal choice and family consultation. If a woman desires to marry a student who is like her but faces opposition from her family, there are several important steps she can consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: She should engage in open and respectful dialogue with her family. Understanding their concerns can help in addressing them. It's essential to listen to their perspective and share her feelings regarding the potential partner.\n\n2. **Respect for Family**: Islam places a high value on familial ties and respect for parents. Even if she feels strongly about her choice, maintaining a respectful attitude towards her family’s views is crucial.\n\n3. **Seeking Counsel**: It may be beneficial to involve a trusted elder or family member who can mediate and provide insights to both the woman and her family. Sometimes an external perspective can help to resolve disagreements.\n\n4. **Consideration of Compatibility**: Islam encourages looking for compatibility in a marriage. If the family is concerned about certain aspects of the student (such as his background, character, or religion), those factors should be thoughtfully considered.\n\n5. **Praying for Guidance**: It is also encouraged to pray for guidance (Salat al-Istikhara) to seek Allah’s direction in the decision-making process.\n\n6. **Freedom of Choice**: Ultimately, while family approval is important, a woman in Islam has the right to choose her spouse. If the partner is suitable and the marriage is in accordance with Islamic principles, she can stand firmly for her choice while still trying to maintain family harmony.\n\nIn conclusion, it’s vital to balance her desires with respect for her family, seeking understanding and resolution through communication, and ultimately making a decision that aligns with Islamic values."

        "question": "Ruling on a woman letting a man know that she wants to marry him",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with a woman letting a man know that in principle, however the woman should not propose herself, rather it is better if that is done via her wali (guardian) or someone else who can let the man know. This is indicated by the fact that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) offered his daughter Hafsah in marriage to Abu Bakr and ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with them).",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the approach to courtship and marriage is guided by principles of modesty, respect, and proper etiquette. A woman expressing her interest in marriage to a man can be a sensitive matter and is generally approached with caution.\n\n1. **Direct Communication**: It is permissible for a woman to indicate her interest in marriage, as long as it is done in a respectful manner and does not compromise her modesty or reputation. This could involve the woman expressing her hope or intention through her family or in a context that is appropriate and public, rather than privately or in a way that could lead to temptation or inappropriate interactions.\n\n2. **Role of Guardians**: It is recommended that a woman involves her wali (guardian), usually her father or a close male relative, in the process of seeking marriage. This aligns with the Islamic concept of family and community involvement in marital decisions.\n\n3. **Modesty and Respect**: Any communication should maintain the principles of hijab (modesty) and respect. Engaging in open romantic pursuits outside the framework of marriage is discouraged in Islam.\n\n4. **Mutual Interest**: If the man is also interested, this could lead to a formal proposal. If the man does not reciprocate the interest, the woman should respect his decision without pressure or insistence.\n\nUltimately, the specifics can vary based on cultural practices and individual circumstances, and it is always recommended to seek guidance from knowledgeable individuals in one's community or local scholars."

        "question": "Can a woman look for her life partner herself?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThe Muslim woman must know that she is obliged to wear hijaab and observe proper Islamic hijaab at all times. It is not permissible for a woman to make a wanton display of herself (tabarruj). Tabarruj is a major sin for which the one who does it deserves the wrath and punishment of Allah.  A woman, as the saying goes, is a jewel, and when she is shown to people and makes a wanton display of herself she loses her value. \nSo I advise the questioner and every Muslim woman to adhere to proper Islamic hijaab, which is pleasing to Allah and is an act of obedience to Him, and is a means of Allah guiding His slave and making things easier for him. \nSecondly: \nWith regard to marriage, it may be obligatory if a man or woman longs for marriage and fears falling into immoral ways. It is also the Sunnah of the Prophets (peace be upon them). \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad), and made for them wives and offspring” [al-Ra’d 13:38]\nThirdly: \nThere is a difference between a Muslim woman looking for a husband and her mixing with and talking to men for that purpose, and meeting by accident a man who she thinks is a potential husband. The former is contrary to modesty, for a woman is required to be of modest character and shy, which is an adornment and beauty for women; the virgin is the epitome of modesty as it says in the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him): “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to be more shy than the virgin in her seclusion, and if he disliked something it would be known from his face.” \nNarrated by al-Bukhari, 5751; Muslim, 2320 \nA woman can do something better than that, which is to make du’aa’ asking Allah to give her a good and righteous husband. Du’aa’ is one of the best things with which a Muslim may equip himself and the best way in which a Muslim may seek to meet his needs. She can also speak to some of her Muslim sisters whose religious commitment and honesty she trusts to tell her of someone who can tell a young Muslim man who wants to get married about a Muslim girl. This is better than her doing something that is contrary to modesty. \nFourthly: \nUndoubtedly the one who told you to take off the hijab and that that is better than wearing it is wrong. How can a woman give up her religious commitment and hijab and ignore something that Allah has enjoined upon her and said that if she forsakes it then she will deserve the wrath and punishment of Allah and will not be granted His support? \nThe Muslim woman must adhere to this virtue which many Muslim women have forsaken, for it is the symbol of the Muslim woman, a sign of her commitment, sincere faith and piety.   \nI advise the sister to fear Allah and to adhere to hijab, and Allah will help her and make her life easier for her. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, in Islam, a woman is permitted to search for her life partner. Traditionally, marriage is a significant and personal decision, and both men and women have the right to express their preferences and choose their spouses. \n\nIslam encourages mutual consent and respect in the process of seeking a partner. While family involvement and guidance can be beneficial, a woman can take the initiative to find and select someone whom she believes is compatible with her values, beliefs, and aspirations. It is recommended that such choices be made with the consideration of Islamic principles and the intention of forming a family based on love, respect, and understanding."

        "question": "‘Azl (coitus interruptus) and using birth control pills",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly, what the Muslims should do is to try to have as many \n    children as they can, because this is the command of the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: “Marry the one who is loving \n    and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the nations.” \n    (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2050; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh \n    Abi Dawood, 1805). \n\n    Having more children increases the numbers of the ummah, and \n    increasing the numbers of the ummah is a source of its glory, as Allaah \n    says, reminding the Children of Israel of His blessings: \n\n    “and made you more numerous in man-power”\n\n    [al-Isra’ 15:6 – interpretation of the meaning]\n\n    And Shu’ayb said to his people: \n\n    “And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied \n    you”\n\n    [al-A’raaf 7:86 – interpretation of the meaning]\n\n    No one can deny that having a large number is a source of \n    pride and strength for the ummah, contrary to what those pessimists think \n    who say that large numbers causes poverty and starvation in a nation. \n\n    If the ummah increases in number, puts its trust in Allaah \n    and believes His promises as mentioned in the aayah,  \n\n    “And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its \n    provision is due from Allaah”\n\n    [Hood 11:6 – interpretation of the meaning], \n    then Allaah will make things easy for them and will grant them independence \n    of means from His bounty. Based on that, the answer to your question is as \n    follows: \n\n    Birth control pills: \n\n    A woman should not use birth control pills, unless the \n    following conditions are met: \n\n    1-She should need to use them, \n    for example if she is ill and cannot cope with a pregnancy every year, or \n    she is physically unfit, or there is some other reason that getting pregnant \n    every year may harm her.\n\n    2-Her husband should give his \n    permission, because the husband has the right to have children. There must \n    also be consultation with the doctor, to find out whether these pills are \n    harmful or not. \n\n    If these two conditions are met, there is nothing wrong with \n    taking these pills, but that should not be on a permanent basis, because \n    that means preventing having children. \n\n     With regard to ‘azl (coitus interruptus), or withdrawing \n    during intercourse, the correct scholarly view is that there is nothing \n    wrong with it, because of the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him): “We used to practise ‘azl at the time when the Qur’aan was being \n    revealed” – i.e., at the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him). If that action had been haraam, the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have forbidden it. But the \n    scholars say that one should not engage in ‘azl with a free woman except \n    with her permission, because she has the right to have children. Moreover, \n    withdrawing without her permission diminishes her pleasure, because the \n    woman’s pleasure can only be completed after ejaculation. So not asking her \n    permission causes her to lose out on pleasure and on the possibility of \n    having children. Hence we state the condition that this may only be done \n    with her permission.\n\n     From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen.\n\n     From Fataawa Islamiyyah, vol. 3, p. 190.\n\n     Thirdly: the reason why the Sahaabah engaged in ‘azl was \n    because they did not want the woman – especially a slave woman – to get \n    pregnant, so that they could continue to enjoy a physical relationship with \n    them and the woman would still be able to do their work. Abu Dawood narrated \n    that a man said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I have a slave woman and I engage \n    in ‘azl with her, because I do not want her to get pregnant, but I want what \n    men want. But the Jews say that ‘azl is a lesser form of infanticide.” He \n    said, “The Jews are lying. If Allaah wants to create (a child) you cannot \n    prevent that.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, Kitaab al-Nikaah, 1856; \n    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1903).",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the issues of 'azl (coitus interruptus) and the use of birth control pills are addressed within the context of family planning and the sanctity of marriage.\n\n1. **'Azl (Coitus Interruptus)**: This practice involves withdrawing before ejaculation to prevent pregnancy. The majority of Islamic scholars have deemed 'azl to be permissible, as it is a method that does not permanently prevent conception and is based on mutual consent between husband and wife. However, it is recommended that couples have a discussion about their family planning decisions and intentions.\n\n2. **Birth Control Pills**: The use of birth control pills is also generally considered permissible in Islam, provided that both spouses consent to their use and there are valid reasons for wanting to delay or limit pregnancies. Scholars generally emphasize the importance of the intention behind using contraception—whether it is for health reasons, to ensure the well-being of existing children, or other justifiable scenarios.\n\nIt is important to note that any form of contraception should not be permanent or irreversible. Also, if a couple decides to use contraception, it is advised that they do so after considering the potential implications and desires regarding family size and child-rearing.\n\nAs with all matters in Islam, it’s encouraged to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars or local religious authorities, as they can provide advice specific to individual circumstances and the context of a couple’s situation."

        "question": "His family want him to marry a girl who is not religious and they say that she will change in time",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    commanded the one who wants to get married to look for a religious woman. He \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “A woman may be \n    married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty or her \n    religious commitment. Look for the one who is religious, may your hands be \n    rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” \n\n    A wife is a life-long companion, and she will take care of \n    his household and all his affairs. She will be the one to bring up and teach \n    his children. Religious commitment is the thing that makes a woman chaste \n    and keeps her away from bad things. So you must choose a wife from among \n    those women who are religiously-committed and fear Allaah. \n\n    What I think you should do is to strive to influence her and \n    make da’wah to her through your family or some of your mahrams so that she \n    will improve and adhere to the straight path. If she adheres to the straight \n    path and improves, then marry her. \n\n    Otherwise, I think that you should look for someone else, for \n    you have no guarantee that you will be able to influence her; she may not \n    respond, or you may be influenced by her, for no matter how much faith and \n    taqwa (piety) a person may have, he is still human and is still subject to \n    change or influence.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the choice of a spouse is significant, and it is emphasized that a person's religiousness and character are important factors to consider when selecting a partner. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised that a person should look for four qualities when choosing a spouse: their faith, their social status, their wealth, and their beauty, but he emphasized the importance of prioritizing piety and religious commitment (Tirmidhi).\n\nIf a person is considering marriage to someone who is not religious, it is important to weigh the potential challenges that may arise from differences in values and beliefs. Trusting that someone will change over time can be a risky perspective, as personal growth and change depend on many factors, including individual motivation and circumstances.\n\nParents and families often wish well for their children, but it's crucial for the individual to reflect on their own values and what they want in a partner. Open communication about religious beliefs and values before marriage can help establish a clear understanding between both partners. \n\nUltimately, it is important to seek guidance through prayer (Salah) and supplication (Dua) to ask for Allah's help in finding the right partner. Additionally, consulting with knowledgeable and trusted individuals in the community can also provide valuable insight.\n\nIf possible, a balance between familial expectations and personal convictions should be sought, as both aspects are important in making a decision about marriage."

        "question": "Are Wedding Rings Permissible?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can men wear gold?\nWith regard to men wearing gold , whether it is a ring or anything else, it is not permissible under any circumstances. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade gold for the males of this ummah. He saw a man wearing a ring of gold and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took it from his hand and said, “Would any one of you take a coal from the fire and hold it in his hand?” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Libas wa’l-Zinah, 3897)\nSo it is not permissible for the Muslim male to wear a gold ring. \nBut with regard to rings of silver or any other kind of metal, it is permissible for men to wear them even if they are precious metals. \nAre wedding rings haram?\nWith regard to the wedding ring, which is worn on the occasion of marriage, this is not one of the customs of the Muslims. If it is believed that it generates love between the spouses, and that taking it off and not wearing it will have an effect on the marital relationship, then this is regarded as a form of shirk and is a kind of jahili belief. Based on the above, it is not permissible to wear a wedding ring under any circumstances. \nWhy are wedding rings haram?\n\nFirstly, because it is an imitation of those who are no good; it is a custom that has come to the Muslims from the non-Muslims.\nSecondly, if that is accompanied by the belief that it has an effect on the marital relationship, then this is a kind of shirk. La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (there is no power and no strength except with Allah). (From a fatwa issued by Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan). \n\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked about the ruling on wearing engagement rings. He said: \n“The engagement ring is a kind of ring, and there is nothing wrong with rings in principle, unless that is accompanied by some belief, as some people do when the man writes his name on the ring that he gives to his fiancée, and she writes her name on the ring that she gives to him, believing that this will create strong bonds between the couple. In this case, this ring is haram, because it is an attachment to something for which there is no basis in Islam and which makes no sense. Similarly, with regard to the engagement ring, it is not permissible to the man to put it on his fiancée’s hand, because she is not his wife yet and she is still a stranger (non-mahram) to him, because she is not his wife until after the marriage contract has been done.” (Al-Fatawa al-Jami’ah li’l-Marah al-Muslimah, vol. 3, p. 914-915) \nFor more, please see these answers: 76413 , 20069 , and 11446\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the permissibility of wedding rings can vary among different scholars and schools of thought. Generally, wearing a wedding ring itself is not prohibited in Islam, as there is no specific injunction against it in the Quran or Hadith. However, several points should be considered:\n\n1. **Intention**: The intention behind wearing a wedding ring should be clear. It is seen as a symbol of marital commitment rather than an object of worship or something that has intrinsic value.\n\n2. **Material**: Traditionally, there are certain guidelines regarding the materials from which rings can be made. For instance, men are generally discouraged from wearing gold due to Hadith; silver or other materials are typically deemed permissible. Women's jewelry can include gold and other materials, but excessive extravagance is discouraged.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices**: In many cultures, wedding rings have become a norm and are viewed as part of the marriage ceremony. Engagement and wedding rings serve as symbols of commitment, and many scholars accept this cultural practice, provided it does not contradict Islamic principles.\n\n4. **Avoiding Excess**: Islam encourages moderation and discourages extravagance. Therefore, wearing simple wedding rings that are within one's means is preferred.\n\nIn conclusion, wedding rings are generally permissible in Islam as long as the intentions are correct, they are made of permissible materials, and they do not lead to extravagance. It is always advisable for individuals to consult their local scholars or follow the practices of their specific community or school of thought."

Discuss your future aspirations and see if they align.\n\n5. **Mutual Respect and Understanding**: A successful marriage is built upon mutual respect, understanding, and support for each other.\n\n6. **Consultation and Prayer**: It is recommended to seek advice from trusted family members or friends, and to perform Istikhara (guidance prayer) to seek Allah's guidance in your decision.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be made after thorough reflection, discussion with the potential partner, and, if necessary, consultation with knowledgeable individuals in your community.

While there is no explicit ruling in the Qur'an or Hadith that categorically forbids marrying someone with HIV/AIDS, it is crucial to consider the implications on health and the potential impact on family life.\n\nParents have a responsibility to ensure the well-being of their children, which includes considering the health risks associated with marrying an individual with a serious illness. If the daughter is aware of the situation, understands the risks, and is willing to marry, it is ultimately her choice. However, parents may guide and advise her, keeping in mind Islamic values and the welfare of their daughter.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision should be made with careful consideration of the medical, social, and emotional factors involved, and it is advisable to seek counsel from knowledgeable individuals, such as a qualified scholar or a healthcare professional, before proceeding."

        "question": "Is masturbation permissible if a person knows that he would not be able to give a wife her rights?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to marry, let him get married, and whoever cannot do that, then he should fast, for it will be a protection for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4677) \nIbn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari: With respect to marriage, the scholars have divided men into several categories. \nThe first is those who have the desire to get married and who have the financial means to do so and who fear for themselves. It is recommended for such a person to get married according to all the scholars; according to one report the Hanbalis said that it is obligatory. The well-known view of Ahmad is that it is not obligatory for the one who is able and has the desire, unless he fears hardship. \nIbn Daqeeq al-‘Eid said: Some of the fuqaha’ divided marriage into five rulings. They said that it is obligatory in cases where there is the fear of hardship, where a man is able for marriage and it is difficult to find a concubine. This was narrated by al-Qurtubi from one of their scholars, namely al-Maaziri, who said: it is obligatory in the case of one who cannot keep away from zinaa otherwise, as stated above. \nHe said: it is forbidden in the case of one who will not take care of his wife with regard to intercourse and spending on her, who is not able for marriage and has no desire for it. Al-Safaareeni said: the poor man who cannot spend on a wife and has no income, and has no desire – in this case it is said that marriage is makrooh for him, because he is cannot afford it and he cannot provide his wife with enjoyment to protect her, and he has no need for it. \nSee Ghidhaa’ al-Albaab, vol. 2, p. 434 \n‘Iyaad said: it is recommended in the case of everyone who hopes for offspring even if he has no desire for intercourse, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I will be proud of your great numbers.” And because of the encouragement for marriage and the commands to marry. The same applies to the one who has any desire for other kinds of enjoyment of women besides intercourse. But in the case of one who is sterile or has no desire for women or for physical pleasure, marriage is permissible for him if the woman knows and accepts that. \nThe hadeeth indicates that masturbation is haraam, because if it were prescribed the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have indicated that. See also Question no. 329 \nIf a person is patient in abstaining from that which Allah has forbidden and gives it up because he is seeking the pleasure of Allah, then Allah will reward him abundantly on the Day of Resurrection, because whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better. \nAnd Allah says, describing the believers (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)” [al-Mu’minoon 23:5]\nThe Muslim has to follow the path prescribed by Islam, as taught by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which is fasting. May Allah protect you and us from falling into haraam. And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the issue of masturbation is viewed differently among scholars. Many scholars consider masturbation to be discouraged (makruh) or even impermissible (haram) in certain circumstances, especially when it leads to greater harm or sinful behavior.\n\nIf a person believes that they are unable to fulfill the rights of a wife—meaning they may not be able to maintain a healthy marital relationship or provide the necessary emotional and financial support—some scholars suggest that masturbation might be a means to avoid falling into sin, such as fornication or adultery. In such cases, it may be viewed as a lesser evil.\n\nHowever, it is essential to seek knowledge and guidance from a qualified scholar or an Imam who can provide personalized advice based on a deeper understanding of the individual's circumstances and intentions. Ultimately, engaging in prayer and seeking Allah's guidance through supplication (dua) can help in making the right decision."

        "question": "He is confused as to whether he should marry a virgin or a widow",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This \n          depends on the situation of the husband; it may be that marriage to \n          a widow is more suitable for him, and better.  \nThe \n          widow may be a lady of religious commitment and good character, such \n          that you would not want to let the opportunity to marry such a woman \n          “slip through your fingers”, and you could not find a virgin of such \n          religious commitment and character.  \nBut \n          generally speaking, the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) encouraged marriage to virgins.  \n          \nThere \n          is the story of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him), whose father \n          had died, leaving him with sisters.

The Messenger of Allaah  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked, ‘Did you get married, \n          O Jaabir?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘A virgin or a previously-married \n          woman?’ I said, ‘A previously-married woman.’ He said, ‘Why not a young \n          girl whom you could play with and she could play with you, and you could \n          laugh with her and she could laugh with you?’ I told him that ‘Abd-Allaah \n          had died and left behind daughters, and I did not want to bring to them \n          someone like them. So I had married a woman who could take care of them \n          and discipline them.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the decision to marry a virgin or a widow is ultimately a personal choice and can depend on various factors including individual circumstances, priorities, and values. Both types of women have their own unique qualities and potential blessings. \n\nHere are some considerations to help in making the decision:\n\n1. **Understanding and Compassion**: A widow may have experienced significant life events and may bring wisdom and perspective into a marriage. It's important to be compassionate and understanding of her experiences.\n\n2. **Family and Personal Goals**: Consider your own goals for marriage. If you desire to have children, you may think about the future potential in both cases. A younger virgin may be seen as someone who can bear children for a longer time, while a widow may already have children and might be looking for a supportive partner.\n\n3. **Character and Compatibility**: Regardless of marital history, the character and compatibility of the individual with you should be of utmost priority. Look for piety, mutual respect, love, and shared values.\n\n4. **Social Considerations**: In some cultures, marrying a virgin might be favored, while in others, marrying a widow is seen as an act of compassion and responsibility. Consider societal views but prioritize your personal feelings and the individual's circumstances.\n\n5. **Consultation and Prayer**: It is encouraged in Islam to pray for guidance (Istikhara) and consult knowledgeable family members or scholars for advice when making significant life decisions.\n\nUltimately, the choice should be made based on what you believe will be most beneficial for you both in this life and the hereafter, considering personal feelings, wisdom, and what aligns best with your faith and values."

        "question": "Undoing the effects of magic on the groom on his wedding night",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is not necessarily the case, but it could happen. Some people are tested by means of someone else putting a magic spell on them which prevents them from having intercourse with their wives. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife, but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allaah’s Leave [al-Baqarah 2:102]\nBut if a person uses the prayers for refuge prescribed in Islam, Allaah will be sufficient for him against the evil of the magicians and others, and Allaah will take that (magic) away if it is present. So he has to read Aayat al-Kursi over himself, and al-Faatihah, and the verses which speak of sihr (magic), and “Qul Huwa Allaahu Ahad” and the Mi’wadhatayn, and it will go away by Allaah’s Leave. This has been tried a great deal. A good qaari’ (reader) from among the good and righteous people from whom one hopes for good may also recite for him. The reader may recite into water which the man may then drink from or wash with, and the harm will go away from him, or the reader may recite over him and blow onto him, and Allaah will cure him of that. All of these are means of keeping safe and sound.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, magic (sihr) is considered a serious offense and it is important to seek protection from it through prayer, supplication, and following Islamic teachings. If someone believes they have been affected by magic, especially on a significant occasion like a wedding night, they can take several steps:\n\n1. **Repentance and Prayer**: The affected individual should turn to Allah with sincere repentance and engage in regular prayers (Salah). It's important to maintain a strong connection with Allah through acts of devotion.\n\n2. **Recitation of Qur’anic Verses**: Certain verses from the Qur'an are recommended for protection against magic and evil. Important ones include:\n   - Surah Al-Fatiha (Chapter 1)\n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2, especially Ayat al-Kursi, verse 255 and the last two verses, which are 285-286)\n   - Surah Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112), Surah Al-Falaq (Chapter 113), and Surah An-Nas (Chapter 114) are often recited for protection.\n\n3. **Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah)**: Regular recitation of dhikr can help in seeking protection and strengthening one's faith. This includes phrases like \"SubhanAllah,\" \"Alhamdulillah,\" and \"Allahu Akbar.\"\n\n4. **Ruqyah (Spiritual Healing)**: Seeking ruqyah, which is the practice of reciting Qur’anic verses and supplications for healing and protection from harmful forces, can be beneficial. Many Islamic scholars and practitioners offer ruqyah services.\n\n5. **Consultation with Knowledgeable Individuals**: If the problem persists, it may be helpful to consult knowledgeable scholars or practitioners who specialize in dealing with magic and spiritual issues, ensuring they follow Islamic principles.\n\n6. **Trusting in Allah**: Ultimately, maintaining firm belief in Allah’s power and asking for His help is essential. Seeking His protection through faith, prayer, and righteous actions is the most effective means of countering the effects of magic.\n\nIt's important to note that seeking help from unauthorized sources or those who engage in practices against Islamic teachings should be avoided. Always focus on the Quran and authentic Sunnah for guidance."

        "question": "Is it makrooh to leave a long interval between the marriage contract and consummation of the marriage?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:\nIt is not makrooh, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concluded the marriage contract with ‘Aa’ishah when she was six years old, and consummated the marriage with her when she was nine. The prospective husband may do that sometimes because he is keen to get married and is afraid that the woman or her family may change their minds, so he hastens to conclude the marriage contract. There is nothing wrong with that from the point of view of sharee’ah, but I think that the marriage contract should be concluded at the same time as the marriage is to be consummated, or shortly before, because that helps to avoid problems that may arise, such as differences that lead to divorce, or death of one of the spouses, etc… And Allaah is the source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is generally preferable to consummate the marriage soon after the marriage contract (nikah) to fulfill the rights and intentions of both spouses. However, leaving a long interval between the marriage contract and consummation is not considered makrooh (discouraged) in a strict sense, but it is discouraged when it leads to difficulties or causes anxiety for either partner.\n\nThe ideal situation promotes a timely consummation to establish the marital relationship properly. If there are valid reasons for delay—such as financial constraints, lack of readiness, or other circumstances—then it may not be viewed negatively. Ultimately, the intention and circumstances surrounding the delay are significant factors.\n\nIt’s always best to refer to knowledgeable scholars or local religious authorities for specific situations, as cultural practices and interpretations may vary."

        "question": "Is Intimacy an Act of Worship in Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is Intimacy an Act of Worship in Islam?\n If a man has intercourse with his wife , he will be rewarded for that, because he is doing something permissible and avoiding something forbidden. This is what is stated in the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):\n It was narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that some people from among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allah, the rich people will get more reward. They pray as we pray, and they fast as we fast, but they give in charity from their excess wealth.” He said, “Has not Allah given you things with which you can give charity? Every Tasbihah (saying `Subhan Allah’ (Glory be to Allah)) is a charity. Every ‘Takbirah’ (saying `Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)) is a charity. Every ‘Tahmidah’ (saying `Al-hamdu-Lillah’ (praise be to Allah)) is a charity. Every Tahlilah (saying `La ilaha ill-Allah’ (there is none worthy of worship but Allah)) is a charity. Enjoining what is good is a charity. Forbidding what is evil is a charity. Having intercourse (with one’s wife) is a charity.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?” He said, “Do you not see that if he does it in a haram way he will have the burden of sin? So if he does it in a halal way, he will have a reward for that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1674) \nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The phrase, `Having intercourse is a charity’ – the word bud’ (translated here as `having intercourse’ ) may mean intercourse, or it may refer to the private part itself…\nThis indicates that permissible actions may become acts of worship, if there is a sincere intention. Intercourse may be an act of worship if the intention behind it is to fulfil the rights of one's wife, to treat her kindly as enjoined by Allah, to seek a righteous child, to keep oneself or one’s wife chaste, to prevent both partners from looking towards or thinking of haram things, and other good intentions. `O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?’” (Sharh Muslim, 7/92)\nIs the reward of sex in Islam equivalent to 70 Sunnah prayers?\n With regard to your comment that the reward of sex in Islam is equivalent to seventy optional prayers”\nPerhaps this question about the reward for having intercourse with one’s wife comes from your reading of Imam An-Nawawi’s commentary on Sahih Muslim (Sharh An-Nawawi `ala Sahih Muslim). It is a comment which we will quote below, where the Shaykh (An-Nawawi – may Allah have mercy on him) was discussing the issue of enjoining what is good and saying that it is obligatory. Then he discussed the issue of saying Tasbih and Dhikr, which he noted is Sunnah. Then he explained that the obligatory act of worship is equivalent to seventy times the Sunnah act, and said: they reached this conclusion from a Hadith… Then at the end of this discussion he referred to the phrase “Having intercourse…” \nIf this is indeed the case, then you should note that the first comment has nothing to do with what follows it. The phrase “from a Hadith” means from some Hadith, but Imam An-Nawawi does not quote it. When he finishes discussing the issue of obligatory and Sunnah acts of worship, and the status of each, he then starts his discussion of the phrase “Having intercourse...” So the confusion has arisen from this juxtaposition.\nThis is what we think. But if you mean that the reward for obligatory acts of worship is equivalent to the reward for seventy Sunnah acts, then An-Nawawi did discuss this point and said that there was a Hadith about it, but he did not quote it.\n We know what An-Nawawi was referring to, and this is what was pointed out by Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him).\n Al-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n “Note:\nIn Ziyadat Ar-Rawdah, An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from the Imam of the Haramayn from some of the scholars that the reward for an obligatory act of worship is seventy times more than the reward for a Sunnah act. An-Nawawi said: they reached this conclusion from a Hadith.”\n The Hadith in question was quoted by Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) in An-Nihayah. It is the Marfu` Hadith of Salman concerning the month of Ramadan: “Whoever seeks to draw closer to Allah during (this month) by doing some good deeds will be like one who does an obligatory action at any other time, and one who does an obligatory action (during Ramadan) will be like one who does seventy obligatory actions at any other time.”\n This is an inauthentic Hadith which was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah (may Allah have mercy on him), but he was uncertain as to whether it was sound or not.” ((At-Talkhis Al-Habir, 3/118)\n What he meant (may Allah have mercy on him) by saying that Ibn Khuzaymah was uncertain as to whether it was sound or not may be understood more clearly by referring to Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (3/191), where he includes it under the chapter heading, Bab Fada’il Sharh Ramadan in Sahha Al-Khabr (Chapter on the virtues of the month of Ramadan, if the report is authentic).\n And the chain of transmission of this Hadith includes `Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad`an, who is a weak narrator.\n And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, intimacy between a husband and wife is regarded as a significant and positive aspect of their relationship. While it may not be classified as a traditional act of worship (like prayer or fasting), it is seen as an important aspect of marital life that can have spiritual benefits and contribute to the well-being of both individuals and their family.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the significance of fulfilling one’s marital duties. Scholars interpret the act of intimacy within marriage as an expression of love, compassion, and commitment, and it can be rewarded by Allah when done in accordance with Islamic guidelines. Engaging in intimacy is encouraged as part of the marital relationship, and it can also serve to strengthen the bond between spouses.\n\nMoreover, intimate acts can be performed with the intention of pleasing Allah and fulfilling one’s rights and responsibilities within the marriage, which can add a dimension of spiritual reward to the act. Therefore, while it may not fit the strict definition of \"worship,\" it can certainly be an act through which a couple seeks to earn Allah's pleasure when approached with the right intentions."

Attraction and affection are important components of a successful marriage, as they contribute to emotional intimacy and mutual satisfaction. \n\nIf someone finds themselves in a situation where they do not feel attraction towards their spouse, it is recommended to approach the situation with patience and understanding. Here are a few steps to consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: Open and honest communication with the spouse is crucial.

Engaging in activities together, spending quality time, and working on building emotional connections can help foster feelings of love and attraction.\n\n4. **Dua (Supplication)**: Turning to Allah in prayer for guidance and assistance can also be instrumental. Making dua for increased affection or for finding contentment in the relationship is encouraged.\n\n5. **Considerations of Compatibility**: Reflect on whether compatibility in values, goals, and life vision may enhance feelings of attraction and happiness within the marriage.\n\nIf, after earnest efforts, one finds that the marriage is still unfulfilling, seeking further advice and exploring the option of separation or divorce may be necessary, but such steps should be taken with careful consideration and in accordance with Islamic teachings.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to create a harmonious and fulfilling relationship that aligns with Islamic values."

The Prophet  (peace and \n          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Avoid the seven sins  which \n          condemn a person to Hell…[which include] consuming ribaa.” And he  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has cursed \n          the one who consumes ribaa, the one who pays it…” Consumption of ribaa \n          is one of the greatest causes of poverty and loss of blessings, as Allaah \n          says (interpretation of the meaning): \n “Allaah \n          will destroy Ribaa and will give increase for Sadaqaat (deeds of charity, \n          alms)” [al-Baqarah 2:276]\n I think that you do \n          not know the ruling on interest-based loans. So seeks Allaah’s forgiveness \n          for what is in the past, and do not do it again. Wait for your Lord \n          to grant you a way out and seek provision from Him. Put your trust in \n          Him for Allaah loves those who put their trust in Him.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the decision to have children is a significant one and should be approached with consideration of various factors, including financial stability, emotional readiness, and the ability to provide a nurturing environment for children. While poverty can be a real concern, it is important to remember a few key principles:\n\n1. **Trust in Allah**: Muslims believe that Allah provides for all of His creation. The Quran emphasizes that He is the Sustainer, and many verses remind us not to fear poverty when it comes to having children. For example, Allah says in the Quran: “And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely, killing them is a great sin.” (Quran, 17:31).\n\n2. **Family Planning**: While family planning is permissible in Islam, it is essential to distinguish between methods. Temporary methods of family planning, like the use of contraceptives, are generally accepted as long as there is a valid reason and mutual agreement between the husband and wife. However, permanent methods, such as sterilization, may be more controversial and should be approached with extra caution and consultation with knowledgeable scholars.\n\n3. **Mutual Agreement**: The decision regarding the number of children should ideally be made jointly by both partners, taking into account their situation, desires, and what they believe they can handle.\n\nUltimately, it is advisable for individuals facing financial concerns to seek guidance through prayer, consultation with knowledgeable people in their community, and careful consideration of their circumstances. Seeking Allah's guidance through istikhara (prayer for guidance) can also be beneficial."

        "question": "He\r\n      has found a religious woman but he does not find her appearance attractive\r\n      – should he marry her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If\n      you want to get married, then look for one who is religious, as the\n      Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised when he\n      said: “Choose the one who is religious, may your hands be rubbed with\n      dust [i.e., may you prosper].” There is no reason why a man should not\n      also look for other things, such as beauty etc., that will help him to\n      keep his gaze lowered. This is something which should be taken into\n      account. Hence the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\n      him) mentioned it when he said, “Women may be married for four things”\n      – and he mentioned beauty as one of them. If you are afraid that you may\n      treat this woman badly because you do not find her attractive, then do not\n      go ahead and marry her. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage is seen as a significant and sacred relationship that encompasses various dimensions, including spiritual, emotional, and physical aspects. When considering a potential spouse, it’s important to weigh different factors.\n\n1. **Religious Commitment**: A woman’s religious commitment and piety are highly valued in Islam. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised to choose a spouse based on their faith and character (Sahih al-Bukhari).\n\n2. **Attraction**: Physical attraction is also an important aspect of marriage. While religious piety may take precedence, personal satisfaction in physical compatibility can contribute to harmony in the relationship.\n\n3. **Consideration of Compatibility**: It’s important to consider overall compatibility beyond appearance, including shared values, goals, and lifestyle.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be based on a holistic view of the relationship. If he feels that strong religious faith and commitment could lead to a fulfilling partnership, he may choose to marry her, but he should also reflect on his feelings regarding attraction and ensure that both partners can build a happy and harmonious life together. If he is unsure, seeking guidance from trusted family members, friends, or an imam may also be beneficial."

        "predicted_answer": "Marriage is primarily considered an action of this world in Islam. It is a social contract that fulfills various needs, including companionship, procreation, and the establishment of families, all of which are aspects of worldly life. However, marriage can also hold significance in the Hereafter, as it can be a means for individuals to earn spiritual rewards if conducted according to Islamic principles. Moreover, in Islamic teachings, spouses can support each other in their faith and good deeds, which may positively affect their standing in the Hereafter. Thus, while marriage is fundamentally a worldly institution, it has implications for the Hereafter as well."

        "question": "validity of a marriage",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Your wife’s brother can assume\n      the (wali) position. If there is not a brother then an uncle would do. He\n      second eldest son would also do, if he is an adult. In the absence of all\n      of these, an Islamic judge or the head of the Islamic center can renew the\n      contract. You don’t have to tell anyone about the reason. You can say\n      that you just want to renew it because you don’t feel good about the\n      first one. Publicity is not needed at all. There was an addition to my\n      answer to you, but apparently it was lost for one reason or another. Here\n      is the full answer once again:\nThe marriage\n      contract is void because it was made without fulfilling its necessary\n      conditions. One of these conditions is the readiness of the womb. This\n      means that the woman whom is to get married must have her womb unoccupied.\n      For example, a man may not marry a woman who is pregnant. He may not marry\n      a woman who was divorced until she is out of her idd’ah (a period where\n      a widow or a divorced woman may not marry). Also a man may not marry a\n      woman he has been having intercourse with until they both repent and she\n      gets her monthly period. This is a sign that her womb is clean. The\n      Prophet forbade Muslims to have intercourse with female slaves they bought\n      recently until they are certain that their wombs are clear from any\n      pregnancy. Waiting for the monthly period does this. In your case, the\n      marriage contract must be renewed. This is not a difficult thing to do.\n      The first boy is not Islamicly your son, as he was not created in his\n      mother’s womb through a valid marriage contract. Some scholars say he is\n      not to be called after you as he is born out of adultery. He is to be\n      called after his mother’s family. He is not to inherit you and you are\n      not to inherit him. As for the remaining children, they are yours and they\n      carry your name. Other scholars, such as Ibn Taymiyah and Ibn AlQayyim say\n      that if the woman is not married at the time of committing adultery, then\n      the adulteress father may give his name to this boy and that he may be\n      treated as his son. In your case, this last opinion may be the most\n      suitable for you and your family. Yet you must renew your marriage\n      contract at any Islamic center, and Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the validity of a marriage, or \"Nikah,\" is determined by several key elements:\n\n1. **Consent**: Both parties (the bride and groom) must willingly consent to the marriage. Coercion or force negates the validity of the marriage.\n\n2. **Witnesses**: A valid marriage requires the presence of at least two adult, sane witnesses (preferably male, but female witnesses may also be accepted in some schools of thought) who are Muslim. \n\n3. **Offer and Acceptance**: There must be a clear offer (Ijab) from one party and acceptance (Qabul) from the other. This exchange can be verbal or in writing.\n\n4. **Mahr (Dowry)**: The groom is required to provide a dowry (Mahr) to the bride. This can be in the form of money, goods, or services and must be agreed upon by both parties.\n\n5. **Legality**: Both individuals must be eligible to marry according to Islamic law, meaning they should not be closely related (prohibited degrees of kinship) and must be of sound mind.\n\n6. **Acknowledgment of Faith**: In the case of a Muslim man marrying a woman from the People of the Book (Jews or Christians), she must be a believer in her faith. A Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim man unless he embraces Islam.\n\n7. **Locus of Marriage**: The marriage must be conducted in an environment free from public immorality and must respect legal regulations set by the country or community regarding marriage.\n\nIf any of these conditions are not met, the marriage may not be considered valid in Islam. It is also important to consult knowledgeable scholars or local Islamic authorities for specific guidance tailored to individual circumstances."

        "question": "The wife’s    family want to do forbidden things during the wedding party",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What the girls family wants to do is undoubtedly haraam and is unacceptable. It is not permissible to please people by doing something that angers Allaah. We do not advise you at all to start your married life with haraam actions. The Muslim should disassociate himself and his family from the idea that his wife is a cheap product to be looked at by all and sundry when she is wearing all her make-up and jewellery etc.\nWe advise you to deal with the situation by doing the following:\n\n\nYou should advise them, politely, and explain to them the Islamic ruling concerning what they are planning to do. Warn them of the wrath of Allaah, and explain to them that music and mixing are haraam. Tell them that they could still have a successful wedding without these haraam things, and it is not in their interests at all in this world or in the Hereafter to respond to the blessing of Allaah, i.e., their daughters marriage, by disobeying Him and going against His commands and doing things that anger Him.\n\n\nIf that does not work, look for some wise people among their family and relatives, and from your own family too, who they think highly of and who you hope can help. Perhaps Allaah will decree that you will find a way out through them, and they will give up these evil things even if it is through pressure and embarrassment.\n\n\nIf that does not work, look for intervention on the part of someone who is knowledgeable and wise, whom they respect and look up to. Perhaps he will make them feel ashamed, or will be able to convince them that what they want to do is wrong, so they will give it up.\n\n\nIf none of this works, perhaps you can threaten them with divorce or separation. They might pay attention to that, because it would make them look bad in front of other people, so they will give up that which has been forbidden by Allaah. Perhaps leaving a long time between the nikaah (marriage contract) and the wedding party will have the result of convincing these people.\nIf they do not respond at all, then we would seriously warn you against getting involved with these people. But if the girl is religious and good-mannered, and she does not agree with what her family are doing, and you and she are able not to be present when the haraam things are happening, and you can leave the party when they start doing things that anger Allaah, and also announce your objections and state that you are disassociating yourselves from what is going to happen, (this is fine). Remember the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): then sit not with them (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them [al-Nisaa 4:140]. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it\nAnd Allaah is the source of help; to Him we complain and in Him we put our trust.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is important to adhere to Islamic guidelines in all aspects of life, including during wedding celebrations. If the wife's family wishes to engage in activities that are considered forbidden (haram), such as mixing of the sexes without proper hijab, playing inappropriate music, or any other actions that contradict Islamic teachings, the couple should approach the situation with wisdom and compassion.\n\n1. **Communication**: The couple should communicate their concerns respectfully with the wife's family. It's essential to express the desire to have a wedding that aligns with Islamic principles.\n\n2. **Seek Compromise**: They can suggest alternatives that maintain cultural traditions while still adhering to Islamic guidelines. For example, they can propose having separate gatherings for men and women, or incorporating Islamic music and teachings.\n\n3. **Set Boundaries**: It may be necessary to set clear boundaries about what will and will not be acceptable at the wedding. This ensures that the couple's values are respected.\n\n4. **Involvement of a Trusted Elder**: If you're having difficulty in discussing these matters, it might be helpful to involve a respected elder or community leader who understands Islamic principles and can mediate the situation.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to celebrate the marriage in a way that brings joy and blessings, while staying true to Islamic teachings. It's important that both families collaborate to ensure the event reflects the values of Islam."

One of these rulings is that it is permissible for you to marry her. But we should note an important point, which is that even though love is something nice, and it is mustahabb for a man to marry a woman whom he loves, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: there is nothing better for two who love one another than marriage\n(Saheeh al-Jaami, no 5200), nevertheless, this love should not be overwhelming and cause a person to forget other characteristics which he should look for in the person he wants to marry. The most important characteristic is religious commitment. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A woman may be married for four things her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her commitment to religion. Choose the one who is religious, may your hands be rubbed with dust [i.e., may you prosper]! (Agreed upon). If your cousin is religious and has a good attitude, then you have chosen well and we ask Allaah to fulfil your hopes and bring you together in a good way.

        "question": "Attributes    of the ideal Muslim husband",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your eagerness to find out the attributes which will help you to choose a righteous husband, in shaa Allah. There follows a description of the most important qualities which should be present in the man whom you choose or accept to be your husband and the father of your children, if Allah decrees that you will have children.\nReligious commitment. This is the most important thing to look for in the man you want to marry. The husband should be a Muslim who adheres to all the laws and teachings of Islam in his daily life. The woman’s guardian (wali) should strive to check out this matter and not rely only on outward appearances. One of the most important things to ask about is the man’s prayer (salaah); the one who neglects the rights of Allah is more likely to neglect the rights of others. The true believer does not oppress or mistreat his wife; if he loves her, he honours her, and if he does not love her, he does not mistreat or humiliate her. It is very rare to find this attitude among those who are not sincere Muslims. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):\n“and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you” [al-Baqarah 2:221]\n“Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwaa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]” [al-Hujuraat 49:13]\n“Good statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or good men for good women)” [al-Noor 24:26]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n“If there comes to you one whose religious commitment and attitude pleases you, then marry [your female relative who is under your care] to him, for if you do not do that, there will be tribulation on earth and much corruption.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1084).\nAs well as being religiously committed, it is preferable that he should come from a good family and a known lineage. If two men come to propose marriage to one woman, and they are equal in terms of religious commitment, then preference should be given to the one who comes from a good family that is known for its adherence to the commands of Allah, so long as the other person is not better than him in terms of religious commitment – because the righteousness of the husband’s close relatives could be passed on to his children and his good origins and lineage may make him refrain from many foolish and cheap actions. The righteousness of the father and grandfather are beneficial to the children and grandchildren. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the town; and there was under it a treasure belonging to them; and their father was a righteous man, and your Lord intended that they should attain their age of full strength and take out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord” [al-Kahf 18:82].\nSee how Allah protected their father’s wealth for the two boys after the father died, as an honour to him because of his righteousness and taqwaa. By the same token, if the husband comes from a righteous family and his parents are good, Allah will make things easy for him and protect him as an honour to his parents.\nIt is good if he has sufficient wealth to keep him and his family from having to ask people for anything, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her), when she came to consult him about three men who had proposed marriage to her, “As for Mu’aawiyah, he is a poor man who has no wealth…” (Narrated by Muslim, 1480). It is not essential that he should be a businessman or rich, it is sufficient for him to have an income that will keep him and his family from having to ask people for anything. If there is a choice between a man who is religiously committed and a man who is wealthy, then the religious man should be given preference over the wealthy man.\nIt is preferable that he should be kind and gentle towards women, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Qays, in the hadeeth quoted above, “As for Abu Jaham, his stick never leaves his shoulder”, referring to the fact that he used to beat women a lot.\nIt is good if he is sound of body and healthy, free of faults, sickness, etc., and not disabled or sterile.\nIt is preferable that he should have knowledge of the Qur’aan and Sunnah; if you find someone like this it is good, otherwise you should realize that this is something rare.\nIt is permissible for the woman to look at the man who comes to propose marriage, and for him to look at her. This should be in the presence of her mahram, and it is not permitted to look more than is necessary, or for him to see her alone, or for her to go out with him on her own, or to meet repeatedly for no reason.\nAccording to Islam, the woman’s wali (guardian) should check on the man who proposes marriage to the woman who is under his guardianship; he should ask those whom he trusts among those who mix with him and who know him, about his commitment to Islam and his trustworthiness. He should ask them for an honest opinion and sincere, sound advice.\nBefore and during all of this, you must turn towards Allah and pray to Him to make it easy for you and help you to make a good choice and to grant you wisdom. Then after all these efforts, when you have decided on a particular person, you should pray Istikhaarah, asking Allah for that which is good. For more details on Salaat al-Istikhaarah, please see Question  2217. Then after you have done your utmost, put your trust in Allah, for He is the best of helpers, may He be glorified.\nAdapted from Jaami’ Ahkaam al-Nisaa’ by Shaykh Mustafaa al-‘Adawi.\nWe ask Allah, the Exalted, the Powerful, to make things easy for you, to help you make a wise choice, and to bless you with a righteous husband and good offspring, for He is Able to do all that. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",

        "question": "Does Anal Sex Break Nikah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (Have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus ), when or how you will, and send (good deeds, or ask Allah to bestow upon you pious offspring) for your ownselves beforehand. And fear Allah, and know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give good tidings to the believers (O Muhammad).” [Al-Baqarah 2:223]\nFrom the word Harth (tilth) we understand that what is permissible is only in the vagina (the front passage), especially because this is what will produce children. The semen that is planted in the womb from which offspring come is likened to the seeds which are planted in the ground, from which vegetation comes, as both of them are substances from which something else is produced.\nThe phrase translated as when or how you will means, in any manner you wish, from behind or from the front, sitting or with the wife lying on her back or on her side, so long as it is in the place of tilth (i.e., the vagina, the place from which a baby is born).\nThe poet said:\nThe wombs are lands for us to till; we have to plant the seeds and whatever grows is up to Allah.\nIt was reported from Khuzaymah ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah is not too shy to tell you the truth: do not have intercourse with your wives in the anus .” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 5/213; a good Hadith)\nIbn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will not look at a man who has intercourse with his wife in her anus .” (Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 3/529; narrated and classed as authentic by At-Tirmidhi, 1165) (See Nayl Al-Maram by Siddiq Hasan Khan, 1/151-154)\nIf a man does this, his wife is not considered to be divorced as many people think, because there is no Shar`i evidence at all that indicates this. But the scholars said that if a man habitually does this, his wife has the right to ask for a divorce, because he is an evildoer who is causing harm by his action, and also because the purpose of marriage cannot be achieved through this action. The wife has to resist this evil action and remind her husband about Allah and about the punishment for transgressing the limits set by Allah. If the husband repents to Allah from this deed, there is no reason why she should not stay with him, and there is no need to renew the marriage contract. \nFor more details, please see the following answers: 5560 , 10053 , 23339 , and 1202 .\nAnd Allah is the Source of strength.",

Generally, the act of anal sex is considered impermissible (haram) by the majority of scholars. Engaging in anal sex may not necessarily break the marriage (nikah), but it is viewed as a sinful act that violates the guidelines of sexual relations in Islam, which emphasize the importance of intimacy between spouses being within the boundaries allowed by Shariah.\n\nIt's important for couples to communicate openly about their sexual relationship and to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars or trusted sources within their respective communities for a more nuanced understanding based on their specific beliefs and circumstances."

Usually no one forgoes getting married except one who is either impotent or promiscuous, as ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) said to a man who had not got married: “Nothing is keeping you from getting married except either impotence or immorality.”\nIn any case, Islam urges people to get married and considers marriage to be one of the ways of the Messengers; it is forbidden to forego getting married even if the intention is to devote oneself to worship. “There is no monasticism in Islam.”\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, it is entirely possible to be pious without being married in Islam. Piety (taqwa) is a personal quality that reflects one's consciousness of Allah and adherence to Islamic principles, and it is not dependent on marital status. Many individuals, including scholars, saints, and religious figures throughout Islamic history, have remained unmarried while leading lives of devotion and righteousness.\n\nIslam encourages marriage as a means of fulfilling certain social and spiritual needs and as a way to complete half of one's faith. However, it does not mandate marriage for everyone. Individuals can attain closeness to Allah through acts of worship, good deeds, and a commitment to moral and ethical behavior, regardless of whether they are married or single.\n\nUltimately, piety is about one's connection to Allah, their sincerity in faith, and their actions in alignment with Islamic teachings, which can be achieved by individuals in various life circumstances."

        "question": "Differences\r\n      between Muslim and non-Muslim weddings",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There are many differences between Muslim and non-Muslim\n    weddings, such as: the condition that the woman must have a wali or\n    guardian to marry her off, the condition that there be witnesses and that\n    the marriage be announced, that the woman cannot be a mahram (close blood\n    relative) of the man, and that the wedding does not have to take place in a\n    mosque.\nThe groom can wear any kind of clothing that has been\n    permitted by Allaah, and it does not have to be any specific colour.\nIt is not permitted for the couple to exchange rings,\n    because this is an innovation that has been newly invented in the religion,\n    and is even worse if the man wears a gold ring because gold is forbidden for\n    men in Islam. It is mustahabb (recommended) for women in particular to sing\n    at weddings and to use the daff (hand-drum), but not any other kind of\n    musical instruments.\nIt is not permissible for men and women to mix, at weddings\n    or at any other time, or for the groom to sit with his bride in front of the\n    women.\nIf the women are alone and no men can see them, it is\n    permissible for them to dance, so long as this will not cause undue\n    provocation of desires.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Muslim and non-Muslim weddings can differ significantly in their customs, rituals, and underlying religious significance. Here are some key differences:\n\n### 1. **Religious Significance:**\n   - **Muslim Weddings:** These weddings are typically conducted under the principles of Islam, emphasizing the spiritual union between two individuals. The marriage contract, known as **Nikah**, is a religious obligation and is often accompanied by recitations from the Quran.\n   - **Non-Muslim Weddings:** The significance of the wedding may vary widely depending on the religion or belief system. For example, Christian weddings may involve church ceremonies and the exchange of vows before God, while secular weddings may focus more on personal commitments rather than religious doctrines.\n\n### 2. **Ceremony Structure:**\n   - **Muslim Weddings:** The Nikah ceremony generally includes the presence of two witnesses and a religious officiant (Imam). It often features the reading of verses from the Quran, the declaration of consent, and the signing of the marriage contract.\n   - **Non-Muslim Weddings:** The structure can vary significantly. Some may have a religious leader performing the ceremony, while others may be officiated by a judge or a celebrant, and may or may not include religious texts.\n\n### 3. **Marriage Contract:**\n   - **Muslim Weddings:** The marriage contract is a crucial component, detailing the rights and obligations of both partners. This contract may also specify a **Mahr** (mandatory marital gift from the groom to the bride).\n   - **Non-Muslim Weddings:** The contractual aspect may not have the same religious connotations. While legal documents are signed in secular marriages, they might not carry the same theological weight.\n\n### 4. **Cultural Traditions:**\n   - **Muslim Weddings:** These can vary widely by culture and region but may include specific customs like the **Henna night** (Mehndi), where the bride's hands and sometimes feet are adorned with intricate designs. Celebrations can involve large family gatherings and distinct cultural practices.\n   - **Non-Muslim Weddings:** Traditions vary extensively based on cultural backgrounds; for example, in Hindu weddings, rituals like **Saptapadi** (seven steps) play a critical role, while Western weddings might include the exchange of rings and a wedding cake.\n\n### 5. **Role of Community:**\n   - **Muslim Weddings:** The community plays a significant role; the marriage is seen as a social contract that involves not just the couple but their families and communities.\n   - **Non-Muslim Weddings:** While community involvement can be significant, especially in religious contexts, secular weddings might focus more on the couple's themes or personal choices.\n\n### 6. **Gender Roles and Responsibilities:**\n   - **Muslim Weddings:** The roles and responsibilities of husband and wife can have specific religious guidelines, grounded in Islamic teachings.\n   - **Non-Muslim Weddings:** Gender roles may vary widely and can be influenced by personal beliefs, cultural traditions, or feminist ideals.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the essential purpose of celebrating love and partnership is common to both Muslim and non-Muslim weddings, the differences in religious significance, ceremony structure, cultural traditions, and community involvement highlight the diverse ways in which societies celebrate marriage. Each tradition reflects the values and beliefs specific to that community or faith."

        "question": "She does not want to go through another bad\r\n    marriage",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The information you have stated about this\n    second person is not encouraging. The fact that he calls a non-mahram woman on a daily\n    basis is cause for suspicion. It is not necessary to call her every in order to find out\n    her opinion and her response. The promises that he spoke about may be genuine or may not\n    be. Hence our advice to you is as follows:\nTry to ask others about him, and about the new situation he claims to be\n    in. Maybe you will find that he has some righteous female relatives who will be able to\n    give you some useful pointers. Of course, asking questions and checking information will\n    take time, but that does not matter, because of the seriousness of the issue. If, after\n    you have found out about the mosque where he prays, the classes he attends, or the books\n    and tapes he reads and listens to, you feel that he is most likely sincere and if you feel\n    that you are able to cope with the possibility of a second failed marriage – Allaah\n    forbid – and that it would not be too great a loss if you were to leave him after\n    discovering that he is a hypocrite and a cheat, then we see no reason why you should not\n    marry him. You can set out conditions and make clear requests in the marriage contract,\n    such as requiring that he do all the prayers on time, and give up major sins like drinking\n    alcohol, committing immoral actions, and so on. Tell him that you are going to take him at\n    face value and deal with him on that basis. Also, do not forget to pray Istikhaarah. We\n    ask Allaah to help you make the right decision and to guide you. May Allaah bless our\n    Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the decision to marry is significant, and individuals are encouraged to consider their choices carefully. If someone has experienced a difficult marriage and is hesitant about entering another one, this is a valid concern. \n\nIt is important for anyone in this situation to seek guidance and support, whether through family, friends, or counseling. Taking time to heal from past experiences is also crucial. In Islam, marriage is built on mutual respect, understanding, and compatibility, so it is essential to carefully contemplate the qualities one seeks in a partner.\n\nAdditionally, it is encouraged to pray for guidance (Salat al-Istikhara) when making important decisions, including marriage. This prayer can help in seeking clarity and divine assistance in making the right choice.\n\nUltimately, it is essential to prioritize personal well-being and ensure that the next step taken is one that fosters a healthy and supportive relationship."

        "question": "He wants to commit suicide because they rejected his marriage proposal",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\"And do not kill yourselves. Surely, Allaah is Most merciful to you. And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire\" [al-Nisa' 4:29-30]\n\nNo matter what psychological pressure or extreme distress befalls him, the Muslim cannot go ahead and kill himself, because he knows that the punishment for that is Hell and a painful torment, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\n\"Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself, he will be in the Fire of Hell throwing himself down for ever and ever. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will have the poison in his hand, drinking it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron [a weapon] will have that piece of iron in his hand, stabbing himself in the stomach with it in the Fire of Hell forever and ever.\" (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5778).\n\nStarving oneself to death by refusing food is also a kind of suicide and deliberately killing oneself. How can a Muslim who believes in Allaah and the Last Day think of trying to move from the suffering of this world to the suffering of the Hereafter, which is more severe and more long-lasting? No sane person would do this. And for what? For a woman, when you could always find another woman to marry, for there are many women besides this one. Moreover, circumstances may change, and they may change their minds and agree to the marriage after a while. You could look for a college or school in your country that is only for women, which your wife could join, and that would solve a part of the problem. Whatever the case, you have to seek the help of Allaah and persevere with sabr (patience).\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\"And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\" [al-Talaaq 65:2]\n\"Allaah will grant after hardship, ease.\" [al-Talaaq 65:7]\n\nWe also suggest that you refer to the book \"Alhomoom - Dealing with Worries and Stress\", which is to be found on this web-site, and put into practise some of the things described therein, to calm you down and restore your equilibrium. Allaah is the One Whom We ask to relieve your distress and grief. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace.",

        "question": "Her husband did\r\n    not respect her family and divorced her after the nikaah but before the wedding party",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The parents have great rights, but the husband has a\n    greater right. It is not permissible for either party to abuse the rights of the other. If\n    the wife thinks that her husband has wronged her parents, she should advise him and remind\n    him that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning),  and live with them\n    [wives] honourably [al-Nisa 4:19] includes treating her family well\n    too, because that makes her happy, and it includes not harming them, because that upsets\n    her. By the same token, if one or both of her parents abuse her husbands rights, she\n    should advise them and remind them of the seriousness of backbiting, wrongdoing and\n    aggression. If they order her to do something and her husband orders her to do the\n    opposite, then her husband takes precedence, because his rights are greater in\n    shareeah. This does not mean that she should forget about their rights; this is the\n    guideline she should follow in cases where there is a conflict.\nWith regard to your second question, it is not haraam according to\n    shareeah for a man to have intercourse with his wife after the nikaah (conclusion of\n    the marriage contract) and before the wedding party. Whatever happened after the nikaah is\n    halaal (permissible), so there is no scandal involved and no need to fear the\n    consequences. If a man divorces his wife after the marriage has been consummated, then she\n    is entitled to keep the entire mahr (dowry)\nIf it is possible for mediators to try to bring you back together in\n    accordance with shareeah and following the proper etiquette, then this is better.\n    And Allaah is the source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marriage (nikah) is a solemn contract and should be based on mutual respect and understanding. If a husband has divorced his wife after the nikah but before the wedding party, it is important to consider the circumstances and the intentions involved.\n\n1. **Validity of Divorce**: If the divorce was pronounced according to the Islamic rules (with the proper intention and process), then the divorce is valid, regardless of whether or not the wedding party took place. There is no specific requirement for a wedding party to validate the marriage or the divorce.\n\n2. **Respecting Family**: Islam emphasizes the importance of respecting one’s spouse and their family. If a husband shows disrespect towards his wife’s family, it can create significant issues within the marriage. Islam encourages communication and resolution of conflicts in a respectful manner.\n\n3. **Rights and Responsibilities**: Both spouses have rights and responsibilities towards each other. If the husband failed to respect his wife's family and this led to divorce, it could be seen as a failure to fulfill his obligations.\n\nIn cases like this, it is advisable for both parties to seek guidance from knowledgeable religious authorities or counselors to address their specific situation and ensure that their rights and interests are protected in accordance with Islamic teachings. Additionally, seeking reconciliation is encouraged in Islam, as divorce is regarded as a last resort."

It is not permissible for anyone who receives a letter in which Allah is mentioned or an aayah of the Qur’aan is quoted to throw it into the garbage or put it in any undesirable place. The same applies to newspapers and other similar papers: it is not permitted to mishandle them or throw them in the garbage, or to use them to wrap food or other things, because the name of Allah is mentioned in them.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, writing \"Bismillaah ir-Rahmaaan ir-Raheem\" (In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) is a way to invoke Allah's blessings at the beginning of any important activity, including wedding invitations. It is permissible to include this phrase on wedding invitations as it reflects a good intention and seeks Allah’s blessings for the event.

If you are able to treat both wives equally, then\n    respond to your parents request to marry the cousin you mention. This is included in\n    the words of the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning):  then marry\n    (other) women of your choice, two or three or four [al-Nisa 4:3].

Try in all cases to\n    please your parents. And Allaah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of marriage is significant, and it is generally encouraged that individuals seek their parents' blessings and approval in their choice of a spouse. However, it is also understood that individuals have the right to choose whom they marry, and this choice should be made based on mutual consent, compatibility, and shared values.\n\nIf a person chooses to marry someone other than the spouse their parents wanted, it is advisable for them to communicate openly with their parents, explaining their reasons for their choice. Parents often have their children's best interests at heart, though their preferences may not always align with the children's feelings or choices.\n\nWhile it is respectful to consider the wishes of one's parents, the central tenets of Islamic marriage emphasize mutual consent between the two individuals entering the marriage. Ultimately, the decision should be made in a manner that maintains family ties and respects the values of both parties involved.\n\nIn summary, marrying someone other than the partner preferred by parents is permissible in Islam, provided that both individuals agree to the marriage and it is conducted in accordance with Islamic principles.

This will solve \n  all the problems, from making the marriage valid, through giving a united direction \n  to the future upbringing of the children, to attaining success and happiness \n  in the Hereafter. Your feelings of unease about taking this step may be due \n  to the difficulty of leaving behind what you are used to and the religion that \n  you have grown up in, or reluctance to go against your family and relatives, \n  or fear of hostility and criticism from others, or concern about losing some \n  worldly advantages. But all these issues will be easily overcome when you seek \n  the help of Allaah and are determined to follow the truth. The wise person is \n  prepared to make sacrifices and put up with difficulties for the sake of following \n  the truth, because the truth is worth pursuing. Any difficulties encountered \n  will become easy because the result is happiness in this world and the next, \n  and Paradise the width of heaven and earth. Moreover, your marriage will help \n  you to live in love and harmony with your husband (if he repents to Allaah for \n  the forbidden relationship and becomes a religious person of good morals) and \n  his Muslim family. There will be no dispute as to which religion the children \n  will be raised in, and they will not feel that there is any conflict in the \n  family, so they will be able to grow up free of the psychological complexes \n  that result from the parents difference of religion. Other people have \n  felt something similar to the feelings that you are experiencing now, as is \n  reflected in the following story, which happened at the time of the Prophet \n  of Islam  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n  him).

The mere intention of marriage\n    does not justify uncovering in front of him. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of appearing before one's fiancé (fiancée) before the wedding (nikaah) is subject to certain guidelines and principles. Generally, interactions between a man and woman who are not mahram (non-related) are governed by rules of modesty and propriety.\n\n1. **Engagement vs. Nikaah**: Prior to the nikaah, a couple is considered to be in a state of engagement. During this time, the fiancé and fiancée can meet and get to know each other, but the interactions should remain appropriate. This means that while they are allowed to spend time together, there should still be a level of decorum maintained.\n\n2. **Permissibility**: It is generally permissible for prospective spouses to meet, provided that they observe Islamic guidelines (e.g., dressing modestly, avoiding being alone together in private settings). Such meetings can serve to assess compatibility and to understand each other's values and beliefs, which is important for a successful marriage.\n\n3. **Intention**: The intention of meeting should be sincere, with the goal of marriage in mind. This is an important aspect; the relationship should be aimed toward a halal (permissible) outcome, which is marriage.\n\n4. **Involvement of Family**: It is often encouraged to involve families in the engagement process. Family support and involvement can pave the way for a mutual understanding and assist in making the relationship healthy and respectful.\n\n5. **Respect and Boundaries**: Both parties should adhere to Islamic codes of conduct while interacting. This includes being respectful, understanding boundaries, and avoiding any form of intimacy that is not allowed before marriage.\n\nOverall, while it is permissible for fiancés to meet before their wedding, it should be done in a way that respects Islamic values and principles.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the institution of marriage is regarded highly, and it is encouraged to seek the approval of parents when considering a marital partner. However, there are several important principles to consider in a situation where one wishes to marry someone but faces parental disapproval:\n\n1. **Respect and Communication**: It is crucial to communicate with your parents and understand their concerns regarding your choice. Engaging in respectful dialogue may help clarify misunderstandings or misconceptions they might have about the woman you wish to marry.\n\n2. **Consultation and Counseling**: Seeking advice from knowledgeable and trustworthy individuals, such as family elders or community leaders, can be beneficial. They can provide guidance and mediate discussions between you and your parents.\n\n3. **Understanding Valid Reasons**: If the disapproval is based on valid reasons (e.g., differences in faith, character, or other significant concerns), it is advisable to take these seriously and reflect on them. In Islam, choosing a spouse who shares similar values and beliefs is important.\n\n4. **Personal Agency**: While parental approval is significant, Islam recognizes individual choice. If you are certain that the woman is a good partner and the reasons for disapproval are not valid or are based on cultural biases rather than Islamic principles, you may choose to proceed with the marriage. However, doing so should be approached with caution and respect for family ties.\n\n5. **Prayer and Seeking Guidance**: Engaging in supplication (dua) and seeking guidance from Allah (SWT) is essential when making a decision about marriage. Ask for clarity, wisdom, and the best outcome for all parties involved.\n\n6. **Mutual Understanding and Patience**: If the marriage is meant to be, it may take time for your parents to come to accept your choice. Patience and ongoing communication can help nurture their understanding and acceptance over time.\n\nIn conclusion, while parental approval is valued in Islam, balancing that with personal choice and the pursuit of a good, righteous partner is important. It is vital to approach the situation with care, respect, and a commitment to fulfilling Islamic principles."

We have created you from a male and a female, \n  and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another  \n  i.e., that they may know one another by referring to their tribes.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the relationship between a son and his mother is highly significant, and showing kindness and respect to one's parents is a fundamental principle. However, Islam also emphasizes the importance of justice, fairness, and treating others with respect, regardless of their background or origins.\n\nIn this situation, it is essential for the son to navigate the dynamics with sensitivity and wisdom. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Respect for Parents**: The son should continue to show respect and kindness to his mother, as long as it does not lead to wrongdoing or injustice.\n\n2. **Communicate**: The son might consider having a respectful conversation with his mother. He can express his feelings and invite her to see the positive qualities of the woman he loves, while emphasizing that a person's worth should not be judged based solely on their origins.\n\n3. **Advocate for Justice**: It's important to stand against any form of unjust discrimination or disrespect. The son should gently remind his mother that Islam teaches love and understanding among people, and that one's lineage or background should not determine their value.\n\n4. **Seek Guidance**: The son might benefit from the advice of knowledgeable individuals, such as community leaders or scholars, who can provide guidance on how to approach the situation in accordance with Islamic principles.\n\n5. **Prayer and Patience**: Lastly, turning to Allah in prayer, asking for guidance, and being patient can help in navigating this challenging situation. \n\nUltimately, the son must balance his love and respect for his mother with his desire for fairness and respect for the woman he loves."

        "question": "Wants to marry a\r\n    girl but his father does not approve of her",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This question requires that we offer advice to both of you. Firstly, to\n    your father, who you say is preventing you from marrying this girl whom you describe as\n    religious and well-mannered. He has to allow you to marry her, unless he has some\n    legitimate Islamic reason, which he should explain to you to convince you and put your\n    mind at rest. He should also put himself in your shoes: if his own father prevented him\n    from marrying a religious and well-mannered girl whom he liked, would he not feel\n    resentful about this denial of his freedom? If he would not like his father to do such a\n    thing to him, how can he do this to his son? As the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of\n    Allaah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until he likes for his brother\n    what he likes for himself.”\nIt is not right for your father to prevent you from marrying this girl\n    with no legitimate Islamic reason. If there is a reason, he should explain it to you so\n    that you will understand what is going on. \nOur advice to you is this: if you can possibly change your mind and\n    find another girl to marry, in order to please your father, maintain family unity and\n    avoid division, then do so.\nBut you may find that you cannot do that, because your heart is\n    attached to this girl, and you cannot bear the thought of marrying anyone else. You may\n    also be afraid that if you choose another girl, your father might object to that marriage\n    too, because some parents may try to force their son to marry a relative, or a woman whose\n    qualities the father likes but the son does not. Some parents may feel jealousy or envy\n    even towards their own children, so they prevent them from doing what they want to do. If\n    this is the case, then there is no sin on you if you marry her, even if your father\n    objects. Perhaps after you are married, your father may change his mind. We ask Allaah to\n    help you make the right choice.",
        "predicted_answer": "Marriage in Islam is a significant and serious commitment, and family approval is often considered important. If a young man wishes to marry a girl but faces opposition from his father, here are some steps he might consider:\n\n1. **Seek Understanding**: The young man should first try to understand his father's reasons for disapproval. Engaging in a respectful conversation can help clarify the father’s concerns.\n\n2. **Communication**: After understanding the father's concerns, he can address them directly. He should present his reasons for wanting to marry the girl and provide assurances regarding their compatibility and future.\n\n3. **Involve Mediators**: Sometimes, involving a trusted family member or an elder can help mediate the situation. This person can provide a different perspective and help facilitate a constructive dialogue.\n\n4. **Assess Compatibility**: Both parties should reflect on the compatibility of the individuals involved. Ensure that the girl possesses qualities that align with Islamic values and what the young man seeks in a spouse.\n\n5. **Consult Scholars**: Seeking advice from knowledgeable scholars (Ulama) can provide guidance based on Islamic teachings. They may offer insights into the importance of family consent while also addressing individual circumstances.\n\n6. **Evaluate Priorities**: The young man should reflect on the importance of family approval versus his feelings for the girl. Islamic teachings encourage seeking a balance between personal desires and parental guidance.\n\n7. **Dua (Prayer)**: Making dua for guidance and a resolution to the situation is crucial. Asking Allah for clarity and support can provide peace of mind.\n\n8. **Respect Decisions**: Ultimately, if the father remains adamant, the young man may need to respect his father’s decision while continuing to seek understanding and, if appropriate, keep the lines of communication open.\n\nIn cases where the young man believes strongly that the relationship is right and beneficial, he can explore other avenues according to Islamic principles but should do so with great care and respect for parental authority."

        "question": "Consummation of Marriage and Etiquettes",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.How to consummate marriage in Islam\nWhen a Muslim wants to consummate his marriage , a number of things are recommended in the sunnah:\n\nHe should treat his bride kindly and gently, like offering her something to drink and so on, because of the hadith narrated by Asma bint Yazid ibn al-Sakan, who said: “I prepared ‘Aishah as a bride when she married the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). I came to him and invited him to see her (uncover her face). So he came and sat beside her, and a large cup of milk was brought to him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drank some, then offered it to her, but she lowered her head and felt shy. I rebuked her and said: ‘Take it from the hand of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ So she took it and drank a little, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her, ‘Give some to your companion (meaning himself).’” (Reported by Imam Ahmad and deemed sahih by al-Albani)\n\nHe should place his hand on his bride’s head and pray for her, saying “Bismillah” and asking for barakah (blessing), saying the words reported in the hadith narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you marries a woman or buys a servant, let him say: ‘Allahumma inni as-aluka khayraha wa khayra ma jabaltaha ‘alayhi wa a’udhu bika min sharriha wa min sharri ma jabaltaha ‘alayhi (O Allah, I ask You for her goodness and the goodness which You have created in her, and I seek refuge with You from her evil and the evil which You have created in her).’” Abu Dawud said that Abu Sa’id added: “Then let him take hold of her forelock and pray for blessing from this woman or servant.” (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Nikah, Bab fi jami’ al-nikah; classed as hasan in Sahih al-Jaami’, no. 341)\n\nHe should pray two rak’ahs with her, leading her in prayer, because this is reported as being the practice of the salaf (early generations). There are two reports concerning this. (i) from Abu Sa’id, the freed slave of Abu Usayd, which states that a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught him and told him: “When your wife comes in to you, pray two rak’ahs and ask Allah for the goodness of what has come to you, and seek refuge with Him from its evil.” (ii) from Shaqiq, who said: “A man called Abu Hariz came and said (to ‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud, may Allah be pleased with him): ‘I have married a young virgin girl, but I am afraid that she may hate me.’ ‘Abdullah said: ‘Love comes from Allah and hatred comes from Shaytan, who wants to make you hate what Allah has made permissible. When she comes to you, tell her to pray two rak’ahs behind you.’” (These two reports were narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah; see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani).\nWhen he wants to consummate the marriage , he should say the words reported in the hadith reported by Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “When one of you wants to approach (have intercourse with) his wife, if he says: ‘Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna al-Shaytan wa jannib al-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from Shaytan and protect whatever You give to us from Shaytan)’ – then if they are given a child, Shaytan will not harm it.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 3271) (For more information, see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani, p. 91)\n\nIs there a limit to the number of guests in a wedding feast?\nThere is no limit to the number of guests one can invite to a wedding feast (walimah), so invite whoever you wish of your relatives, the bride’s relatives, your friends and anyone you have a good reason to invite.\nMusic in a wedding ceremony: Haram?\nIt is not permitted in Islam to do anything that is haram such as having music , letting men and women mix, or letting women dance in front of men, or other things that earn the wrath of Allah. How can the blessing of Allah be exchanged for disobedience and immorality? \nAt weddings , women can do whatever is allowed in Islam, such as singing acceptable songs with good words or entertaining themselves by playing the daff (a certain kind of drum, resembling a tambourine without the rattles) only, so long as no men are present.\nWho should give the wedding walimah?\nProviding the wedding feast (walimah) is the husband’s responsibility . The sunnah is to slaughter one sheep or more for the guests, if he is able to, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, “Give a wedding feast, even if it is only one sheep.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, no. 2048).\nWe ask Allah to bless you and your bride and to grant you a happy marriage.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the consummation of marriage, or the physical union between husband and wife, is regarded as an important and significant step in the marriage process. It is generally encouraged to be conducted with care, respect, and in accordance with Islamic principles. Here are some key points and etiquettes regarding the consummation of marriage in Islam:\n\n1. **Intention (Niyyah)**: Before consummating the marriage, both spouses should have the intention of fulfilling their religious duties and seeking the pleasure of Allah. This helps in making the act an act of worship.\n\n2. **Privacy**: The consummation should take place in private, ensuring that the couple’s first intimate encounter is respected and kept confidential from others.\n\n3. **Mutual Consent**: Both husband and wife should consent to the consummation. Marriage in Islam is based on mutual respect, love, and understanding, and this extends to their physical relationship.\n\n4. **Kindness and Gentleness**: The husband should treat his wife with kindness, gentleness, and consideration. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of treating one’s spouse with compassion.\n\n5. **Communication**: Open and honest communication between spouses regarding their feelings, desires, and any concerns can foster a healthy physical relationship.\n\n6. **Comfort and Readiness**: It is essential to ensure that both partners feel comfortable and ready for consummation. There should be no pressure on either party.\n\n7. **Du’a (Supplication)**: It is recommended to recite specific supplications before consummating the marriage. One such du’a is: \n   \"Bismillah, Allahumma j'al baynana wa bayna l-harami Assalam wa al-Afiyah.\" (In the name of Allah, Oh Allah, make our union filled with peace and health.)\n\n8. **Gift Giving and Affection**: Showing affection through gentle actions and possibly gift giving to express love and appreciation can enhance the relationship.\n\n9. **Post-Consummation**: After consummation, it is important to continue to show care and affection, fulfilling each other's emotional and physical needs.\n\n10. **Rights and Responsibilities**: Both spouses have rights and responsibilities towards one another, which should be honored and respected. This includes fulfilling physical, emotional, and spiritual needs.\n\nIt is important to approach the topic of consummation with maturity and understanding, recognizing that it is a significant part of the marital relationship in Islam. Each couple may navigate this aspect of their relationship in their own way but should always stick to the principles of respect, kindness, and mutual consent."

        "question": "Premarital sex, and is it the parents’ obligation to arrange marriage for their\r\n    children?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In answer to your second question, to say that it is permissible for a man\n    to engage in a premarital physical relationship (even if it does not include intercourse)\n    with a woman who is not permissible for him, claiming that he intends to marry her in the\n    future, is total and utter nonsense. This can never be allowed by sharee’ah, and\n    there can be no legitimate relationship until after the completion of a legal marriage\n    contract according to Islamic law (i.e., nikaah).\nI sent your first question to Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd\n    al-Rahmaan al-Jibreen, and he wrote back to me with the following answer: \nYes, it is a duty on the father to keep his children\n    chaste by arranging their marriages, and spending on them and clothing them, if he is able\n    to do so. If he is not able to, but the mother, grandfather or grandmother is able, it\n    becomes that person’s duty to arrange the marriage. If the son cannot afford it but\n    he has the ability to earn a living, it is his obligation to do so, in order to keep\n    himself chaste. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, premarital sex is generally considered haram (forbidden). The concept of sexual relations is meant to be enjoyed within the confines of marriage, which is viewed as a sacred contract in Islam. Engaging in premarital sexual relations is discouraged and is seen as contrary to Islamic teachings.\n\nRegarding the obligation of parents to arrange marriages for their children, there is a difference of opinion among scholars. While it is not an obligation, parents do have a significant role in facilitating the marriage process. Islam encourages parents to help their children find suitable spouses, but it also emphasizes the importance of the individuals' consent and choice in the matter. The desire and willingness of both parties are essential components of any marriage in Islam.\n\nUltimately, while parents can guide and assist, the decision to marry should be made with consideration for the preferences and feelings of the individuals involved. Communication, mutual respect, and understanding are key principles in the process."

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is important to remember that a person’s past does not define them, especially after they have sincerely repented for their actions. Repentance (Tawbah) is highly valued in Islam, and Allah's mercy and forgiveness are extensive. \n\nIf you wish to marry a girl who has repented, consider the following points:\n\n1. **Repentance**: Ensure that the girl has genuinely repented. In Islam, true repentance involves feeling remorse for past sins, stopping the sin, and intending never to return to it.\n\n2. **Parental Approval**: While parental guidance and approval are important in matters of marriage, every situation is unique. It's essential to approach the matter sensitively. Speak with your mother to understand her concerns. You can share the positive attributes of the girl, her repentance, and how that reflects her character.\n\n3. **Consultation**: Consider involving a respected elder, scholar, or community leader who can provide perspective to both you and your mother. Sometimes, an impartial voice can help mediate disagreements.\n\n4. **Importance of Character**: In Islam, a person's character and piety are crucial for marriage. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized looking for these qualities over social status or past mistakes.\n\n5. **Making a Decision**: Ultimately, it's your decision. If you believe that the girl is a good match for you and her past does not affect her current character and faith, you have the right to pursue the marriage. However, doing so with respect for your mother’s opinions is important.\n\n6. **Dua (Supplication)**: Make dua for guidance in your decision. Ask Allah to open your mother’s heart and make the path easy for you if this marriage is the best for you both.\n\nNavigating family concerns about marriage can be challenging, but maintaining open communication and showing respect for both your feelings and your mother’s concerns is key."

This includes discussions about wedding planning, dowry (mahr), and any other arrangements.\n   - **Getting to Know Each Other**: The couple may have opportunities to get to know each other better in a supervised environment, with family present, to build a connection before the marriage contract.\n   - **Dua and Istikhara**: It is recommended that both individuals and their families make dua (supplication) and seek guidance from Allah (Istikhara) during this time.\n\n2. **Between Marriage Contract and Wedding Party**:\n   - **Nikah Ceremony**: The formal marriage contract (nikah) is conducted, which typically includes the reading of certain verses from the Quran, the offering of marriage by the groom, acceptance by the bride, and the agreement on the mahr.\n   - **Understanding Rights and Responsibilities**: After the nikah, there is a focus on understanding the rights and responsibilities of each spouse as outlined in Islamic teachings.\n   - **Celebrating with the Walimah**: The wedding party, or walimah, is a celebration that follows the nikah.

        "question": "Fighting for love",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.A Muslim man is permitted to marry anyone he likes of the women whom\n    Allaah has allowed him to marry, but he is encouraged to marry a Muslim woman who is\n    religious and has a good moral character (because this is the basis of true happiness).\n    Similarly, he is permitted to marry a chaste woman of the People of the Book, i.e., Jews\n    and Christians. Another basis for a happy marriage is that his parents should be pleased\n    with his choice of bride, and part of the way in which parents show their love and\n    kindness towards their son is by helping him to get married, whether financially or in\n    other ways. As regards what you say about striving and fighting for the sake of love, we\n    should stop and think about this matter carefully. We believe that feeling love for a\n    particular woman is not the be-all and end-all in a Muslim’s life, for which he\n    should give up everything that matters to him. No way! The Muslim is wise and pays\n    attention to everything that is in his interests, such as the woman’s religious\n    commitment and moral character, his parents’ approval, his own honour and reputation\n    among people, the future of the marriage and its potential to endure, whether any bad\n    things will result from his marriage to a particular woman and whether this outweighs his\n    interests, the environment in which the children of the marriage will grow up, the nature\n    of his future in-laws with whom he will have to mix, etc. It is not the matter of a\n    fleeting desire, rather it is the matter of one’s future and eventual destiny. \nFinally, we say that the love of a woman is not\n    some god to be worshipped, rather it is a matter that is governed by the laws of the One\n    God, Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of love encompasses a broad range of emotions, including love for Allah, love for the Prophets, love for family, and love for humanity. However, the idea of \"fighting for love\" can be understood in different contexts.\n\n1. **Sacrificing for Love**: In many teachings of Islam, sacrificing for the sake of loved ones or for Allah's sake is encouraged. This can mean making sacrifices in terms of time, effort, and even personal desires for the betterment of a loved one or community.\n\n2. **Defending Love**: If love pertains to defending one’s spouse, family, or community, Islam permits fighting in the context of self-defense or protecting one's rights and loved ones. The concept of \"Jihad\" means to strive or struggle, and can encompass both personal struggle and physical defense when necessary.\n\n3. **Unjust Fighting**: It’s important to note that fighting that results in harm, oppression, or aggression without just cause contradicts Islamic principles. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized compassion, justice, and peace.\n\n4. **Emotional and Spiritual Love**: Romantic relationships should be approached within the guidelines of Islam—emphasizing respect, consent, and lawful conduct, such as marriage. Pursuing love should not lead to actions that contradict Islamic teachings.\n\nIn summary, \"fighting for love\" must be examined in the context of what type of love is being referred to and whether the means of fighting is just and aligned with Islamic principles. Ultimately, Islam promotes love based on compassion, justice, and mutual respect rather than conflict."

In response to your question, if the\n    marriage was contracted through an offer or proposal (eejaab) from the walee\n    (guardian) of the bride and acceptance (qabool) on the part of the groom, with the\n    consent of the bride, in front of two Muslim witnesses of good character (as regards\n    piety, attitude, conduct, etc.), then the marriage contract is valid. Ibn Qudaamah (may\n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: “A marriage is not properly contracted unless there\n    are two Muslim witnesses, regardless of whether the bride and groom are both Muslims or\n    only the groom is. This is what Ahmad stated, and it is also the opinion of\n    al-Shaafi’i.” (Al-Mughni, 9/349; al-Mufaddal fi Ahkaam\n    al-Mar’ah, 6/120).\n    If the marriage was conducted as described above, then it is valid,\n    otherwise it must be repeated. It is permissible for a non-Muslim woman to be married by\n    her non-Muslim guardian, but if she becomes Muslim, this role can only be played by a\n    Muslim. If she has no Muslim walee, then this role can be delegated to the director of the\n    Islamic Centre or whoever is acting in his stead. As regards the children who were born\n    during this time, they are the children of the man and should be given his name, as is the\n    ruling in cases where there is uncertainty of this nature.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",

The important aspect here is her sincere acceptance of Islam and the declaration of faith (Shahada).\n\n2. **Marriage Status**: The marriage to her Christian husband can remain valid as long as the husband is a practicing Christian and he agrees. However, if she intends to marry a Muslim man after her conversion, she would need to follow Islamic guidelines, which typically includes the need for the marriage to be conducted according to Islamic law.\n\n3. **Interfaith Marriage**: In Islam, a Muslim woman is traditionally not permitted to marry a non-Muslim man unless he converts to Islam. This might require her to approach her situation with a clear understanding of Islamic teachings and possibly discuss the matter with knowledgeable individuals (Ulama) in her community.\n\n4. **Seeking Guidance**: It is advisable for her to consult a knowledgeable Imam or community leader to provide guidance based on her specific circumstances, including the validity of her marriage, the rights and obligations of both spouses, and any necessary steps she may need to undertake following her conversion.\n\nIn summary, her conversion to Islam is acknowledged and should be recognized, and she should seek proper guidance regarding her previous marriage and future relationships within the context of her new faith."

This is typically done in Arabic: for the groom, \"Qabiltu al-nikah,\" meaning \"I accept the marriage,\" and similarly for the bride.\n\n6. **Dua (Supplications)**: The officiant may also lead the congregation in making dua for the couple, asking Allah to bless their union with love, mercy, and offspring.\n\n7. **Final Blessing**: The ceremony often concludes with a supplication asking for the couple's happiness and prosperity.\n\nIt is important to note that while customs may vary by region and culture, these elements form the core of a typical Islamic marriage ceremony. It is always advisable to consult with knowledgeable local scholars or community leaders for specific practices and traditions that may apply."

        "question": "Asking about a person’s past",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If you want to look for a wife for someone, or a husband for a woman, then\n    you can ask him about his wishes, such as the desired age, level of education, employment\n    situation, country and origin and position of the family, and whether he has any\n    preferences about her general appearance, such as skin colour, height, etc. The most\n    important characteristic to ask about is a person’s level of commitment to Islam.\n    This kind of useful question is fine.\nBut asking for details of a person’s past and wanting to know what\n    sins they might have committed when they were ignorant about Islam – this is not\n    right at all. Allaah covers people’s sins and loves to see them covered (i.e., not\n    dragged out into the open). So long as a person has repented, his sins have been wiped\n    out. Islam deletes whatever came before, so why should we ask questions that will only\n    embarrass people? Allaah accepts people’s repentance without their having to confess\n    or expose their sins to any other person. A number of the Sahaabah had committed adultery\n    and murder repeatedly, or had buried infant girls alive, or stolen things, but when they\n    entered Islam they were the best of people. No one needs to be reminded of a shameful\n    past; it is over and done with, and Allaah is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. What\n    matters when considering a person for marriage is how that person is now: is he righteous\n    or not? Has he cut all ties with his past and his wrong deeds, or not? If he is clearly\n    living a good and righteous life now, then it is wrong to dig up the past. If there is any\n    fear of anything that could have future implications, such as certain diseases and so on,\n    then there are medical tests which can give the answer and put your mind at rest.\nAs far as giving a detailed description of a prospective wife to someone\n    is concerned, this can be done in writing: one of her mahram relatives (i.e. a blood\n    relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden) or a woman who knows her can write\n    down a description, then a trustworthy person can deliver it to one who is seriously\n    considering a marriage proposal. The Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon\n    him) said: “No woman should describe another woman to her husband as if he can see\n    her.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4839)\n    The wisdom behind this prohibition is the fact that a\n    husband might like the sound of what he hears, so he may divorce the one who described the\n    other to him, or there may be temptation to do wrong. (Commentary on the above\n    hadeeth in Fath al-Baari).\n    We ask Allaah to help us all to do that which He loves and\n    will earn His pleasure. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, asking about a person's past can be sensitive and should be approached with care. The general principle is that it is not appropriate to pry into someone's past, especially if it involves asking about their sins or mistakes. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised against digging into the faults and sins of others, stating, \"Whoever conceals the fault of a Muslim, Allah will conceal his faults on the Day of Resurrection\" (Sahih Muslim).\n\nHowever, there are contexts where asking about someone's past may be relevant, such as in matters of marriage or when assessing someone's character for a position of trust. In these cases, it's important to maintain a respectful and compassionate approach, ensuring that the intention is to understand and support rather than to judge or condemn.\n\nUltimately, Islam emphasizes mercy, forgiveness, and the importance of not judging others based solely on their past. It encourages believers to focus on the present and future and to support each other in personal growth and improvement."

        "question": "Shaking hands etc. after nikaah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nThe answer is, yes, all of this is permitted, even if it happens before the wedding \nparty, so long as the contract has been drawn up according to Sharee’ah, with a \nguardian and two witnesses, and the proposal has been given and accepted, and both \nparties consent to the marriage. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, the act of shaking hands after a Nikah (marriage contract) is not explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an or Hadith as a religious obligation or practice. The customs surrounding marriage, including gestures like shaking hands, can vary significantly based on cultural practices rather than strict religious mandates. \n\nIn many cultures, it is common for newlyweds to greet family and friends with a handshake or embrace as a celebration of their marriage. However, it is important to consider the principles of modesty and appropriate interactions between genders in Islamic teachings.\n\nGenerally, for men and women who are non-mahram (not closely related and hence permissible to marry), touching or shaking hands should be avoided due to Islamic guidelines on maintaining modesty. In contrast, for mahram relatives (close relatives like parents, siblings, etc.), physical gestures such as hugs or handshakes are typically considered acceptable.\n\nIt’s advisable for the couple and their families to consider their own cultural practices and Islamic guidelines when deciding on post-Nikah gestures. If there are any uncertainties, seeking the counsel of knowledgeable scholars or local leaders is recommended to ensure actions align with one’s faith."

        "question": "Father preventing his son from marrying because he needs his help \r\nto take care of siblings",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nIf the son will commit haraam acts if he does not get married, then the father has no \nright to prevent him from getting married for the reason stated in the question. Allaah \nis the Provider and those brothers and sisters are part of His creation; He will never \nforsake them. Allaah has promised to help the one who gets married in order to keep \nhimself chaste. He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\"And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and a \nwoman who has no husband) and (also marry) the saalihoon (pious, fit and \ncapable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be \npoor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His \ncreatures’ needs, All-Knowing (about the state of the people).\"\n[al-Noor 24:32]\nThe Messenger of Allaah \n said: \"There are three to whom Allaah’s help is due: the \nmujaahid who goes out to fight for the sake of Allaah; the slaves who makes a \ncontract with his master to pay installments towards his freedom; and the one who \ngets married because he wants to remain chaste.\" (al-Tirmidhi, no. 1566. Abu ‘Eesaa said: this \nis a hasan hadeeth. See also Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 3050).\nBut if the son is able to be patient and give himself up to working and helping his \nfather to provide for his brothers and sisters, then he will be rewarded, for Allaah \nnever allows the reward of those who do good to be lost.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, marrying is considered a highly encouraged act for individuals who are of age and able to fulfill the responsibilities of marriage. It is also important to recognize the significance of family ties and responsibilities in Islam. \n\nA father may feel the need for his son's assistance in caring for younger siblings, which is a valid concern. However, preventing a son from marrying solely based on this need may not be justified from an Islamic perspective. The son has his own rights and needs, including the right to marry and form his own family.\n\nIslam teaches the importance of balancing family responsibilities with personal rights. The father should look for ways to manage family responsibilities without obstructing the son’s right to marry. Encouraging the son to marry might actually benefit the family as the new spouse can also contribute to the household.\n\nUltimately, open communication between the father and son is essential. They should have a discussion about the concerns at hand, exploring all possible options that respect both the son’s desire to marry and the family needs. Seeking advice from a knowledgeable person or an Islamic scholar may also provide guidance in finding a suitable resolution. \n\nIn summary, while family responsibilities are important, they should not be a barrier to an individual's right to marry."

        "question": "Divorced wife due to her family’s use of sihr (magic or witchcraft)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nWhat I advise you to do is to put your trust in Allaah and hasten to remarry. Nothing will harm \nyou so long as you put your trust in Allaah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \". . . \nAnd whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. . .\" [al-Talaaq 65:3]\nBut this time you should make the effort to check out your future wife and her family very \ncarefully. Take a lesson from your past experience, for the Prophet SAWS (peace and \nblessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The believer should not stung from the same hole \ntwice.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 6133).\nSomething that may help you not to worry is the fact that it appears from your question that the \nfault lay with your ex-wife, and not with you. So you must strive to recite the verses of the \nQuraan which offer protection (muawwidhaat i.e., Surat al-Falaq and Surat al-Naas) \nimmediately after each prayer and before sleeping, blow into your hands when you recite them, \nand wipe your face and body with your hands. \nMay Allaah protect you and us from all evil.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the practice of sihr (magic or witchcraft) is strictly prohibited and considered a serious sin. If a husband finds that his wife's family is involved in such practices, and it is affecting their marriage, he may feel justified in seeking divorce. \n\nHowever, it is crucial to approach such sensitive matters with careful consideration. The act of divorcing should not be taken lightly; it involves significant emotional, social, and spiritual implications. Here are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Evidence and Clarity**: Before taking any drastic actions like divorce, it's important to have clear evidence of such practices and their impact on the marriage. Mere suspicion should not be a basis for divorce.\n\n2. **Consultation**: It is advisable to consult knowledgeable scholars (Ulama) or a trusted person with experience in marital and Islamic matters. They can help assess the situation better and provide guidance based on Sharia.\n\n3. **Seeking Help**: If magic or witchcraft is suspected to be affecting one's life, the affected person is encouraged to seek protection through prayer, supplication (du'a), and recitation of Quranic verses known for protection against harm, such as Ayat al-Kursi and the last two verses of Surah Al-Baqarah.\n\n4. **Communication**: It may be beneficial to discuss concerns openly and honestly with the wife, exploring whether the allegations about her family are accurate and how both partners can work together to address them.\n\n5. **Islamic Rights and Duties**: Both parties should remember their rights and responsibilities in marriage, and efforts should be made to overcome challenges together whenever possible.\n\nIf after all means the husband feels that the marriage cannot continue due to the influence of sihr, he can initiate divorce (talaq) following the proper Islamic guidelines. It is important to handle the process respectfully and fairly, ensuring that both parties' rights are considered.\n\nUltimately, each situation is unique, and it should be handled with care, seeking wisdom and guidance from Islamic teachings and knowledgeable individuals."

        "question": "If A Wife Deserts Her Husband Marriage Will Not Be Nullified",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.; \nIf a woman deserts her husband, the marriage contract will not be nullified. It remains valid until \nthe husband divorces the wife, the wife gets a divorce (khul), or the Qaadi (judge ruling \naccording to Islamic shariah) annuls the marriage contract.\nAllaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, a marriage is not automatically nullified if a wife deserts her husband. The general principle is that marriage is a sacred contract, and for it to be nullified, there must be valid grounds recognized by Islamic law. \n\nDesertion, or the act of one spouse abandoning the other, can lead to various consequences and can be grounds for seeking divorce (khula or talaq) by the aggrieved party, but it does not nullify the marriage by itself. The husband may have the right to seek reconciliation, and if not possible, he may initiate divorce proceedings. \n\nHowever, the specifics can vary based on different schools of thought and local laws, so it's advisable for individuals in such situations to consult a knowledgeable scholar or a local imam who can provide guidance based on the particulars of the case and the applicable legal framework."

        "question": "Ruling on Intercourse with a Woman in her rectum",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. \n\nYour apology is accepted. Striving to understand the rulings of Sharee'ah in this and similar matters is not haraam or shameful; it is necessary.\n\nAs regards your question, anal intercourse with one's wife is a major sin, whether it occurs at the time of menstruation or not. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) cursed the one who does this: \"Cursed is the one who approaches his wife in her rectum\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 2/479; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5865).\n\nThe Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) also said: \"The one who has intercourse with a menstruating woman, or with a woman in her rectum, or who goes to a fortune-teller, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1/243; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5918).\n\nIn spite of the fact that many wives of sound nature refuse this, there are some husbands who threaten their wives with divorce if they do not obey them (in this matter), and some even deceive their wives, who are too shy to ask scholars about it, into thinking that it is permissible. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said that a man may approach his wife in any way he likes, from the front or the back, so long as intercourse takes place in the place from through which a child is born. There is no doubt that the rectum is the place from which waste matter is expelled, not the place from which a child is born.\n\nAnother reason why some may commit this immoral act is that they enter upon what should be a clean married life with some jaahili (ignorant) traditions and odd practices, or with memories of scenes from indecent movies, for which they have not repented to Allaah.\n\nIt is known that this act is forbidden even if both partners agree to it. Mutual consent to a haraam deed does not make it halaal.\n\nI ask Allah to bestow upon us a proper understanding of His religion and to make us adhere to its limits, for He is the All-Hearing, the One Who answers prayers.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, intercourse with a woman in her rectum (anal intercourse) is generally considered impermissible (haram) by the majority of scholars and schools of thought. This ruling is based on interpretations of Islamic texts and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nThe Quran and Sunnah encourage sexual relations to be expressed in a manner that is respectful and loving, primarily within the confines of a marital relationship, and traditional teachings emphasize the importance of the marital bed being a source of mutual satisfaction and respect.\n\nThat being said, different scholars and schools may have varying opinions on this matter, so it's always advisable to consult knowledgeable scholars or an authoritative source in one's own community for personalized guidance.\n\nIt is also important to note that any sexual act should be consensual and respectful between partners."

        "question": "No prescribed period for consummating marriage",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. \n\nIf a man executes a valid marriage contract with a woman then it is\npermissible for the two to do as they please between themselves, even with\nonly the contract.  There is no period prescribed by Islamic shari'ah\nbetween the contract and consummation of the marriage, so this issue is up\nto the two partners as to what they decide is most appropriate and in their\nbest interests. \n\nIt is incumbent upon both parties to consider, respect, and ensure the\nother one's personal comfort and ease.  Thus, if the husband sees that the\nwife needs some time to become acclimated and develop their relationship\nand level of intimacy before consummation, such as 3 months, for example,\nhe should do so, and vice versa.  Likewise, it is incumbent upon the wife\nif she sees that her husband feels an urgent need to guard his chastity by\nconsummating the marriage that she should not prolong the period so that he\ndoes not fall into a state of awkward discomfort and difficulty, and vice\nversa.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, there is no prescribed or fixed period for consummating a marriage. The consummation of marriage, which is the act of sexual intercourse, is encouraged to occur when both spouses are ready and comfortable. It is important that both parties agree and consent to this important aspect of their relationship.\n\nCommunication between husband and wife is crucial, and cultural practices may also influence the timing of consummation. However, there are no specific Islamic texts that mandate a certain timeframe for when this must take place after the marriage contract (nikah) is completed.\n\nUltimately, the timing of consummation should be based on mutual understanding and respect between the spouses."
