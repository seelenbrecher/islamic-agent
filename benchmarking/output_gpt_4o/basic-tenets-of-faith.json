        "question": "Can Babies See the Angels?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is seeing the Angels possible?\nSeeing the angels, in a form other than their true form in which Allah created them, is possible. It is proven that a number of the Companions saw the angels in human form , as was also proven among nations who came before us.\nCan we see the Angles in their real form?\nAs for seeing the angels in their real form , there is no report regarding that except reports which say that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw Jibril [in his real form] twice, and he was stunned by what he saw of his great size in his real form.\nIt was narrated that `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whilst we were with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) one day, a man came to us whose garment was exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black, and there were no signs of travel on him, and none of us knew who he was. He came and sat before the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), resting his knees against his and placing his hands on his thighs. He said: O Muhammad, tell me about Islam…. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O `Umar, do you know who that questioner was?” I said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: “That was Jibril, who came to you to teach you your religion.” (Muslim, 8)\nIt was narrated that Sa`d ibn Abu Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: On the day of Uhud, I saw on the right of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and on his left two men wearing white garments, fighting fiercely to defend him, and I never saw them before or since. (Muslim, 2306) These two men were angels .\nAl-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Al-Nawawi said: From this Hadith, we understand that seeing the angels is not only for the prophets; rather the Companions and the Awliya’ (extremely pious people) have seen them, and they did not fight only on the day of Badr.\" (Sharh Al-Suyuti `ala Muslim 5/317)\nAnother example is Jibril (peace be upon him) appearing to Maryam (peace be upon her), and the Hadith about the angel who appeared to the bald man, the leper and the blind man, and other sound texts.\nCan we see the Jinn?\nSeeing the jinn – also in a form other than their real form – is also possible. Examples of that include the following:\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed me to guard the Ramadan zakah. Someone came and started taking some of the food. I grabbed hold of him and said, ‘I am going to take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!’ He said, ‘Let me be, for I am in need and I have children and am in great need.’ So I let him go. … At the end of the hadith it says: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `He indeed told you the truth, although he is a liar. Do you know who you have been speaking with for the past three nights, O Abu Hurayrah?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, `That was a devil.’” (Muslim, 2187)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What we learn from this Hadith… is that the devil may appear in different forms, so it is possible to see him. The words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning), {Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them} [Al-A`raf 7:27] refer to when he is in his original form with which he was created.\" (Fat-h Al-Bari by Ibn Hajar  4/489)\nThus we know that seeing the angels and the jinn in a form other than their real form is possible and does happen.\nCan babies see the Angels?\nAs for suggesting that only children can see that, we do not know of any text which speaks of that. This is a matter of the unseen, and we cannot say anything about it except on the basis of evidence, and there is no evidence to deny or affirm that.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, there are various beliefs regarding the abilities of infants, including the potentially supernatural perception of angels. One common view among some scholars is that newborns or young children may possess a unique spiritual awareness that allows them to perceive angels or other unseen beings. \n\nThere are several hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) that suggest that young children can see what adults generally cannot. For instance, it is said that children may smile or react to things that others do not see, which some interpret as an interaction with angels.\n\nHowever, these beliefs are more anecdotal and not explicitly detailed in the Qur'an. As with many aspects of spirituality in Islam, interpretations can vary widely among scholars and across different cultures.\n\nIt is important to approach these topics with humility, recognizing the limitations of human understanding in matters of the unseen. Ultimately, the belief in the unseen, including angels, is a fundamental aspect of faith in Islam, and the capacity of babies to perceive them is part of a larger mystery that remains with Allah."

        "question": "Is Islamic `Aqidah Theoretical?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is Islamic `Aqidah Theoretical?\nIslamic `Aqidah is not a theoretical and philosophical method; action is an essential part of this `Aqidah. Hence the Ahl As-Sunnah agreed that faith consists of words and deeds, or speaking with the tongue, believing in the heart and acting with the physical faculties. \nWhoever believes in Allah as his Lord and God, will worship Him and obey Him by praying, giving Zakah and so on. \nWhoever believes in the Last Day and its reckoning and reward or punishment, will be motivated thereby to do that which Allah has commanded and abstain from that which He has forbidden. \nWhoever believes that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah will therefore obey him, follow his Sunnah and propagate his religion.  \nThus the principles in which a person believes are translated into actions and words and efforts. The stronger that faith grows in his heart, the more its effects will be seen outwardly. \nHence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In the body there is a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the entire body will be sound, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. It is the heart.” Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 52; Muslim, 1599)\nAl-Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Faith is not the matter of wishes or outward appearances, rather it is that which settles in the heart and is confirmed by one's actions.” \nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“If the heart is sound in terms of faith, knowledge and feelings, then this will inevitably lead to the soundness of physical actions, such as verbal statements and deeds. As the leading scholars of Hadith said: Words and deeds, both inward and outward. What is outward must follow what is inward, so if what is inward is sound then what is outward will also be sound, and if it (the former) is corrupt, (the latter) will also be corrupt. Hence one of the Companions said concerning the one who prayed carelessly: If his heart had been humble and focused, his body would have been humble and focused.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 7/187)\nBooks on `Aqidah\nWith regard to books which one may read about `Aqidah , there are many, the greatest of which are the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in which there is protection and salvation for those who adhere closely to them. The scholars were concerned with explaining and propagating sound `Aqidah , and they wrote innumerable books on this topic. Among the most famous of these books are the following: \n\nAs-Sunnah by `Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal\nAt-Tawhid by Ibn Khuzaymah\nSharh Usul I`tiqad Ahl As-Sunnah by Al-Lalka’i\n`Aqidat As-Salaf wa As-hab Al-Hadith by Al-Sabuni\nAl-`Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah by Ibn Taymiyah [available in English translation]\nAl-`Aqidah Al-Tahhawiyyah wa Sharhuha by Ibn Abu Al-`Izz Al-Hanafi\nLawami` Al-Anwar Al-Bahiyyah by Al-Safarini\nMa`arij Al-Qubul by Hafiz Hakami\nAl-Irshad ila Sahih Al-I`tiqad by Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan – this is an easy and useful book. \n\nHow to apply `Aqidah in real life\nWith regard to applying this `Aqidah in real life, this is done by learning it, propagating it, calling others to it, and refuting those who go against it with wisdom and beautiful preaching. This is how `Aqidah is spread and its effects made manifest so that all people may benefit from it. \nHow to learn `Aqidah\nThe way in which `Aqidah may be learned is to learn it directly from those who believe in it and act accordingly. This is the soundest and best way for those who are able to do it. For those who are far away from scholars, they should refer to their commentaries, writings and tapes, as well as asking about confusing matters and anything they do not understand. \nIf a person follows some of the teachings of Islam and neglects others, by failing to do some of the obligatory duties or by committing some of the acts that are forbidden, this is a shortcoming in his faith and a weakness in his belief and his love for his Lord and His religion. This is undoubtedly a fault in his `Aqidah. \nHence one of the basic principles of Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that faith increases by doing acts of worship and decreases by doing acts of sin. These shortcomings and faults may erase faith altogether, so that the person becomes an apostate from Islam, such as if he stops praying. Please see question no. 5208  and 2182 . \nWith regard to sins that do not reach the level of disbelief, such as withholding obligatory Zakah or looking at prohibited things and so on, these are things which cause faith to decrease. \nWhat is the correct `Aqidah?\nThe Muslims need people to explain pure, correct `Aqidah to them, that is based on the Quran and Sunnah according to the understanding of the righteous Salaf. That is because of the widespread existence of ignorance, innovations (Bid’ah), myths and deviant schools of thought. \nEvery Muslim must be sincere towards himself first of all, by learning correct `Aqidah from trustworthy sources, then by propagating it and teaching it to the people, by means of lessons and lectures, books, publications and magazines, thus fulfilling the duty to convey the message as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“(And remember) when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) to make it (the news of the coming of Prophet Muhammad and the religious knowledge) known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it.” [Al-`Imran 3:187] \n“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.” [Al `Imran 3:104] \n“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allah (i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me (also must invite others to Allah, i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism with sure knowledge). And Glorified and Exalted be Allah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the Mushrikun (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah; those who worship others along with Allah or set up rivals or partners to Allah.)’” [Yusuf 12:108]\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The concept of `Aqidah in Islam refers to the beliefs and doctrines that form the foundation of a Muslim's faith. While it encompasses theoretical elements, such as the belief in the Oneness of Allah (Tawheed), the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the existence of angels, it is not solely theoretical. \n\nIslamic `Aqidah is both theoretical and practical. The beliefs are meant to guide a Muslim's actions and behavior in daily life, encouraging adherence to the teachings of Islam and fostering a deep relationship with Allah. In other words, understanding `Aqidah on a theoretical level is essential, but it is equally important for it to be reflected in one’s actions, worship, and interactions with others.\n\nIn summary, while Islamic `Aqidah has a theoretical component, it is ultimately intended to be lived out in practice, making it a comprehensive aspect of a Muslim’s faith and life."

        "question": "What Takes a Person Out of the Fold of Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“Note that Allah has commanded all people to enter Islam and to adhere to it and to beware of whatever is contrary to it. He sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to call mankind to that. He tells us that those who follow him will be guided and that those who turn away from him have gone astray.\nIn many verses He warns against the means that lead to apostasy and all forms of polytheism and disbelief .\nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have said, when discussing apostasy, that a Muslim may apostatize from his religion by doing many acts that nullify Islam, which makes it permissible to shed his blood and seize his wealth, and which will put him beyond the pale of Islam. \nAmong the most serious and most common of these things are ten which were mentioned by Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Abd Al-Wahhaab and other scholars (may Allah have mercy on them all). \nWe will mention them in brief here, so that you and others can beware of them, in the hope that you will be safe and sound. We will also explain a little about them after mentioning each one.  \n\nShirk or associating others in worship with Allah . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“Verily, Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners (in worship) with Him, but He forgives whom He wills, sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away.” [An-Nisa’ 4:116] \n“Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:72]\nThat includes praying to the dead, seeking their help, making vows and offering sacrifices to them or to the jinn or to the grave. \n\nWhoever sets up intermediaries between himself and Allah and calls upon them, asks them to intercede, and puts his trust in them, is a disbeliever according to scholarly consensus. \nWhoever does not regard the polytheists as disbelievers, or doubts that they are disbelievers, or regards their way as correct, is a disbeliever. \nWhoever believes that anything other than the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is more complete than his teachings , or that the rulings of anyone else are better than his rulings – such as those who prefer the rule of false laws to his rulings – is a disbeliever. \nWhoever hates any part of that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought, even if he acts in accordance with it, is a disbeliever, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“That is because they hate that which Allah has sent down (this Quran and Islamic laws); so He has made their deeds fruitless.” [Muhammad 47:9]\n\nWhoever makes fun of anything in the religion of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or makes fun of any texts that refer to rewards or punishments, is a disbeliever. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“Say: Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?\nMake no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed.” [At-Tawbah 9:65-66]\n\nWitchcraft – including spells to turn one person against another or to make someone love another. Whoever does this or approves of it is a disbeliever. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, `We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).’” [Al-Baqarah 2:102]\n\nSupporting the polytheists and helping them against the Muslims. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliya’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliyaa’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliya’), then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Dhalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust)” [Al-Ma'idah 5:51]\n\nWhoever believes that some people are allowed to operate outside the law of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) just as Al-Khidr operated outside the law of Musa (peace be upon him) is a disbeliever, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.” [Al `Imran 3:85]\n\nTurning away from the religion of Allah, not learning it and not acting in accordance with it. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, then turns aside therefrom? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the Mujrimon (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners).” [As-Sajdah 32:22]\nWith regard to all of these acts that nullify Islam, it makes no difference whether a person is joking, serious or afraid, unless he is forced to do it. All of them are very serious, and they all happen a great deal. \nThe Muslim should beware of them and fear falling into them. We seek refuge with Allah from the things that may incur His wrath and painful punishment. May Allah send blessings and peace upon the best of His creation, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions. \n\nThe fourth category includes those who believe that the systems and laws devised by men are better than the Shari`ah of Islam, or equal to it; or that it is permissible to refer to them for judgements and rulings, even if he believes that referring to Shari`ah is better; or that the Islamic system is not fit to be applied in the twentieth century; or that it was the cause of the Muslims’ backwardness; or that it should be limited to a person’s relationship with his Lord and not have anything to do with the other affairs of life \nThe fourth category also includes those who think that carrying out the ruling of Allah by cutting off the hand of the thief or stoning the married adulterer is not appropriate in the modern age. \nThat also includes: everyone who believes that it is permissible to rule according to something other than the laws of Allah with regard to interactions, hudud punishments or other matters, even if he does not believe that that is better than the ruling of Shari`ah, because by doing so he is regarding as permissible something that Allah has forbidden according to consensus, and everyone who regards as permissible something that Allah has forbidden and is well known to be forbidden in Islam, such that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing that it is forbidden, such as adultery , alcohol and Riba , and ruling by something other than the Shari`ah of Allah, is a disbeliever according to the consensus of the Muslims. \n\nWe ask Allah to help us all to do that which pleases Him, and to guide us and all the Muslims to His Straight Path, for He is All Hearing, Ever-Responsive. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, several actions and beliefs can potentially take a person out of the fold of Islam (known as \"kufr\" or disbelief). However, it's important to note that declaring someone a non-Muslim (kafir) is a serious matter and should not be taken lightly. Scholars emphasize the importance of intention, understanding, and context. Here are a few key points that are generally recognized:\n\n1. **Shirk (Associating Partners with Allah)**: Believing in or practicing polytheism, such as worshiping others alongside Allah, is considered one of the gravest sins and can lead to disbelief.\n\n2. **Apostasy (Riddah)**: Intentionally renouncing Islam, whether through speech, actions, or belief, can take a person out of the fold of Islam.\n\n3. **Rejecting Fundamental Tenets of Faith**: Denying the core beliefs of Islam, such as the oneness of Allah, the finality of the prophethood of Muhammad, the validity of the Quran, or key practices like prayer or fasting, can lead to disbelief.\n\n4. **Mocking or Ridiculing Religious Practices**: Making fun of or showing contempt for Islamic beliefs or practices can also be considered an act of disbelief.\n\n5. **Practicing Magic or Sorcery**: Believing in or practicing magic as a means to gain power or control over others can take a person out of Islam.\n\n6. **Misinterpreting Islamic Teachings**: Extreme misinterpretations that lead to beliefs contrary to Islam might also be regarded in this context, especially if they are widely recognized as such by scholars.\n\nWhile these points outline conventional views on actions and beliefs that could lead someone to leave Islam, the decision ultimately lies with Allah. It is advisable for individuals who have doubts or questions about their faith to seek knowledge and guidance from qualified scholars or local religious leaders, rather than jumping to conclusions about someone's faith status. Islam emphasizes mercy, compassion, and understanding, both in practice and in judgment."

        "question": "Ruling on saying, “So and so is going to cause us to become disbelievers”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a person says “So and so is going to cause us to become disbelievers”, what he means is that that person will push us to do that because of his bad attitude or raising doubts and the like.\nThat person does not become a disbeliever because of saying that, because he is speaking about something in the future that has not happened.\nBut saying such a thing is abhorrent in all circumstances, because disbelief (kufr) is not a matter to be taken so lightly that a person could fall into it because of some annoyance he is faced with. Using this phrase is indicative of a lack of religious commitment, and demonstrates that the issue of falling into disbelief is something that the speaker takes lightly.\nWhat we must do is be wary of slips of the tongue. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Man does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared [to record]} [Qaf 50:18].\nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A person may say a word which displeases Allah, thinking little of it, for which he will be thrown down into Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6478) and Muslim (2988).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, making statements that imply or directly accuse someone of causing disbelief (kufr) in oneself or others is a serious matter. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) warned against using such language lightly. \n\nSaying “So and so is going to cause us to become disbelievers” could be problematic for several reasons:\n\n1. **Accusation of Disbelief**: It implies that the person in question has the power to lead others away from Islam, which could unjustly accuse them of wrongdoing or misguidance.\n\n2. **Influence on Faith**: It can reflect a lack of personal accountability for one's own faith, as belief and disbelief are personal matters that ultimately depend on one’s understanding and conviction.\n\n3. **Communal Harmony**: Such statements can sow discord among community members, leading to distrust and division. \n\n4. **Linguistic Precautions**: The Prophet (peace be upon him) encouraged us to be careful with our words, especially regarding matters of faith. \n\nIn light of these points, it is advisable to refrain from making such statements and instead focus on understanding, dialogue, and seeking to strengthen faith through personal commitment and mutual support in the community. If there is a concern about someone’s influence on faith, it is better to address it with wisdom and kindness rather than through accusatory language. \n\nIf you encounter someone causing doubts in faith, it is better to seek knowledge, understanding, and guidance from trustworthy scholars or knowledgeable members of the community."

        "question": "How can a disbeliever believe after Allah has cursed him and expelled him from His mercy?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is meant by cursing and what it implies\nIf it is a disbeliever who is cursed, what is meant by that is being cast away far from Allah’s mercy and paradise, and abiding forever in hell- that is, if the person dies in a state of disbelief.\nIf it is a Muslim who is cursed, or the curse is for doing something that does not constitute disbelief, then what is meant is that he will initially be prevented from entering Paradise. That applies if Allah does not pardon him, because the one who commits a major sin is subject to the will of Allah, so he may die without repenting, yet despite that Allah will forgive him.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Sahih Muslim: In linguistic terms, cursing refers to being expelled and cast far away. The scholars said that what is meant by cursing here is the punishment that the individual deserves for his sin, and being prevented initially from entering Paradise. This is not the same as cursing the disbelievers, who will be completely cast far away from the mercy of Allah, may He be exalted. End quote.\nAllah, may He be exalted, say (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, Allah has cursed the disbelievers and prepared for them a Blaze.\nAbiding therein forever, they will not find a protector or a helper} [Al-Ahzab 33:64, 65].\nThis applies to the disbeliever if he dies in a state of disbelief.\nAs for the one who repents before he dies, he is no longer subject to the curse.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proofs and guidance after We made it clear for the people in the Scripture - those are cursed by Allah and cursed by those who curse -\nExcept for those who repent and correct themselves and make evident [what they concealed]. Those - I will accept their repentance, and I am the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful} [Al-Baqarah 2:159, 160].\nThus the gate of repentance and acceptance is open for them, even if they were subject to the curse, for by means of sincere repentance ,the reason for being subject to the curse will no longer apply.\nAnd Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and had witnessed that the Messenger is true and clear signs had come to them? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.\nThose - their recompense will be that upon them is the curse of Allah and the angels and the people, all together,\nAbiding eternally therein. The punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved,\nExcept for those who repent after that and correct themselves. For indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful} [Al ‘Imran 3:86-89].\nSo the gate of Islam and repentance is open to every disbeliever, even though there may be verses which curse him, because his being cast away from Allah’s mercy does not become confirmed except if he dies as a disbeliever.\nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, says regarding the disbelievers of Quraysh who fought the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at Badr and persecuted him in Makkah (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say to those who have disbelieved [that] if they cease, what has previously occurred will be forgiven for them. But if they return [to hostility] - then the precedent of the former [rebellious] peoples has already taken place} [Al-Anfal 8:38].\nRuling on cursing a specific individual\nBecause cursing is like stating that a person will be cast out of Allah’s mercy in the hereafter, the majority of scholars forbade cursing a specific disbeliever, unless it is proven in the religious texts that he is cursed, such as Iblees, or it is known that he died in a state of disbelief. As for the disbeliever who is still alive, he may become Muslim; therefore he should not be cursed by name. Rather it may be said in general terms that Allah cursed the disbelievers, just as it may be said that the disbelievers will abide eternally in the Fire. This can only apply to those who died in a state of disbelief.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (6/511):\nCursing is permissible in general terms, in the case of those whom Allah and His Messenger cursed.\nAs for cursing a specific individual, if it is known that he died as a disbeliever, it is permissible to curse him.\nAs for cursing a specific evildoer, it is not appropriate to curse him, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade cursing ‘Abdullah ibn Himar, who used to drink alcohol, even though he had cursed the drinkers of alcohol in general terms. However, with regard to cursing a specific individual if he is an evildoer or a promoter of innovation, there is a difference of scholarly opinion. End quote.\nPlease see the answers to questions no. 36674 and 83390 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, the concept of belief and disbelief is complex and can be influenced by many factors, including individual circumstances, intentions, and the mercy of Allah. \n\n1. **Understanding Allah's Mercy**: In Islam, Allah's mercy is vast and encompasses all things. The belief that someone is beyond the reach of Allah's mercy is generally not acceptable. The Qur'an repeatedly emphasizes that Allah is the Most Merciful and Most Forgiving. For instance, in Surah Al-Zumar (39:53), Allah invites all to seek His mercy, stating that He forgives all sins.\n\n2. **Repentance and Guidance**: A disbeliever can always turn back to Allah and seek forgiveness. The act of repentance (Tawbah) is a powerful means of returning to faith. It is important to note that no one is definitively beyond the possibility of belief, as long as they are alive and have the capacity to respond to the call of faith.\n\n3. **Divine Will and Human Agency**: Belief is ultimately guided by divine will, but humans also possess free will to make choices. Allah may guide whom He wills, but individuals can also strive to seek truth and aspire to believe. The invitation to faith remains open as long as a person is alive.\n\n4. **Context of \"Cursing\"**: The concept of being cursed or expelled from mercy often pertains to specific actions or persistent disbelief. However, the Qur'an provides numerous examples of individuals who turned to faith after a period of disbelief, suggesting that change is always possible.\n\n5. **Hope and Encouragement**: Muslims are encouraged to maintain hope for others, to invite them gently towards Islam, and to pray for their guidance. Allah knows the hearts of individuals, and only He can truly judge.\n\nIn summary, a disbeliever can believe even after being described in a manner as having been cursed, because Allah's mercy is always available, and repentance can lead to forgiveness and guidance towards faith."

        "question": "If animals go around in circles, does that indicate that some event is about to happen, or is it a sign of the onset of the Hour?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing in the Quran or the proven Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to indicate that animals going around in circles is one of the portents of the Hour. If what is meant is that is an indication that the Hour is imminent, then that is even more clearly false, because the revelation has stated that the Hour will only come after its portents have occurred, and that after these portents appear, humans will live for a while during which faith will be taken away, so the Hour will only come upon the worst of people.\nSome of that has been explained previously, for example in the answer to question no. 43840 .\nAs for the view that it is an indication that some event, such as an earthquake or volcanic eruption, is about to occur, this is something for which there is nothing in the religious texts to support it.\nAs for the idea of zoologists discovering that and finding a connection between a specific movement of birds or other animals and the occurrence of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, this is something which requires sound research by trustworthy scientists and scholars to confirm it. This is something of which we are not aware up till now. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are still happening, and the natural instinct of animals when they sense that something frightening is about to happen, such as earthquakes, is to flee and panic, not to go around in circles in a regular motion that is not indicative of fear or panic.\nMoreover, this going around in circles is not something that is consistent in all animals; rather it occurs in isolated cases here and there. Logic would dictate that if it is a sign of some event that is going to happen in some area, then this behaviour would be seen in all animals in that area. The point is that it is not appropriate for the Muslim to try to interpret such animal behaviour without knowledge.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned} [Al-Isra’ 17:36].\nShaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn this verse, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, forbids pursuing that of which one has no knowledge. That includes saying ‘I saw’ when you have not seen, or ‘I heard’ when you have not heard, and ‘I know’ when you do not know.\nThat includes every type of speaking without knowledge and doing actions that are not based on knowledge. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has said something similar in other verses.\"(Adwa’ al-Bayan  3/682).\nThe prohibition on trying to find an interpretation for such things becomes more emphatic if we do not know the reality of these video clips. People on social media compete to get likes by posting weird and strange things, and some of them readily resort to deceit or concealing the true nature of the clips that they are posting.\nWhat the wise person must do is not hasten to believe everything that is posted by such people, who are not known to be honest.\nWhat the Muslim should really be alarmed about is the spread of mischief and corruption, and how people readily commit sin without any feeling of guilt, for calamities only occur because of that.\nIt was narrated from Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) entered the house in a state of alarm, saying: “La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah; woe to the Arabs from an evil that has approached! Today a (hole) like this has been opened in the barrier of Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj,” and he made a circle with his thumb and forefinger. Zaynab bint Jahsh said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, will we be destroyed even though there are righteous people among us? He said: “Yes, if evil prevails.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (3346) and Muslim (2880).\nWhat the Muslim must do is strive to reform himself and call others to reform themselves too, so that the numbers of righteous people will increase and the evildoers will be suppressed.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOur scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said: Her words “Will we be destroyed even though there are righteous people among us?” and the Prophet’s response, “Yes, if evil prevails” indicate that calamity may be warded off from those who are not righteous, if righteous people prevail.\"(At-Tadhkirah  3/1062).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, there is no specific teaching or evidence that suggests that animals going around in circles is an indication of an impending event or a sign of the onset of the Hour (the Day of Judgment). \n\nThe concept of signs leading up to the Hour is discussed in various Hadith literature, but specific behaviors of animals are not directly mentioned in major texts as definitive signs. Instead, Islamic teachings focus on spiritual readiness, acts of worship, and moral conduct as preparations for the Day of Judgment.\n\nTherefore, while some cultural beliefs may ascribe significance to animal behavior, it is important to rely on authentic Islamic teachings and scholars for understanding such matters. If you have further questions or need clarification on Islamic beliefs, it is always recommended to consult reputable sources or scholars."

        "question": "Good dreams are one of the parts of prophethood; what are the other parts?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari ((6989) narrated from Abu Sa‘id, and Muslim (2263) narrated from Abu Hurayrah, from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “Good dreams are one of the forty-six parts of prophethood.”\nThe parts of prophethood referred to in the hadith are a matter of the unseen, which cannot be known unless there is a text of the Qur’an or hadith to explain it. Some of the scholars said: That is not known, and the hadith was not said to explain them; rather it was said to explain the importance of good dreams.\nAl-Qadi Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maliki said: No one knows what the parts of prophethood really are except an angel or prophet. Rather all that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wanted to do was highlight that dreams are one of the parts of prophethood in general, because in the dream one may learn about some matters of the unseen in some respect. As for the details of the other parts, knowledge of that is something that is for the prophets alone.\nAl-Maziri said: The scholar is not required to know all things in general terms and in detail. Allah has set a limit for the scholar beyond which he cannot go. Therefore he will know some matters in general terms and in detail, and he will know some matters in general terms only, but not in detail, and this is one of those matters.\"(Fath al-Bari  12/364).\nIn the Sunnah there is some explanation about some parts of prophethood, such as the report narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2010) from ‘Abdullah ibn Sarjis al-Muzani, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Carrying oneself in a calm and dignified manner, deliberation and moderation are one of the twenty-four parts of prophethood.” This is a hasan gharib hadith; it was classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi. See also: Hashiyat Musnad Ahmad (ar-Risalah edn, 4/432).\nThis is what we could find about the parts of prophethood.\nWhatever the case, what a person needs to know about prophethood and its characteristics, and what it has to do with his religious duties, was conveyed by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to his ummah, and Allah preserved this knowledge for the ummah, and the leading scholars strove to study it and explain it.\nAs for prophethood itself and its status, that cannot be attained by seeking it or striving to attain it, or by researching its characteristics and learning about its parts, and that was the case even at the times when the prophets were still coming and messages were still being revealed. So how about now, when prophethood and the sending of the messages ended with Allah’s Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and there is no longer any hope of anyone becoming a prophet, for it is proven that there will be no prophet after him, and nothing remains for the one who cares for himself but to seek and learn the legacy of knowledge brought by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, it is mentioned that good dreams (ru'ya) are a part of prophethood, specifically for the ummah of Muhammad (peace be upon him). However, the complete understanding of prophethood includes several aspects. According to some scholars, the other parts of prophethood consist of the following:\n\n1. **Revelation (Wahy)**: This is the primary function of a prophet, where they receive divine communication from Allah to guide their community.\n\n2. **Miracles (Mu'jizat)**: Prophets are often granted miracles that serve as signs of their truthfulness and authority from Allah.\n\n3. **Guidance and Teaching**: Prophets are tasked with providing moral and spiritual guidance to their people, teaching them the laws and ethics of Islam.\n\n4. **Finality (Khatam al-Nabiyyin)**: In Islam, it is believed that Muhammad is the last prophet, and there will be no new prophets after him.\n\nThese aspects highlight the significant role of prophets in conveying Allah's message and guiding humanity. Good dreams, while a form of divine guidance, are one aspect among others."

        "question": "The angels questioned Allah in order to find out and learn",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nRegarding the angels’ questioning of Allah that is mentioned in Surat al-Baqarah, it was a question aimed at finding out and seeking to understand and learn something new. It was not an importunate question or an objection, for they are far above such a thing, may Allah’s peace be upon all of them. And it was said that Allah, may He be exalted, gave them permission to ask, so they asked.\nMakki said in al-Hidayah (1/216-217): Many of the commentators narrated that the angels were aware that the jinn who dwelt on earth had caused a great deal of mischief and shed blood, so they asked by way of wanting to learn the reason and seeking new knowledge: {Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood?} In other words, will they be like those who spread mischief?\nThus they asked for the purpose of seeking to learn, not to object, because they had no knowledge of how these successive generations would be, which Allah told them He was going to create. It was said that they said that by way of wondering, as the Arabs say: Will you show kindness to So-and-so, when he mistreats you?\nAnd it was said that Allah, may He be exalted, gave them permission to ask about that.\nAnd it was said that Allah, may He be exalted, mentioned that by way of informing them that He was going to create successive generations on earth, so they asked by way of seeking knowledge: What are those successive generations going to be like? So He said: He [Adam] will have progeny who will spread mischief on earth and shed blood, whereupon they said by way of astonishment and seeking confirmation, not by way of objecting: “Will You place upon it those who cause corruption therein and shed blood?”\nAnd it was said that they said that by way of astonishment at what Allah told them about those successive generations causing mischief on earth and shedding blood. End quote.\nAl-Wahidi narrated in al-Basit (2/324) the views of scholars in response to that, as he said:\nSome of the commentators said that there is an implicit meaning that is stated briefly. What it means is: are You going to place in it those who will spread corruption in it [and shed blood? Or are You going to place in it those who will not spread mischief in it] or shed blood? This is like the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says: {Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night …?} [az-Zumar 39:9], meaning: is he like one who is not devoutly obedient? And it is like the words of the poet Abu Dhu’ayb:\nI went against my gut instinct, for I am obedient to her command, and I do not know whether pursuing her is wise.\nWhat he meant is: is it wise or foolish?\nBased on that, the angels were seeking to understand and perhaps be told something of which they were not aware; it was not their intention to disapprove or object. Then Allah said: {“Indeed, I know that which you do not know”} [al-Baqarah 2:29]. He did not inform them about the character of the sons of Adam and He did not explain to them whether He wanted to create someone who would spread mischief or would not spread mischief.\nIt was said that when Allah said {“Indeed, I will make upon the earth successive generations”}, the angels did not know what type of creatures those successive generations would be. They said: O our Lord, will You place on the earth successive generations who will spread mischief like the children of the jinn? Or will You make successive generations from among the angels? For we glorify and praise You. But Allah did not inform them about that, and he said: {“Indeed, I know that which you do not know”} – in other words: among them will be both those who are obedient and those who are disobedient.\nAz-Zajjaaj said, narrating from someone else: what is meant here is that Allah informed the angels that He was going to place on the earth successive generations, and the successive generations were a group of the sons of Adam who would shed blood. Allah gave the angels permission to ask Him about that, and His informing them of that served to further confirm to them that He knows the unseen. It is as if they said: Are You going to create in it people who will shed blood and disobey You? Rather what they should do when they realise that You have created them is glorify and praise You as we do, and sanctify You as we do. They only said that when they were given permission to ask, because Allah, may He be exalted, has described them as doing what they are commanded. End quote.\nIbn Kathir (1/216) said: What the angels said was not by way of objecting to Allah, or by way of envy for the sons of Adam, as some commentators thought. Allah, may He be exalted, has described the angels as {They do not speak until He has spoken} [al-Anbiya’ 21:27]; in other words, they do not ask Him about anything for which they are not given permission.\nWhen Allah told them that He was going to create a new creation on earth, Qatadah said: They already knew that they [the new creation] would spread mischief on earth, so they said: {“Will You place upon it…”}. That was a question by way of enquiring and finding out the wisdom behind that. They said: O our Lord, what is the wisdom behind creating these people, even though some of them will spread mischief on earth and shed blood? For if the purpose is that they should worship You, we already glorify and praise You and sanctify You. In other words, we pray to You and we will not do anything of that manner at all, so why did You not decree that we are enough?\nAllah, may He be exalted, said, responding to this question of theirs: {“Indeed, I know that which you do not know”}. That is, I know that there is a greater purpose in creating such people, which outweighs the mischief that you refer to, which you do not know, for there will be Prophets and Messengers among them, and among them there will be those who are strong and true in faith, martyrs, righteous people, devoted worshippers, ascetics, close friends of Mine, devout people, those who are close to Me, scholars who act in accordance with their knowledge, those who fear Me, those who love Me, and those who will follow the Messengers (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them). End quote.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says: {He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned} [al-Anbiya’ 21:23], it is similar to the verse {Indeed, Allah does what He wills} [al-Hajj 22:13].\nWhat is meant is that Allah, may He be exalted, is the One Who controls His creation in whatever way He wills, for His is the power of creation and His is the command, and it is He Who is in control. Just as He creates them however He wills, blesses whomever He wills, dooms whoever He wills, grants good health to whomever He wills, decrees sickness for whomever He wills, supports whomever He wills, and forsakes whomever He wills, in like manner He rules over His slaves however He wills. Therefore He permits whatever He wills, forbids whatever He wills, allows whatever He wills, and proscribes whatever He wills, for when Allah decrees [a thing], none can reverse His decree.\"(Tafsir Ibn Kathir  1/387).\nIt says in Tafsir al-Wasit – Majma‘ al-Buhuth (6/1102): This is an elaboration on the fact that He, may He be glorified, is one and unique in His divinity and majestic in His Lordship, and in the fact that He questions His slaves about what they do, but He is not to be questioned by them about what He does to them. The great scholar az-Zamakhshari said, commenting on this verse: As it is the case that usually subjects do not question kings about their actions or the way in which they run the affairs of their kingdoms, out of respect and awe, despite the fact that kings are susceptible to error, mistakes and all kinds of mischief, by the same token it is more appropriate that the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, their Creator and Provider, is not to be questioned about what He does, especially when it is known and well established that everything He does is rational and based on wisdom, so it is not possible for Him to make mistakes or do anything abhorrent. End quote.\nAs for people, they will be questioned, because they are His slaves and are obliged to obey Him and act in accordance with His laws which He prescribed for them on the lips of His Messengers, and because of what He has given them of sound reason, which enables them to distinguish truth from falsehood, good from evil, and benefit from harm.\nAmong those of His slaves whom He will question are those whom people associate with Him, such as the Messiah and the angels; so how can those whom they worshipped be deserving of that worship when they too will be questioned by the One God, may He be glorified and exalted? End quote.\nConclusion:\nAllah, may He be exalted, may be asked for the purpose of learning with humility, or He may be asked for the purpose of seeking guidance and knowledge, but He is not to be questioned by way of objection or disapproval of anything that He does, may He be glorified.\nThe question of the angels was a question that was aimed at learning, for they were aware of the rights of their Lord, and they glorified and praised Him, for they are the ones who do not disobey Allah in what He commands them, and they do as they are commanded.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, there is a narrative in the Quran where the angels ask Allah about His creation of humans. Specifically, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:30), the angels express their concern about the creation of mankind, as they feared that humans would cause corruption on earth and shed blood. Their question reflects their understanding of God's wisdom and mercy, as they are eager to learn about the divine plan.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the angels did not question Allah out of doubt or disbelief, but rather out of a desire to understand His wisdom. Allah responded by stating that He knows what they do not know, indicating that the purpose of humanity encompasses divine wisdom that the angels may not fully comprehend at that moment.\n\nThis exchange demonstrates the humility of the angels and reinforces the idea that Allah's knowledge is vast and beyond human understanding. It also emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding in a respectful manner."

        "question": "The connection between provision (rizq) and death",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the individual’s lifespan is how long he will remain in this world, and it is a type of provision (rizq) which, when it comes to an end, the individual will die. That is his lifespan.\nHumans are like all other creatures that have lifespans and an appointed time of death, which cannot be brought forward or put back, because the appointed time of death is the end of his allotted period. His lifespan is how long he remains in this worldly life, and his appointed time of death is when that period comes to an end.\nIt is soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Allah decided the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth. And His Throne was above the water.” Narrated by Muslim (2653).\nAnd it was soundly narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There was Allah, and there was nothing before Him, and His Throne was above the water. He wrote everything in the Book and created the heavens and the earth. – According to one version: then He created the heavens and the earth. – And Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So when their time has come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they precede [it]} [al-A‘raf 7:34].”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (3191).\nAllah knows what will happen before it happens, for He has decreed that. So He knows that this one will die of a stomach disease, or pleurisy, or being crushed under a collapsed building, or drowning, or other causes of death, and that that one will be murdered either by poison, the sword, stones or other ways of killing.\nSee: Jami‘ al-Masa’il Vol. 7 (37).\nThe individual’s lifespan is included in the general meaning of provision (rizq), and whatever Allah has decreed of provision for a person will end when his lifespan ends. In the hadith that was narrated from ‘Abdullah it says: Umm Habibah, the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: O Allah, let me have the joy of the company of my husband the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and my father Abu Sufyan, and my brother Mu ‘awiyah (all my life). The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You have asked Allah about lifespans that have already been determined, days that have already been counted and provisions that have already been allotted. Allah will never do anything before its due time or delay it beyond its due time. If you had asked Allah to grant you refuge from punishment in the Fire or punishment in the grave, that would have been better or preferable.” Narrated by Muslim (2663).\nSecondly:\nWhat is discussed above has a valid meaning and makes sense, and what is mentioned in the question does not contradict it.\nProvision (rizq) includes what a person gets in this world that meets his essential and basic needs.\nProvision refers to everything that serves to meet a person’s needs in this life such as food, livestock, animals, fruit-bearing trees, clothing, and whatever he may acquire thereof by means of silver and gold (currency). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And when [other] relatives and orphans and the needy are present at the [time of] division, then provide for them [something] out of the estate} [an-Nisa’ 4:8]\nthat is, from that which the deceased left behind.\nAnd He says:\n{Allah extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. And they rejoice in the worldly life…} [ar-Ra‘d 13:26].\nAnd He says, telling the story of Qarun:\n{And We gave him of treasures …\n… Oh, how Allah extends provision to whom He wills of His servants and restricts it!}\n[al-Qasas 28:76-82] – what is meant here is the treasures of Qarun.\nAnd Allah says:\n{ And if Allah had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth} [ash-Shura 42:27].\nIn Islamic terminology, according to the scholars of ahl as-sunnah, the meaning of rizq (provision) is the same as the linguistic meaning. The basic principle is that no specific religious meaning can be attributed to a word without evidence. So the word rizq (provision) applies to that which is acquired in both halal and haram ways, because whether it is acquired through halal or haram means is not relevant here. That is a matter to be discussed elsewhere, but we may note that Allah only accepts what is good and lawful. This varies from one stage of revelation to another, as in the case of alcohol and dealing in it before it was prohibited. The point is that they spent from whatever provision they had in their hands.\nAt-Tahrir wa’t-Tanwir (1/135-234). See also: al-Mu‘jam al-Ishtiqaqi (2/794-795).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe word provision applies to that which Allah, may He be exalted, has permitted to a person and given him possession of it, and it may refer to that which nourishes a person. End quote from Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (8/545).\nBased on that, if a person dies before he has taken possession of something or before he has made use of it or benefitted from it, it is not part of the provision that was decreed for him. This is clear and understandable. That applies even if he did some work, then died before receiving payment for it; that payment was not part of the provision that was allocated to him in this world. And if he dies before he enjoys good health, then that good health was not part of the provision that was allocated to him in this world. The same applies to food that did not enter his stomach, or things that did not come into his possession or come under his control when he was in this world; these things were not allocated as provision for him.\nIn the hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him), it says that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no deed that will bring a person closer to Paradise but I have enjoined it upon you, and there is no deed that will bring a person closer to Hell but I have forbidden it to you. No one should think that his provision is slow in coming, for Jibril (peace be upon him) inspired to me that none of you will ever depart this world until he has received his provision in full. So fear Allah, O people, and be moderate in seeking provision, and if one of you thinks that his provision is slow in coming, let him not seek it by disobeying Allah, for the bounty of Allah cannot be attained by disobeying Him.”\nNarrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (2189) and others. Al- Albani said: It is sahih because of corroborating evidence.\nConclusion:\nThe words mentioned in the question are sound, and there is nothing wrong with them.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the connection between provision (rizq) and death is significant and underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and the predetermined nature of each individual's sustenance and lifespan.\n\n1. **Predestination (Qadar)**: Islam teaches that Allah has assigned a specific amount of sustenance (rizq) to each individual. This provision is decreed and determined by Allah before a person is born. The Quran states in Surah Al-Isra (17:31): \"And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely, killing them is a grave sin.\"\n\n2. **Life Span vs. Sustenance**: There is a direct relationship between a person's lifespan and their rizq. According to a hadith, it is said that \"The soul of a servant will not depart until his full provision is completed.\" This indicates that a person's sustenance is complete before their death, and they will receive what has been allotted to them during their lifetime.\n\n3. **Trust in Allah**: Belief in the connection between rizq and death encourages Muslims to put their trust in Allah. Knowing that their provisions are preordained allows believers to have faith that they will receive what they are meant to have, regardless of their circumstances. This trust is fundamental to the Islamic concept of tawakkul (reliance on Allah).\n\n4. **Effort and Reliance**: While Muslims are encouraged to seek provision through hard work and lawful means, it is also understood that ultimate success and sustenance are in Allah’s hands. Two hadiths convey this spirit: \"If you were to rely on Allah with the reliance He deserves, He would provide for you just as He provides for the birds; they go out hungry in the morning and return full in the evening.\" (Sunan Ibn Majah).\n\n5. **Balance**: Thus, the relationship between rizq and death teaches Muslims to balance their efforts and intentions with faith in Allah's plan. It emphasizes the transient nature of worldly provisions and encourages a focus on the hereafter, knowing that true sustenance includes not just physical needs, but spiritual fulfillment as well.\n\nIn summary, in Islam, provision (rizq) is divinely ordained and is fully connected to the decreed lifespan of a person, teaching believers to trust in Allah’s wisdom, pursue lawful means diligently, and seek spiritual sustenance as well."

        "question": "A response to the specious argument that if Allah is not unjust, why do people vary so much and the provision of blessings that they have?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nAllah is far above any injustice\nAllah, may He be glorified, is far above any injustice . He is free of need and almighty, and has no need of His creation, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O mankind, you are those in need of Allah, while Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.\nIf He wills, He can do away with you and bring forth a new creation\nAnd that is for Allah not difficult} [Fatir 35:15-17]\n{Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward} [an-Nisa’ 4:40].\nIn the famous hadith qudsi, it says: “O My slaves, I have forbidden injustice (zulm) to Myself and I have made it forbidden among you, so do not be unjust towards one another.” Narrated by Muslim (2577).\nIn relation to the greatest creations of Allah, such as the Throne, the Kursiy, the galaxies, the sun and moon, man is no more than a speck of dust or a grain of sand in a vast desert!\nAllah is free of need and has no need whatsoever to be unjust and wrong this speck of dust whom He has blessed with life and granted him hearing and vision, and bestows upon him bounty from His stores.\nHow strange it is, then, that this created being, who is so insignificant, when he forgets his status and the Shaytan deceives him with an idea, would dispute with the Most Gracious about His actions and decree, or when it crosses his mind that Allah, the Most Great, the Most High, Who has bestowed everything upon him, could be unjust towards him.\nFirst of all, you need to know that Allah is mighty, free of need, sovereign, bestower of blessings, most kind, bestower of bounty, most generous, most giving. Whatever good comes to a person, it is Allah Who bestowed it, beginning with the blessing of being brought into existence, and ending with admittance to Paradise and enjoying its delights.\n{And whatever you have of favor - it is from Allah} [an-Nahl 16:53]\n{And if you should count the favor of Allah , you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful} [Ibrahim 14:34].\nSecondly, you should understand what injustice (zulm) is.\nInjustice is taking from you what you own, or punishing you for no sin, or causing your good deeds to be in vain, or taking them from you and giving them to someone else, or requiting you for your good deeds with Hell.\nAllah is far above all of that.\nNo human can attribute any such thing to Allah.\nAllah has reassured His slaves and has told them that they will not be wronged in the slightest.\n{But he who does of righteous deeds while he is a believer - he will neither fear injustice nor deprivation} [Ta-Ha 20:112]\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah . Then every soul will be compensated for what it earned, and they will not be treated unjustly} [al-Baqarah 2:281]\n{And they will confide regret when they see the punishment; and they will be judged in justice, and they will not be wronged} [Yunus 10:54]\n{And for all there are degrees [of reward and punishment] for what they have done, and [it is] so that He may fully compensate them for their deeds, and they will not be wronged} [al-Ahqaf 46:19].\nThirdly: you should understand the difference between justice and blessings.\nJustice means that Allah does not treat you unjustly or wrong you. As for blessings, He grants them to whomever He wills.\nThus Allah, may He be glorified, does not wrong His slaves in the slightest, but He is the Possessor of abundant bounty which He bestows upon whomever He wills, and He knows best who is deserving of His bounty, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{But Allah selects for His mercy whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty} [al-Baqarah 2:105]\n{Say, “Indeed, [all] bounty is in the hand of Allah - He grants it to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Wise.”\nHe selects for His mercy whom He wills. And Allah is the possessor of great bounty} [Al ‘Imran 3:73-74]\n{That is the bounty from Allah, and sufficient is Allah as Knower} [an-Nisa’ 4:70].\nAllah, may He be glorified, sent His Messengers, sent down His Books, and explained His commands and prohibitions. Then whoever He willed believed and whoever He willed disbelieved, and whoever disbelieved, his ultimate fate will be the Fire, and this is His justice.\nAllah, may He be glorified, bestows His bounty upon whomever He wills, so He opens his heart and helps him to be guided, and He makes him steadfast in adhering to the truth. This is His bounty and grace.\nAllah, may He be glorified, enjoined His slaves to strive on earth and seek provision. Some of them work hard and strive, and they succeed and accumulate wealth and riches, and some of them are sluggish and lazy, and are content with poverty and weakness. This is justice.\nAllah, may He be glorified, bestows His bounty on whomever He wills, so He blesses him, makes means available to him, and enables his trade to be profitable or his work to bear fruit. This is His bounty.\nFourthly: you should understand that Allah is the Lord, the All-Knowing, the Most Wise, who is not to be asked about what He does.\nSo it cannot be said to the Lord: Why did You give to So-and-so and not to So-and-so?\nIt cannot be said to the Lord: Why did you create this one beautiful and that one ugly?\nIf the Lord could be questioned, there would be no difference between the Lord and His slave!\nBut reflect on the wisdom of Allah, for He may grant beauty and wealth to someone, but that person then transgresses, so his ultimate fate will be Hell.\nHe may grant beauty and wealth to someone who does not give thanks to Him, so that is a cause of suffering and doom for him.\nOr He may take away beauty and grant guidance, and instil contentment in that person’s heart, thus he becomes one of the happiest of people.\nOr He may grant one person beauty, guidance and happiness, and this is His bounty that he bestows upon whomever He wills.\n{And if Allah had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth. But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills. Indeed He is, of His servants, Acquainted and Seeing} [ash-Shura 42:27].\nFifthly: you should understand that the fact that Allah gives to certain people is not because of the high status, virtue or righteousness of the one to whom He gives.\nAnd the fact that He withholds from some people is not because they are insignificant before Him, or because they are evil or corrupt people. Rather it is based on great wisdom which is known to the Most Kind, the All-Aware, and people cannot grasp its essence and secrets.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And as for man, when his Lord tries him and [thus] is generous to him and favors him, he says, “My Lord has honored me.”\nBut when He tries him and restricts his provision, he says, “My Lord has humiliated me.”\nNo!} [al-Fajr 89:15-17].\n“No!” means the matter is not as you say or as you think, that being blessed with wealth or provision is an honour and that being deprived of that is humiliation. Rather it is because of the great wisdom of the Most Wise, the All-Aware, Who tests thereby whomever He wills of His slaves.\nShaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHere Allah tells us of the nature of man as he really is; he is ignorant and a wrongdoer, who does not think of the consequences. He thinks that the situation he finds himself in will last and never change, and he thinks that the generosity of Allah in this world and the blessings that He bestows upon him indicate that he is dear to Allah and close to Him.\n{But when He tries him and restricts his provision } and reduces it to what is just enough, with no surplus, he thinks that Allah is humiliating him thereby. But Allah refutes this notion by saying:\n{ No!} that is, not everyone on whom I bestow abundance in this world is dear to Me, and not everyone whose provision I restrict is insignificant or worthless before Me.\nRather wealth and poverty, restriction and abundance, are a trial with which Allah tests His slaves to see who will give thanks and be patient, so that He may reward him generously for that, and who will not respond in that manner, and will therefore suffer a terrifying punishment.\nMoreover, if a person focuses only on what he himself wants, this is indicative of low aspirations. Therefore Allah criticises them for not paying attention to the situation of needy people… End quote from Tafsir as-Sa‘di (924).\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 178673 .\nSo ignore these intrusive thoughts, and learn how to love Allah and how to turn to Him, give thanks for His blessings, reflect on His gifts, expect His grace, hope for His Paradise and long to see Him.\nGive up this ingratitude, rebellious attitude and denial of his blessings, and think instead about the thousands of blessings that He has bestowed upon you, the greatest of which is that He has made you His female slave who prostrates to Him, and you raise your hands to Him [in supplication]. How many people are deprived of this blessing, for they turn to objects of worship other than Him and seek to draw close to deities other than Him.\nYou have been honoured, blessed and favoured over millions of other people, so say: Al-hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah).\nIn this world, no matter how hard your life is, if you believe in Allah and He admits you to Paradise, you will not remember ever having gone through hardship, so praise Allah.\nNo matter how much you are tried and tested in this world in terms of your health, wealth, or looks, if you bear it with patience, Allah will compensate you for that with that which has never crossed your mind, because He is the Lord, the Most Generous, the Most Merciful. There is no act of worship that His slave does and nothing that he gives up for His sake, or does for His sake, but He will compensate him for that with a vastly multiplied reward.\nSo be steadfast in your faith, turn to your Creator, and keep your eye on the prize of eternal bliss which Allah has promised to His slaves in the hereafter, for the hereafter is true life, and the life of this world is but a temporary convenience.\nAl-Bukhari (6571) and Muslim (186) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Indeed I know the last of the people of Hell to be brought forth from it, and the last of the people of Paradise to be admitted to it. It will be a man who will emerge crawling from Hell, and Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to him: ‘Go and enter Paradise.’ He will come to it and it will appear to him to be full. He will go back and say, ‘O Lord, I found it full.’  Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to him: ‘Go and enter Paradise.’ He will go to it and it will appear to him to be full. He will go back and say, ‘O Lord, I found it full.’ Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to him: ‘Go and enter Paradise, and you will have the equivalent of the whole world and ten times as much – or you will have ten times as much as the whole world –.’ He will say, ‘Are You mocking me – or laughing at me – when You are the Sovereign?’” He said: And I saw the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) smile so broadly that his eyeteeth appeared. And it was said: He will be the lowest of the people of Paradise in status.\nAnd Muslim (2807) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The most affluent of the people in this world, of those who will go to Hell, will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and dipped once in the Fire. Then it will be said: ‘O son of Adam, did you ever see anything good? Did you ever have any pleasure?’ He will say: ‘No, by Allah, O Lord.’\nThen the most destitute of the people in this world, of those who will enter Paradise, will be brought and dipped once in Paradise, and it will be said to him: ‘O son of Adam, did you ever see anything bad? Did you ever experience any hardship?’ ‘He will say: No, by Allah, O Lord. I never saw anything bad and I never experienced any hardship.’”\nWe ask Allah to grant you reassurance, guide you, make your faith steadfast, and make you among the righteous women who are devout and give thanks.\nSecondly:\nIs it permissible to pray against an aggressor?\nYou should not pray against anyone, especially minors who have not yet reached the age of puberty. It is better to show them kindness and try to win them over, and to set a good example for them. Then if they cause you annoyance, be patient, as was the advice of Luqman:\n{O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befalls you. Indeed, [all] that is of the matters [requiring] determination} [Luqman 31:17].\nControl your tongue and only speak good words. When you offer supplication, pray for them to be guided to righteousness, such as saying: May Allah guide you, may Allah rectify your condition.\nAs for praying against an aggressor, a person may overstep the mark and go beyond what is within his rights to say, in which case he himself will become an aggressor and wrongdoer.\nHis supplication may be answered, and something bad may happen to the one against whom he prayed, thus causing him pain and sorrow.\nBut if you must do that, then say: O Allah, suffice me against their evil; O Allah, avert their harm from me… and the like.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question you've posed touches on a deep and significant aspect of Islamic theology regarding the nature of Allah (God) and the wisdom behind the varying circumstances of human life. The existence of inequality in terms of blessings, wealth, health, and other life conditions can be perplexing, but it can be understood through several key Islamic concepts:\n\n1. **Divine Wisdom**: Allah's creation is marked by wisdom that may not always be apparent to us. The variations in blessings among people may serve a greater purpose that aligns with Allah's overarching plan. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:286) states, \"Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.\" This implies that each individual is tested according to their capacity.\n\n2. **Purpose of Life**: In Islam, life is seen as a test (Surah Al-Mulk, 67:2). The variations in circumstances can be viewed as different tests. Some may be tested through hardship, while others may be tested through abundance. The essence of this life is to prepare for the Hereafter, where true justice is guaranteed.\n\n3. **Reward for Patience and Gratitude**: Allah rewards those who are patient during trials and grateful during times of ease. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of being content with what Allah has allotted to us and encouraged believers to trust in Allah's plan. The Quran states, \"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:155).\n\n4. **Moral Agency and Free Will**: Islamic teachings emphasize that humans are granted free will and moral agency, which encompasses the choices they make, the effort they put forth, and their interactions with others. The disparities in worldly circumstances can be a reflection of these choices, whether at a communal level or individually.\n\n5. **Compassion and Community**: The variation in wealth and blessings is also a call for community responsibility. The wealthy are encouraged to help the less fortunate through acts of charity (Zakat, Sadaqah) as a means of fostering compassion and social justice. This principle emphasizes that the blessings one receives are also a test in how they are utilized for the benefit of others.\n\nIn summary, the variations in blessings and circumstances among people do not reflect injustice from Allah but rather His wisdom in testing individuals uniquely, fostering moral growth, encouraging community support, and ultimately preparing them for the eternal life to come."

        "question": "What Is the Sound `Aqidah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.No deeds are accepted without sound `Aqidah\nIt is known on the basis of Shar`i evidence from the Quran and Sunnah that deeds and actions can only be valid and accepted by Allah if they stem from sound belief . If the belief is not correct, then the actions and words that stem from it are invalid, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.} [Al-Ma`idah 5:5]\n{And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah, your deeds would surely become worthless.}[Az-Zumar 39:65] And there are many similar verses.\nWhat is sound `Aqidah?\nThe Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) clearly indicate that sound belief may be summed up as: believing in Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, the Last Day, and the divine decree, both good and bad. These six matters form the basis of sound belief with which the Book of Allah was sent down and with which Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nReference to sound `Aqidah in the Quran\nThere is a great deal of evidence for these six fundamentals in the Quran and Sunnah, such as the verses in which Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n{Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah , the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets ….} [Al-Baqarah 2:177]\n{The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers, [saying], “We make no distinction between any of His messengers”.} [Al-Baqarah 2:285]\n{O you who have believed, believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Book that He sent down upon His Messenger and the Scripture which He sent down before. And whoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day has certainly gone far astray.} [An-Nisa` 4:136]\n\nReference to sound `Aqidah in the Sunnah\nThere are also many authentic hadiths which point to these fundamentals, such as the famous sahih hadith which was narrated by Muslim in his Sahih from Amir al-Mu`minin `Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which Jibril (peace be upon him) asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about faith , and he said to him: “Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day, and to believe in the divine decree, both good and bad…” This hadith was also narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah.\nFrom these six fundamentals stem everything that the Muslim must believe in with regard to Allah, may He be glorified, and with regard to the Resurrection, and other matters of the unseen.\nFundamentals of Sound `Aqidah\nBelief in Allah\nBelief in Allah, may He be glorified, includes believing that He is the [only] true God Who is deserving of worship, to the exclusion of all others, because He is the Creator of people, the One Who cares for them, the One Who provides for them, the One Who has knowledge of all that they do, both in secret and openly, the One Who is able to reward those who obey Him and punish those who disobey Him. It is for this purpose of worshipping Him that Allah created the two races [of humankind and the jinn] and commanded them [to worship Him Alone].\nThe true meaning of this worship is to single out Allah, may He be glorified, Alone for all acts of worship that people do, such as calling upon Him in supplication, fear, hope, prayer, fasting, offering sacrifices, making vows and other types of worship, which are to be done for Him Alone, with humility, seeking His pleasure and fearing His wrath, with perfect love for Him, humbling themselves before His might.\nAnother part of believing in Allah is believing in everything that He has enjoined upon His slaves and made obligatory for them, such as the five pillars of Islam – which are: testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing prayer; giving zakah; fasting Ramadan; and going on pilgrimage to the Sacred House of Allah (Hajj), for the one who is able to do that – and other obligatory deeds which are mentioned in Islamic teachings.\nThe greatest and most important of these pillars is testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah dictates that one should devote worship sincerely to Allah Alone, and refrain from worshipping anyone or anything besides Him. This is the meaning of La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah), for what it means is that there is none that is deserving of worship except Allah, so everything that is worshipped besides Allah, whether a human, an angel, a jinni or anything else, is worshipped on the basis of falsehood, and the only one Who is worshipped on the basis of truth is Allah Alone, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{That is because Allah is the Truth, and that which they call upon other than Him is falsehood.} [Al-Hajj 22:62]\nAnother part of believing in Allah is believing in His beautiful names and sublime attributes, as narrated in His Book and in sound reports from His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him), without distorting or denying the meaning, without discussing how they are, and without likening Him to His creation. Rather they must be taken as they are, without discussing how, whilst believing in what is indicated by the sublime attributes that are ascribed to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. We must affirm these attributes in the manner that is befitting to Him, without likening Him to His creation in any of His attributes, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.} [Ash-Shura 42:11]\nBelief in the Angels\nBelief in the angels includes believing in them in general terms and in specific terms. So the Muslim believes that Allah has angels whom He created to obey Him, and He has described them as honoured slaves who do not speak until He has spoken and they carry out His commands:\n{He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they are filled with reverent awe of Him.} [Al-Anbiya` 21:28]\nAngels in Islam are of many kinds. Some of them are appointed to be the bearers of the Throne; some of them are the keepers of Paradise and Hell; some of them are appointed to keep a record of people’s deeds.\nAnd we believe in specific terms in those whom Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) have mentioned by name, such as Jibril, Mika`il, Malik the keeper of Hell, and Israfil who is appointed to blow the Trumpet [on the Day of Resurrection]; he is mentioned in sound hadiths. It is proven in As-Sahih from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels were created from light, the jinn were created from smokeless fire, and Adam was created from what has been described to you.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih)\nBelief in the Books of Allah\nIt is obligatory to believe in general terms that Allah, may He be glorified, sent down Books to His prophets and messengers to explain the truth and call people to it, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{We have already sent Our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that the people may maintain [their affairs] in justice.} [Al-Hadid 57:25]\nWe believe in specific terms in those which Allah has mentioned by name, such as the Tawrah (Torah), the Injil (Gospel), the Zabur (Psalms) and the Quran.\nThe Noble Quran is the best of them and the last of them, and it supersedes them and confirms them. It is the one which all people are obliged to follow and refer to for judgement, along with what is soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of the Sunnah, because Allah, may He be glorified, sent His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as a messenger to both races [humankind and the jinn], and He sent down to him this Quran so that he might judge between them according to it. He has made it a healing for what is in their hearts, and an explanation for all things, guidance and mercy for the believers, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And this [Quran] is a Book We have revealed [which is] blessed, so follow it and fear Allah that you may receive mercy.} [Al-An`am 6:155]\nBelief in the Messengers of Allah\nIt is obligatory to believe in the messengers in general terms and in specific terms. Hence we believe that Allah, may He be exalted, sent to His slaves messengers from among them, as bringers of glad tidings and warners, and as callers to the truth. Whoever responds to their call will attain bliss, and whoever goes against them will incur loss and regret. The last and best of the messengers is our Prophet Muhammad ibn `Abdillah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], “Worship Allah and shun false gods”.} [An-Nahl 16:36]\nWith regard to those whom Allah has mentioned by name, or their names are soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), we believe in them in specific terms, such as Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim and others – blessings and peace of Allah be upon them and upon our Prophet.\nBelief in the Last Day \nBelief in the Last Day includes believing in everything that Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) have told us about what will happen after death, such as the trial and punishment or bliss in the grave, and what will happen on the Day of Resurrection of terrors, hardships, the Sirat, the balance, the reckoning, requital, and the distribution of the records among the people, when some will receive their record in their right hands and others will receive their records in their left hands or behind their backs. That also includes believing in the cistern of our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to which people will come, and believing in Paradise and Hell, and believing that the believers will see their Lord, may He be glorified, and He will speak to them, and other things that are mentioned in the Quran and soundly narrated in the authentic Sunnah from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). We must believe in all of that and affirm it in the manner in which Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) have explained it.\nBelief in the divine decree \nBelief in the divine decree includes believing in four things: Allah`s knowledge, His writing all things in Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz, creation and the divine will . \nImportant aspects of belief in Allah\n\nBelieving in Allah also includes believing that faith consists of words and deeds, and it increases by doing righteous deeds and decreases by committing sins; and that it is not permissible to deem any Muslim to be a disbeliever for committing any sin that is less than shirk or disbelief, such as zina, theft, consuming riba, consuming intoxicants, defiantly disobeying parents, and other major sins, so long as he does not regard those things as permissible, because Allah says:\n\n{Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills.} [An-Nisa` 4:48]\nAnd it is proven in the Mutawatir Hadiths narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that Allah will bring forth from the Fire anyone who has in his heart faith the size of a mustard seed.\n\nPart of believing in Allah is loving for the sake of Allah, hating for the sake of Allah, taking some people as allies for the sake of Allah, and taking others as enemies for the sake of Allah. So the believer loves the believers and regards them as allies, and he hates the disbelievers and regards them as enemies.\n\nForemost among the believers of this ummah are the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Ahl as-Sunnah wal Jama`ah love them and regard them as allies, and they believe that they are the best of people after the prophets, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of people are my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.” Sahih – agreed upon.\nThey believe that the best of them are: Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, then `Umar al-Faruq, then `Uthman Dhu`n-Nurayn, then `Ali al-Murtada (may Allah be pleased with them all). After them come the rest of the ten who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, then the rest of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all). \nThey refrain from discussing the disputes that arose among the Companions, and they believe that in that case each of them was striving to reach the right conclusion and make the right decision; whoever got it right will have two rewards and whoever got it wrong will have one reward. \nThey love the family members of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who believed in him, and they regard them as allies. They regard as allies the wives of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them), the Mothers of the Believers, and they pray that Allah be pleased with all of them.\nThey reject the way of the Rafidis who hate and revile the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and exaggerate about the members of the Prophet`s family (Ahl al-Bayt), raising them to a status higher than that which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, bestowed upon them. They also reject the way of the Nasibis who revile Ahl al-Bayt in words or deeds.\nEverything that we have mentioned above is the sound `Aqidah (belief or creed) with which Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). It is the creed of the saved group, Ahl as-Sunnah wal Jama`ah , concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A group of my ummah will continue to adhere to the path of truth and they will continue to prevail, and they will not be harmed by those who forsake them, until the decree of Allah comes to pass.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Jews split into seventy-one groups, and the Christians split into seventy-two groups. This ummah will split into seventy-three groups, all of whom will be in the Fire except one.” The Companions said: Who are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Those who follow that which I and my Companions follow.” This is the `aqidah and sound creed to which we must adhere and remain steadfast therein, and we must beware of anything that goes against it.\nFalse beliefs from an Islamic perspective\n\nAs for those who deviate from this `aqidah and follow the opposite, they are of many kinds. Among them are those who worship idols , images, angels, the awliya’ (“saints”; close friends of Allah), the jinn, trees, rocks and so on. \n\nThose people have not responded to the call of the messengers; rather they have gone against them and stubbornly rejected them, as Quraysh and other Arabs did with our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); they used to ask their objects of worship to meet their needs, heal the sick and grant them victory over their enemies, and they used to offer sacrifices to them and make vows to them. When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rebuked them for that, and instructed them to devote worship sincerely to Allah Alone, they found that odd and rejected it, and they said:\n{“Has he made the gods [only] one God? Indeed, this is a curious thing.”} [Sad 38:5]\nThen circumstances changed, and ignorance prevailed over most people until the majority have gone back to the religion of the Jahiliyyah, exaggerating about the prophets and the awliya’, calling upon them, seeking their help and other kinds of shirk (associating others with Allah). They do not understand the true meaning of La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah) as even the disbelievers among the Arabs understood it. This shirk continued to spread among the people until the present day, because of the prevalence of ignorance, and because we are so far from the era of prophethood.\n\nOne of the kinds of creeds based on disbelief that are opposed to sound `aqidah and opposed to the message of the messengers (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) is what the atheists believe in nowadays, namely the followers of Marx, Lenin and others who promote atheism and disbelief, regardless of whether they call that socialism or communism or Baathism or any other names. One of the basic principles of these atheists is that there is no God and life is purely materialistic. Other basic principles of theirs include denial of the Resurrection, denial of Paradise and Hell, and disbelief in all religions. Anyone who examines and studies their books will realise that for sure. Undoubtedly this creed is opposed to all the divinely-revealed religions and will lead its followers to the worst consequences in this world and the Hereafter.\nAnother kind of creed that is opposed to the truth is what some esoterics (batinis) and some Sufis believe in, that some of those whom they call awliya’ (“saints” or “holy men”) share control with Allah, directing the affairs of the universe. They call them by titles such as aqtab, awtad, aghwath and other names that they have fabricated for their gods. This is one of the most reprehensible types of associating others with Allah in His Lordship, and it is worse than the shirk of the Arabian Jahiliyyah, because the disbelieving Arabs did not associate others with Allah in His Lordship; rather they associated others with Him in their worship, and they did that at times of ease, but at times of hardship, they devoted their worship sincerely to Allah Alone, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n{And when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, at once they associate others with Him.} [Al-`Ankabut 29:65]\nWith regard to divine Lordship, they acknowledged that it belongs to Allah Alone, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if you asked them who created them, they would surely say, “Allah”.} [Az-Zukhruf 43:87]\n{Say, “Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?” They will say, “Allah,” so say, “Then will you not fear Him?”} [Yunus 10:31] And there are many similar verses.\n\nAmong the creeds that are opposed to sound Islamic `aqidah regarding the divine names and attributes are the beliefs of the innovators such as the Jahmis, Mu`tazilah and others who followed their way in denying the attributes of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and denying His attributes of perfection, and they ascribed to Him, may He be glorified and exalted, attributes of non-existent beings, inanimate beings and impossible beings – exalted be Allah far above what they say.\nThat also includes those who deny some of the divine attributes and affirm others, such as the Ash`aris , who should have applied the same argument as they applied to the attributes that they affirmed to the attributes that they denied and interpreted in a manner other than what was indicated by the apparent meaning. Thus they went against both the textual evidence and the rational evidence, and contradicted themselves.\n\nSource: \nSummarised from the essay Al-`Aqidah As-Sahihah wa ma Yudadduha by Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, a \"sound `Aqidah\" refers to a correct and firm belief system that conforms with the fundamental tenets of the faith as taught by the Quran and the Sunnah (the practices and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). \n\nA sound `Aqidah encompasses several core beliefs, including:\n\n1. **Tawhid (Oneness of God):** The absolute monotheism, affirming that Allah is one, without partners, and that He has unique attributes that cannot be likened to any of His creation.\n\n2. **Belief in Angels:** Recognizing the existence of angels, created by Allah from light, who perform various duties, including conveying revelations and recording human actions.\n\n3. **Belief in the Scriptures:** Accepting that Allah sent down divine scriptures, including the Torah, Psalms, Gospel, and the Quran, which is considered the final and complete revelation.\n\n4. **Belief in the Prophets:** Acknowledging the prophets and messengers sent by Allah to guide humanity, including figures like Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all).\n\n5. **Belief in the Day of Judgment:** Holding the belief in a Day of Judgment when all individuals will be resurrected and held accountable for their actions.\n\n6. **Belief in Divine Decree (Qadar):** Accepting that Allah has knowledge of everything that happens and has decreed all events in His wisdom.\n\nA sound `Aqidah is integral to a Muslim's faith and is reflected in their daily practices, worship, and interactions with others. It is essential for such beliefs to be aligned with scholarly interpretations rooted in authentic sources, as this protects a believer from deviating into sectarian errors or misunderstandings. \n\nScholars throughout Islamic history have emphasized the importance of education in `Aqidah and the avoidance of sectarian divisions to maintain unity within the Muslim community (Ummah)."

        "question": "Is Shari`ah Comprehensive?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is Shari`ah comprehensive?\nThe Islamic system of law (Shari`ah ) that Allah, may He be Exalted, revealed to His slaves covers all that people need with regard to their creed, their acts of worship, and their interactions with one another, because it is the final religion and system of law, with which the final Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent to all people. So there is no prophet after him and no law after his law. Even ‘Isa (peace be upon him), when he comes down at the end of time, will judge in accordance with it.\nThe one who reflects on the Quran and studies the Sunnah, and examines the books of jurisprudence and novel issues will realise that with certainty.\nThe rulings are either specifically mentioned in the religious text of the Quran and Sunnah – this is called the fundamental rulings (Usul Al-Ahkam), and most of what people need can be found in these rulings. Or the rulings are not specifically mentioned in the religious texts, but the jurist can find out the ruling concerning a matter by examining other Shar`i evidence, such as the reports reported from the Companions, or analogy (Qiyas) with the rulings mentioned in the text, or Istis-hab (assumption of the continuation of a fact in the absence of proof to the contrary) or Masalih Mursalah (the public interest) or barring means that lead to evil.\nHence Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[Say], “Then is it other than Allah I should seek as judge while it is He who has revealed to you the Book explained in detail?” And those to whom We [previously] gave the Scripture know that it is sent down from your Lord in truth, so never be among the doubters.} [Al-An‘am 6:114]\n{And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things.} [An-Nahl 16:89]\nIn the Hadith it says: “There is no deed that brings a person closer to paradise but I have enjoined it upon you, and there is no deed that brings a person closer to hell but I have forbidden it to you. No one of you should think that his provision is slow in coming, for Jibril inspired to me that one of you will never depart this world until he has received his provision in full. So fear Allah, O people, and be moderate in seeking provision. If any of you think that his provision is slow in coming, let him not seek it by disobeying Allah, for Allah’s bounty cannot be attained by disobeying Him.” (Narrated by Ibn Abu Shaybah in Al-Musannaf, 34332 and by Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak, 2/5; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wa’t-Tarhib, 1700)\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“Islamic rulings may be divided into two categories:\n\n[The first category] is that which the Lawgiver [Allah] mentioned in specific terms in the religious texts, such as the verses,\n\n{Prohibited to you are dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah ….} [Al-Ma’idah 5:3]\n{And lawful to you are [all others] beyond these.} [An-Nisa’ 4:24] – this refers to women who are permissible to marry.\nAnd there are many examples of that.\n\nThe second category is that which is not mentioned in specific terms in the texts; rather it is mentioned in general guidelines in Islamic teachings and general Shar`i evidence. That is because the Islamic system of law is comprehensive and covers everything, but it is not possible to mention every issue specifically in the texts, for that would require many volumes that no vehicles could carry.\n\nBut there are general, basic guidelines with which Allah blesses whomever He wills of His slaves, so that they will be able to find answers to other minor issues by means of the general guidelines and rulings, such as, “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm,” for example. Even though there are some reservations about the soundness of the Hadith, the basic principles of Islam testify to the soundness of its meaning. This general principle could cover thousands of issues in which there is harm, and thousands of issues in which there is reciprocal harm, without having to mention each issue by name.\nFor example, at the time of the caliph ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), there was a dispute between two men. One of them owned two pieces of land, between which there was a piece of land belonging to another man. The owner of the two pieces of land wanted to let water flow through the other man’s piece of land to reach his second piece of land. But the owner of that land refused and said: You cannot let the water flow through my land. The matter was referred to the caliph ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), and he ruled that the water should be allowed to flow through that man’s land whether he liked it or not. He said: I shall surely let it flow, even if it flows across your stomach – or across your back – because this neighbour who refused to let the water flow through his land only wanted to harm him thereby, otherwise there is something that serves his interests, meaning that he would be able to benefit by planting trees or crops due to this water flowing through his land, which is something that serves the interests of both parties.\" (Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftuh  18/122)\nIt may be understood from the verses which we have quoted that the Quran – on its own – contains detailed explanations for everything that people need. The scholars answered this in two ways:\n\nThe Quran indicates that the Sunnah, scholarly consensus (Ijma‘), and analogy (Qiyas) constitute sound proof. Therefore it may be stated correctly that whatever is established on the basis of these proofs is referred to in the Quran.\nThe Quran itself includes an explanation of that issue in one way or another, even if that is by virtue of the fact that things are to be deemed permissible in some cases.\n\nEven though, in this discussion, we are not trying to prove that all rulings are mentioned in the Quran – rather our aim is to prove that Shari`ah , with its sources that are recognised as such, can produce rulings on all issues – it is worth mentioning what was confirmed by Ar-Razi (may Allah have mercy on him) concerning the second argument, after he noted that the first argument is the view of the majority of jurists.\nAr-Razi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“With regard to his view that this Book does not contain all the rulings having to do with fundamental and minor issues, we say: As for the fundamental issues, they are all to be found in the Quran, because these fundamentals are mentioned in it in the most eloquent manner.\nAs for the various views of the Madhhabs and the details of those different views, there is no need for it.\nAs for the detailed discussion of the minor issues, we say: The scholars have two views regarding that.\n1- The first view: they say that the Quran indicates that Ijma‘ (scholarly consensus), Ahad reports and Qiyas (analogy) are to be regarded as proof in Shari`ah , so whatever is proven on the basis of these three proofs is, in reality, proven by the Quran.\nAl-Wahidi (may Allah have mercy on him) gave three examples of that:\n\nThe first example: It was narrated that Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say: Why should I not curse those whom Allah cursed in His Book, meaning the woman who does tattoos and the one who asks for tattoos to be done, and the woman who does hair extensions and the woman who asks for hair extensions to be done. And it was narrated that a woman read the entire Quran, then she came to him and said: O Ibn Umm ‘Abd, yesterday I read the Quran from cover to cover, and I did not find in it any cursing of the woman who does tattoos and the woman who asks for tattoos to be done. He (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If you had read it, you would have found it. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n{And whatever the Messenger has given you - take.} [An-Nashr 59:7]\nAnd one of the things that the Messenger of Allah brought to us is that he said: “May Allah curse the woman who does tattoos and the woman who asks for tattoos to be done.”\nI say: It is possible to find the ruling on this issue in the Book of Allah in a verse that is clearer than that, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says in Surat An-Nisa’:\n{and they [actually] call upon none but a rebellious Satan, Whom Allah has cursed.} [An-Nisa’ 4:117-118]\nThus Allah cursed him, then He listed some of his abhorrent deeds, among which He mentioned his saying:\n{“and I will command them so they will change the creation of Allah”.} [An-Nisa’ 4:119]\nThe apparent meaning of this verse indicates that changing the creation of Allah will lead to being cursed.\n\nThe second example: it was narrated that Ash-Shafi‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) was sitting in Al-Masjid Al-Haram, and he said: You will not ask me about anything but I will give you an answer to it from the Book of Allah, may He be Exalted. So a man said: What do you say about a pilgrim in Ihram who kills a wasp?\n\nHe said: He does not have to do anything [as expiation] The man said: Where is that in the Book of Allah? He said: Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whatever the Messenger has given you - take.} [Al-Nashr 59:7]\nThen he mentioned a report, with an Isnad [chain of narration] going back to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “You must adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs who come after me.” Then he mentioned, with a chain of narration going back to ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The pilgrim in Ihram may kill a wasp.\nAl-Wahidi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Thus he gave an answer quoting from the Book of Allah and deriving this ruling by going through three levels of narration.\nI say: There is another way of proving it that is clearer, which is that in principle, the wealth of Muslims is protected. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned.} [Al-Baqarah 2:286]\n{and [He will] not ask you for your properties} [Muhammad 47:36]\n{do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent.} [An-Nisa’ 4:29]\nThus Allah forbids consuming people’s wealth except through trade. So when there is no trade, that means that it remains prohibited [to consume people’s wealth]. These general rulings dictate that there should be no penalty on the pilgrim who kills a wasp at all, and that is because adhering to the general meaning of these principles dictates that this should be the ruling.\n\nThe third example: Al-Wahidi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated in the Hadith about the hired labourer who committed Zina that his father said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Judge between us in accordance with the Book of Allah.\n\nSo he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, I shall surely judge between you in accordance with the Book of Allah.” Then he ruled that the hired worker should be flogged and banished, and that the woman should be stoned if she admitted guilt.\nAl-Wahidi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Flogging and banishment are not mentioned in the text of the Quran. This indicates that whatever ruling was given by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is essentially the same as what is in the Book of Allah.\nI say: This example is correct, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them.} [An-Nahl 16:44]\nEverything that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained and made clear is included in the meaning of this verse.\nFrom these examples, it is proven that as the Quran indicates that ijma‘ (scholarly consensus) constitutes proof, and that the Ahad report constitutes proof, and that Qiyas (analogy) constitutes proof, every ruling that is established in one of these three ways is in fact proven by the Quran. It is in this way that we may understand the words of Allah:\n{We have neglected nothing in the Book.} [Al-An‘am 6:38]\nThis is the way to understand this verse, and this way of understanding it is supported by the majority of jurists…\n2- The second view with regard to the meaning of this verse is that of those who say that the Quran alone is sufficient and all rulings may be found in it.\nThe way to explain this is by noting that in principle everyone is free of obligations, and for any obligation there should be separate proof. Mentioning in specific texts the categories in which there is no obligation is impossible, because the categories in which there is no obligation are unlimited, and mentioning in specific texts that which is unlimited is not possible. Rather mentioning in specific texts is only possible in the case of that which is finite.\nFor example, there are a thousand obligations that Allah has enjoined on people; He mentioned them in the Quran, and He instructed Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to convey that thousand to people. Then after that, He said:\n{We have neglected nothing in the Book.} [Al-An‘am 6:38]\nThus what it means is that there is no other obligation that Allah has enjoined upon us after that thousand. Then He confirmed that in the verses:\n{This day I have perfected for you your religion.} [Al-Ma’idah 5:3]\n{nor [is there] anything fresh or dry, but [it] is written in a Clear Record.} [Al-An‘am 6:59]\nThis is the explanation of the view of these people. Further discussion of this matter is to be found in the books of Usul Al-fiqh (the fundamentals of jurisprudence). And Allah knows best.\" (Tafsir Ar-Razi  12/527).\nNote:\nThe correct view regarding the verse in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says: {We have neglected nothing in the Book.} [Al-An‘am 6:38] is that what is meant by the Book here is Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz, in which Allah, may He be Exalted, wrote the decrees of His creation. This is what is narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) in his commentary on this verse.\nBut a better verse to quote as evidence in this context is the verse in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says:\n{And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things.} [An-Nahl 16:89]\nSee: Tafsir Ibn Jarir (9/234); Tafsir Ibn Kathir (3/253); As-Sa‘di (p. 255).\nFiqh of contemporary issues\nIf a novel issue arises of which there is no clear mention in the Book of Allah, may He be Exalted, or in the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – as in the case of some medical and economic issues, for example, such as artificial insemination, genetic engineering, and dealing in crypto currencies, for example – then the scholars study and strive to find a ruling on it, by means of analogy and deriving rulings on that basis, or by applying the general guidelines of Shari`ah, taking into consideration the objectives of Shari`ah .\nNo matter what the issue is, it is possible for these scholars to work out the Shar`i ruling, even by referring to some of the basic principles, because there are things which are either in principle permitted or forbidden, if there is no evidence to suggest otherwise, so it is not possible that there could be any issue for which there is no ruling in Islamic Shari`ah.\nFor more information, please see: Tafsir Adwa’ Al-Bayan by Ash-Shinqiti, on the verse {Indeed, this Quran guides to that which is most suitable.} [Al-Isra’ 17:9]\nIn conclusion, the Islamic system of law (Shari`ah) provides all that people need of rulings regarding all their affairs, because it is the final system of law, the perfect and complete religion, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favour upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion.} [Al-Ma’idah 5:3]\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, Shari`ah (Islamic law) is considered comprehensive in the sense that it encompasses a wide range of aspects governing both personal and communal life for Muslims. It addresses various areas including worship, morality, legal matters, social justice, economics, and family law. \n\nShari`ah is derived from two primary sources: the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, and the Sunnah, which includes the practices and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Together, these sources provide guidance on how Muslims should conduct themselves in all levels of life—spiritual, ethical, and social.\n\nMoreover, Shari`ah is also adaptable to different cultural contexts and circumstances while remaining rooted in the core principles of Islam. Scholars engage in the process of ijtihad (independent reasoning) to derive rulings that can address contemporary issues, thus contributing to the comprehensive nature of Shari`ah in the lives of Muslims today.\n\nHowever, interpretations and implementations of Shari`ah can vary within different cultures and schools of thought, leading to diverse understandings of what is considered Shari`ah-compliant."

        "question": "Does believing that humans have the ability to cause earthquakes constitute shirk (associating others with Allah)?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a Muslim believes that it is possible that some humans, based on some experiments, are able to cause earthquakes and the like, merely thinking that is not indicative of shirk, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has made this universe operate according to natural laws beyond which it cannot go. Then Allah enabled some people to conduct research on these natural laws, find out about some of them and benefit from them. For example, Allah, may He be exalted, is the Healer, but He has created means of healing.\nIt was narrated from Jabir, from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “For every disease there is a remedy, and when the remedy is applied to the disease, it is healed by Allah’s leave.” Narrated by Muslim (2204).\nAnd He has guided some of His slaves to find out some of these remedies.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Allah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down a remedy for it. Those who know it know it, and those who do not know it do not know it.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (6/50).\nThe doctor’s discovery of the means of healing only happens by the will and decree of Allah, may He be exalted; the doctor and his medicine are all part of Allah’s creation.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{… While Allah created you and that which you do} [as-Saffat 37:96].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The verse {…While Allah created you and that which you do} may be understood in two ways. The meaning may be: while Allah created you and your deeds. Or the meaning may be: while Allah created you and that which you do.\nBoth meanings are interconnected, but the former is more likely, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhari in Kitab Af‘al al-‘Ibad (The Book of People’s Actions) from Hudhayfah, which is marfu‘ [attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)]: “Indeed Allah made every maker and what he makes…”\"(Tafsir Ibn Kathir  7/26).\nMoreover, Allah, may He be exalted, has guided some people to understand the natural laws that He has ordained concerning motion, as a result of which they have been able to make vehicles that move on land, in the air and on the sea. All of that is by the will of Allah, and by His leave and His decree. Both the maker and his vehicle are created by Allah, may He be exalted.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [He created] the horses, mules and donkeys for you to ride and [as] adornment. And He creates that which you do not know} [an-Nahl 16:8].\nThe commentator Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding the words {And He creates that which you do not know}, in this verse, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, states that He creates [and will create] things which those who were first addressed did not know at the time when this verse was revealed, and He did not describe that which He will create; rather He referred to it as “that which” and did not specify any of it. But the fact that it is mentioned in the context of His reminding people of His blessing of providing mounts indicates that part of what He will create is things that are used as means of transportation. This is seen in the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon His slaves in the form of means of transportation that were not known at the time when the verse was revealed, such as planes, trains and cars.\"(Adwa’ al-Bayaan  3/265-266).\nSo merely thinking that there could be some specialists whom Allah, may He be exalted, has enabled to understand the means of causing storms and earthquakes, and even believing that – if the one who says that appears to believe what he is saying – all of that does not lead to disbelief, if the individual believes that these specialists are slaves of Allah, may He be exalted, and they could never do any of that except by His will and decree, and that the universe is in His hand alone. Rather their efforts are no more than means that would lead to some natural phenomenon of which they have discovered the causes, or some of them, and all of that only happens by the decree of Allah, may He be exalted, and by His knowledge, His will and His creation.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “In whose hand is the realm of all things - and He protects while none can protect against Him - if you should know?”\nThey will say, “[All belongs] to Allah.” Say, “Then how are you deluded?”} [al-Mu’minoon 23:88-89].\nHowever, you should not exaggerate about any of that, for most cases when such events are known of or reported, the aim is not to create an earthquake in a particular place or to create an earthquake in particular; rather they conduct underground explosions, for scientific purposes or otherwise, as a result of which these tremors and earthquakes occur, the intensity of which may vary.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, shirk is understood as the act of associating partners with Allah or attributing divine qualities to other than Allah. It is considered one of the gravest sins. When it comes to natural phenomena like earthquakes, Islam teaches that Allah is the ultimate creator and controller of everything in the universe, including natural disasters.\n\nBelieving that humans have the ability to cause earthquakes could imply that one believes humans have control over forces that are inherently controlled by Allah, which could border on shirk if it undermines Allah's sovereignty and power. However, if the belief is framed in a way that acknowledges Allah's ultimate control while recognizing human actions as a means through which events can transpire, it may not be considered shirk.\n\nIn summary, one must be careful to maintain the belief that while human actions can have consequences, it is Allah who is ultimately in control of all matters, including natural occurrences. It is important to have a correct understanding of Tawhid (the oneness of Allah) and ensure that any beliefs or statements align with this fundamental principle of Islam. For a more nuanced understanding, it would be advisable to consult knowledgeable scholars or ulama."

        "question": "The Only Religion in the Sight of Allah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islam is the only acceptable religion\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam.} [Al `Imran 3:19]\nHere He, may He be Glorified and Exalted, tells us that there is no religion that is acceptable to Him except Islam, which means submitting, surrendering and humbling oneself before Allah, may He be Exalted, worshipping Him alone, and believing in Him and in His Messengers, and what they brought from Allah. For each Messenger Allah prescribed a system of law and a method, until He sent the last of them, Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) He sent him to all people, so after him, Allah will not accept any religion from anyone except Islam, which is the religion that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought.\nWere the previous Prophets Muslims?\nThe believers who followed the previous prophets were all Muslims in the general sense of the word, and they will enter Paradise by virtue of their Islam.

He will not accept any other religion and will not grant reward except for it.\nAbu Al-`Aliyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Islam means sincere devotion to Allah alone , and worshipping Him without associating anything else with Him.\" (Tafir At-Tabari  6/275)\nCommentaries on: {Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam}\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“In the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam}, Allah, may He be Exalted, tells us that there is no religion that He will accept from anyone except Islam, which means following the Messengers and that with which Allah sent them at various times, until they ended with Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), at which point all paths to Him were barred except that of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). So whoever meets Allah after He sent Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with any religion other than his, it will not be accepted, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers..} [Al `Imran 3:85]\nand He says in this verse, telling us that the only religion that is acceptable to Him is Islam :\n{Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam.} [Al `Imran 3:19]\" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir 2/25)\nIbn Al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Az-Zajjaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Din (religion) is a word which refers to everything that Allah has prescribed for people to worship Him thereby and has commanded them to adhere to it, and He will reward them for it.\nOur shaykh, ‘Ali ibn ‘Ubaydillah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Din refers to what a person adheres to and commits himself to for the sake of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\nIbn Qutaybah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Islam means entering into submission , by submitting to Allah and following His commands, and it also means surrendering.\" (Zad Al-Masir  1/267)\nAs-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The words {the religion in the sight of Allah}, mean: the religion besides which  there is no other religion that Allah approves of and will accept is Islam, which means submitting to Allah alone, outwardly and inwardly, by adhering to what He prescribed on the lips of His Messengers. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.} [Al `Imran 3:85] So whoever follows a religion other than Islam has not truly submitted to Allah, because he has not followed the path that He prescribed on the lips of His Messengers.\" (Tafsir As-Sa`di  p. 964)\nIbn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Islam, in the general sense of the word, means worshipping Allah by doing what He prescribed from the time when Allah sent the Messengers until the onset of the Hour, as He, may He be Glorified and Exalted, has stated in many verses, which indicates that the teachings of all earlier Prophets were Islam or submission to Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\nAllah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says tells us that Ibrahim said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Our Lord, and make us Muslims [in submission] to You and from our descendants a Muslim nation [in submission] to You.} [Al-Baqarah 2:128]\nIslam in the specific sense of the word, after the sending of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), is limited to that with which Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent, because that with which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent abrogated all previous religions. Thus the one who follows him is a Muslim and the one who goes against him is not a Muslim. The followers of the Messengers were Muslim at the time of their Messengers, so the Jews were Muslims at the time of Musa (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Christians were Muslims at the time of ‘Isa (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) But when the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent and they disbelieved in him, then they were not Muslims.\nThis Islamic religion is the religion that is acceptable to Allah and will benefit the one who follows it. Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam.} [Al `Imran 3:19]\n{And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.} [Al `Imran 3:85]\nThis Islam is the Islam of which Allah reminded Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his ummah that He had blessed them with it, when He, may He be Exalted, said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favour upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion.} [Al-Ma’idah 5:3]” (Sharh Thalathat Al-Usul, p. 20)\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said:\n“The religion of the Prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) is one religion, even though the systems of law vary. Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus - to establish the religion and not be divided therein.} [Ash-Shura 42:13]\n{O messengers, eat from the good foods and work righteousness. Indeed, I, of what you do, am Knowing.\nAnd indeed this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so fear Me.} [Al-Mu’minun 23:51-52]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “We Prophets, our religion is one and the Prophets are like brothers from different mothers.”\nThe religion of the Prophets is the religion of Islam, and Allah will not accept any other. It is submission to Allah by affirming His oneness, submitting to Him in obedience, and shunning shirk (association of others with Allah) and its people.\nAllah tells us that Nuh said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims.} [Yunus 10:72]\nAnd He tells us that Ibrahim said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{I have submitted [in Islam] to the Lord of the worlds.} [Al-Baqarah 2:131]\nAnd He says regarding Musa (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And Moses said, “O my people, if you have believed in Allah, then rely upon Him, if you should be Muslims”} [Yunus 10:84]\nAnd He says the Messiah (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [remember] when I inspired the disciples, \"Believe in Me and in My messenger Jesus.\" They said, \"We have believed, so bear witness that indeed we are Muslims [in submission to Allah].} [Al-Ma’idah 5:111]\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says regarding the previous Prophets and the Torah (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The prophets who submitted [to Allah] judged by it for the Jews.} [al-Ma’idah 5:44]\nAnd Allah tells us that the Queen of Saba’ (Sheba) said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to Allah, Lord of the worlds.} [An-Naml 27:44]\nThus Islam is the religion of all the Prophets; it is submission to Allah alone, and the one who submits to Him and to anyone else is a polytheist (one who associates others with Allah), whilst the one who does not submit to Him is arrogant. Both those who associate others with Allah and those who are too arrogant to worship Him are disbelievers.\nSubmission to Allah includes worshipping Him alone, and obeying Him alone. That means obeying Him at all times, by doing what He has enjoined at that time. When Islam first began, Allah commanded the Muslims to face towards Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem, when praying), then after that, He enjoined them to face towards the Ka`bah. The one who did either action, at the time when it was enjoined, is a Muslim, for religion is obedience, and both actions were acts of worship for Allah, which may take various forms, which in this case had to do with the direction in which the worshipper faced.\nLikewise, the religion of the messengers is one, and even though the systems of law and ways, and rituals, may have differed, that does not mean that the religion was not one. This is even applicable in the system of law brought by one Messenger – as we have seen in the change of the Qiblah from Bayt Al-Maqdis to the Ka`bah in the system of law brought by Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nSo the religion of the prophets is one , even though their systems of law varied. Allah may have prescribed something at one time, for a reason, then prescribed something else at another time, for a reason. So doing what was abrogated, before it was abrogated, was an act of obedience to Allah, but after it was abrogated, it became obligatory to do that which superseded it. So the one who adheres to that which has been abrogated and does not do that which superseded it is not following the religion of Islam, and he is not following any of the Prophets. Hence the Jews and Christians disbelieved, because they adhered to a system of law that had been changed and abrogated.\nAllah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, prescribed for each nation that which was appropriate to its situation and its time, which would rectify its condition and serve its best interests. Then Allah abrogated whatever He willed of those systems of law because their time had come to an end, until He sent His Prophet Muhammad, the last of the Prophets, to all the people on earth, for the rest of time until the Day of Resurrection, and He ordained for him a system of law that is comprehensive and is suited to every time and place, which cannot be altered or abrogated. So all the people of Earth have no option but to follow him and believe in him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, [O Muhammad], “O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger of Allah to you all”.} [Al-A`raf 7:159]” (Al-Irshad ila Sahih Al-I`tiqad, p. 194)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the only religion that is accepted by Allah is Islam itself. This is clearly mentioned in the Quran, specifically in Surah Al-Imran (3:19), which states: \"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam.\" Also, in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:3), it is emphasized that Allah has completed the favor upon the believers with the completion of Islam as a way of life. \n\nIslam teaches that it is the final revelation and guidance provided to humanity through the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and that the teachings of Islam encompass all aspects of life. Muslims believe that following the guidance of Islam leads to salvation and fulfillment of one's purpose in life. \n\nIf you have any more specific questions or topics you would like to explore further, feel free to ask!"

        "question": "She is concealing her conversion to Islam from her family, and they force her to prostrate to their idols; what should she do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe congratulate you, our sister, for Allah having guided you to Islam, and we ask Allah to bless you with His care and support, and to make you steadfast. We appreciate what you are going through of major challenges, and we understand very well the great impact that they have on you and what they are causing you of distress. We hope that Allah will give you the strength to overcome these challenges, and will reward you immensely for all that you are going through.\nSecondly:\nUndoubtedly it is important to plan strategically to live independently and have financial independence, and that should be among your future goals. As you are studying in order to be able to help your mother, that (i.e., continuing your studies) should be one of your plans, so that you will be able to support yourself (by working after you graduate) in a place far away from your family’s supervision and pressure. Undoubtedly there are some details of your situation of which we are not aware, and we cannot say that you should do such and such, or not do such and such, in precise terms.\nWe can only say that complete freedom to practice your religion and perform the obligatory acts of worship, and keep away from family pressure and the challenges of concealing your religion, is something that you must begin to plan to attain, even if the plans are slow and will only be achieved in the long term.\nThirdly:\nOne of the important tricks that have been used by people in circumstances similar to yours is that they started by claiming that they were losing interest in [their former] religion and its rituals, because families usually react violently to a change of religion, but their reaction is less serious if their daughter pretends to have lost interest in [their] religion and its rituals.\nWe do not know precisely how successful this trick will be in your case, but we suggest that you can try it.\nFourthly:\nWith regard to the issue of prostrating, there is a permissible way out that may be suggested so that you can pass this terrible and painful test. This is by doing this prostration when you are forced to do it, but you can intend in your heart that you are prostrating to Allah, may He be glorified. Thus it will be a prostration to Allah in front of the idol, but it will not be a prostration to the idol.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: Outward actions that constitute disbelief, such as prostrating to idols and reviling the Messenger, and the like, are disallowed because they are indicative of inward disbelief.\nBut if it so happens that a person prostrated in front of an idol but he did not intend in his heart to prostrate to it – rather he intended in his heart to prostrate to Allah – then it does not constitute disbelief, and that may be permitted if a person is living among polytheists and fears for his life, so he goes along with them in outward actions, intending in his heart to prostrate to Allah. This is like what was narrated, that some of the scholars of the Muslims and scholars of the People of the Book did that with some people who were polytheists, then they called them to Islam and those people became Muslim as a result; they did not show that they were different from them in the beginning.\"(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa  14/120).\nSo if you are compelled to do this prostration, let your intention be that it is prostration to Allah, and the fact that the idol is present in the place where you are prostrating to Allah will not harm you, and neither will their thinking that you are prostrating to their idol, so long as you are in these extenuating circumstances. We ask Allah to grant you relief soon, and a way out from this environment that is hostile to your religion.\nWhatever the case, you should understand that so long as your heart is at peace with faith and comfortable with it, there is no blame on you for anything that you say or do under compulsion, and that will not affect the soundness of your faith. This is a great concession granted by the Lord of the Worlds, the Most Merciful of those who show mercy, to the weak and oppressed among His slaves, those who have no control over their affairs. So if they find themselves doing some practices of disbelief under pressure from the disbelievers who are forcing them to do that, they do not become disbelievers or go beyond the bounds of Islam, and they are not sinning by doing such things. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whoever disbelieves in Allah after his belief... except for one who is forced [to renounce his religion] while his heart is secure in faith. But those who [willingly] open their hearts to disbelief, upon them is wrath from Allah, and for them is a great punishment} [an-Nahl 16:106].\nFor more information on this topic, please see the answer to question no. 150748 .\nFifthly:\nAs you now realise, there is no blame on you if your family put pressure on you to prostrate to their idols or to join them in any of their rituals of disbelief. There is no blame on you if you do as much of that as will ward off their harm from you, and will protect you from their persecution, so that they will not become suspicious about your having become Muslim.\nIn that case, what we advise you to do – and we do not see any other solution right now – is not to tell any of them about your religion, because they will not compromise with you and they will not accept your situation, especially in your society, which is very hostile towards Islam and Muslims.\nTherefore you must take precautions by doing your acts of worship and rituals of your religion in secret, away from their gaze, and whatever you are unable to do because you are being watched by your disbelieving family or your community that is hostile towards you and your religion, there is no blame on you regarding that, and that obligation is waived in your case, for Allah does not burden any soul with more than it can bear.\nIn the answer to question no. 324751 , we said to a new Muslim woman who persecution:\nWhat you must do is do whatever you are able to of that, without exposing yourself to trouble or persecution, until Allah grants you relief and a way out.\nWhatever you are able to do in secret of prayers and other acts of worship, do it.\nWhatever you are unable to do of that, then Allah is Oft-Pardoning, Most Generous; He has commanded His slaves to do whatever of His commands and acts of worship they are able to do, and He has not obliged them to do that which they are unable to do.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{So fear Allah as much as you are able} [at-Taghabun 64:16]\n{The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers, [saying], “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and we obey. [We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination.”\nAllah does not burden any soul with more than it can bear. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned. “Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred. Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us. You are our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people.”} [al-Baqarah 2:285-286].\nWe have also previously given advice in several questions to people who have gone through the same situation as you, which you should read so that you can learn how to conduct yourself in your current, difficult circumstances. Please see the answer to question no. 192411 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, a person's faith and belief in God (Allah) are of utmost importance, and one should never compromise their beliefs by participating in acts of worship that contradict those beliefs, such as prostrating to idols. \n\nFor a person who is concealing her conversion to Islam and is being pressured to do something against her faith, she should take the following steps:\n\n1. **Seek Knowledge and Guidance**: It’s important to understand the teachings of Islam regarding such situations. She should consult with knowledgeable individuals or scholars who can provide guidance.\n\n2. **Assess the Situation**: If prostrating to idols is forced upon her, this is a clear violation of her Islamic beliefs. The act of prostration to idols is considered shirk (associating partners with Allah), which is a serious sin in Islam.\n\n3. **Avoiding Compromise**: Islam teaches that believers should not engage in acts that contradict their faith, even under duress. She should express her beliefs to her family calmly and respectfully, if safe to do so.\n\n4. **Seek Support**: It may be beneficial to seek help from local Muslim communities or organizations that can provide emotional support and possibly mediation with her family.\n\n5. **Prioritize Safety**: If there is a risk of harm or serious consequences for herself or her family as a result of her conversion, she should prioritize her safety while maintaining her faith. This may mean finding discreet ways to practice her religion or seeking refuge in a safe environment if necessary.\n\n6. **Dua (Supplication)**: She should make dua for guidance, strength, and a way to navigate her situation that allows her to maintain her faith.\n\nUltimately, faith is a private matter between the individual and Allah, and one must strive to maintain their beliefs while also considering their personal safety and well-being."

        "question": "Who Are the Awliya’ of Allah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Who are the Awliya’ of Allah? \nThe awliya’ of Allah (allies of Allah ) – clearly and briefly – are people of faith and piety, who are constantly aware that Allah, may He be exalted, is watching them in all their affairs, so they adhere to His commands and heed His prohibitions.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Unquestionably, [for] the allies [awliya’] of Allah there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve,\nThose who believed and were fearing Allah, For them are good tidings in the worldly life and in the Hereafter. No change is there in the words of Allah. That is what is the great attainment} [Yunus 10:62-64].\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tafsir Al-Qur’an al-‘Azim (4/278):\n“Here Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that His awliya’ are those who believe and fear Him, as their Lord describes them. So everyone who fears Allah and is mindful of Him is a wali (singular of awliya’). {There will be no fear concerning them} regarding what awaits in the future of the terrors of the resurrection, {nor will they grieve} for what they have left behind in this world.\n‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud, Ibn ‘Abbas and more than one of the early generations said: The awliya’ of Allah are those who, if you see them, they remind you of Allah. This was narrated in a marfu‘ hadith.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Among the slaves of Allah are some whom the prophets and martyrs will envy.” It was said: Who are they, O Messenger of Allah, so that we may love them? He said: “They are people who love one another for the sake of Allah, not because of ties of trade or kindred. Their faces will be light on thrones of light. They will not fear when the people fear and they will not grieve when the people grieve.” Then he recited the words, {Unquestionably, [for] the allies [awliya’] of Allah there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve} [Yunus 10:62]. Narrated by Abu Dawud with a jayyid isnad. It was classed as sahih by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah as-Sahihah (7/1369).”\nDegree of wilayah \nThe degree of wilayah [being a wali of Allah] varies according to a person’s faith and fear of Allah (taqwa). Every believer has a share of wilayah, love of Allah and closeness to Him, but this share varies according to his righteous deeds, both physical actions and deeds of the heart, by means of which he draws closer to Allah. Based on that, it is possible to divide the degrees and ranks of wilayah into three levels:\n\nThe one who wronged himself. This refers to the believer who commits sin. He will have a degree of wilayah commensurate with his level of faith and righteous deeds.\nThe one who is moderate. This refers to the believer who adheres to the commands of Allah and heeds His prohibitions, but he does not strive in doing supererogatory acts. He is of a higher level of wilayah than the first one.\nThe one who is foremost in good deeds. This is the one who does supererogatory acts as well as obligatory duties, and attains the highest level of worshipping Allah, may He be exalted, by doing deeds of the heart. This is one of the highest levels of wilayah.\n\nThere can be no doubt that prophethood is the highest and loftiest level of wilayah and being an ally of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu‘ al-Fatawa (10/6):\n“People are of three levels: the one who wrongs himself, the one who is moderate, and the one who is foremost in good deeds.\n\nThe one who wrongs himself is the one who sins by failing to do what is enjoined or doing what is prohibited.\nThe one who is moderate is the one who does obligatory deeds and refrains from haram deeds.\nThe one who is foremost in good deeds is the one who draws close to Allah by doing whatever he can of obligatory and recommended (mustahabb) deeds, and refraining from haram and disliked (makruh) deeds.\n\nEven though the one who is moderate or the one who is foremost in good deeds may commit some sins, they will be erased from their record, either by means of repentance – for Allah loves those who repent and He loves those who purify themselves – or by means of good deeds which erase bad deeds, or by means of calamities that expiate bad deeds, or by other means. Both categories, those who are moderate and those who are foremost in good deeds, are among the awliya’ of Allah whom He mentions in His Book when He says (interpretation of the meaning): {Unquestionably, [for] the allies [awliya’] of Allah there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve} [Yunus 10:62]. Thus the definition of the ‘awliya’ of Allah is the believers who fear Him and are mindful of Him.\nBut these awliya’ may be divided into a general group, namely those who are moderate, and an elite group, namely those who are foremost in good deeds, even though those who are foremost in good deeds are the highest levels, such as the prophets and those who are strong and true in faith (siddiqs).\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned these two categories in a hadith which was narrated by al-Bukhari in his Sahih from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Allah says: ‘Whosoever shows enmity to an ally of Mine has declared war on Me. My slave draws not close to Me with anything more loved by Me than the obligatory religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My slave continues to draw close to Me with supererogatory deeds so that I will love him. So when I love him, I will be his hearing with which he hears, his vision with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks. So by My help and guidance he will hear, by My help and guidance he will see, by My help and guidance he will strike, and by My help and guidance he will walk. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to seek refuge in Me, I would surely grant him it. I do not hesitate to do anything as I hesitate to take the soul of My believing slave, for he hates death and I hate to hurt him, but there is no escaping it.’”\nAs for the believer who wrongs himself, he attains wilayah commensurate with the level of his faith and piety, just as he has the opposite of that commensurate with the level of his bad deeds, because an individual may do both good deeds that earn reward and bad deeds that incur punishment, so it is possible that he may be both rewarded and punished. This is the view of all the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), the leading scholars of Islam, and Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah, who say that no one who has an atom’s weight of faith in his heart will abide forever in the Fire.”\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in Fatawa Muhimmah (p. 83):\n“Whoever is a believer and fears Allah is a wali (ally) of Allah, and whoever is not like that is not a wali of Allah. If he has a little faith and fear of Allah, then he has some measure of wilayah.”\nIs Wilayah exclusive to some particular class of people?\nWilayah is not a monopoly, and it is not exclusive to some particular class of people. It cannot be inherited and it cannot be awarded like a medal. Rather it is a divinely granted status that begins in the heart with love and veneration of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and is reflected in a person’s behaviour, so that that individual attains the love and wilayah of Allah, may He be exalted.\nCan the Wali of Allah do haram deeds?\nWilayah does not mean that a person can do haram deeds or omit obligatory duties; rather if a person does that, it indicates that his wilayah is lacking. By the same token, it does not allow anyone else to exaggerate about those whom they call awliya’ – who may not even deserve that – and elevate them to the level of prophethood, to the extent that they would not refuse any instruction that they give them, and would not debate any view or opinion that they suggest. All of that comes under the heading of exaggeration which Allah, may He be exalted, has forbidden, for it is one of the greatest causes of people falling into shirk (association of others with Allah).\nSome people have overstepped this mark and fallen into major shirk because of a failure to properly understand the meaning of wilayah and the status of the awliya’. Hence you see them calling upon the awliya’ instead of Allah, making sacrifices and other offerings to them, and circumambulating their tombs.\nIs it permissible to call the awliya’ the “friends of Allah (ashab Allah)”?\nWith regard to calling the awliya’ the “friends of Allah (ashab Allah),” there is nothing to suggest that this is a sound way of describing them.\nThe best of the ‘awliya’ of Allah, may He be exalted, are the messengers and prophets, then the Companions of Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then those who came after them, then those who came after them. We do not know that the phrase “ashab Allah (friends of Allah)” was given to any of them.\nRather it was soundly narrated from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that they are called Ahl al-Quran (the people of the Quran) or Ahl Allah (the people of Allah).\nImam Ahmad (11870) and Ibn Majah (215) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has His own people among mankind.” They said, O Messenger of Allah, who are they? He said, “The people of the Quran, the people of Allah and those who are closest to Him.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)\nThe people of the Quran are those who have memorised it, recite it and act in accordance with its teachings.\nThe people of Allah are His awliya’ (allies) who are as close to Him as a man is to his own family.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The term \"Awliya’ Allah\" (أولياء الله) refers to the \"friends\" or \"allies\" of Allah in Islamic theology. These are individuals who have attained a close relationship with Allah through their piety, devotion, and righteous deeds. \n\nIn the Qur'an, it is stated:\n\n**“Verily, the Awliya’ of Allah shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.”** (Qur'an 10:62)\n\nAwliya’ can be understood as those who are characterized by their strong faith (Iman), love for Allah, adherence to His commandments, and the practice of the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). They are often thought to have been granted special spiritual insight, blessings, and sometimes miracles (karamat) as a sign of their closeness to Allah.\n\nCharacteristics of the Awliya’ include:\n\n1. **Taqwa (Piety)**: They have a strong awareness of Allah and strive to fulfill their religious obligations.\n2. **Sincerity (Ikhlas)**: Their actions are done purely for the sake of Allah.\n3. **Love for Allah and His Messenger**: They exhibit a profound love and devotion to Allah and His Prophet.\n4. **Service to Others**: They are often engaged in acts of kindness and service to humanity.\n5. **Gratitude and Patience**: They show resilience in trials and maintain a state of gratitude towards Allah.\n\nIt's important to note that claims of being an Awliya' are not made lightly, and individuals are recognized as such based on their actions and the perceptions of their communities. The concept of Awliya’ can vary across different Islamic traditions, but the essence remains the same—a deep spiritual connection with the Divine."

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, it is important to understand the concept of causation and the proper attribution of events to Allah. Generally, Muslims are taught that all events occur by the will and decree of Allah (SWT). \n\nWhen expressing the sequence of events or processes, it is often stated that something happened by the will and decree of Allah alone. However, stating \"by virtue of Allah then the Qur’an\" could imply that the Qur'an is a separate, significant cause independent of Allah's will, which may lead to misunderstanding.\n\nTo maintain clarity in Islamic beliefs, it is advisable to attribute all occurrences directly to Allah's will and decree, without suggesting that the Qur'an functions as a separate source of cause. A more appropriate way to phrase it could be: \"This happened by the will of Allah, and the guidance of the Qur'an played a role in our understanding or actions.\"\n\nIt's always best to consult knowledgeable scholars or trusted sources of Islamic guidance for specific rulings or interpretations regarding such expressions."

        "question": "Ruling on mocking Islam and those who are committed to it",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Mockery – which may also imply showing disrespect or making fun of something – in some cases constitutes major disbelief (kufr akbar) which puts a person beyond the bounds of Islam. In other cases, it comes under the heading of evildoing, and in some cases it may come under both headings.\n1. If it is mocking Allah, may He be exalted, or the Quran, or the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then it is disbelief (kufr) that puts a person beyond the bounds of Islam. This is indicated by the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if you ask them, they will surely say, “We were only conversing and playing.” Say, “Is it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?”\nMake no excuse; you have disbelieved after your belief} [At-Tawbah 9:65-66].\nThe scholars are unanimously agreed on that.\n2. If it is mocking people themselves and their worldly actions that have nothing to do with religion, then it comes under the heading of evildoing (fisq), concerning which Allah, may He be exalted, said (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them; nor let women ridicule [other] women; perhaps they may be better than them} [Al-Hujurat 49:11].\n3. As for the possibility that it may be both disbelief (kufr) that puts a person beyond the bounds of Islam and evildoing (fisq), this refers to mocking the Muslim for his religious commitment and his appearance that is in accordance with the Sunnah. If the mockery is because of the religious teaching that the Muslim is adhering to, then it constitutes disbelief that puts a person beyond the bounds of Islam. If it is mocking the Muslim himself because, for example, he is not religious enough to show that he is a committed Muslim, or because he goes to extremes or is very strict in implementing the Sunnah in a manner that is not supported by the religious texts, then this comes under the heading of evildoing, because it is mocking a person and is not mocking the religion.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nIf someone mocks the religion by mocking the beard or shortening of the thobe, is that regarded as disbelief (kufr)?\nHe replied:\nIt depends. If his aim is to mock the religion, then it constitutes apostasy, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “Is it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?”\nMake no excuse; you have disbelieved after your belief} [At-Tawbah 9:65-66].\nBut if it is mocking the person himself for other reasons, such as if it has to do with his beard or his shortening of his thobe, and what is meant by mocking him is that he is too strict, or it is mocking other things, such as his strictness in this regard and his lenience regarding other issues that he knows are part of religious teachings, and his aim is not to mock the religion, rather the intention is to mock the person for shortening his thobe or for other reasons, if his intention is to mock the religion and show disrespect to the religion, then this constitutes apostasy. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.\nAfter that, he was asked:\nWhat if he says: I say that to people to make them laugh, by way of joking?\nHe replied:\nThis is not permissible; it is an evil deed and the one who does it is taking a risk, and if his aim is to mock the religion, then it constitutes disbelief (kufr).\"(Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz 28/365, 366).\nBased on that, we may say regarding the topic of the question:\nIf the speaker’s aim is to mock the ruqyah itself, then it constitutes disbelief which puts him beyond the bounds of Islam, because he is mocking the Quran.\nIf his aim is to mock the person himself, because he is not qualified to recite ruqyah, or because he is claiming to treat the problem by means of the Quran, but in reality that is not the case, so the mockery is directed at the person himself, it does not constitute disbelief; rather it is evildoing and is haram.\nIf he claims that he did not intend to mock anyone, rather he wanted to joke and make people laugh, then he is taking a risk, because there is no room for joking about such matters.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, mocking or ridiculing the religion, its teachings, or those who are committed to it is considered a serious offense. It goes against the principles of respect, reverence, and dignity that are emphasized in the Qur'an and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nThe Qur'an contains verses that instruct Muslims to respond to mockery and insults with dignity and patience. For example:\n\n- Surah Al-Ahzab (33:57) states: \"Indeed, those who abuse Allah and His Messenger - Allah has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter and prepared for them a humiliating punishment.\"\n\nAlso, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) faced mockery and ridicule during his mission, and he exhibited patience and perseverance in response.\n\nMocking or disrespecting any aspect of Islam is not only disrespectful but also harmful to the unity and peace within the community. It is important for Muslims to uphold the values of respect, tolerance, and understanding, even in the face of mockery or hostility.\n\nIn conclusion, mocking Islam and its adherents is viewed as a serious violation of Islamic ethics, and it is encouraged for Muslims to respond with wisdom and good character while standing firm in their faith."

        "question": "He swore that if he did such and such, he would die a disbeliever, then he did that thing, then he died, so has he died a disbeliever?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Swearing that one will be a disbeliever in order to make oneself do something or refrain from something is reprehensible speech, and it is not permissible.\nAl-Bukhari (1363) and Muslim (110) narrated from Thabit ibn ad-Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever swears deliberately and falsely that he belongs to a religion other than Islam is as he said.”\nAbu Dawud (3258) and Ahmad (23006) narrated that Buraydah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an oath and says ‘I have nothing to do with Islam’, if he is lying it will be as he said, and if he is telling the truth he will not return to Islam soundly.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.\nIf he swore that he would become a disbeliever, intending it literally and meaning what he said, then he is a disbeliever, because he meant it.\nBut if he swore that he would become a disbeliever if he did something, so as to stop himself from doing it and make that thing off-putting to himself, then he did it, he does not become a disbeliever as a result of doing it, but he must offer expiation for breaking an oath (kaffarat yamin).\nIf he said that he would become a Jew, or a Christian, or a Zoroastrian, or that he would have nothing to do with Islam, or that he would become a communist if he did such and such; or he swore by Allah that he would stop doing something, and that if he went back to it then he would die as a disbeliever, and the like, then this is an oath, and he must offer expiation if he breaks his oath, but he does not become a disbeliever thereby, according to scholarly consensus, as was narrated by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), who said:\nIf he said that he would become a Jew or a Christian if he did such and such, or that if he did such and such he would become a disbeliever, and the like, then the leading scholars are agreed that if he breaks his oath, he does not become a disbeliever; rather he must offer expiation for breaking an oath according to Abu Hanifah and Ahmad, according to the well-known view narrated from him. According to Malik and ash-Shafa‘i, he does not have to do anything, unlike the case if he said, “If you give me the money, I will become a disbeliever.” In this case, he becomes a disbeliever on that basis; in fact he became a disbeliever immediately [as soon as he said these words], because he meant it and intended that he would become a disbeliever if that condition was fulfilled [and his oath was broken].\"(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa  33/199).\nIbn ‘Allan (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“then he is as he said” means: if he wanted to change his religion and was determined that he would do that if he did that thing [concerning which he swore that oath], then he becomes a disbeliever immediately, because deciding to disbelieve constitutes disbelief. But if his intention was to make sure that he would not do that thing, and he intended never to do the thing mentioned in his oath, then it is a sin and he must ask Allah for forgiveness for it.\"(Dalil al-Falihin (8/394); see also: al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah  7/300-303).\nSee also the answer to question no. 174658 .\nIf he said that and then died:\n\nIf he did not do the thing concerning which he swore that oath, then there is no blame on him and nothing is required of his heirs.\nIf he did do it, and died before he could offer expiation for his oath, then his heirs must offer expiation on his behalf from his wealth (the estate).\n\nIt says in Mughni al-Muhtaj (6/192):\nIf someone dies owing expiation, then the least expensive option must be given from his estate.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, swearing an oath that one would die a disbeliever if one did a particular action is a serious matter. However, the consequences of such a situation depend on various factors, primarily the intention (niyyah) behind the action and the person's state of faith at the time of death.\n\nIf a person swore that they would die a disbeliever if they committed an act, and then they did commit that act, it does not automatically mean that they died as a disbeliever. The essential aspect to consider is whether they acted in an emotionally charged state, under coercion, or in a way that reflects a fundamental change in their belief system.\n\nIslam teaches that faith is deeply personal and internal. A person remains a believer until the very last moment of their life, and their actions can change based on their circumstances, intentions, and repentance. Additionally, it is important to recognize that Allah's mercy encompasses all, and the ultimate judgment belongs to Him alone.\n\nIf a person did renounce faith knowingly and purposefully, then that might lead to disbelief. However, each case is scenario-dependent and should be approached with caution and understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not appropriate for anyone to declare definitively that someone has died a disbeliever based solely on a situation as you described. Ultimately, one should not rush to judgment and should leave the matter to Allah, who knows the heart and intentions of every individual. It is also wise for individuals to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars on such complicated theological issues."

        "question": "What is the third eye?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is no such thing as the third eye, which they say is on the forehead, between the eyes. This is a concept that originally stems from idolatrous religions.\nSee: https://bit.ly/3vnLwQY\nThere is no mention in the Qur’an or Sunnah, or in the words of the Sahaabah or the leading scholars who came after them, of this so-called invisible eye.\nBut there is insight (baseerah), intuition (faraasah) and inspiration (ilhaam), all of which cannot be acquired by one’s efforts; rather they are gifts from Allah to some of His slaves.\nWith regard to insight, al-Jarjaani said in at-Ta‘reefaat (p. 46): Insight (baseerah) is an ability in the heart that is illuminated by divine light, by which a person may see the true nature of things and what lies beyond their physical appearance. It is similar to eyesight with which he sees the physical appearance of things. End quote.\nWith regard to intuition (faraasah), Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, discussing its cause, its true nature and its origin:\nIt is light that Allah shines into the heart of His slave, by means of which he distinguishes between truth and falsehood, good and bad, the one who tells the truth and the one who tells lies.\nIts true nature is that it is an idea that springs to mind and rules out its opposite; it overwhelms the heart like a lion overwhelms the prey.… This intuition is commensurate with the strength of the person’s faith: whoever is stronger in faith, his intuition will be sharper.\nThe origin of this type of intuition is life and light that Allah, may He be exalted, grants to whomever He wills of His slaves, and the heart is revived and illuminated by that, so that his intuition is hardly ever wrong. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And is one who was dead and We gave him life and made for him light by which to walk among the people like one who is in darkness, never to emerge therefrom?} [al-An‘aam 6:122].\nHis heart was deadened by disbelief and ignorance, then Allah revived it with faith and knowledge, and through the Qur’an and faith, He gave him light by means of which he finds the appropriate way of dealing with people, and finds his way in the darkness.

        "predicted_answer": "In a spiritual and metaphorical context, the \"third eye\" often refers to an inner vision or heightened awareness that allows individuals to perceive things beyond ordinary sight. This concept is more prominently found in various Eastern religions and philosophies, such as Hinduism and Buddhism, where it is associated with intuition, higher consciousness, and spiritual insight.\n\nIn the context of Islam, however, the notion of a \"third eye\" is not traditionally prevalent. Islam emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge through the Quran and Sunnah (the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad) and encourages believers to use reason and reflection in their understanding of faith and the world. \n\nIf you are referring to a specific concept or interpretation within Islamic thought, please clarify, and I would be happy to provide more information."

        "question": "Can Anyone Other than Allah Know the Unseen?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Types of the Unseen in Islam\nThe unseen (al-ghayb) is of two types:\n1- That which is absolutely unseen and unknown. No one knows this type except Allah . For example, this includes knowledge of when the Hour will begin, when rain will fall, and so on.\n2- That which is relatively unseen and unknown, knowledge of which is hidden from some people and others know it. This is described as unseen or unknown in relation to the one who does not know it, and it is not unknown or unseen for the one who does know it.\nA person may learn of that which is relatively unseen either through revelation, or through life experience, or through empirical science, or other means through which he may come to know of that which is hidden from many people, such as finding out about what is in the depths of the oceans, or in the caves of the earth or in the heavens.\nIbn Taymiyah said: \n“As for that which some people know, it is unseen (ghayb) for those who do not know it, and it is seen for those who do know it.” (An-Nubuwwat, 2/1022)\nCommentary on al-Jinn 72:26-27\nWith regard to the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n{[He is] Knower of the unseen, and He does not disclose His [knowledge of the] unseen to anyone, except whom He has approved of messengers.} [al-Jinn 72:26-27], Ibn Kathir said: \n“{Knower of the unseen, and He does not disclose His [knowledge of the] unseen to anyone, except whom He has approved of messengers} – this is like the verse in which He, may He be exalted, says: {and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills.} [al-Baqarah 2:255]\nSimilarly, He says here that He knows the unseen and the seen, and that none of His creation can learn about anything of His knowledge except what He, may He be exalted, discloses to him. Hence He says: {and He does not disclose His [knowledge of the] unseen to anyone, except whom He has approved of messengers}.\nThis includes both angelic and human messengers.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 8/247)\nIbn ‘Ashur said: \n“Allah discloses some things to some of His Messengers because of the message that He wants to send to humankind.\nThus we may know that the unseen matters that Allah discloses to the messengers are of a type that is part of the message; these are: matters of the unseen that Allah wanted to convey to people so that they might believe in them, or act upon them; the unseen matters that have to do with the promise of reward and threat of punishment, which have to do with matters of the Hereafter or matters of this world; and what Allah tells His messengers about of matters of the unseen as proof that they are indeed messengers, such as the verses in which He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \n{The Byzantines have been defeated in the nearest land. But they, after their defeat, will overcome within three to nine years.} [ar-Rum 30:2-4]\nThe purpose behind that is so that the messengers will acquire certain, clear and beneficial knowledge, as if they had seen these matters themselves.” (At-Tahrir wa’t-Tanwir, 29/248)\nWith regard to what is granted to some of the righteous of knowledge of some unseen matters, it is by way of karamah (honouring them) and may be granted by some of them by way of inspiration and the like.\nShaykh al-Islam said: \n“The miracles and signs of the awliya (close friends of Allah) are part of the miracles and signs of the prophets, because they definitely confirm the prophethood of the prophets and confirm that they are indeed true prophets. Were that not the case, these people would not be awliya and they would not have any miracles (karamat ).” (An-Nubuwwat, 2/824)\nSome of the scholars stated that letting the awliya find out about some matters of the unseen could happen through the angels, so it is like us learning about the events of the Hereafter, which is a matter of the unseen, through the messengers. Thus when we speak of it, it is not the same as when the messengers speak of it.\nTypes of revelation (wahy)\nWith regard to the verses referred to, there is nothing in them about learning about the unseen; rather they refer to inspiration that is granted to some of the awliya. Perhaps this is the source of the questioner’s confusion, because the verses speak of wahy being given to someone other than the prophets.\nThe response to that is as follows:\nWahy (revelation, inspiration) is of two types:\n1. Wahy in a special sense (revelation), which is the sending of an angelic messenger to a prophet or messenger.\n2. Wahy in a general sense (inspiration), which is what happens to some of the awliya, and to the angels, and to some created beings; this happens through inspiration, dreams, and so on.\nShaykh al-Islam said: \n“Not everyone who receives wahy in the general sense (inspiration) is a prophet, for wahy (inspiration) may be sent to other people.” (An-Nubuwwat, 2/690)\nAnd he said: \n“Similarly, the word wahy may be used in a general sense (meaning inspiration)…\nWahy in the general sense is what may happen to some individuals.” (Majmu‘at al-Masail, Rashid Rida, 3/96)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, the concept of the \"Unseen\" (Ghayb) refers to knowledge that only Allah possesses, including matters related to the future, the Day of Judgment, and other aspects that are beyond human perception. \n\nThe Quran emphasizes that knowledge of the Unseen is a unique attribute of Allah. For instance, in Surah Al-Jinn (72:26-27), it is stated that only Allah knows the Unseen, and there are no intermediaries who can have that knowledge. While prophets and messengers may receive certain revelations from Allah, they do not possess independent knowledge of the Unseen. Instead, such revelations are granted to them by Allah for a specific purpose.\n\nThus, in general, it is understood in Islamic belief that no one besides Allah has the complete knowledge of the Unseen. Humans can have some knowledge that is revealed to them or inferred from signs, but ultimate knowledge belongs solely to Allah."

        "question": "Can We Say that a Person Has Wronged His Lord?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Types of Zulm (wrongdoing) in Islam\nWrong others \nWrongdoing (zulm) is something that a person may do to other people or other creatures, by impugning their honour or harming them physically, or transgressing against their wealth unlawfully.\nWronging oneself\nThe word wrongdoing (zulm) refers to what a person may do of heedlessness or falling short with regard to his duties towards Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nIn the case of this type of wrongdoing, it cannot be said that the person wronged his Lord; rather in reality he has wronged himself, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is not harmed by the disobedience of His slaves and He does not benefit from their obedience.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, said of the Children of Israel (interpretation of the meaning):\n{and they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves.} [al-Baqarah 2:57]\nIbn Jarir at-Tabari said: \n“What is meant by the words {and they wronged Us not} is that their actions and their disobedience to Us did not cause any harm to Us or undermine Us. Rather their actions caused harm to them and undermined them… For our Lord, may He glorified, is not harmed by the sin of a sinner, His stores are not depleted by the wrongdoing of a wrongdoer, He does not benefit from the obedience of one who is obedient, His dominion is not increased by the justice of one who is just; rather the wrongdoer only wrongs himself, the sinner only undermines himself, the obedient one only benefits himself, and the just one only helps himself.” (Tafsir at-Tabari, 1/711)\nMoreover, wrongdoing and oppression (zulm) only affects those who are helpless, weak or easy to pick on, and Allah is far above such things.\nHence Ibn 'Abbas said concerning the words {and they wronged Us not}: “[What is meant is:] We are too mighty to be wronged.” (Tafsir Ibn Abi Hatim, 1/116)\nAl-Alusi said: “It is not possible for anyone to wrong Allah, may He be exalted, at all.” (Ruh al-Ma'ani, 1/265)\nIbn al-Qayyim said: “No person can wrong his Lord; rather he wrongs himself. And his Lord does not wrong him; rather he is the one who wrongs himself.” (al-Jawab al-Kafi, p. 71)\nIs it OK to say that a person has wronged his Lord?\nHence what is commonly said by some people, that it is possible for a person to wrong his Lord and to wrong himself and to wrong others is not correct. Rather the correct thing is to say that the person did wrong with regard to his relationship with his Lord.\nTypes of sins\nIn the hadith it says: \n“Sins are of three types: a sin of which Allah will not forgive any part, a sin that Allah does not care about, and a sin of which He will not overlook any part.\nAs for the sin of which Allah will not forgive any part, it is associating others with Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills} [an-Nisa 4:48]\nAs for the sin which Allah does not care about, it is when a person wrongs himself by falling short regarding his relationship with his Lord.\nAs for the sin of which Allah will not overlook any part, it is the wrongs that people do to one another and scores that will inevitably be settled.” (Narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak ‘ala as-Sahihayn, 4/619). There is some weakness in its isnad, but it has corroborating evidence in the hadith of Anas that was narrated by Abu Dawud at-Tayalisi (3/579). It was classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (1927).\nCategories of zulm according to some scholars\nSome of the scholars mentioned only two categories of wrongdoing.\nIbn Rajab al-Hanbali said of wrongdoing (zulm): It is of two types:\nThe first type is wronging oneself, the worst of which is shirk (associating others with Allah), as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, association [with Him] is great injustice (zulm).} [Luqman 31:13]\nThe one who associates others with Him has regarded a created being as being of the same status as the Creator, and has worshipped that created being and shown devotion to it, thus putting things in the wrong place. The most frequently mentioned warnings to wrongdoers in the Quran refer to those who associate others with Allah, as He, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And the disbelievers - they are the wrongdoers.} [al-Baqarah 2:254]\nThen after that come other sins, of various types, major and minor .\nThe second type of wrongdoing is wronging others. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said in his khutbah during the Farewell Pilgrimage: “Indeed your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to you, as sacred as this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours.” (Jami‘ al-‘Ulum wa’l-Hikam, 2/36)\nIn conclusion, what a person does of shirk, disbelief (kufr), sins and major sins is wronging himself, or it may be said that the person has done wrong with regard to his relationship with Allah. What is meant by that is sins that have nothing to do with the rights of other people; rather they are transgressions against the rights of Allah, may He be exalted. It cannot be said that the person wronged his Lord, because this phrase is likely to be misunderstood, and Allah is too great and mighty to be wronged by any of His slaves.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, it can be said that a person wrongs their Lord by committing acts of disobedience or turning away from the guidance that has been provided through divine revelations. This is often framed in terms of \"dhulm,\" or injustice, which can be directed towards oneself, others, or against Allah.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to understand that Allah is Transcendent and free from any imperfection. Therefore, while individuals can wrong themselves by their choices (such as through sin), the notion of \"wronging Allah\" does not imply that they can affect Him in any way. Instead, it refers to a failure to fulfill the duties owed to Him, such as obeying His commandments, acknowledging His greatness, or acting in accordance with His guidance.\n\nIn the Quran and Hadith literature, believers are encouraged to seek forgiveness and repent for their shortcomings and sins, as Allah is Most Merciful and Forgiving. Thus, while it is accurate to say that a person can wrong themselves in relation to their obligations to Allah, this is usually framed within the context of personal accountability and the call to repentance."

        "question": "Any Difference between ‘In Sha Allah’ and ‘Bi Idhnillah’?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We do not think there is any difference between you saying “In sha Allah ” or “Bi idhnillah.” That is for several reasons, the most important of which are:\nFirstly:\nWhat is meant by both phrases is very similar, so making something conditional upon Allah’s will is similar to making it conditional upon His leave or permission. This is because both the general will of Allah and His universal leave and decree are both characteristics of divine Lordship that belong to the Creator, may He be glorified and exalted. Whatever Allah wills, He has permitted it to happen, and whatever He has permitted to happen, He has willed that it be created and brought into existence. Thus the two meanings are synonymous.\nSecondly:\nThe Quranic usage of these two phrases is also very close in meaning, and we do not see any difference between their meanings, as they are always used in the same context. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{It has never been for us to bring you evidence except by permission of Allah.} [Ibrahim 14:11]\n{And it was not for a messenger to come with a sign except by permission of Allah.} [ar-Ra‘d 13:38]\nWith regard to His will, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Blessed is He who, if He willed, could have made for you [something] better than that - gardens beneath which rivers flow - and could make for you palaces.} [al-Furqan 25:10]\nIn fact, in the Quran there are some verses which mention both phrases together, which is indicative of how close they are in meaning. We see this in the verses in which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And it is not for any human being that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that He sends a messenger to reveal, by His permission, what He wills. Indeed, He is Most High and Wise.} [ash-Shura 42:51]\n{And how many angels there are in the heavens whose intercession will not avail at all except [only] after Allah has permitted [it] to whom He wills and approves.} [an-Najm 53:26]\nThirdly:\nWe have not come across anyone among the mufassirin, scholars of ‘aqidah and commentators on hadith who differentiates between the two phrases; rather we have found those who interpret the divine will as referring to Allah’s leave or permission.\nAl-‘Allamah at-Tahir ibn ‘Ashur (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“What is meant by the divine will is Allah’s permission.” (At-Tahrir wa’t-Tanwir (15/296)\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Allah’s permission is of two types: universal (kawni) and religious (shar‘i). They have been explained previously in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {it is [none but] he who has brought the Quran down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah} [al-Baqarah 2:97].” (Tafsir al-Fatihah wa’l-Baqarah, 3/36)\nThe fuqaha have a topic called al-istithna (condition; it refers to saying “In sha Allah (if Allah wills)”) in which they discuss oaths, vows, divorce (talaq) and so on. They say: That is when you connect something to the will of Allah and the like, which renders the ruling invalid, as it says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (7/278). And they say: When you say “bi idhnillah,” it leads to the same outcomes as saying “in sha Allah .”\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked the following question: Is it permissible to make a condition in an oath by saying words other than “in sha Allah,” such as saying “Bi idhnillah (by Allah’s leave)”?\nHe replied:\n“Yes, that is permissible, because saying “bi idhnillah” is like saying “in sha Allah.” (Liqa al-Bab al-Maftuh (no. 119, question no. 18)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, there is a difference between **“In Sha Allah”** and **“Bi Idhnillah”**, though both phrases are commonly used by Muslims and relate to the will of Allah.\n\n1. **In Sha Allah (إن شاء الله)**: This phrase translates to \"If Allah wills\" or \"God willing.\" It is often used when someone talks about future events, expressing the belief that whatever they plan will happen only if Allah allows it. It reflects a sense of humility and acknowledgment of Allah’s control over all matters.\n\n2. **Bi Idhnillah (بإذن الله)**: This phrase means \"By the permission of Allah.\" It implies a more assertive acknowledgment that an action will occur only with Allah’s permission. It is often used when someone is indicating that they will undertake an action contingent on Allah’s approval or leave it in His hands.\n\nIn summary, while both phrases indicate reliance on Allah's will, “In Sha Allah” focuses more on the possibility of future events happening with His will, whereas “Bi Idhnillah” highlights the permission aspect and is often used in the context of actions that are expected to take place with Allah’s consent."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly you are right to tell them off, because they are coming close to disbelief (kufr ) with these words. Changing one letter does not alleviate the grievousness of their error, because these words are very close to words of disbelief.\nReligion has limits that must be protected, and no one should transgress these limits.\nThese words that sound like words of disbelief are a transgression of those limits, and the only thing standing between the speaker and disbelief is this letter that he changed. Allah, may He be exalted, says, warning such people (interpretation of the meaning):\n{They were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith.} [Al ‘Imran 3:167]\nComing near to disbelief is of various levels, and it is not permissible for the Muslim to come near to it on any level. Rather what is required is to keep away from it altogether.\nMoreover, coming near to disbelief with such words desensitises the listener to words of disbelief. Perhaps the changed letter may sound unchanged to the listener, and he will not notice the change.\nBy the same token, changing one letter will not reduce the impact on the listener, for this altered phrase is still indicative of disbelief, so it is as if the listener is saying: I understand what you mean and are referring to.\nWhat the Muslim must do is guard his tongue, for perhaps a word that a person utters, not thinking anything of it, will be the cause of his doom and punishment – Allah forbid.\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A person may say a word, not realizing its repercussions, for which he will be thrown down into Hell further than the distance between the east and the west.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (6477) and Muslim (2988)\nAccording to a report narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2314): ``A man may utter a word, not seeing anything wrong with it, for which he will fall down into Hell the distance of seventy years.” (Classed as sahهh by al-Albani in Sahهh at-Tirmidhi)\nBilal al-Muzani (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “One of you may speak a word that angers Allah, not realizing how far it may go, and because of it Allah will decree that He is angry with it until the Day he meets Him.” (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2319); classed as sahهh by al-Albani in Sahهh at-Tirmidhi)\nMoreover, cursing in and of itself is a major sin, so how about if there is added to it that which gives the impression of disbelief and comes near to it?\nThis way of sounding tough and macho, as some people claim – because they cannot prove themselves to be tough and macho except by cursing and swearing – is baseless and false, and it is not the way to prove anything. If they were real men, they could confirm their manliness in other ways, by speaking true and sound words and committing themselves to them.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the act of uttering words of kufr (disbelief) is a serious matter, and the consequences depend on the intention and understanding of the one who utters those words.\n\n1. **Change in Words or Letters**: If a person changes words or letters in a way that alters the meaning significantly, the ruling can vary. If the altered words still convey the essence of disbelief or negate fundamental aspects of faith, then it may still be considered kufr. However, if the change negates the original meaning and does not imply disbelief, then it may not be regarded as such.\n\n2. **Intention**: Intention is a critical factor in determining the ruling. If a person alters the words while intending to deny faith, they may still be committing an act of kufr. Conversely, if the intention is not to disbelieve but to express something else, this may mitigate the ruling.\n\n3. **Context**: The context in which the words are uttered matters significantly. If the utterance occurs in a situation of coercion or misunderstanding, it might not implicate a person as a disbeliever.\n\nIn conclusion, while altering words or letters can sometimes change the ruling, it is essential to consider the intention, context, and whether the modified expression still conveys disbelief. For specific cases, it is advised to consult knowledgeable scholars or refer to well-established texts in Islamic jurisprudence."

        "question": "Superstition about the number 666",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is the number 666 the number of the devil (Shaytaan)?\nBelieving that there is anything special about the number 666, especially with regard to benefit or harm, and believing that it is the number of the devil or of the Dajjaal (“antichrist”) is a global myth which originated with people of disbelief (kufr), especially those who claim to be devil worshippers.\nHence it is not permissible for the Muslim to believe that there is anything special about this number; rather it is like all other numbers which indicate the quantity of things. The one who believes that it has any special impact has fallen into what is haraam by imitating the disbelievers and following their myths and superstitions.\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (4031); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (5/109).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis is a jayyid isnad… This hadith, at the very least, indicates that it is prohibited to imitate them, even though it appears to indicate that the one who imitates them is a disbeliever, as in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them} [al-Maa’idah 5:51].\nThis may be understood as meaning that whoever imitates them in everything, that would dictate that he is a disbeliever, and the text indicates that it is forbidden to imitate them in some ways. Or it may be interpreted as meaning that his being like them is commensurate with the extent to which he imitates them, so that if he imitates them in something that is regarded as disbelief or a sin, or in something that is regarded as being unique to them, then the ruling will be in accordance with that.\nWhatever the case, the text indicates that it is haraam to imitate them and the reason for that is mere imitation. \"Iqtida’ as-iraat al-Mustaqeem (1/240-242)\".\nIn order to be different from them, you should not believe that there is anything special about this number, and you should pay no attention to writing it; rather you should deal with it like any other number.\nAs for not writing it at all, that is not correct, because writing numbers when needed is permissible, and what is permissible and is needed cannot be abandoned just because some people were misguided concerning it. Rather the misguidance that is connected to it should be ignored.\n‘Ikrimah said: We were with Ibn ‘Umar, and Ibn ‘Abbaas was there with him too (may Allah be pleased with them both). A crow flew by, cawing, and a man said: It is a good sign! Ibn ‘Abbaas said: It is neither good nor bad. Narrated by ad-Daynoori in al-Majaalisah (3/297).\nBecause of this corruption – the corruption that results from innovation being instilled in people’s hearts – the scholars forbade, for the purpose of differing from the disbelievers in their festivals, deliberately fasting on the days of their festivals and depriving oneself of delicious food on the days of their festivals.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf it is said: What do you say about fasting on the days of Nawruz and Mahrajan and other festivals of the polytheists?\nIt may be said: many of the scholars regard that as disliked (makrooh), and most of the companions of Ahmad were of the view that it is disliked.\nThey gave as the reason for that the fact that these are two days that are venerated by the disbelievers, so to single them out for fasting rather than other days is like going along with them in venerating those two days. Therefore it is disliked, like fasting on a Saturday. The author of al-Mughni said: By analogy, this applies to any festival of the disbelievers or any day that they single out for veneration. \"aashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim ma‘a ‘Awn al-Ma‘bood (7/52)\".\nFor more information, see the answer to the question: “Ruling on regarding numbers as lucky and unlucky” and “Ruling on regarding a twitch of the eye as unlucky.”\nSecondly:\nRepenting from belief in superstition is like repenting from any other sin, and is done by avoiding it, regretting doing it, and resolving not to go back to it.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars said: Repentance from every sin is obligatory. If the sin has to do with the relationship between the individual and Allah, may He be exalted, and does not have to do with the rights of another human, then there are three conditions to be met:\n1.. He must give up the sin.\n2.. He must regret doing it.\n3.. He must resolve never to go back to it.\nIf one of the three is omitted, then his repentance is not valid. \"Riyaadh as-Saaliheen (p. 14)\".\nGiving up superstitions is achieved by believing that benefit and harm are in the hands of Allah, may He be exalted, alone.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say, “In whose hand is the realm of all things - and He protects while none can protect against Him - if you should know?” \nThey will say, “[All belongs] to Allah.” Say, “Then how are you deluded?”} [al-Mu’minoon 23:88-89]\n{Say, “Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?” They will say, “Allah,” so say, “Then will you not fear Him?”} [Yoonus 10:31].\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“Whoever lets tiyarah (superstitious belief in bird omens) stop him from doing something is guilty of shirk (associating others with Allah).” They said, O Messenger of Allah, what is the expiation for that? He said, “To say: ‘Allahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka O Allah, there is no good except Your good, no birds except Your birds, and there is no god besides You).’” Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (11/623); classed as hasan by the commentators on al-Musnad.\nThe Muslim must also bear in mind the fact that these superstitions are harmful to one’s mind and intellect, and Islam came to protect people’s intellect and reason from anything that could damage them.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIslam is based on perfecting people’s religious commitment by casting away idolatry and attachment to created beings, and on perfecting people’s reasoning by casting away myths and superstitions, and focusing on beneficial matters that help to refine one’s thinking and purify one’s soul, and rectifying all situations, both spiritual and worldly. And Allah knows best. \"Al-Qawl as-Sadeed/al-Majmoo‘ah al-Kaamilah li Mu’allafaat as-Sa‘di (10/19)\".\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the number 666 does not hold any special significance or superstition. The notion of this number being associated with evil or misfortune primarily comes from Christian eschatology, specifically from the Book of Revelation in the Bible, where it is referred to as the \"number of the beast.\" \n\nIn Islam, beliefs and practices should be firmly rooted in the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah, rather than superstitions or numerological interpretations. Superstitions in general are discouraged in Islam, as they can lead to misconceptions and distract from the core tenets of faith.\n\nMuslims are encouraged to rely on Allah (SWT) for protection and guidance, rather than being influenced by superstitious beliefs surrounding numbers or other symbols. Instead, one should maintain a firm belief in the oneness of Allah and seek refuge in Him from all forms of evil."

        "question": "Knowledge of the Unseen in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Types of the unseen (al-ghayb)      \nThe unseen is of two types:\n1. That which is absolutely unseen and unknown . No one knows this type except Allah. For example, this includes knowledge of when the Hour will begin, when rain will fall, and so on.\n2. That which is relatively unseen and unknown, knowledge of which is hidden from some people and others know it. This is described as unseen or unknown in relation to the one who does not know it, and it is not unknown or unseen for the one who does know it.\nSo in Islam, the unseen is that which is hidden from people’s senses, whether it remains hidden and concealed, and no human can comprehend it, in the sense that no one knows it except the All-Aware, or people may learn of it because of a religious text from the Quran or hadith.\nA person may learn about some of the unseen on the basis of his rational thinking, or by some other means, such as obtaining knowledge through some means that help to enhance the senses, like telescopes and other equipment. This comes under the heading of things that are relatively unseen or unknown.\nThe importance of believing in the unseen (al-ghayb)\nBelief in the unseen is one of the characteristics that distinguish humans from other living beings. Animals have in common with humans the ability to learn about what is tangible, but as for the unseen, humans alone are qualified to believe in it, unlike animals. Hence belief in the unseen (al-ghayb) is one of the pillars of faith in all the divinely-revealed religions. The revealed books spoke a great deal about unseen matters that man has no way of knowing except through proven revelation in the Quran and Sunnah, such as mention of Allah, may He be exalted, and His attributes and actions; the seven heavens and what they contain; the angels, the prophets, Paradise and Hell, the shayatin (devils) and jinn, and other matters of belief in the unseen that no one could learn about or understand except through the sound religious texts of the Quran and Sunnah.\nDetailed account on types of the unseen (al-ghayb)\n1. That which is absolutely unseen, which is that of which man has no way of becoming aware and learning through the means of his physical faculties. It is of two types:\nThe first type is that of which Allah, may He be exalted, has informed people, or some of it, through revelation to the messengers, who conveyed it to the people.\nOne example of that is the shayatin and the jinn, and what He has said about them, as in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n{It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, ‘'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Quran. It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone’.} [al-Jinn 72:1-2]\nThe second type is that of which He has kept the knowledge to Himself, and has not disclosed it to any of His creation, whether a prophet who was sent or an angel who is close to Him. This is what is referred to in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him.} [al-An'am 6:59]\nAn example of that is knowledge of when the Hour will begin, or the time, place and cause of one’s death, and some of the names by which Allah, may He be exalted, has called Himself, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, Allah [Alone] has knowledge of the Hour and sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs. And no soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul perceives in what land it will die.} [Luqman 31:34]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said in one of his supplications: “O Allah, indeed I ask You by every name that belongs to You, by which You have called Yourself or taught it to any of Your creation, or kept it to Yourself in the knowledge of the unseen which is with You.”\n2. That which is restricted and relative. This is what is unknown to some, such as historical events. They are unseen or unknown in relation to those who do not know of them. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) after mentioning the story of the family of ‘Imran (interpretation of the meaning):\n{That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Muhammad]. And you were not with them when they cast their pens as to which of them should be responsible for Mary. Nor were you with them when they disputed.} [Al ‘Imran 3:44]\n3. That which is restricted but is not relative. This refers to that which people do not experience or see because of barriers of time (the future) or place, or other barriers, until that thing is made known because of the removal of the temporal or spatial barrier, as in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And when We decreed for Solomon death, nothing indicated to the jinn his death except a creature of the earth eating his staff. But when he fell, it became clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in humiliating punishment.} [Saba 4:14]\nThis refers to the death of Sulayman (peace be upon him).\nExamples of matters of the unseen\n1. The ruh (soul). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And they ask you, [O Muhammad], about the soul. Say, “The soul is of the affair of my Lord. And mankind has not been given of knowledge except a little”.} [al-Isra 17:85]\n2. The minor and major signs of the Hour, of which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke in the hadith of Jibril: “When you see the barefoot, naked, destitute shepherds competing in the construction of lofty buildings.”\nThese are some of the matters of the unseen of which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke and they have come to pass. Among the major signs of which he spoke are: the Dajjal, who will emerge at the end of time; and the Beast, which will also emerge at the end of time. (From al-‘Aqidah, Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic affairs)\nThus it becomes clear to you that what your friend did come under the heading of that which is relatively unseen, and not that which is absolutely unseen. So the fact that he knows about it and similar things for which there are tangible causes is not something that should be a cause for confusion.\nMoreover, it is well established for any man of reason that there are many matters which may turn out differently from what someone said would happen, and may turn out differently from what was forecast by one who has knowledge of such matters. How often one says that the train or plane will arrive at the appointed time, then that does not happen, or something may be said about a foetus on the basis of modern equipment, then it does not turn out as he said. It may be that you stop the clock before the alarm goes off, so it does not go off, or the battery runs out, so the alarm does not go off… Any confusion about such matters is baseless and pointless, and it is not difficult to resolve. It is just a trick from the Shaytan to deceive one who has nothing to do about an issue that has no reality and no basis, were it not for this person allowing himself to pursue trivial matters and the shayatin distracting the sons of Adam.\nThe issue of the decree being written comes under the heading of belief in the divine will and decree (al-qada’ wa’l-qadar)\nWith regard to the decree being written, it has nothing to do with what you mentioned at all, and we are surprised at this question of yours.\nAsking about such matters may be valid, if Allah had revealed to us in His Book that the alarm would never ring, then it rang. In this case, what He told us would be different from reality.\nAs for a person knowing about something, whether in the past or present or even in the future, that did not happen, and he came to know about that through his own means, where is the confusion about that when we believe that everything that will happen until the Day of Resurrection is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz?\nWhatever the case, the belief that Allah wrote everything comes under the same heading as believing in the divine will and decree, which means believing that Allah wrote all of that in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.\nWhat is required for belief in the divine decree to be sound is to believe the following:\n1.   That man has free will and choice on the basis of which he carries out his actions, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{For whoever wills among you to take a right course.} [at-Takwir 81:28]\n{Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity.} [al-Baqarah 2:286].\n2.  A person’s will and power does not go beyond the power and will of Allah, for He is the One Who granted that to the person and made him able to distinguish and choose, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And you do not will except that Allah wills - Lord of the worlds.} [at-Takwir 81:29].\nWith regard to setting your alarm, knowing that it is going to ring, if it rings, then that is something that Allah decreed and He created it, and you expect to happen. Otherwise some impediment could occur to prevent the phone from doing that task. All of that was decreed by Allah.\nYou should understand that His written decree is of two types: the first type is that which cannot be altered or changed, which is what is in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz.\nThe second type is that which can be changed and altered, which is what is in the hands of the angels, but how it will be settled with them in the end will be in accordance with what Allah decreed in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz. This is one of the meanings of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Allah eliminates what He wills or confirms, and with Him is the Mother of the Book.} [ar-Ra‘d 13:39]\nHence we can understand what is mentioned in the sahih Sunnah about the fact that upholding ties of kinship increases a person’s lifespan or provision, or that supplication (du‘a) can put back the divine decree , for Allah, may He be exalted, knew that His slave would uphold ties of kinship and that he would offer supplication, so He wrote in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz that that person would have ample provision and an extended lifespan.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of the \"Knowledge of the Unseen\" (Ilm al-Ghayb) refers to the knowledge of matters that are beyond human perception and understanding. This includes, but is not limited to, aspects such as the future, the hidden realities of the universe, the soul, Heaven and Hell, and other esoteric matters.\n\n1. **Allah's Exclusive Knowledge**: The knowledge of the unseen is primarily considered a domain that belongs to Allah alone. The Quran states in Surah Al-Jinn (72:26-27) that only Allah knows the unseen and that no one among His creation can access this knowledge without His permission.\n\n2. **Prophets and Revelation**: While Allah's knowledge is absolute, He does impart some knowledge of the unseen to His prophets and messengers. This knowledge is revealed to them as part of their mission, but it is limited and specific to what Allah wills for the guidance of humanity.\n\n3. **Human Limitations**: In Islam, humans are encouraged to seek knowledge and understanding of the world around them. However, there is an acknowledgment of the limitations of human knowledge—particularly concerning matters that are unseen. Muslims are taught to trust in Allah's wisdom and knowledge, especially in areas beyond human comprehension.\n\n4. **Belief in the Unseen**: Faith in the unseen is one of the fundamental aspects of Islamic belief. This includes belief in Allah, angels, scriptures, prophets, the Day of Judgment, and destiny (Qadar). In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:3), it is stated that the believers are those who believe in the unseen.\n\n5. **Practical Implications**: Understanding the concept of the unseen influences a Muslim's worldview, encouraging them to remain humble, patient, and resilient in the face of uncertainties, as they place their trust in Allah's divine plan.\n\nIn summary, the knowledge of the unseen in Islam is a profound concept that emphasizes the supremacy of Allah's knowledge over the limited understanding of human beings and the significance of faith in aspects of existence that are not directly observable."

        "question": "Types of Creation in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be glorified, is the Creator , and everything other than Him is created, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is, over all things, Disposer of affairs.} [az-Zumar 39:62]\nSo there is nothing that exists except the Creator, namely the Lord of the Worlds, may He be glorified, or that which is created, which is everything other than the Creator, may He be glorified. There is no third category.\nAre you created?\nYou are definitely created , and you are not a creator. You are not a creator of yourself or of anyone else.\nThe problem that caused you to think in this way is that you limited the concept of creation to creation from nothing, and you did not realise that creation may be like that, or it may also mean creation from an already-created substance, which is the case of this universe that we see.\nTypes of creation in Islam\nSo creation in Islam may be either a direct process, as in the creation of Adam, or it may be through certain means, as in the creation of the progeny of Adam from an ejected fluid. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning)\n{Who perfected everything which He created and began the creation of man from clay, then He made his posterity out of the extract of a liquid disdained, then He proportioned him and breathed into him from His [created] soul and made for you hearing and vision and hearts; little are you grateful.} [as-Sajdah 32:7-9]\nAdam was created from clay , and was not created from nothing, and his offspring are created from a liquid disdained, but Adam was created directly by means of the divine word, and Allah created him with His Hands.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him, “Be,” and he was.} [Aal 'Imran 3:59]\n{[Allah] said, “O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My Hands? Were you arrogant [then], or were you [already] among the haughty?”} [Sad 38:75]\nSo the one who was created from dust is created, and the one who was created from a sperm drop is also created.\nAllah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{He created the heavens and earth in truth. High is He above what they associate with Him \nHe created man from a sperm-drop; then at once, he is a clear adversary.} [an-Nahl 16:3-4]\n{Recite in the name of your Lord who created, Created man from a clinging substance.} [al-‘Alaq 96:1-2]\nThus we are all created, from a clinging substance (‘alaq) and from a sperm-drop (nutfah), and our father Adam was created from dust or from clay or from clay like [that of] pottery.\nBread that is made from flour is created, because the flour originally comes from a plant and the earth, which are both created, and because it results from the actions of humans, and the actions of humans are created because they stem from the ability and will of humans, which are created.\nBy the same token, the smartphone is created, because it is manufactured from created materials, and by the ability of humans which is also created.\nHow were the heavens and the earth created?\nYou should understand that Allah created the heavens and the earth from materials that were already created.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“Allah, may He be glorified, tells us that He rose over the heaven when it was smoke, and he said to it and to the earth, “Come [into being], willingly or by compulsion.” And they said, “We have come willingly.” (Fussilat 41:11). Thus they were created from smoke. And there are reports from the early generations which say that they were created from steam, and this is the water over which the throne was which is mentioned in the verse, {And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days - and His Throne had been upon water} [Hud 11:6].\nAllah has told us that He created the heavens and the earth within a certain period, and from a substance. The Quran does not mention the creation of anything from nothing; rather it says that He created created things after they had been nothing, as in the verse:\n{for I created you before, while you were nothing} [Maryam 19:9]\nEven though He says that He created him from a sperm-drop.” (Majmu‘ al-Fatawa, 18/235)\nAl-Qunawi said in his commentary on Tafsir al-Baydawi (10/123): \n“The words, “Allah created Adam and the seminal matter”, serve to highlight the fact that man’s creation is from earth and creation is not limited to that. That is, what is meant by creating from it is creating through a certain means, for Allah, may He be exalted, created Adam, who is the father of humankind, from it, or he created the seminal matter from the nourishment that comes from the earth. Thus human individuals are created from the earth through various means, except Adam, who was created directly.”\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, creation can be categorized into several types based on various attributes and characteristics. Here are some commonly recognized types of creation:\n\n1. **Human Beings (Insan)**: This is the highest form of creation, as humans are endowed with intellect, free will, and a special status among living beings. In Islam, humans are created from clay and given life through the breath of Allah.\n\n2. **Angels (Malaika)**: Angels are created from light and serve various purposes, such as conveying revelation, recording deeds, and managing various aspects of the universe. They are considered beings of obedience and do not possess free will.\n\n3. **Jinn**: Jinn are created from smokeless fire and possess free will similar to humans. They live in a parallel world and can be good (Muslims) or evil (Shayatin or devils). They are accountable for their actions in the afterlife.\n\n4. **Animals (Hayawanat)**: Animals are living beings created from earth in various forms. They lack free will and act based on instinct. They are considered part of Allah's creation and are to be treated with kindness and respect.\n\n5. **Plants (Nabat)**: Plants are considered a form of creation that sustains life on Earth. They do not have consciousness but play a crucial role in the ecosystem and in the sustenance of living beings, including humans.\n\n6. **Inanimate Objects (Jamad)**: This includes everything that does not possess life, such as stones, water, and elements of nature. They are considered part of Allah's creation and serve various functions within the created order.\n\n7. **Heavens and Earth (Al-Samawat wal-Ard)**: The universe itself, including stars, planets, and other celestial bodies, is also a type of creation. The heavens and the earth are created by Allah's command and reflect His greatness and power.\n\nEach of these types of creation has a specific role and purpose within the framework of Islamic teachings, emphasizing the interconnectedness and harmony of Allah's creation."

        "question": "Can You Stop Sinning out of Love for Someone?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Stop sinning out of fear of Allah only\nRefraining from sin will only save a person if it is done out of fear of Allah , may He be exalted, and veneration of Him.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{But as for he who feared the standing before his Lord and prevented the soul from [unlawful] inclination, then indeed, Paradise will be [his] refuge.} [an-Nazi‘at 79:40-41]\nCan you refrain from sin out of love for Ahl al-Bayt?\nAs for refraining from sin out of respect and love for any created being, this is a type of shirk, and it is not permissible for a person to intend to do that, because refraining from sin is an act of worship, and worship cannot be directed to any except Allah, may He be exalted.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Refraining from sin is of three types:\n\nFor which one will be rewarded.\nFor which one will be punished.\nFor which one will be neither rewarded nor punished.\n\nThe first type is when a person is aware of the prohibition and refrains from doing it for the sake of Allah, when he is able to do that thing.\nThe second type is when a person refrains from it for the sake of someone other than Allah, not for the sake of Allah. He will be punished for giving it up for the sake of someone other than Allah, just as he would be punished for doing something good for the sake of someone other than Allah. For this refraining is an action of the heart, and if he does that as an act of worship for anyone other than Allah, he deserves to be punished.” (Shifa al-‘Alil, p. 942)\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Thinking of doing bad deeds without actually doing them, according to the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, will be recorded as one complete good deed. Similarly, according to the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, Anas and others, it will be recorded as a good deed. According to the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that Allah said: “He only gave it up for My sake.”\nThis indicates that what is meant is the one who was able to do the sin of which he was thinking, but he refrained from it for the sake of Allah, may He be exalted. There is no doubt that this will be recorded for him as a good deed, because refraining from sin with this intention is a righteous deed.\nAs for the one who thinks of committing a sin, then refrains from doing it for fear of people, or to show off to them, it was said that he will be punished for refraining from it with this intention, because giving precedence to fear of people over fear of Allah is forbidden.\nSimilarly, intending to show off to people is haram, so if that is accompanied by refraining from sin for that purpose, he will be punished for refraining in that case.” (Jami‘ al-‘Ulum wa’l-Hikam, 2/321-322)\nSo what he must do is refrain from sin out of love for Allah, may He be exalted, and fear of Him.\nFor more, please see these answers: 45887 , 13220 and 100 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of stopping a sin is tied closely to one's intention (niyyah) and the desire to please Allah. It is possible to stop sinning out of love for someone, but this love should ideally lead to a greater love and fear of Allah. \n\nIf a person chooses to stop sinning because they want to honor a loved one, this can be seen as a positive motivation. However, the ultimate goal should be to seek Allah's pleasure and to fulfill one's duties as a Muslim. \n\nTrue repentance (tawbah) involves multiple steps: feeling remorse for the sin, ceasing the sinful act, and having the intention not to return to it. If the love for a person inspires an individual to repent and seek to leave sinful behaviors, this can be a good catalyst. \n\nUltimately, though a love for someone may motivate someone to stop sinning, it is essential that the decision aligns with one's faith and commitment to Allah. The most meaningful and lasting change comes when a person seeks to please Allah above all else."

        "question": "From Eternity to Here: Islamic View",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Abstract numbers do not exist except in the mind\nAbstract numbers are not connected to anything tangible, and they exist only in the mind. We did not arrive from past eternity to zero or anything else.\nWhat you have learned about mathematics does not mean that it exists in reality; rather it is something in the mind that is purely hypothetical.\nNote: Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in as-Safadiyyah (2/279): “These philosophers very often get it wrong, as they think that what exists in their minds [what is hypothetical] actually exists in reality, such as the mistake made by the first of them, Pythagoras, and his followers regarding abstract absolute comparative numbers, as they thought that they existed in reality, in isolation from items and things.” \nIt says in Dar Ta‘arud an-Naql wa’l-‘Aql (4/173): “These abstract quantities and numbers only exist in people’s minds and words.”\nThe visible universe has a beginning\nWe and the entire visible universe have a defined beginning. Allah created the Throne and the Pen, then He created the heavens and the earth, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days - and His Throne had been upon water.} [Hud 11:7]\nMuslim (2653) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saying: “Allah wrote the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.” And he said: “And His Throne is above the water.”\nThis has to do with our creation and the visible universe , the heavens and the earth, as we believe that Allah, may He be exalted, is the First before Whom there is nothing, and that He never stopped creating, and that it is possible that before our universe there were other universes, and before them were other universes, until past eternity. In other words, Allah, may He be glorified, creates creation after creation. This is the famous issue of the sequence of creations.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“The Lord, may He be glorified, is perfect in His attributes, names and actions. Therefore it is inevitable that His attributes will have an impact on the universe. He is merciful, and it is impossible that there could be mercy without there being anyone to whom mercy is shown. He is the provider, so there must be those to whom He grants provision. He is oft-forgiving, most forbearing, most generous and most kind to His slaves; He gives and withholds, gives abundantly, lowers and raises, honours and humiliates. These names and attributes require things to which they apply, and on which they have an impact. So there must be creatures who are subjected to the impact of these names and attributes otherwise these attributes will become idle and irrelevant, so there should be creation to reflect the impact of these names and attributes.” (Shifa al-‘Alil. 2/143)\nShaykh Muhammad Bukhayt al-Muti‘i, the former Grand Mufti of Egypt, said:\n“There is no proof to suggest that it is not possible that there has been a sequence of creations from past eternity, even when the famous view suggests that this sequence is impossible. Believing that there is a sequence of creations after creations from eternity does not contradict ‘aqidah (Islamic belief), unless we say that a particular creation has no beginning, in the sense that there is no beginning to its existence. This is something that no one has ever said; rather everyone agrees that everything other than Allah, may He be exalted, that existed or exists now, is contingent, meaning that it came into existence after it did not exist, regardless of whether the sequence of creation has a particular time at which it started in the past and a particular time at which it will end in the future, or it, or it does not have a particular time either in the past or in the future, or it does not have one of them.\nDo you not see that there is consensus that the delights of paradise are infinite and will not cease to exist at any point in the future, after they had been contingent in the sense that they existed after they did not exist? So it does not matter if you say that there is no end to it, in the sense that the delights of paradise will not cease to exist and will not have an end. But if we say that there is no end to them (the delights of paradise), in the sense that their existence is necessary because of what they are, then that constitutes disbelief.\nSimilarly, when we refer to the past, we may say that there was a series of creations that had no beginning, in the sense that the sequence of creations does not have a starting point in the past, yet each of them existed after it did not exist. \nIf we say these creations have no beginning to their existence and no starting point, that suggests that they existed from eternity, and this constitutes disbelief (kufr).\nYou should read two books: al-Qawl al-Mufid and Hawashi al-Kharidah.” (Nihayat as-Sul fi Sharh Minhaj al-Usool, 2/103)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question \"From Eternity to Here: Islamic View\" encompasses deep theological and philosophical concepts in Islam regarding the nature of time, creation, and God's existence. In Islamic thought, the following key points can be highlighted:\n\n1. **Eternality of God**: In Islam, Allah (God) is described as eternal and outside the constraints of time and space. He has no beginning or end and exists independently of His creation. This attribute is fundamental in Islamic theology and distinguishes God from His creation.\n\n2. **Creation and Time**: According to Islamic teachings, time itself was created by Allah along with the universe. Before the creation of the heavens and the earth, there was no time as we understand it. The idea of \"from eternity to here\" can be linked to the notion that God existed before time and space were created, and subsequently, He initiated the creation of the universe.\n\n3. **Linear vs. Cyclical Time**: Islamic perspectives generally align with a linear understanding of time, where history progresses from creation to a future Day of Judgment. Events are viewed as unfolding in a linear fashion, moving from the past through the present and into the future.\n\n4. **Philosophical Considerations**: Scholars like Al-Ghazali and Ibn Sina (Avicenna) have discussed the nature of time and existence in their works. Al-Ghazali emphasized God's active role in the continuous creation of the universe, while others have debated whether time is an absolute entity or a relational concept based on change.\n\n5. **The Importance of the Hereafter**: In Islam, the journey \"from eternity to here\" ultimately leads to the belief in an afterlife, where individuals are held accountable for their actions in this world. The emphasis on the Hereafter serves as a reminder of the transient nature of this life.\n\nIn summary, the Islamic view on the concept of eternity and time is rich and multi-faceted, emphasizing God's eternal nature, the creation of time, and the purposeful journey of life leading to the Hereafter. Understanding these elements helps to grasp how Muslims perceive existence and their relationship with the divine."

If someone reads them believing in them, then he is rightfully subject to the warning which says that he has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad and that no prayer will be accepted from him for forty days.\nIn the case of the one who reads them solely for the purpose of entertainment, and does not believe that the practitioners of witchcraft, soothsayers and charlatans are speaking the truth, then he is sinning by going to where they are, meeting them there, or watching their programs, because this is a kind of approving of them and helping them, because it is well known that these channels are helped by having a large number of viewers, and that pushes them further into misguidance.\nThere is the fear that the one who watches these programs may be included in the warning that no prayer will be accepted from him for forty days.\nIn the case of the one who reads the messages that come to him on his mobile phone, and he does not seek them out or go to a website or channel or place that is known for fortune tellers and astrologers – rather he only reads the [unsolicited] messages that come to him – there is no blame on him.\nBut he should not keep these messages; rather he should erase them immediately, and he has no need to look at them again.\nIf he looks at them again, or looks repeatedly at them to make sure of their contents or to determine whether they are true or false, or to be certain whether the message is about fortune-telling or not, then this warning does not apply to him, in sha Allah.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:\n“If he asks that person questions to find out about his situation and what he really is, and he has the ability to determine whether he is telling the truth or lying, this is permissible, as it is proven in as-Sahihayn that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) asked Ibn Sayyad: “Who comes to you?” He said: A truthful one and a liar come to me. He said: “What do you see?” He said: I see a throne on water. He said: “I am concealing something from you.” He said: Ad-dukh, ad-dukh. He said: “Be off with you! You will never go beyond your rank.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, fortune-telling and seeking knowledge of the unseen through such means are generally considered impermissible (haram). This includes reading messages related to fortune-telling, horoscopes, or any similar practices that claim to predict the future or provide insights based on supernatural elements.\n\nThe foundation of this prohibition is based on several teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). For example, he said, \"Whoever goes to a fortune-teller and asks him about anything, his prayers will not be accepted for forty days\" (Sahih Muslim).\n\nAdditionally, Islam emphasizes reliance on Allah alone and discourages practices that may lead to superstition or shirk (associating partners with Allah). Muslims are encouraged to place their trust in Allah's wisdom and mercy rather than seeking guidance from sources that are not grounded in Islamic teachings.\n\nIn summary, reading messages related to fortune-telling is not allowed in Islam.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The belief of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah is that if a Muslim dies persisting in a major sin – such as zina, slander and stealing – he is subject to the will of Allah, may He be glorified. If Allah wills, He will forgive him, and if Allah wills, He will punish him for the major sin in which he was persisting when he died, but his ultimate destiny will be Paradise, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills” [an-Nisa’ 4:48].

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, beliefs about the fate of those who commit major sins (kaba'ir) and die while persisting in those sins can vary among different scholars and schools of thought. However, some general principles are widely accepted in mainstream Sunni Islam:\n\n1. **Major Sins and Repentance**: Major sins are serious transgressions against God's commands. However, Islam teaches that all sins can be forgiven if a person sincerely repents (tawbah) before death. Repentance involves feeling genuine remorse for the sin, stopping the sinful behavior, and making a firm intention not to return to it.\n\n2. **Persisting in Sin**: If a person dies while persisting in major sins without repenting, the general understanding is that they may be subject to God's punishment in the Hereafter. The severity of that punishment can depend on various factors, including the nature of the sins, the person's faith, and God's mercy.\n\n3. **Shirk (Associating partners with God)**: The greatest sin in Islam is shirk (associating partners with Allah). If someone dies committing shirk without repenting, mainstream Islamic belief holds that they may not receive forgiveness and could face severe punishment.\n\n4. **Believers vs. Non-believers**: If a person is a believer but has committed major sins, Islamic teachings suggest that they may be punished in Hell for a period based on their deeds, but they may ultimately be forgiven and admitted to Paradise due to their faith.\n\n5. **God's Mercy**: Islam emphasizes God's mercy and compassion. He may choose to forgive whom He wills, even if they have committed major sins, especially if they maintained belief in Him.\n\n6. **Final Judgment**: Ultimately, the fate of individuals is determined by Allah on the Day of Judgment, where each person's deeds will be evaluated, and they will be judged fairly.\n\nIt is important for Muslims to strive to avoid major sins, seek forgiveness, and maintain a strong relationship with Allah through good deeds and repentance."

        "question": "If a disbeliever becomes a Muslim but is still persisting in a sin, is his Islam valid?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a person repents from one sin whilst persisting in another sin, then the sin from which he has repented will be forgiven for him, according to the correct scholarly view, but the sin from which he has not repented will remain as it is and will not be included in that act of repentance, according to scholarly consensus.\nSee the answer to the question: Is repentance from one sin valid when one is persisting in another sin?\nIf a disbeliever or apostate becomes Muslim whilst persisting in some sin from which he has not repented, his becoming Muslim is valid according to scholarly consensus. But will he be forgiven for the sin from which he has not repented, as a result of becoming Muslim? Concerning this there are two scholarly views.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) summed up this difference of opinion when he said:\n… The second principle is: whoever has committed some sins and repents from some of them but not others, his repentance will only lead to forgiveness of those from which he has repented. As for that from which he has not repented, it will remain subject to the ruling on one who has not repented, not the ruling on one who has repented.\nI do not know of any dispute concerning that, except with regard to a disbeliever if he becomes Muslim. In that case, his becoming Muslim implies that he has repented from disbelief, so by virtue of becoming Muslim he is forgiven for the disbelief from which he has repented. But will he be forgiven for sins that he committed whilst he was a disbeliever and from which he has not repented as a Muslim?\nRegarding this matter, there are two known views:\nThe first view is that he will be forgiven for all his sins, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Islam erases that which came before it.” Narrated by Muslim. And Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say to those who have disbelieved [that] if they cease, what has previously occurred will be forgiven for them.” [al-Anfaal 8:38].\nThe second view is that he does not deserve to be forgiven for sins that he committed after he became Muslim except those from which he has repented. So if he became Muslim but persisted in some major sins that are less grievous than disbelief, then in that regard his ruling is the same as that on others who commit major sins.\nThis view is what is supported by general Islamic principles and textual evidence. In as-Saheehayn it is narrated that Hakeem ibn Hizaam said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): O Messenger of Allah, will we be brought to account for what we did during the Jaahiliyyah? He said: “Whoever among you does good in Islam will not be brought to account for what he did during the Jaahiliyyah, but whoever commits evil after becoming Muslim will be brought to account for what he did both before and after [he became Muslim].”\nThis text indicates that accountability for deeds will only be waived for what was done during the Jaahiliyyah in the case of one who does good, not in the case of one who does not do good. If a person does not do good, he will be brought to account for what he did both before and after [he became Muslim], and the one who does not repent from a particular sin has not done good. End quote from al-Fataawa al-Kubra (5/278).\nThese two views are agreed that the person’s becoming Muslim is valid and that it erases disbelief; the difference of opinion has to do with forgiveness of sins, from which he has not repented, by virtue of his becoming Muslim.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a Jew or a Christian who becomes Muslim: does any sin remain on him after he becomes Muslim?\nHe replied: If he becomes Muslim both inwardly and outwardly, he will be forgiven for the disbelief from which he repented by becoming Muslim, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that. As for sins from which he has not repented, such as if he persisted in a sin, in wrongdoing or in some immoral action, and did not repent for it when he became Muslim, then some of the scholars said that he will be forgiven for [his misdeeds before becoming Muslim] by virtue of his becoming Muslim.\nHowever, the sound view is that he will only be forgiven for what he repents from [after becoming Muslim], as it is proven in as-Saheeh that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked: Will we be brought to account for what we did during the Jaahiliyyah? He said: “Whoever does good after he becomes Muslim will not be brought to account for what he did during the Jaahiliyyah [time of ignorance before becoming Muslim], but whoever continues to do bad deeds after becoming Muslim will be brought to account for what he did before and after [becoming Muslim].”\nDoing good after becoming Muslim means adhering to doing what Allah enjoins and refraining from what He forbids. This is what is meant by repentance in general. So whoever becomes a Muslim in this sense, all his sins will be forgiven. End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (11/701).\nIf a disbeliever becomes Muslim, but he loves alcohol and persists in drinking it, his becoming Muslim is valid according to scholarly consensus, but will he be forgiven for drinking alcohol [before becoming Muslim] by virtue of becoming Muslim? This is the matter concerning which there is a difference of scholarly opinion.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, when a disbeliever (kafir) embraces Islam and recites the Shahada (the declaration of faith), they are considered a Muslim.

The key principle is that the person is now under the obligations and responsibilities of a Muslim, and they should work towards overcoming any sinful behavior with sincerity and purpose.\n\nIt is encouraged for new Muslims to seek knowledge, guidance, and support from the community to help them with their journey and to distance themselves from persistent sins as they grow in their faith.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:59].\n“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission” [al-Nisa’ 4:65]\n“Do they then seek the judgement of (the days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith” [al-Maa’idah 5:50]\nEvery ruling that goes against the ruling of Allaah is a ruling of ignorance (Jaahiliyyah). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Is not Allaah the Best of judges?” [al-Teen 95:8]\n“The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism); that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not” [Yoosuf 12:40]\nThus it is clear that refusing to refer for judgement to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him), or rejecting their ruling, or believing that the ruling of someone else is better than their ruling, constitutes kufr (disbelief) and puts one beyond the pale of Islam. \nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the rulings which Allaah has prescribed for His slaves and explained them in His Holy Book or on the lips of His trustworthy Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him), such as the rulings on inheritance, five prayers, zakaah, fasting and other things which Allaah has explained to His slaves and on which the ummah is unanimously agreed, no one has the right to object to them or to change them, because this is clear legislation that was decreed for the ummah at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) and after him until the Hour begins. That includes giving the male more than the female [in inheritance] among children, sons’ children, siblings through both parents and siblings through the father, because Allaah has explained it in His Book and the Muslim scholars are unanimously agreed on that, so it is obligatory to act upon that out of conviction and faith. Anyone who says that what is better is something other than that is a kaafir, and similarly the one who says that it is permissible to go against that is to be regarded as a kaafir because he is objecting to the rulings of Allaah, may He be exalted, and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) and to the consensus of the ummah. The authorities should ask him to repent if he is a Muslim; if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he is to be executed as a kaafir and an apostate from Islam, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.” We ask Allaah to keep us and all the Muslims safe and sound from misguiding turmoil and going against pure sharee’ah.

It is important to approach such matters with humility and a willingness to learn.\n\n5. **Openness to Discussion**: While questioning for the purpose of understanding is acceptable, it should be done respectfully and without a tone of denial or rejection of Allah's commands. Approaching such topics with the intention of seeking the truth while remaining submissive is essential.\n\nIn summary, while it is important to seek understanding in matters of faith, objecting to Shari'ah rulings can have serious implications, and it should be approached with reverence, respect for divine authority, and a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue."

        "question": "Is this statement that is attributed to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) sound – “Did you come to know your Lord through Muhammad?”?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.1. Comment on the soundness of the statement attributed to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him)\nIbn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that this statement is falsely attributed to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), as he quoted its isnaad:\nIt was narrated that Muhammad ibn Ashras as-Sulami said: Muhammad ibn Sa‘eed al-Harawi said: Ismaa‘eel ibn Yahya ibn ‘Ubaydillah at-Taymi and ‘Ali ibn Ibraaheem al-Haashimi informed us, from Yahya ibn ‘Aqeel al-Khuzaa‘i, from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, that a man asked him: Did you come to know Allah through Muhammad or did you come to know Muhammad through Allah?\nHe said: If I came to know Allah through Muhammad, Muhammad would be more credible than Allah, and if I came to know Muhammad through Allah, I would have no need of the Messenger of Allah. Rather Allah (may He be exalted) caused me to know him, without describing how, as He willed. He sent Muhammad as a Messenger to convey the Qur’an and faith, and He established proof so that people would adhere to the path of Islam. So I believed what he brought from Allah, because he did not bring anything contrary to the command of his Lord, for none of the messengers before him did anything contrary [to the command of their Lord]. He brought guidance and glad tidings, and taught us to believe in the messengers who came before him. Ibn al-Jawzi said: This is a fabricated hadith that is falsely attributed to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), because he is too good to say such a thing. The one who is accused of fabricating it is Muhammad ibn Sa‘eed, who narrated it from Ismaa‘eel. Ibn ‘Adiyy said: Ismaa‘eel narrates false reports from trustworthy narrators. As for al-Haashimi, he is unknown.\nEnd quote from al-‘Ilal al-Mutanaahiyah fi’l-Ahaadeeth al-Waahiyah (2/942).\nAdh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMay Allah curse the one who fabricated it, namely Muhammad ibn Ashras as-Sulami – a liar – who narrated it from Muhammad ibn Sa‘eed, from Ismaa‘eel ibn Yahya – who is suspicious.\nEnd quote from Talkhees Kitaab al-‘Ilal al-Mutanaahiyah (p. 370).\nAsh-Shawkaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, when it was said to him: Did you come to know Allah through Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or did you come to know Muhammad through Allah (may He be exalted)?\nHe said: I did not need the Messenger of Allah, but Allah (may He be exalted) caused me to know him, without describing how, as He willed. He sent Muhammad as a Messenger to convey the Qur’an and faith …\nNarrated by al-Jawzaqaani in al-Waahiyat (Flimsy Reports).\nIbn al-Jawzi said: This is a fabricated hadith that is falsely attributed to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him).\nEnd quote from al-Fawaa’id al-Majmoo‘ah (p. 455).\nThis statement is mentioned in the books of the Shi‘ah as part of a lengthy story. The evidence that it is a lie is very obvious, because in that story they impugn Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them), and cast aspersions on their knowledge. They narrate this report with an isnaad that is not free of narrators who were accused of lying or are unknown, as in the book of the Shi‘i Ibn Baabawayh al-Qummi which is called at-Tawheed (p. 210) and elsewhere.\n2. Comment on the meaning of the statement\nSimilar phrases are also narrated in some of the books of the scholars which are attributed to some of the early generations, without mentioning any names.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n‘Abd al-Wahhaab ibn Abi’l-Faraj al-Maqdisi said: That was narrated from a number of our pious predecessors. One of them was asked: Did you come to know Allah through Muhammad or did you come to know Allah through Him? He said: I came to know Allah through Him and I came to know Muhammad through Allah. If I came to know Allah through Muhammad, the source of that favour would have been Muhammad, not Allah.\nEnd quote from Dar’ Ta‘aarud al-‘Aql wa’n-Naql (9/25).\nWhat they meant by that is that the believer comes to know Allah and His Messenger by the help and guidance of Allah, not by merely thinking and reflecting upon what the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought, as Allah (may He be exalted) says:\n“And know that among you is the Messenger of Allah . If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would be in difficulty, but Allah has endeared to you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief, defiance and disobedience. Those are the [rightly] guided \n [It is] as bounty from Allah and favor. And Allah is Knowing and Wise”\n[al-Hujuraat 49:7-8]\n“And if we had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me will come into effect [that] \"I will surely fill Hell with jinn and people all together”\n[as-Sajdah 32:13].\nAt the same time, they do not deny that there are means and measures for this guidance that have been ordained by Allah (may He be exalted), the greatest of which is the call of the Messengers and their teaching the people.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThose of Ahl as-Sunnah who argue that knowledge and faith could be attained by virtue of Allah’s blessing, mercy and guidance, and by virtue of His enabling a person to know Him, and other such phrases, their words imply that what the Qadaris say is false.\nThis is true, but that does not necessarily mean that attaining knowledge cannot happen through reflection and thinking, and it does not mean that knowledge cannot be attained through the teaching of the Messenger, the scholars and the believers, and the supplications and explanation of the evidence that they establish.\nRather it is well known that knowledge could be attained sometimes through what a person hears from people of explanation and teaching, either by way of establishing and showing rational evidence, or by way of telling the true facts.\nAnd sometimes it happens by means of what Allah enables him to understand through thinking and contemplation, and evidence that he is inspired to find, and even sometimes by means of his own efforts and his own reasoning.\nAnd sometimes it happens by means of what Allah compels him to know without any effort on his part…\nThat is because of what Allah has established in the believers’ hearts of faith, whether it came about because of the individual’s efforts, such as thinking and reasoning, or by other means, or without that. All of these means happened by the will and decree of Allah, and they are part of the blessings that Allah bestows upon His slave, for Allah is the source of blessings by making the means and measures available to the individual.\nWhoever thinks that knowledge and faith could be attained by mere contemplation and reasoning – as the Qadaris say – is wrong. This is what these people tried to prove was wrong.\nEnd quote from Dar’ Ta‘aarud al-‘Aql wa’n-Naql (9/28-29).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The statement often attributed to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) – \"Did you come to know your Lord through Muhammad?\" – is not found in the most authentic sources of Islamic literature, such as Sahih Bukhari or Sahih Muslim. However, it is commonly referred to in discussions about the importance of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in understanding and recognizing Allah.\n\nThe essence of the statement emphasizes that the understanding of Allah and His attributes is facilitated through the teachings and prophetic example of Muhammad (pbuh). In Islam, Prophet Muhammad is viewed as the final messenger, and his life and teachings are central to the faith.\n\nWhile the exact attribution of this phrase to ‘Ali may not be verified in authentic hadith collections, the overall message aligns with Islamic teachings about the importance of the Prophet Muhammad in conveying the message of Allah. Always consult with knowledgeable scholars or reliable sources for deeper insight on such matters."

        "question": "A comment on the phrase “Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is not mentioned at times of hardship but ease will be granted”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The matter of whether things are made easy or difficult is in the hand of Allah alone\nOne of the things concerning which there is no doubt is that the matter of whether things are made easy or difficult is in the hand of Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and no one has any power over that except Allah.\nMany texts affirm this fact.\nAllah (may He be exalted) is the One Who makes it easy for man to emerge from his mother’s womb, and it is He Who has made the Qur’an easy to memorize and understand.\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Cursed is man; how disbelieving is he \nFrom what substance did He create him \nFrom a sperm-drop He created him and destined for him \nThen He eased the way for him ”\n[‘Abasa 80:17-20]\n“And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember”\n[al-Qamar 54:17].\nWhen Allah commanded Moosaa to go to Pharaoh, he asked his Lord to make it easy for him.\nAllah (may He be exalted) said:\n“ ‘Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed.’ \n[Moses] said, \"My Lord, fill my heart with courage and steadfastness \nAnd ease for me my task”\n]Taa-Haa 20:24-26].\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to ask his Lord to make guidance easy for him [to adhere to it].\nAt-Tirmidhi narrated in his Sunan (3551) that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say in his supplication: “O Lord, help me and do not help others against me; support me and do not support others against me; plan for me and do not help others plan against me; guide me and make guidance easy for me…”\nThis hadith was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah (3088).\nOne day, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) bade farewell to one of his companions who wanted to travel, and he prayed for him, asking Allah to make good easy for him wherever he was.\nAt-Tirmidhi narrated in his Sunan (3444) that Anas said: A man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I want to travel, so give me something that will help me on my journey. He said: “May Allah supply you with taqwa (piety).” He said: Give me more. He said: “May he forgive your sin.” He said: Give me more, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you. He said: “May He make good easy for you wherever you are.”\nThis hadith was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi (2739).\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to teach his companions to seek guidance (istikhaarah) in all affairs, which includes asking one’s Lord to make something easy for him if it is good for him.\nAl-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh (7390) that Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach his companions to make istikhaarah in all things, just as he used to teach them soorahs from the Qur’an. He said: “If any one of you is concerned about a decision he has to make, then let him pray two rak‘ahs of non-obligatory prayer, then say: Allaahumma inni astakheeruka bi ‘ilmika wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika wa as’aluka min fadlika, fa innaka taqdiru wa laa aqdir, wa ta‘lamu wa laa a‘lam, wa anta ‘allaam al-ghuyoob. Allaahumma fa in kunta ta‘lamu haadhal-amra (then the matter should be mentioned by name) khayran li fi aajil amri wa aajilihi (or: fi deeni wa ma‘aashi wa ‘aaqibati amri) faqdurhu li wa yassirhu li thumma baarik li fihi. Allaahumma wa in kunta ta‘lamu annahu sharrun li fi deeni wa ma‘aashi wa ‘aaqibati amri (or: fi ‘aajili amri wa aajilihi) fasrifni ‘anhu [wasrafhu ‘anni] waqdur li al-khayr haythu kaana thumma radini bihi (O Allah, I seek Your guidance [in making a choice] by virtue of Your knowledge, and I seek ability by virtue of Your power, and I ask You of Your great bounty. You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not. You are the Knower of hidden things. O Allah, if in Your knowledge, this matter (then it should be mentioned by name) is good for me both in this world and in the Hereafter (or: in my religion, my livelihood and my affairs), then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me. And if in Your knowledge it is bad for me and for my religion, my livelihood and my affairs (or: for me both in this world and the next), then turn me away from it, [and turn it away from me], and ordain for me the good wherever it may be and make me pleased with it).”\nNothing is ever made easy except by the permission of Allah alone.\nAs the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say: “O Allah, nothing is easy except what You make easy, and if You willed, it You could make rugged land smooth.”\nNarrated by Ibn Hibban in his Saheeh (2427); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Silsilat as-Saheehah (2886).\nUmm al-Mu’mineen ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Ask Allah for everything, even a sandal-strap, for if Allah does not make it easy [for you to obtain it], it will not be easy.\nNarrated by Abu Ya‘la in his Musnad (4560); classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (3/540).\nSecondly: the phrase “Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is not mentioned at times of hardship but ease will be granted” is an ambiguous phrase that may be interpreted in a sound way or a wrong way\nThe phrase that the questioner mentions – “Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is not mentioned at times of hardship but ease will be granted” – is an ambiguous phrase that may be interpreted in a sound way or a wrong way, so it is not permissible to say it in this way. That is for the following reasons:\nFirstly, it may be understood that what the speaker means is that he believes that mere mention of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will make difficult things easy. This applies even if we assume that the speaker is not basing it on a false belief – like the extreme Sufis – as there is no evidence to support that.\nSecondly: if what he means is that he believes that by virtue of sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), Allah will relieve him of distress and remove his hardship, this is sound.\nThis is seen in the hadith which was narrated by ‘Abd ibn Humayd in his Musnad (170) from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: O Messenger of Allah, I often send blessings upon you; how much of my supplication should I allocate to sending blessings upon you? He said: “Whatever you wish.” He said: One quarter? He said: “Whatever you wish, and if you do more, that will be good.” He said: Half? He said: “Whatever you wish, and if you do more, that will be good.” He said: Two thirds? He said: “Whatever you wish, and if you do more, that will be good.” He said: Should I make all of my supplication sending blessings upon you? He said: “Then your worries would be taken care of and your sin would be forgiven.”\nThis hadith was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Targheeb wa’t-Tarheeb (1670).\nFinally:\nWe think that you should avoid ambiguous phrases such as these, because protecting the sublime concept of Tawheed is obligatory, and you should use clear phrases that are not ambiguous, such as saying for example: By virtue of sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), Allah will grant relief from distress and make difficult things easy. Or you can say: Whenever the teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are followed, there will be ease and comfort.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase you mentioned emphasizes the importance of remembering and invoking the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him) during times of both hardship and ease. In Islamic teachings, acknowledging the Prophet and seeking blessings upon him is considered a means of drawing nearer to Allah and receiving His mercy.\n\nWhile it might seem more common to invoke the Prophet's name during difficulties, it's essential to understand that true devotion includes remembrance in all circumstances—whether we are facing trials or enjoying times of comfort. The teachings in Islam encourage gratitude during ease and patience during hardship. \n\nIn the face of adversity, turning to the Prophet’s example can serve to comfort believers and provide guidance on how to conduct themselves with grace and perseverance. Conversely, during times of prosperity, it is equally important to express gratitude and recognize the blessings received.\n\nThus, rather than viewing the phrase as a restriction, it can be seen as a reminder of the holistic nature of faith—where the name of the Prophet should be a constant in both difficult and favorable moments of life. This reflects the comprehensive approach to worship and remembrance in Islam, where every facet of life is intertwined with spirituality and devotion to Allah and His Messenger."

        "question": "Ruling on reading books and articles by fortunetellers and astrologers",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to ask fortunetellers questions, even if you do not believe them.\nIt is not permissible to ask fortunetellers questions, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortuneteller and asks him about anything, no prayer will be accepted from him for forty days.” Narrated by Muslim (2230).\nThis applies to the one who asked him a question without believing him. However, if he also believes that, then the matter is more serious, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has intercourse with a menstruating woman, or with a woman in her back passage, or goes to a fortuneteller and believes what he says, has disbelieved in what Allah sent down to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).” Narrated by Ahmad (9779), Abu Dawood (3904), at-Tirmidhi (135), and Ibn Maajah (936). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.\nReading the words of fortune tellers and soothsayers is haraam (forbidden).\nIt says in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (1/434): It is not permissible to look at the books of the People of the Book – this was stated by Imam Ahmad – because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got angry when he saw that ‘Umar had a page of the Torah, and he said: “Are you doubting, O son of al-Khattab…?” And it is not permissible to look at the books of the people of innovation, or books that contain [a mixture of] truth and falsehood, or to narrate them, because of the harm that may cause by corrupting people’s beliefs. End quote.\nIn (3/34) it says, discussing haraam branches of knowledge: … and prohibited branches of knowledge, such as ‘ilm al-kalaam [“Islamic philosophy”], or philosophy, charlatanry. astrology, geomancy, and other kinds of divination. Also prohibited are witchcraft and amulets written in languages other than Arabic for those who do not understand their meanings.\nAlso prohibited is working out the numerical value of a person’s name and his mother’s name (numerology), or working out his “star sign” (horoscope), and determining on that basis that he will be poor or rich, or other supposed astrological indications of worldly fortunes. End quote.\nIt says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (1/203): What is the Islamic ruling on believing in the horoscopes that are found in newspapers and magazines, and on reading them?\nAnswer: Believing that bad luck and good luck are connected to the stars and constellations comes under the heading of the shirk of the early Magians and the Sabians among the philosophers, and others of that ilk among disbelieving and polytheist groups. Claiming to have knowledge of that is clearly claiming to have knowledge of the unseen, and that is like trying to compete with Allah in His sovereignty; this is a grave form of shirk. Moreover it is in reality charlatanry and lying, toying with people’s minds, consuming their wealth unlawfully, corrupting their beliefs and confusing them.\nBased on that, it is haraam to publish horoscopes, to read them and to propagate them among the people, and it is not permissible to believe them; rather this is a branch of disbelief (kufr) that is contrary to Tawheed. What is required is to avoid that, advise people to keep away from it, rely on Allah (may He be glorified and exalted) and put your trust in Him in all your affairs.\nBakr Abu Zayd, ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh, Saalih al-Fawzaan, ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyaan, ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baaz. End quote.\nIf you deliberately read it, then repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness, and do not do such a thing ever again.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, seeking knowledge and guidance should be done from sources that align with Islamic teachings and beliefs. Reading books and articles by fortunetellers and astrologers is generally discouraged in Islam. This is primarily because:\n\n1. **Reliance on the Unseen**: Fortunetelling and astrology involve claiming knowledge of the unseen, which is reserved for Allah alone. The Quran emphasizes that no one knows what will happen in the future except Allah (Surah Luqman 31:34).\n\n2. **Misguidance**: Engaging with such practices can lead to misguidance, as it may involve beliefs or ideas that contradict Islamic teachings. It can also divert a person from relying on Allah and seeking guidance through prayer and good deeds.\n\n3. **Prohibition of Certain Practices**: In many Islamic traditions, seeking knowledge from fortune tellers, astrologers, or similar practitioners is considered haram (forbidden). For example, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) stated that anyone who visits a fortuneteller or seeks their advice has committed an act of disbelief.\n\nOverall, Muslims are encouraged to seek their guidance and knowledge from reliable and halal (permissible) sources, such as the Quran, Hadith, and knowledgeable scholars. If you feel concerned or curious about your future, it is better to engage in prayer and trust in Allah’s plan."

        "question": "A response to one who claims that Allah loves to punish and torment people",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThis is an abhorrent statement that no one would say except one who is twisted and misguided, and denies the blessings of his Lord and His favours to him.\nIt is a lie and fabrication against Allah, ascribing to Him bad characteristics that are not appropriate for a human being of sound character, so how about the Creator, the Generous, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful, may He be exalted and sanctified?\nAllah, may He be exalted, does not love to punish and torment His creation; rather He loves to show them mercy and guide them, and He is more merciful to them than their own selves and their mothers.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Why would Allah punish you if you are grateful and believe? And ever is Allah Appreciative and Knowing”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:147].\nShaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThen Allah, may He be exalted, tells us of the perfect nature of His self-sufficiency and the vastness of His forbearing, mercy and kindness: “Why would Allah punish you …?” Because Allah is Appreciative and Knowing, He will give those who carry the heavy burden of commitment for His sake and persist in doing righteous deeds an immense reward and abundant kindness. Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will give him something better than it.\nFurthermore, He knows how you appear outwardly and what is in your hearts, and He knows what you do and what it is based on, be it sincerity or the opposite. He wants you to repent and turn back to Him, then if you turn to Him, why should He punish you? He does not find any joy in punishing you and He does not benefit from punishing you; rather the sinner only harms himself, just as the deed of one who is obedient is to his own benefit.\nEnd quote from Tafseer as-Sa‘di (211).\nThe great scholar at-Taahir ibn ‘Ashoor (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This may be addressed to and intended for the entire ummah, or it may be addressed to the hypocrites, beginning by speaking of an absent party, then addressing them directly, by way of showing kindness to them.\nThe question in the phrase “Why would Allah punish you” is formed in such a way as to indicate that the expected response is negative, so it is denying such a thing. In other words: Allah would not punish you at all.\nWhat is meant is that the warning that is addressed to the hypocrites is a warning against disbelief and hypocrisy, and no more. Therefore if they repent and mend their ways, and hold fast to Allah, He will forgive them and spare them punishment. So they should not think that Allah will punish them because He hates them personally, or because He finds joy in punishing them. Rather it is a requital for bad conduct, because the Most Wise does what is appropriate, so He rewards good with good and requites bad with bad. If the evildoer gives up his bad deeds, Allah will spare him from the punishment for those deeds, because He does not benefit either from punishment or from reward; rather this is the divinely ordained process of cause and effect. If the believers persist in adhering to their faith and showing gratitude, and they avoid taking the hypocrites and disbelievers as allies and friends, then Allah will not punish them, because there is no reason to punish them.\nEnd quote from at-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer (5/245).\nIt was narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab that he said: Some prisoners were brought to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and there was a woman among the prisoners who was searching for someone. When she found a small boy among the prisoners, she clasped him to her and started to breastfeed him. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to us: “Do you think that this woman would throw her child into the fire?” We said: No, by Allah, she would never do that if she is able not to. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah is more merciful towards His slaves than this woman is towards her child.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (5999) and Muslim (2754).\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah created the universe, he wrote in His Book, which is with Him above the Throne: “My mercy precedes My wrath.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (7453) and Muslim (2751).\nIt was narrated that Salmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “On the day that Allah created the heavens and the earth, He created one hundred parts of mercy, each of which is as great as the distance between the heavens and the earth, and He put one part of that mercy on earth, because of which a mother shows compassion to her child and animals and birds show compassion to one another. When the Day of Resurrection comes, that mercy will complete the number (again).”\nNarrated by Muslim (2753).\nIn addition to His perfect mercy, kindness, beneficence and compassion to His slaves, Allah, may He be glorified, is Most Wise, All-Knowing, the Creator, Almighty; He is not pleased if He is disobeyed or disbelieved in, and He does not accept for His Prophets to be rejected or for His slaves to be wronged. Hence He warned those who disbelieve in Him, rebel against Him, reject His Messengers and wrong His slaves of a severe and painful punishment.\nThis is part of His perfect justice and might, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“[O Muhammad], inform My servants that it is I who am the Forgiving, the Merciful\nAnd that it is My punishment which is the painful punishment”\n[al-Hijr 15:49, 50].\nRather if (hypothetically speaking) He loved to punish and torment people he would do the following:\n1. He would love to punish and torture people, even if they were obedient and adhered to His commands. But Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:40].\n2. He would not give His slave any respite, excuse or chance to repent. But Allah, may He be glorified, is forbearing and generous, and He gives respite to His slaves, and leaves them with no excuse. He sends Messengers to them to remind them, and tests them in this world so as to instill in them fear of Him and bring them closer to Him.\n3. He would mostly resort to torment and punishment, and rarely show mercy. But Allah, may He be exalted, is the most merciful of those who show mercy, and His mercy precedes His wrath.\nThink and reflect. There are billions of people today who revile Allah and attribute a son to Him, or deny Him, or worship others instead of Him, yet despite that, he grants them provision and good physical health, and he bestows innumerable blessings upon them. He does not hasten the punishment for them, and He accepts the repentance of those among them who repent, even if the one who repents has led a life of disbelief and rebellion; He rejoices over that repentance, honours the one who repents, and turns his previous bad deeds into good deeds!\nWhat mercy, forbearance and generosity can surpass this?\nAl-Bukhaari (6099) and Muslim (2804) narrated that Abu Moosa said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one is more patient in bearing offensive things that he hears than Allah, may He be glorified and exalted; others are associated with Him, a son is attributed to Him, but He still grants them health and provision.”\nTo sum up, the one who expresses this view does not know Allah at all! And he does not know that He is the one who grants provision and bestows generously, and that everything that a person has of wealth, health, happiness, intellect, the ability to think, compassion towards others and being enabled to do good all comes from Allah. If he believed in that, he would realize that Allah is the most merciful of those who show mercy and is the most generous of those who show generosity.\nThe remedy for these people – if they truly seek good – is to learn about Allah and see for themselves the impact of His mercy. That is better for them than repeating the words of deniers of whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“They recognize the favor of Allah; then they deny it. And most of them are disbelievers”\n[an-Nahl 16:83].\nSecondly:\nThe one who sincerely cares about himself and about his faith, and is very cautious lest anything have a bad impact on it, should not listen to the specious arguments of the deniers and doubters, for that may undermine his faith and cause doubts to enter his heart.\nNo one should examine specious arguments except those who are well grounded in knowledge. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And when there comes to them information about [public] security or fear, they spread it around. But if they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those of authority among them, then the ones who [can] draw correct conclusions from it would have known about it. And if not for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy, you would have followed Satan, except for a few”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:83].\nWe ask Allah to help us and you to avoid fitnahs (temptations, confusion), both apparent and hidden.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In response to the claim that Allah loves to punish and torment people, it is important to approach this topic with a nuanced understanding based on Islamic teachings. According to Islamic belief, Allah is often described as Al-Rahman (the Most Merciful) and Al-Rahim (the Most Compassionate). These names emphasize that Allah's mercy and compassion are fundamental attributes.\n\n1. **Purpose of Punishment**: In Islam, punishment is not an expression of love but is often seen as a means of justice and correction. Allah's punishment is generally understood as a response to injustice, wrongdoing, and oppression. It serves to maintain moral order and is ultimately aimed at providing individuals with a chance to repent and seek forgiveness.\n\n2. **Judgment and Accountability**: The belief in the Day of Judgment underscores the idea that every person will be held accountable for their actions. This accountability is a demonstration of Allah's justice. The Qur'an often speaks of Allah's mercy being greater than His wrath (Qur'an 7:56) and emphasizes that He prefers to forgive those who repent.\n\n3. **Encouragement to Seek Forgiveness**: Rather than a desire to punish, Allah encourages believers to turn back to Him in repentance. The Qur'an states that Allah loves those who are repentant and those who purify themselves (Qur'an 2:222). Thus, the focus is on providing guidance and opportunities for redemption.\n\n4. **Human Understanding of Love**: It is important to recognize that human interpretations of love and punishment may differ from divine wisdom. What may seem like punishment from a human perspective can be a means for personal growth and refinement from Allah's perspective.\n\n5. **Afflictions as Tests**: Muslims believe that difficulties and afflictions can also serve as tests from Allah. These trials may lead to spiritual growth and increased faith, and they should not be interpreted solely as punishment.\n\nIn summary, the claim that Allah loves to punish and torment people does not align with the broader understanding of His attributes in Islam, which emphasize mercy, compassion, and justice. Allah's ultimate goal is guidance and forgiveness, and He is always ready to accept the repentance of those who turn towards Him sincerely."

        "question": "The abhorrent nature of shirk",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The abhorrent nature of shirk, wrongdoing and shameful deeds is something that is well-established even if one has not heard of the teachings of the Prophets, but the (divine) punishment of one who does such deeds does not become due until after the teachings reach him\n\nWhat Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) meant by these words was to highlight that shirk is wrong and blameworthy, and that the one who commits shirk is to be described as a mushrik; his action is abhorrent and blameworthy, regardless of whether or not proof with evidence has been established against the mushrik, because shirk is abhorrent in all cases, before the sending of the message and afterwards.\nThen he explained: The (divine) punishment of this mushrik is conditional and cannot be carried out unless matters are explained and proof is established. Therefore he does not deserve to be punished except after the Messenger has come and after the matter has been explained and made clear. If he associates others with Allah after the matter has been explained, then he deserves punishment, but if he did that before becoming aware of the teachings that were brought by the Messenger, he does not deserve punishment until proof is established against him.\nSo the discussion of Ibn Taymiyah is highlighting two issues:\n-1-\nHe points out that shirk is abhorrent and is entirely evil; that is its inherent nature and cannot be separated from it, whether that is before proof was established with the sending of the Messengers and Books, or after that. The mushrik is the one who fell into shirk and it became his practice; the fact that proof has not been established does not alter the nature or name of shirk as described in the religious texts.\n-2-\nThe mushrik does not deserve to be punished for his shirk except after proof is established against him. Punishment and reward cannot become due on the basis of what may be arrived at on the basis of rational thinking. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And never would We punish until We sent a messenger”\n[al-Isra’ 17:15]\n“And Allah would not let a people stray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them what they should avoid. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things”\n[at-Tawbah 9:115].\nBy highlighting the above, Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) intended to refute the arguments of two (theological) groups:\n-1-\nThe Mu‘tazilah and those who followed them in their view that the mushrikeen [those who associate others with Allah] are deserving of (divine) punishment on the basis of what they could have understood through rational thinking, even if proof was not established against them through the sending of the Messenger.\n-2-\nThe Ash‘aris and those who agreed with their view that shirk and wrongdoing are not abhorrent in and of themselves; rather their abhorrent nature is only confirmed on the basis of the religious texts that highlight their abhorrent nature, after proof is established on the basis of the religious text.\nThen he explained that the view of Ahl as-Sunnah is a middle path between these two. Shirk, wrongdoing and shameful deeds are all abhorrent and blameworthy matters, both before proof is established and after that. This is something that is understood by means of rational thinking and sound human nature, but Allah, may He be exalted, does not punish people except after establishing proof against them, as He made clear in His Book.\nThis is clearly stated by Shaykh al-Islam in several places in his books.\nHe said:\nIn some cases Allah differentiates between what came before the message was sent and what came afterwards, in terms of descriptions and rulings. In other cases, He gives the same descriptions and rulings both before and after the message was sent. This is proof against the two groups: against those who say that there is no such thing as deeds that are good or bad, and those who say that they deserve punishment regardless of whether the message reaches them or not.\nWith regard to the first group, Allah calls them wrongdoers, transgressors and spreaders of corruption and mischief, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed”\n[Taa-Haa 20:24]\n“And [mention] when your Lord called Moses, [saying], ‘Go to the wrongdoing people –\nThe people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear Allah?’”\n[ash-Shu‘araa’ 26:10-11]\n“Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions, oppressing a sector among them, slaughtering their [newborn] sons and keeping their females alive. Indeed, he was of the corrupters”\n[al-Qasas 28:4].\nThus Allah tells us that Pharaoh was a wrongdoer, a transgressor and a spreader of corruption and mischief; these descriptions are applied to him and his people, and are a criticism of their deeds, because criticism is only applicable to deeds that are evil and abhorrent. This indicates that deeds may be described as abhorrent and blameworthy before the Messenger came to them, but they did not deserve punishment except after the Messenger came to them, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And never would We punish until We sent a messenger”\n[al-Isra’ 17:15].\nSimilarly, Allah tells us that Hood said to his people (interpretation of the meaning):\n“O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. You are not but inventors [of falsehood]”\n[Hood 11:50].\nThus He describes them as inventors of falsehood before any ruling stated by the text that they might have gone against, because they associated another god with Allah.\nThe description of the mushrik is confirmed before the message is sent, because he is associating others with his Lord and is regarding false gods as being equal to Him, and he is ascribing other gods alongside Him and declaring them to be equals and rivals before the Messenger is sent.\nSomething similar may be said with regard to ascribing ignorance to the ignorant, and describing someone as being ignorant or behaving in an ignorant manner before the messenger comes.\nAs for (divine) punishment, however, there is no punishment [except after the message has been sent].\nWith regard to turning away and refusing to obey Allah, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning) “And the disbeliever had not believed, nor had he prayed. But [instead], he denied and turned away” [al-Qiyaamah 75:31-32]; this can only be after the coming of the Messenger. Similar to that is what Allah says of Pharaoh (interpretation of the meaning): “But Pharaoh denied and disobeyed” [an-Naazi‘aat 79:21] – that was after the Messenger came to him, as Allah, may He be exalted, says: “And he showed him the greatest sign, But Pharaoh denied and disobeyed” [an-Naazi‘aat 79:20-21] and “But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger” [al-Muzzammil 73:16].\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (20/37-38).\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\nThe majority of the earlier and later generations are of the view that what they (Pharaoh and his people, etc.) did before the coming of the Messenger constituted shirk and ignorance, and was something abhorrent and evil, but they did not deserve (divine) punishment until after the coming of the Messenger.\nTherefore:\nWith regard to shirk, wrongdoing, lying, shameful deeds and the like, there are three scholarly views:\n-1-\nIt was said that their abhorrent nature is known through rational thinking, and that they deserve punishment for that in the hereafter, even if no Messenger came to them, as is the view of the Mu‘tazilah and many of the companions of Abu Haneefah, who narrated it from Abu Haneefah himself, and it is also the view of Abu’l-Khattaab and others.\n-2-\nIt was said that there is nothing that can be regarded as abhorrent or good or evil before the sending of the message; rather what is abhorrent is that which Revelation came and said not to do it; what is good is that which revelation came and said to do it, or that for which permission was given to do it, as is the view of the Ash‘aris and those who agree with them.\n-3-\nAnd it was said that these deeds were were bad or evil or abhorrent before the Messenger came, but the (divine) punishment only becomes due when the Messenger is sent. This is the view of most of the early generations and most of the Muslims, and it is proven by the Qur’an and Sunnah, which clearly state that what the disbelievers believed in was evil, abhorrent and bad before the Messengers came, even though the punishment did not become due except after the Messenger was sent.\nIn as-Saheeh it is narrated that Hudhayfah said: O Messenger of Allah, we were in a state of ignorance and evil, then Allah brought this goodness to us. After this goodness, will there be any evil? He said: “Yes, there will be callers at the gates of Hell, and whoever responds to them, they will throw him into it.”\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (11/676-677).\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Lateef ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Hasan Aal ash-Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that proof was not yet established does not affect the shar‘i descriptions of people and actions; rather things are to be called what the Lawgiver called them, such as disbelief, shirk or evildoing, as named in the religious texts. The fact that proof is not yet established does not alter these descriptions, even if the person is not to be punished if no shar‘i proof was established against him and the message did not reach him. There is a difference between regarding a certain sin as constituting disbelief and regarding the one who did it as a disbeliever.\nEnd quote from Minhaaj at-Ta’sees (p. 316).\nFor more information and further explanation, please see the answer to question no. 111362.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, shirk refers to the act of associating partners with Allah (God) or attributing divine qualities to anyone or anything besides Him. It is considered the gravest sin in Islam, as it directly contradicts the core principle of Tawhid, which asserts the oneness and uniqueness of Allah.\n\nThe abhorrent nature of shirk is highlighted in several key aspects:\n\n1. **Violation of Tawhid**: Tawhid is the foundational concept in Islamic theology. Shirk undermines this principle by suggesting that there are other entities deserving of worship or having divine attributes, thus diminishing Allah's singularity.\n\n2. **Qur'anic Condemnation**: The Qur'an explicitly condemns shirk in multiple verses. For instance, Surah Al-Nisa (4:48) states that Allah does not forgive associating partners with Him unless one repents before death. Surah Al-Maidah (5:72) emphasizes that those who say “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary” have committed shirk.\n\n3. **Spiritual Consequences**: Engaging in shirk can lead to severe consequences in the afterlife, including eternal punishment in Hell. Such teachings serve as a warning for believers to maintain pure faith and devotion to Allah alone.\n\n4. **Challenge to Monotheistic Beliefs**: Shirk challenges the essence of Islamic monotheism and can lead to divisions within the community of believers. It encourages practices that distract from true worship and obedience to Allah.\n\n5. **Moral and Ethical Implications**: The concept of shirk has implications for moral and ethical behavior in a believer's life. It fosters a dependence on created beings, rather than the Creator, which can lead to societal injustices and idolatry.\n\nIn Islamic teachings, it is thus imperative for Muslims to avoid any form of shirk, maintain their faith solely in Allah, and promote the understanding of His oneness in all aspects of life. Repentance (Tawbah) is always encouraged for those who may be engaging in acts of shirk, with the hope of returning to the path of Tawhid."

        "question": "Response to those who say that worship is accepted from everyone, no matter what his belief",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe apparent meaning of this statement is that worship is accepted from a disbeliever just as it is accepted from a believer, and this is definitely wrong, because the worship of the disbeliever is not accepted and is not valid on his part, and he will not be rewarded for it in the hereafter, but he will benefit from good deeds in this world, as Allah will feed him in return for doing them.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We will regard what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed”\n[al-Furqaan 25:23]\n“The example of those who disbelieve in their Lord is [that] their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on a stormy day; they are unable [to keep] from what they earned a [single] thing. That is what is extreme error”\n[Ibraaheem 14:18]\n“But those who disbelieved - their deeds are like a mirage in a lowland which a thirsty one thinks is water until, when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing but finds Allah before Him, and He will pay him in full his due; and Allah is swift in account”\n[an-Noor 24:39]\n“And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah , your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers”\n[az-Zumar 39:65]\n“And whoever of you reverts from his religion [to disbelief] and dies while he is a disbeliever - for those, their deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and those are the companions of the Fire, they will abide therein eternally”\n[al-Baqarah 2:217]\n“And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers”\n[al-Maa’idah 5:5]\n“Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - never would the [whole] capacity of the earth in gold be accepted from one of them if he would [seek to] ransom himself with it. For those there will be a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:91].\nAnd there are many similar verses.\nMuslim (214) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, during the Jaahiliyyah Ibn Jud’aan used to uphold the ties of kinship and feed the poor. Will that benefit him at all? He said: “It will not benefit him, because he did not say one day, ‘Lord forgive me my sins on the Day of Judgement.’”.\nAnd Muslim (2808) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not treat the believer unjustly with regard to his good deeds. He blesses him because of them in this world and He will reward him for them in the Hereafter. As for the disbeliever, he is fed because of the good deeds that he does for the sake of Allah in this world, then when he passes on into the Hereafter, he will have no good deeds left for which to be rewarded.”.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim (17/150):\nThe scholars are unanimously agreed that for the disbeliever who dies in a state of disbelief there will be no reward in the hereafter, and he will not be rewarded in the hereafter for anything that he did in this world seeking to draw closer to Allah, may He be exalted.\nIn this hadith it clearly states that the disbeliever will be fed in this world because of the good deeds that he does, i.e., the deeds that he does seeking to draw close to Allah, may He be exalted, thereby; this refers to deeds the validity of which does not depend on the intention, such as upholding ties of kinship, giving charity, freeing slaves, offering hospitality, helping others, and so on.\nAs for the believer, the reward of his good deeds is stored up for him in the hereafter, and he is also rewarded for them in this world, as there is nothing to prevent him being rewarded for his good deeds both in this world and in the hereafter. This is referred to in the religious texts, and it is obligatory to believe in it.\nIf a disbeliever does such good deeds, then becomes Muslim, he will be rewarded for those deeds in the hereafter, according to the correct view. End quote.\nIbn Katheer said in his commentary on the first verse quoted above (3/106):\nThe words of Allah, “And We will regard what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed” [al-Furqaan 25:23], refer to the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will bring all people to account for what they did, good or bad. Here He tells us that the deeds that these polytheists did, thinking that they would save them, will not avail them anything, because they failed to meet the prescribed conditions, either doing the deeds sincerely for Allah alone, or following the laws prescribed by Allah.\nAny deed that is not sincerely for the sake of Allah alone and in accordance with the laws that He has prescribed and is pleased with, is invalid.\nThe deeds of the disbelievers may fail to meet either of these conditions, or they may fail to meet both of them, in which case they are even less likely to be accepted. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, says “And We will regard what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed” [al-Furqaan 25:23]. End quote.\nShaykh al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Some of the disbelievers honour their parents, uphold ties with their kin, honour guests, help those who are oppressed, give relief to those who are in distress, doing all of that for the sake of Allah. These are valid righteous deeds that are in accordance with Islamic teachings and the doer may be sincere towardsAllah when doing them, but they will not benefit him before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We will regard what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed”\n[al-Furqaan 25:23]\n“Those are the ones for whom there is not in the Hereafter but the Fire. And lost is what they did therein, and worthless is what they used to do”\n[Hood 11:16]\n“…their deeds are like a mirage…”\n[an-Noor 24:39]\n“…like ashes…”\n[Ibraaheem 14:18].\nAnd there are many similar verses.\nIt is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that with regard to the deeds of the righteous disbeliever – such as honouring his parents, bringing relief to one who is in distress, honouring a guest, helping one who has been wronged, and upholding the ties of kinship, that are done seeking the pleasure of Allah – if a disbeliever does such righteous deeds, Allah will reward him in this world, so He will give him worldly gains such as wealth, and will grant him food and drink, and good health, but they will not bring any reward with Allah (in the hereafter).\nThis is proven in the hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that was narrated from him by Anas, and narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh from Anas, from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that Allah feeds the disbeliever in return for his righteous deeds in this world, and He rewards him in this world, but when it comes to the hereafter, he will not have any good deeds for which to be rewarded. As for the Muslim, Allah will reward him for his good deeds in this world and stores reward for him in the hereafter.\nThe Qur’anic verses which indicate that the disbelievers benefit from their good deeds in this world include the following:\n“Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter - We increase for him in his harvest. And whoever desires the harvest of this world - We give him thereof, but there is not for him in the Hereafter any share”\n[ash-Shoora 42:20].\nEnd quote from al-‘Adhb al-Muneer (5/570).\nSee also the answer to question no. 13350.\nSecondly:\nThe prayer of the disbeliever may be answered, especially if he is in a state of distress or he is being wronged.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, at once they associate others with Him”\n[al-‘Ankaboot 29:65]\n“Say, ‘Who rescues you from the darknesses of the land and sea [when] you call upon Him imploring [aloud] and privately, “If He should save us from this [crisis], we will surely be among the thankful.”’\nSay, ‘It is Allah who saves you from it and from every distress; then you [still] associate others with Him.’”\n[al-An‘aam 6:63-64].\nAhmad (12549) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Fear the prayer of the one who has been wronged, even if he is a disbeliever, for there is no barrier [between it and Allah].”\nClassed as hasan by al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah, no. 767.\nBelief is not connected to one’s social or intellectual standing, as is claimed by some of those who propagate these misguided ideas. Rather it is a serious matter, which one must affirm in the heart, seeking to draw closer to Allah, may He be exalted, no matter what a person’s environmental, physical or social circumstances.\nMoreover, good deeds may be rendered invalid and rejected for various reasons, including not being in accordance with the Sunnah, or being done to show off, so how can anyone say that deeds will be accepted from everybody?!\nMay Allah protect us from the evils of tribulations, both apparent and hidden.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the acceptance of worship is fundamentally linked to the belief in the oneness of God (Tawhid) and the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him). According to Islamic teachings, acts of worship (ibadah) are only considered valid and accepted when they are performed with sincerity (ikhlas) and in accordance with the teachings of Islam.\n\nThe Quran emphasizes that those who disbelieve and turn away from faith may not have their deeds accepted by Allah. For instance, in Surah Al-Kahf (18:102-104), Allah warns that the deeds of those who reject faith will be rendered void, regardless of their outward good actions. Similarly, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:217), it is stated that if someone dies while associating partners with Allah (shirk), their deeds will not be accepted.\n\nAdditionally, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) stated in authentic Hadith that actions are judged by intentions, and the foundation of intention is tied to belief. If the fundamental tenet of belief is lacking, the validity of the worship is in question.\n\nThus, while acts of goodness and charity may have value in a general humanitarian context, in terms of religious worship and seeking acceptance from Allah, it is crucial for the individual to hold the correct belief and follow the prescribed acts of worship in Islam. Therefore, the assertion that worship is accepted from everyone, regardless of belief, is not aligned with Islamic teachings. Worship in Islam must be accompanied by the correct faith and adherence to the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah to be deemed accepted."

        "question": "Can telomeres prevent death?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The most that can be said about telomeres, if it is true and proven scientifically, is that they work to renew nerve cells and prevent the cells aging; they reduce the speed of telomere loss, and thus increase the rate of cell renewal even in old age.\nEven if this is proven scientifically, it means that youthfulness is preserved and aging is avoided.\nBut that has nothing to do with preventing death, because death happens to young and old, strong and weak; it is something that Allah has decreed for all humans and jinn.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We did not grant to any man before you eternity [on earth]; so if you die - would they be eternal?\nEvery soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned”\n[al-Anbiyaa’ 21:34-35]\n“Indeed, you are to die, and indeed, they are to die”\n[az-Zumar 39:30].\nAl-Bukhaari (7383) and Muslim (2717) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say: “…I seek refuge in Your glory – there is no god but You Who will never die, but jinn and men die.”\nNo matter what strength, youthfulness or good health a person attains, he has an appointed time that Allah, may He be exalted, has decreed for him, and he will inevitably taste death, then he will be resurrected for the reckoning and requital.\nAmong the polytheists there are those who deny the resurrection and the requital, but there is no one who denies death, for it is the reality that is seen by all, and no one can ward it off.\nRenewing cells, or preventing them from advancing in age, will be of no avail to the human being when the time of his death comes. You see the sturdiest of people, the best in health, the most youthful of them, dying when Allah wills it, and no one can ward off death from him.\n“Then why, when the soul at death reaches the throat,\nAnd you are at that time looking on –\nAnd Our angels are nearer to him than you, but you do not see –\nThen why do you not, if you are not to be recompensed,\nBring it back, if you should be truthful?”\n[al-Waaqi‘ah 56:83-87].\nGlory be to the One Who subjects His slaves to death, whilst He alone remains for eternity.\n“And He is the subjugator over His servants, and He sends over you guardian-angels until, when death comes to one of you, Our messengers take him, and they do not fail [in their duties].\nThen they His servants are returned to Allah, their true Lord. Unquestionably, His is the judgement, and He is the swiftest in calling to account”\n[al-An‘aam 6:61-62].\nWe do not know of anyone who has claimed to discover a medicine or a means of preventing death. No one will ever be able to do that, even if he seeks the help of all the people on earth, for the One Who created man created death, and has decreed people’s lifespans, and He ordained that in a Book with Him fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth. None can put back His decree or overturn His decision.\nSo forget about dubious matters; focus on yourself and prepare to meet Allah, may He be exalted, for the appointed time decreed by Allah is surely coming.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the concept of death is understood as a part of Allah's divine plan and is predetermined for every individual. It is part of the natural order of life and serves a significant purpose in the human experience.\n\nTelomeres are the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that play a role in cellular aging. The length of telomeres is associated with the aging process, and shorter telomeres are linked to a higher risk of various age-related diseases and, ultimately, death. However, while research on telomeres and aging is ongoing, they do not prevent death; rather, they may influence health and longevity.\n\nIn Islam, it is believed that death is not something that can be prevented by scientific means or medical advancements. Instead, individuals are encouraged to live a life that aligns with Islamic teachings, focusing on good deeds, moral conduct, and preparation for the afterlife. The understanding is that while we may seek to maintain our health, the timing of death is ultimately in the hands of Allah."

        "question": "All goodness is in complying with and submitting to the command of Allah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe would like to draw the questioner’s attention to the importance of choosing the right words, for words are the vessels of meaning.\nIt would have been more appropriate for the questioner to say trust or reliance (tawakkul), submission or thinking positively of Allah, or other such Islamic phrases which reflect sound meanings, instead of using phrases such as “blind trust”, which carries a shade of meaning that is not appropriate when speaking of submitting to Allah, believing in Him and putting one’s trust in Him (tawakkul).\nYes it is trust, but it is not blind; rather it stems from deeply-rooted certainty that all good is in His hands, and that nothing bad comes from Him, may He be glorified and praised, and that adhering to His laws, obeying His commands, and avoiding what He prohibits is the key to all goodness.\nSecondly:\nImam at-Tahhaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: One’s commitment to Islam cannot be steadfast unless it is based on submission and surrender.\nEnd quote from Sharh at-Tahhaawiyyah (1/231).\nShaykh al-Barraak said in his commentary on at-Tahhaawiyyah (128): A person’s commitment to Islam cannot be established and he cannot develop reassurance and peace of mind unless it is built on the foundation of submission.\nThe ideas of surrender and submission are close in meaning. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whoever submits his face to Allah while he is a doer of good…”\n[Luqmaan 31:22].\nIslam means surrender and submission, which implies not disputing, because the one who disputes has not submitted.\nSubmission is an important principle and is to be based on belief in Allah, His Messenger and His Book.\nBelief in Allah means believing that He, may He be exalted, is the true God and no other is deserving of worship except Him; that He, may He be exalted, is the Lord and Sovereign of all things; that He, may He be glorified and exalted, possesses all the attributes of perfection and is far above any shortcomings, so there is no injustice or folly in His creation, laws and decree, rather He, may He be exalted, is wise in all that He creates, prescribes and decrees.\nOnce you understand this properly, then whatever you learn about what Allah, may He be exalted, and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said and prescribed, you must submit, because objections and disputes only stem from weakness of faith in divine justice, and from weakness of faith in divine wisdom.\nEverything that is contrary to truth is false, but sometimes the opposition may be blunt and clear, as in the case of the disbelievers and those whose faith is shaky or has almost vanished altogether. Such people speak of objections to the laws and will of Allah, and sometimes they do not speak of them but they are in their hearts.\nThe Muslim must ward off all objections that cross his mind, or that he hears on the lips of the devils or of ignorant people. He can ward that off by believing that Allah, may He be exalted, is Most Just, Most Wise and All-Knowing.\nThis does not mean that Islamic teachings are contrary to reason; rather sound reasoning is never contrary to the soundly-narrated texts. But reason has certain limits when it comes to understanding the religious texts. It is not possible for human reason to encompass everything; rather human reason has its limits beyond which it cannot go, because man is imperfect. Not every question can be answered; rather you should say: Allah knows best, and Allah is Most Wise and All-Knowing.\nWhen a person submits, he will find comfort and will be able to give reassurance to people around him.\nWith regard to the objections that came to your mind:\neither you can ward them off with evidence and proof that will dispel these doubts,\nor if you are not able to do that because of lack of knowledge, then you may ward them off with this principle [submission] and say: I believe in Allah and His Messenger, for the Shaytaan casts waswaas [whispers; intrusive thoughts] into people’s hearts.\nThirdly:\nWith regard to the meaning that you understood for this verse, it is correct and was stated by a number of commentators, namely that Moosa (peace be upon him) thought that Allah was commanding him to reject his staff. It was narrated from Wahb: The Lord said to him: “Throw it down, O Moses”, and Moosa thought that He was telling him to reject it, so he threw it down by way of rejecting it.\nEnd quote from at-Tafseer al-Baseet (14/382); Tafseer al-Baghawi (5/269).\nAnd whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, will not feel its loss.\nEnd quote from Tafseer al-Qurtubi (18/26).\nShaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAsh-Shaakir and ash-Shakoor (the Appreciative) are among the names of Allah, may He be exalted, Who accepts a small deed from His slave and grants him an immense reward for it. If His slave adheres to His commands and obeys Him, He helps him to do that and praises him for it, and rewards him with light, faith and comfort in his heart, and with physical strength and energy, and grants him increased blessing and growth in all his affairs, and increased success in his deeds.\nThen after that, He will grant him reward in full with his Lord in the hereafter, and nothing will be detracted from that.\nPart of Allah’s appreciation of His slave is that if he gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than it; whoever draws near to Him a handspan, Allah will draw near to him an arm’s length; whoever draws near to Him an arm’s length, He will draw near to him a fathom’s length; whoever comes to Him walking, He will come to him at speed; whoever enters into a deal with Him, He will grant him abundant profit. Although He is Appreciative, He knows best who is deserving of reward in full, commensurate with his intention, faith and piety, and who is not like that. He knows best about the deeds of His slaves, so He will not cause them to be lost; rather they will find them complete and abundant, according to their intentions, of which the All-Knowing, the Most Wise is well aware.\nEnd quote from Tafseer as-Sa‘di (76).\nFourthly:\nThis verse contains an important, practical meaning, which is very helpful to the Muslim in the way he responds to the commands of the Lord of the Worlds and of His noble Messenger that are addressed to him. That is: to quickly respond to them, and not be lazy or slow or hesitant, or procrastinate.\nWhere we see that in the verse is when Allah, may He be exalted, says, “So he threw it down”. The particle fa (translated here as “so”) indicates that this happened straightaway. In other words, Moosa (peace be upon him) hastened to comply with the command of his Lord and to obey Him. So he threw down his staff that was so useful and necessary to him, as soon as he heard the words of the Lord of the Worlds.\nThis is how the Muslim should be with his Lord. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error”\n[al-Ahzaab 33:36].\nWe also advise you to measure the ideas that come to your mind concerning the meaning against what the scholars say about the interpretation of this verse, and to frequently consult readily available tafseers such as Mukhtasar at-Tafseer (Markaz Tafseer edition) or at-Tafseer al-Muyassar (Ministry of Awqaaf edition). After that, one of the most important tafseers is that of Shaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) [available in English under the title Tafseer as-Sa‘di, published in ten volumes by International Islamic Publishing House (IIPH), Riyadh]. That will be a great help to you in reflecting upon the meanings of the verses and understanding the subtle concepts derived from them.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Indeed, in Islam, the essence of goodness lies in complying with and submitting to the commands of Allah (SWT). The concept of obedience to Allah encompasses following His guidance as revealed in the Qur'an and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This obedience is considered a fundamental aspect of a Muslim's faith and practice.\n\nBy submitting to Allah’s commands, a believer seeks to align their actions with divine will, which leads to personal righteousness and societal harmony. The Qur'an emphasizes that true believers are those who submit themselves to Allah and strive to live in accordance with His commands. Goodness is often manifested through acts of worship, moral conduct, compassion, justice, and integrity—all of which stem from a desire to obey Allah.\n\nUltimately, by adhering to Allah's guidance, one can attain the ultimate purpose of life, which is to seek His pleasure and ensure success in both this world and the Hereafter."

        "question": "Thinking in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Muslim should strive to preserve his belief and his faith, and focus on maintaining his sound fitrah and thinking; he should flee for the sake of his religious commitment and spiritual well-being from doubts and confusion, for hearts are weak and specious arguments may be attractive, because of the way they are presented as something beautiful by proponents of innovation and misguidance, when in fact they are based on flimsy and weak foundations.\nReading books that promote innovation and misguidance, or books that promote shirk and myths, or the books of other religions that have been distorted, or the books written by atheists and hypocrites, or looking at websites that promote these deviant ideas and propagate specious arguments, is not permissible except for one who is well-versed in Islamic knowledge, whose aim in reading such material is to refute it and highlight its corrupt nature, and has the ability to do that or is qualified to take on this task.\nAs for one who does not have Islamic knowledge looking at or reading such material, doing so is more likely to lead to some sort of confusion, undermining the belief in his heart and shaking his faith, because of the specious arguments that he reads.\nThis has happened to many ordinary Muslims, and even to some seekers of knowledge who are not qualified to deal with such material, to the extent that in some cases they have ended up misguided and astray – we seek refuge with Allah.\nVery often, the one who looks at these books may be deceived by his thinking that his faith is stronger than all the specious arguments presented, but then suddenly he finds – if he reads a great deal – that the specious arguments have begun to take root in his mind in a manner that never occurred to him.\nHence the advice of the scholars of the righteous early generations was to forbid looking at or reading such books.\nWe have quoted the words of the scholars in the answer to question no. 92781.\nSecondly:\nIt is essential to learn Islam from its sources, the greatest of which, and the foundation thereof, are the Qur’an and Sunnah.\nIslam has emphasized the importance of reason and thinking, which is reflected in many verses. There are phrases that are repeated dozens of times in the Qur’an, such as “Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you might use reason” [al-Baqarah 2:242], “for a people who give thought” [Yoonus 10:24] and “for a people who understand” [al-An‘aam 6:98].\nAllah calls upon us to think in the Qur’an, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“[This is] a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded”\n[Saad 38:29].\nAllah, may He be glorified, says, calling us to reflect upon His creation (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Do they not contemplate within themselves? Allah has not created the heavens and the earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specified term. And indeed, many of the people, in [the matter of] the meeting with their Lord, are disbelievers”\n[ar-Room 30:8].\nIndeed, Allah, may He be exalted, has criticized the people of Hell by stating that they did not benefit from their reason, and He tells us (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And they will say, ‘If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze’”\n[al-Mulk 67:10]\n“So have they not traveled through the earth and have hearts by which to reason and ears by which to hear? For indeed, it is not eyes that are blinded, but blinded are the hearts which are within the breasts”\n[al-Hajj 22:46].\nThinking is an act of worship, which Allah points out in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding\nWho remember Allah while standing or sitting or [lying] on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth, [saying], \"Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly; exalted are You [above such a thing]; then protect us from the punishment of the Fire”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:190-191].\nShaykh as-Sa‘di said:\nHere Allah tells us that “Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding”. This encourages people to think deeply, examine these signs and contemplate the creation. He left the word “signs” ambiguous, and did not state explicitly what it points to, as an indication of the great number and ubiquitous nature of those signs. That is because in creation there are amazing signs that dazzle those who look upon them, convince those who ponder them, attract the hearts of those who are sincere and strengthen the faith of those of understanding. But the details of what these signs contain are impossible for any person to list or even comprehend some of them.\nIn conclusion, what we see in them of greatness, the vastness and order in the movement of heavenly bodies, point to the greatness of their Creator and His power, which encompasses all things.\nTheir perfection, precision and beauty point to the wisdom of Allah, His control over all things and the vastness of His knowledge.\nThe benefits they bring to people are indicative of the vastness of Allah’s mercy, the all-encompassing nature of His grace and kindness, and the necessity of being grateful to Him. All of that indicates that the heart should only be attached to its Creator and originator, and should do its utmost to seek His pleasure, and not associate with Him any of those who have not even an atom’s weight of power over themselves or others on earth or in heaven.\nAllah has intended these signs only for those of understanding, namely people of reason, because they are the ones who benefit from that and who contemplate the signs with reason, and do not merely look at them with their eyes.\nThen Allah describes those of understanding as being those “who remember Allah” in all circumstances, “standing or sitting or [lying] on their sides”. This includes all types of remembrance of Allah, both verbal and in the heart. That includes praying standing; if that is not possible, then sitting; and if that is not possible then lying on one’s side. “and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth” that is, so that they may reach the conclusion intended (that there is a great Creator).\nThis indicates that thinking is an act of worship, and is one of the characteristics of the close friends of Allah. When they think and reflect upon these things, they realise that Allah did not create them in vain, and they say: “Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly; exalted are You [above such a thing]” and exalted are You above all that is not befitting to Your Majesty; rather You created it in truth, for truth, and including truth.\n“then protect us from the punishment of the Fire” by protecting us from doing bad deeds, and helping us to do righteous deeds, so that we might attain thereby salvation from the fire. End quote.\nIn the hadith narrated from ‘Ata’, he said: ‘Ubayd ibn ‘Umayr and I went to visit ‘Aa’ishah. She said to ‘Ubayd ibn ‘Umayr: It is about time you visited us. He said: O my mother, I say as the first one said: Make your visits at long intervals, and people will love you more. She said: Spare us from this gibberish of yours! Ibn ‘Umayr said: Tell us of the most amazing thing you saw from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). She remained silent for a while, then she said: One night he said: “O ‘Aa’ishah, let me focus on worshipping my Lord this night.” I said: By Allah, I love to be near you, and I love what makes you happy. He got up and did wudoo’, then he began to pray. She said: And he kept weeping until his lap became wet. Then he wept and kept weeping until his beard became wet. Then he wept and kept weeping until the ground became wet. Then Bilaal came to call him for prayer, and when he saw him weeping, he said: O Messenger of Allah, why are you weeping when Allah has forgiven you your past and future sins? He said: “Should I not be a thankful slave? Last night a verse was revealed to me; woe to the one who recites it and does not reflect:\n‘Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding\nWho remember Allah while standing or sitting or [lying] on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth, [saying], \"Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly; exalted are You [above such a thing]; then protect us from the punishment of the Fire’\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:190].”\nNarrated by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh (2/286). See also as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (1/147).\nThe man of literature and great thinker, Ustadh ‘Abbaas Mahmoud al-‘Aqqaad, wrote a book on this issue, entitled at-Tafkeer Fareedah Islamiyyah (Thinking is an Islamic Duty).",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, thinking and reflection are highly encouraged and are considered important aspects of faith. The Quran and Hadith emphasize the importance of using one's intellect to understand the signs of Allah in the universe and to ponder over the creation around us. Here are a few key points regarding thinking in Islam:\n\n1. **Encouragement of Intellectual Inquiry**: The Quran urges believers to think critically and reflect upon their surroundings. Verses such as Surah Al-Imran (3:190) state, \"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding.\"\n\n2. **Seeking Knowledge**: The pursuit of knowledge is considered a form of worship in Islam. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.\" (Sunan Ibn Majah)\n\n3. **Balance Between Reason and Faith**: Islam teaches that faith (iman) and reason (aql) go hand in hand. Muslims are encouraged to use their reasoning to understand their faith deeper, thus reinforcing belief through knowledge and contemplation.\n\n4. **Critical Thinking**: Islam encourages questioning and critical thinking. However, this inquiry should be approached with sincerity and a desire to understand the truth, not for mere debate or argumentation.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Critical thinking in Islam must also take into account ethical considerations. Muslims are urged to ensure that their reasoning aligns with Islamic values and principles.\n\n6. **Reflection and Self-Improvement**: Muslims are encouraged to reflect on their lives, actions, and the world around them. This reflection can lead to self-improvement and a deeper relationship with Allah.\n\nOverall, thinking in Islam comprises a blend of critical reasoning, ethical considerations, and a pursuit of knowledge, all aimed at enhancing one's faith and understanding of the divine."

        "question": "Why Do Muslims Kiss the Black Stone?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ’Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained the wisdom behind tawaf when he said: “Circumambulation of the Ka`bah (tawaf), going between as-Safa and al-Marwah (sa‘i), and stoning the Jamarat have only been ordained to establish the remembrance of Allah.” \nThe one who circumambulates the House of Allah, may He be exalted, does that while feeling awe of Allah in his heart, may He be exalted. Thus he is in a state of remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted, and all his movements – walking, kissing or touching the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner, or pointing to the Black Stone – all come under the heading of remembering Allah, may He be exalted, because they are all acts of worship, and all acts of worship are remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted, in general terms. \nAs for the words that he utters of takbهr, dhikr and du`a, they obviously come under the heading of remembering Allah, may He be exalted. \nAs for kissing the Black Stone , it is an act of worship in which a person kisses a stone to which he has no connection except worshipping Allah, may He be exalted, by venerating it and following the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) by doing that, as it is proven that the Amهr al-Mumineهn ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, when he kissed the Black Stone : I know that you are a stone and have no power to harm or benefit; were it not that I saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) kissing you, I would not have kissed you.\nWith regard to what some ignorant people think, that the purpose behind that is to seek blessing (barakah) from it, there is no basis for that, so it is invalid.\nWith regard to what some heretics have said, that circumambulating the Ka`bah is like circumambulating the graves of their saints, and that it is tantamount to idolatry, this is part of their heresy. \nThe believers only circumambulate the Ka`bah in compliance with the command of Allah, and whatever is done in compliance with the command of Allah, doing it is an act of worship of Allah, may He be exalted.\nDo you not see that prostrating to anything other than Allah is major shirk (shirk akbar), but when Allah commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam, prostration to Adam was an act of worship to Allah, may He be exalted, and refusing to prostrate to him was an act of disbelief?\nHence circumambulation of the Kabah is one of the greatest acts of worship; it is the foundation of the Hajj, and Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam. Hence when the mataf (place of tawaf) is calm, the one who does tawaf experiences the joy of tawaf and feels in his heart that he is close to his Lord, which confirms the virtue and high status of the House of Allah. And it is Allah Whose help we seek.” (Fatawa al-‘Aqهdah, pp. 28-29)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the Black Stone (Hajr al-Aswad) is a significant relic located in the corner of the Kaaba, the sacred structure in the Grand Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca. Kissing the Black Stone is a practice performed during the Hajj pilgrimage and Umrah, and it holds both spiritual and symbolic significance for Muslims.\n\n1. **Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad**: Kissing or touching the Black Stone is a practice established by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) during his lifetime. He kissed the stone when he performed Tawaf (the ritual circling of the Kaaba) and encouraged others to do the same.\n\n2. **Symbol of Unity**: The Black Stone is seen as a symbol of the covenant between God and humanity. By kissing it, Muslims express their devotion to God and their connection to the broader Muslim community.\n\n3. **Remembrance of Allah**: The act of kissing the Black Stone is part of the rituals during Hajj and Umrah, which are acts of worship aimed at drawing closer to God. It serves as a reminder of the oneness of Allah and the significance of obedience and submission in a Muslim's faith.\n\n4. **Spiritual Significance**: While touching or kissing the Black Stone is regarded as meritorious, it is understood that it does not hold any inherent power. The act is symbolic, reflecting the believer's connection to the Prophet and the Islamic faith.\n\nIn essence, while kissing the Black Stone is a revered practice, it is the intention and devotion behind the action that holds the true significance in Islam."

        "question": "Is testifying that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah equal to testifying that there is no god but Allah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhaari (8) and Muslim (12) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing prayer, giving zakaah, Hajj and fasting Ramadan.”\nThe shahaadatayn (twin testimony of faith) is one of the pillars of Islam, and this first pillar of Islam is a belief that includes affirming the oneness of Allah and testifying to the message of His Prophet. The conjunction wa (“and”) indicates that the two phrases come under the same ruling, which applies equally to both. Just as it is obligatory for an individual to say “I bear witness that there is no god but Allah (ash-hadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allah),” and his Islam is not valid, and he has not entered Islam, unless he says that, the same ruling applies equally to the second half of the shahaadah (testimony of faith): “I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasool-Allah).” So the individual must also say this, and his Islam is not valid, and he has not entered Islam, unless he says it. So these two phrases are equally subject to the ruling, and they are the two halves of a single pillar of Islam, which is the Shahaadatayn (twin declaration of faith).\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOne may recite only the testimony that there is no god but Allah, whilst intending both parts of the twin declaration of faith, because they are strongly interconnected.\nEnd quote from Fath al-Baari (1/133).\nAl-Mullah ‘Ali al-Qaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nBecause the two parts of the twin declaration of faith are inseparable according to Islamic teaching, they are regarded as one thing, and one of the two phrases may appear in a report on its own because it is sufficient to indicate both of them.\nIt was said: it may be understood from their being mentioned together in most reports that in order for a person’s Islam to be valid, it is essential to recite them both together, one after the other, in this order. End quote.\nMirqaat al-Mafaateeh (1/168).\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah is regarded as a single pillar, because in every act of worship it is essential to have true sincerity towards Allah alone and to follow the way of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nEnd quote from Liqaa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh (2/197).\nShaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe two phrases of the twin declaration of faith are inseparable; whoever testifies to one of them, that implies that he testifies to the other. In fact, the second one is complementary to the first, because we say: how do you know that there is no god but Allah, and that Allah is the true God, and that no one deserves to be regarded as divine except Him? Is that not through the message of the Messenger? Hence you must believe in the Messenger and testify that he was sent by his Lord.\nIf you believe that the Messenger (peace be upon him) was indeed a Messenger, and that he was sent by his Lord, then what is the message that he conveyed? Is it not the case that the first thing he began with was to affirm the oneness of Allah by saying, There is no god but Allah? So the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) began by calling people to worship Allah alone and to give up the worship of anyone other than Him. This is the greatest message that he conveyed. Therefore the two halves of the twin declaration of faith are inseparable, and whoever testifies that there is no God but Allah must pronounce the second half of the testimony of faith, which is testifying that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Whoever testifies that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah must accept his message, the most important part of which is the belief that there is no god but Allah. From this we know that the two parts are inseparable.\nEnd quote from Sharh at-Tahhaawiyyah (45/12).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the testimony of faith, known as the Shahada, consists of two parts: \"Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah\" (I bear witness that there is no god but Allah) and \"Ashhadu anna Muhammadur Rasulullah\" (I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah). \n\nBoth parts are essential and complementary to each other in declaring one's faith. The first part acknowledges the oneness of Allah, affirming monotheism, while the second part recognizes Muhammad as His final messenger. Together, they encapsulate the core beliefs of Islam and are fundamental for a person to be considered a Muslim.\n\nIn summary, testifying that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah is not equal to testifying that there is no god but Allah in terms of their individual significance, but both are required together to complete the testimony of faith in Islam."

        "question": "Every monotheist will enter Paradise, so why should the Muslims strive?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThis man, ‘Adnaan Ibraaheem, is not someone who is to be followed regarding religious matters, and his talks should not be listened to, because of the corrupt ideas and beliefs that he promotes.\nHe is not one of the scholars to whom one should refer; rather his ideas are deviant in terms of knowledge, methodology and belief, as the Ahl as-Sunnah of our time have pointed out.\nFor more information on him and what he promotes of deviant ideas, please click on the following link:\nSecondly:\nWhat is indicated by the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah, and the salaf (early generations) of this ummah are unanimously agreed upon it, is that no one in whose heart is an atom’s weight of faith will abide in Hell forever. Even if he enters Hell because of his sin, he will remain there for as long as Allah wills, then he will be brought forth therefrom to Paradise.\nAl-Bukhaari (44) and Muslim (193) narrated from Anas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allah and has in his heart goodness the weight of a grain of barley will be brought out of Hell, then whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allah and has in his heart goodness the weight of a grain of wheat will be brought out of Hell, then whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allah and has in his heart goodness the weight of an atom (or a small ant) will be brought out of Hell.”\nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhoever dies affirming the oneness of Allah (Tawheed) and not associating anything with Allah will be one of the people of Paradise, even if he commits zina and steals, and even if he commits other sins, such as defiance towards parents, riba (usury), bearing false witness, and so on. For the sinner is subject to Allah’s will; if our Lord wills, He will forgive him, and if He wills, He will punish him according to his sins, if he dies without having repented. And even if he enters Hell and is punished therein, he will not abide therein forever; rather he will be brought forth therefrom to Paradise, after he has been cleansed and purified.\nEnd quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb (6/51).\nSee also the answers to questions no. 112113 , 147996 and 170526 .\nThirdly:\nFor someone to say, “All the Muslims will enter Paradise, so do whatever you want” is a false statement and is contrary to what is  well-known of the religion, which calls and urges people to obey Allah, and warns them against disobeying Him. In fact, it is contrary to the messages of all the Prophets, which call on people to worship Allah and enjoin them to do so. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], ‘Worship Allah and avoid Taghut [false gods].’ And among them were those whom Allah guided, and among them were those upon whom error was [deservedly] decreed. So proceed through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers” [an-Nahl 16:36].\nAllah sent the Prophets to correct people’s beliefs, deeds and attitudes; the call of Islam sets out guidelines and instructions for the rectification of every aspect of human life:\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have only been sent to perfect good attitude and good manners.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘ (2349).\nThe texts which indicate that it is obligatory to obey Allah and obey His Messenger, and warn against doing anything contrary to that, are too many to mention here. For example:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And obey Allah and the Messenger that you may obtain mercy” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:132]\n“And obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware. And if you turn away - then know that upon Our Messenger is only [the responsibility for] clear notification” [al-Maa’idah 5:92].\nAnd He warns against disobeying Allah and His Messenger, and neglecting His commands. He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“So let those beware who dissent from the Prophet's order, lest fitnah strike them or a painful punishment” [an-Noor 24:63]\n“And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits - He will put him into the Fire to abide eternally therein, and he will have a humiliating punishment” [an-Nisaa’ 4:14]\n“It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error” [al-Ahzaab 33:36].\nMoreover, it is also contrary to the reason for which Allah created the jinn and mankind. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me” [adh-Dhaariyaat 51:56].\nAs for this baseless question, “why should we strive, so long as every Muslim will be in Paradise?”,\nIt may be answered from several angles.\n-1- The believer will only attain Paradise by virtue of his own deeds, and not by virtue of his name or heritage. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We will have removed whatever is within their hearts of resentment, [while] flowing beneath them are rivers. And they will say, ‘Praise to Allah , who has guided us to this; and we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us. Certainly the messengers of our Lord had come with the truth.’ And they will be called, ‘This is Paradise, which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do’” [al-A‘raaf 7:43]\n“The ones whom the angels take in death, [being] good and pure; [the angels] will say, ‘Peace be upon you. Enter Paradise for what you used to do’” [an-Nahl 16:32]\n“[They will be told], ‘Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do’” [at-Toor 52:19]\n“Indeed, the righteous will be among shades and springs\nAnd fruits from whatever they desire,\n[Being told], ‘Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do’” [al-Mursalaat 77:41-43].\n-2- If we assume that Allah, may He be exalted, has decreed that someone will enter Paradise, he is also enjoined to strive, and it will be made easy for him to do the deeds of the people of Paradise, so that he will enter it by virtue of his deeds. There is no contradiction between the prior decree of Allah and the religious duties. This is something that is well-known in the religion, that Allah has commanded His slaves to believe in the divine decree (predestination), but at the same time has also enjoined upon them that they should strive.\nIt was narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was at a funeral, and he picked up something and started to hit the ground with it, and said: “There is no one among you but his place in Hell or his place in Paradise is already decreed.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, then should we not rely on our destiny and give up striving? He said: “Keep striving, for everyone will be helped to do that for which he was created. As for the one who is among the blessed, he will be helped to do the deeds of the blessed; as for the one who is among the doomed, he will be helped to do the deeds of the doomed. Then he recited the words: “As for he who gives and fears Allah, And believes in the best [reward], We will ease him toward ease” [al-Layl 92:5-7].\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (4949) and Muslim (2647).\n-3- It may be said: Yes, no one will enter Paradise except a Muslim, and no one will remain in Hell in whose heart is an atom’s weight of faith, but how can you be certain that Allah will not cast into your heart fitnah, shirk, deviation and misguidance, in requital for your deviating from what He has enjoined and your failing to obey Him? Allah, may He be exalted, has warned those who disobey him, as we have seen above. And Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And when they deviated, Allah caused their hearts to deviate. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people” [as-Saff 61:5].\nEach individual should understand that his deeds and his status will only be judged according to how his life ends, and who can guarantee him a good and believing end, if he persists in his deviation and disobedience?\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us, and he is the most truthful one: “The creation of any one of you is put together in his mother’s womb for forty days, then he becomes a ‘alaqah (a piece of thick coagulated blood) for a similar period, then he becomes like a chewed piece of flesh (mudghah) for a similar period, then Allah sends to him an angel who is enjoined to write down four things; it is said to Him: Write down his deeds, his provision, his lifespan, and whether he is doomed (to Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise). Then the soul is breathed into him. One of you may strive until there is nothing between him and Paradise but a cubit, then the decree overtakes him and he does a deed of the people of Hell. Or he may strive until there is nothing between him and Hell but a cubit, then the decree overtakes him and he does a deed of the people of Paradise.” Agreed upon.\nIt was narrated from Sahl ibn Sa‘d as-Saa‘idi (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: A man may do the deeds of the people of Paradise, or so it appears to people, although he is one of the people of Hell, and a man may do the deeds of the people of Hell, or so it appears to people, although he is one of the people of Paradise. Deeds are judged by how they end.” Agreed upon.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, while the belief is held that all true monotheists have the potential to enter Paradise, this belief does not imply that striving in faith and practice is unnecessary. Here are several reasons why Muslims are encouraged to strive:\n\n1. **Obligations of Faith**: Islam teaches that worship and good deeds are fundamental obligations for Muslims. While belief in the oneness of God (Tawhid) is the cornerstone of faith, it is combined with actions, including prayer, charity, fasting, and fulfilling other religious duties. These practices are acts of worship that demonstrate one's faith and commitment to God.\n\n2. **Gradations in Paradise**: Islamic teachings suggest that there are different levels or degrees in Paradise. The rewards in the afterlife are based on one's deeds and adherence to the teachings of Islam. Striving in worship and good actions can lead to elevated status in the Hereafter.\n\n3. **Accountability and Judgment**: Every individual will be held accountable for their actions on the Day of Judgment. Muslims believe that their striving and adherence to righteous deeds will be evaluated by God, and this evaluation will influence their ultimate fate. This accountability serves as a motivation to engage in acts that please God.\n\n4. **Purpose of Life**: The Quran states that human beings are created to worship God (Quran 51:56). Striving in faith and good deeds fulfills the purpose of life and cultivates a deep relationship with the Creator.\n\n5. **Intercessions and Mercy**: While it is true that belief in God is essential, striving in good deeds can also open the doors to God's mercy. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught that God's mercy encompasses all things, and sincere efforts in worship and kindness can lead to forgiveness and closeness to Him.\n\n6. **Personal Development**: Striving in faith helps with personal growth, moral development, and the cultivation of positive character traits. It promotes discipline, compassion, and a sense of community through good actions toward others.\n\nIn conclusion, striving in Islam is a crucial aspect of a believer's life that underscores their faith, enhances their connection to God, and offers a path towards success in both this life and the Hereafter."

        "question": "Going to horoscope pages and channels in order to refute them",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not permissible for a Muslim to go to fortune tellers or listen to them, even if he does not believe in what they claim to have of knowledge of the unseen, because of the report narrated by Muslim (2230) from one of the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “Whoever goes to a fortune-teller and asks him about something, his prayer will not be accepted for forty nights.”\nHowever, if he believes what they say, then he has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nImam Ahmad (9536) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a soothsayer or fortune teller and believes what he says has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘ (5939).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe scholars said: It is only prohibited to go to soothsayers because they speak of matters of the unseen that may come to pass by coincidence, so there is the fear that people may become confused because of that, because they try to confuse people and make them drift away from the path of Islam. There are many saheeh hadiths which indicate that it is forbidden to go to soothsayers and believe what they say.\nEnd quote from Sharh an-Nawawi (5/22).\nSecondly:\nAstrology involves making connections between events on earth and the movements of the stars, interpreting what happens on earth on the basis of astronomical events.\nOne of the types of astrology is that which is called horoscopes and zodiac, in which it is believed that the child who is born under a particular sign of the Zodiac will be lucky or unlucky, and what they say about the nature and characteristics of people according to their star signs.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Whoever acquires any knowledge of astrology has acquired knowledge of a branch of witchcraft”:\nWhat is meant here is that knowledge of the stars through which they seek to predict earthly events, so – for example – when a certain star appears in conjunction with another star, they predict that such and such will happen, and if a person is born under a particular star, he will be lucky, and if a person is born under another star, he will be unlucky. From the different positions of the stars they predict various earthly events. But earthly events are decreed by Allah; the causes thereof may be known to us or they may be unknown, but the stars have nothing to do with it.\nEnd quote from al-Qawl al-Mufeed (1/519).\nIt says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (27/203):\nIt is haraam to publish, read or propagate horoscopes, and it is not permissible to believe them; rather this is a kind of disbelief (kufr) and is contrary to Tawheed. What you must do is be aware of that, advise others to avoid it, and rely only on Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, putting your trust in Him in all your affairs. End quote.\nSee also the answer to question no. 2538 .\nThirdly:\nIf someone has sufficient knowledge to be able to advise these fortunetellers and charlatans, so he tries to communicate with them, and he goes to them where they are, so that he can tell them that what they are doing is wrong and explain to them the Islamic ruling on what they are doing, then that is not regarded as going to them in the manner that is prohibited. Rather that is something prescribed and enjoined for one who is able to do it, and it is either obligatory or recommended, no matter what the means of communicating with them.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that speaking to fortune tellers or asking them questions is of different types, one of which is:\n… The fourth type: asking the fortuneteller questions in order to highlight his falseness and lies. Thus one may test him by asking him questions, and this may be obligatory or may be something that is needed. Proving the words of soothsayers to be wrong is something that is needed, and may be obligatory. In that case, going to the soothsayers and asking them questions is not the same in all cases; rather it depends on the reason for going to them, as is indicated by other shar‘i texts.\nEnd quote from al-Qawl al-Mufeed (2/49).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:\nBut if he is asking him in order to test him and find out what he really is, and he (meaning the questioner) has sufficient knowledge to recognise when he is telling the truth and when he is lying, then this is permissible, as it is proven in as-Saheehayn that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) asked Ibn Sayyaad: “What comes to you?” He said: (Sometimes) a truthful one comes to me and (sometimes) a liar comes. He said: “What do you see?” He said: I see a throne on water. He said: “I am hiding something from you.” He said: (It is) ad-dukh, ad-dukh. He said: “Be off with you! You will never go beyond your rank. Rather you are one of the brethren of the soothsayers.”\nEnd quote from Fataawa Ibn Taymiyah (19/62).\nDenouncing these astrologers is something that is needed from those who are able to do it, by all possible means, whether that is on social media, YouTube or otherwise.\nBut if the Muslim thinks that denouncing them is just a drop in the ocean (and will not be noticed), and no one will pay attention to it and it will not achieve the desired results – as is usually the case with these pages – then what is prescribed is for him to not waste his time, and to protect his face by keeping away from these websites, because no interest can be served by going to these pages, and it is most likely that no one will benefit from what he says, there will not even be the benefit of establishing proof against them. Moreover, by his refraining, he will thwart the aim of these people to increase the number of followers, to have their webpages become more widely known, and to cost the ignorant to become confused and be tempted to join them because of the increased popularity of their pages.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, engaging with horoscope pages and channels, even with the intention of refuting them, is generally discouraged. This is because horoscopes are rooted in astrology, which is considered a form of divination and is prohibited (haram) in Islam. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) warned against seeking knowledge from such sources as it can lead to misunderstanding and may negatively impact one's faith.\n\nInstead of visiting those pages, it is more beneficial to seek knowledge from reliable Islamic sources and to focus on educating oneself and others about the beliefs and teachings of Islam. If one wishes to refute these ideas, it is better to do so by sharing authentic Islamic teachings and conditioning oneself with a strong foundation in the faith, rather than directly engaging with the sources of misinformation.\n\nIn conclusion, focusing on constructive knowledge and avoiding engagement with astrology and horoscopes would be the best course of action in this regard."

        "question": "Is it obligatory to entrust all our affairs to Allah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThese words that are attributed to Ja‘far as-Saadiq refer to the passage in which Allah, may He be exalted, tells us the story of the believer of the household of Pharaoh and what he said to his people:\n“ ‘And you will remember what I [now] say to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah. Indeed, Allah is Seeing of [His] servants.’\nSo Allah protected him from the evils they plotted, and the people of Pharaoh were enveloped by the worst of punishment”\n[Ghaafir 40:44-45].\nShaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words of Allah, may He be exalted, in this passage: “ ‘…and I entrust my affair to Allah. Indeed, Allah is Seeing of [His] servants.’ So Allah protected him from the evils they plotted” clearly indicate that sincerely relying on Allah and entrusting one’s affairs to Him are a means of being protected from all ills.\nThis verse indicates that Pharaoh and his people wanted to plot against this believer, and that Allah protected him and saved him from the harm of their plotting and scheming to cause trouble to him, because of his reliance upon Allah and his entrusting his affairs to Him.\nEnd quote from Adwa’ al-Bayaan (7/96-97).\nThis verse is like another verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Those to whom hypocrites said, ‘Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them.’ But it [merely] increased them in faith, and they said, ‘Sufficient for us is Allah , and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs.’\nSo they returned with favor from Allah and bounty, no harm having touched them. And they pursued the pleasure of Allah , and Allah is the possessor of great bounty”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:173-174].\nEntrusting one’s affairs to Allah, may He be exalted, means relying on Allah alone.\nAt-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words “and I entrust my affair to Allah” mean: I submit my affairs to Allah and leave them to Him, and I rely on Him, for He will suffice the one who puts his trust in Him.\nEnd quote from Tafseer at-Tabari (20/335).\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“and I entrust my affair to Allah” means: and I rely on Allah and seek His help.\nEnd quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer (7/146).\nSecondly:\nEntrusting one’s affairs to Allah, may He be exalted, and relying on Him is something that is required in all one’s affairs, both religious and worldly. This is enjoined in many texts, such as the following:\n“And upon Allah rely, if you should be believers”\n[al-Maa’idah 5:23]\n“…and rely upon Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:81]\n“And to Allah belong the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth and to Him will be returned the matter, all of it, so worship Him and rely upon Him. And your Lord is not unaware of that which you do”\n[Hood 11:123]\n“And rely upon the Ever-Living who does not die”\n[al-Furqaan 25:58].\nThe point is that entrusting one’s affairs to Allah with regard to raising children means relying on Allah, may He be exalted, and turning to Him to achieve this goal. Entrusting all one’s affairs to Him is something good and is something that one is required to do. Relying on Allah is one of the most important acts of worship.\nBut relying on Allah and entrusting one’s affairs to Him in the correct sense must be accompanied by taking permissible measures, as is indicated in the hadith of Anas ibn Maalik, who said: A man said: O Messenger of Allah, should I tie up [my camel] and rely on Allah, or should I leave it loose and rely on Him? He said: “Tie it up and rely [on Allah].”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (2517); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan at-Tirmidhi (2/610).\nAl-Mubaarakfoori (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the words “Tie it up”, it says in al-Qaamoos that tying up a camel means hobbling it by tying its foreleg up. “Rely” means rely on Allah after tying up the camel.\n“or leave it loose” means leaving it untied.\n“He said: ‘Tie it up…’” – al-Minnaawi said: That is, tie up your camel’s foreleg with a rope. “And rely” that is, depend on Allah. That is because tying it up is not contrary to relying on Allah.\nEnd quote from Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (7/186).\nThe one who truly relies on Allah takes the prescribed measures, especially if they are obligatory.\nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt should be understood that truly relying on Allah does not cancel out taking the measures by means of which Allah, may He be glorified, causes to happen what He has decreed; this is the way that Allah has ordained for His creation, for Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined us to take measures, yet he has also enjoined us to rely on Him. So striving to take measures is an act of obedience to Him, and relying in our hearts on Him is an act of faith in Him.\nMoreover, the deeds that a person does are of three types, one of which is:\nActs of obedience that Allah has enjoined upon His slaves and has made the means of salvation from hell and admittance to paradise. These deeds must be done whilst relying on Allah and seeking His help to do them, for there is no power and no strength except in Him; whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen.\nWhoever falls short in anything that Allah has enjoined upon him is deserving of punishment in this world and in the hereafter.\nEnd quote from Jaami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam (2/498-499).\nUpbringing of children must combine reliance upon Allah, may He be exalted, with taking of appropriate measures and using different valid approaches in child-rearing, as Allah has enjoined. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, over which are [appointed] angels, harsh and severe; they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded”\n[at-Tahreem 66:6].\nShaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe man is enjoined to instruct his family – such as his wife, children and so on – to do what is right and proper and forbid them to do what is wrong and evil, because Allah, may He be exalted, says “O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire…” And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd, and each of you is responsible for his flock…”\nEnd quote from Adwa’ al-Bayaan (2/209).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is highly encouraged for Muslims to entrust their affairs to Allah, a practice known as \"Tawakkul\" (توكلت على الله), which means reliance or trust in Allah. While complete and absolute reliance on Allah is a fundamental aspect of faith, it is not strictly obligatory in the sense that one would be sinful for not doing so. However, it is considered an essential quality of a believer. \n\nTawakkul involves a combination of trust in Allah's plan and taking appropriate actions in one's affairs. The Quran mentions this concept in several verses, emphasizing the importance of trusting Allah while also striving to fulfill one's responsibilities. For instance, in Surah Al-Imran (3:159), Allah commands believers to trust in Him after they have made their efforts.\n\nIn summary, while complete reliance on Allah is not deemed obligatory in a punitive sense, it is a key aspect of faith that believers are encouraged to practice, alongside taking the necessary steps to manage their worldly affairs."

        "question": "On the issue of whether ignorance is a valid excuse",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat is required of the Muslim is to understand and believe in Tawheed (the Oneness of Allah) and to follow the Qur’an and Sunnah according to the understanding of the righteous early generations (salaf), and to avoid innovation (bid‘ah) and its people. The Sufi tariqahs (paths) come under the heading of people of innovation, so the Muslim should keep away from their path and not follow in their footsteps.\nSecondly:\nIt is not permissible to take the issue of calling a Muslim a disbeliever (kaafir) or an evildoer (faasiq) lightly, because that comes under the heading of fabricating lies against Allah and fabricating lies against His Muslim slaves. It is not permissible to call a Muslim a disbeliever or an evildoer unless he commits that which would support that appellation in word or deed, based on clear evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah.\nMoreover, it is not permissible to call him a disbeliever or evildoer until all conditions required for calling him such are met, and all impediments to that are absent.\nOne of those conditions is that he should be aware that his words and practice contradict the teachings of Islam, which led to him becoming a disbeliever or evildoer.\nOne of the impediments to that is if he bases his action on a misinterpretation, or he may have some specious argument that he thinks provides evidence for his practice, or he is in such a situation that he cannot understand the shar‘i evidence in a proper manner. A person can only be deemed a disbeliever after there is certainty that he is deliberately going against the teachings of Islam and he is not ignorant of the issue.\nFor more information on the guidelines on whether or not a person may be deemed a disbeliever, please see the answer to question no. 85102.\nThirdly:\nThe correct view with regard to the issue of ignorance and whether ignorance is a valid excuse is that if a Muslim is proven to be a Muslim, he cannot be stripped of this description on the basis of mere doubt; rather he cannot be stripped of this description except on the basis of certainty and after establishing proof against him in such a way that leaves him with no excuse.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf we do not describe as a disbeliever one who worships the idol  on the grave of ‘Abd al-Qaadir or worships the idol on the grave of Ahmad al-Badawi [the “idols” in question are structures over the graves, to which some people devote practices that constitute worship], and the like, because of their ignorance and because there is no one who ever alerted them to their mistake, then how could we regard as a disbeliever one who never associated anything with Allah if he does not migrate to us, or if he does not regard others as disbelievers and fight them? “Exalted are You, [O Allah]; this is a great slander” [an-Noor 24:16].\nEnd quote from ad-Durar as-Saniyyah (1/104)\nit is well-established that basically these non-Arabs have grown up in countries and societies where ignorance of many of the rulings and teachings of Islam is the norm, especially with regard to issues having to do with the Sunnahs and also the foundations of Tawheed. Rather they believe in general terms, but are ignorant of many of the details.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding someone as a disbeliever is like a warning of hellfire, even if it is because the one who is so described is saying something that implies rejection of what the Messenger taught; that man may be new in Islam, or may be living in the wilderness, far from centres of teaching.\nSuch a person should not be deemed a disbeliever for something he rejected of the teachings of Islam until proof has been established in his case. A man may not have heard of some particular text, or he may have heard of it but it was not proven to him to be sound and correct, or he may have already some idea established in his mind that contradicts the text and so he misinterpreted the text.\nI always remember the hadith in as-Saheehayn about the man who said: “…When I die, burn me then crush (my bones), then scatter me in the wind and in the sea, for by Allah, if Allah grasps hold of me, He will punish me as He has never punished anyone. They did that to him, then He said to the land: Return what you have taken, and he was standing there. Then He said to him: What made you do what you did? He said: Fear of You, O Lord. And Allah forgave him because of that.”\nThis was a man who doubted the might of Allah, and doubted that He would be able to bring him back to life after his ashes were scattered; in fact he believed that he would not be resurrected, which constitutes disbelief according to the consensus of the Muslims. But he was ignorant and did not know that, yet he was a believer who feared that Allah would punish him, so Allah forgave him because of that.\nIf a person misinterprets a religious text when he is qualified to engage in ijtihad and is keen to follow the Messenger, it is more appropriate that he should be forgiven than someone like the person who is mentioned in the hadith.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (3/231).\nHe also said:\nMany people may grow up in places and times where there is not much left of knowledge of the revelations of Allah, to the extent that there is no one left who can teach others that with which Allah sent His Messenger of the Book and wisdom, so they do not know much of that with which Allah sent His Messenger, and there is no one there to teach them that. Such people cannot be deemed disbelievers. Therefore the leading scholars were unanimously agreed that whoever grew up in the wilderness, far away from people of knowledge and faith, and is new in Islam, if he rejects some of these well-known, mutawaatir rulings of Islam, he is not to be deemed a disbeliever until he learns the message with which the Messenger was sent.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (11/407).\nTheir merely knowing a translation of the meanings of the Qur’an is not enough; rather even if they are able to read it in Arabic, that is not enough. How many of those who speak Arabic and have some knowledge of the language still cannot understand from reading the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah that what they are doing is wrong or invalid, or whether it is shirk or not.\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Ghazaali said in his book at-Tafriqah bayna al-Eemaan wa’z-Zandaqah: What we must be very careful not to do is to call people disbelievers, and we should avoid that as much as possible, for the error in not labelling one thousand disbelievers as a disbelievers is less grave than the error of shedding the blood of one Muslim.\nEnd quote from Fat-h al-Baari (12/300).\nWhat the questioner in this case should do is strive to call his relatives and acquaintances by teaching them true Tawheed and Sunnah, and bearing with patience their offence, rejection and harshness. The greatest attitude that he can have towards people is as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And who is better in speech than one who invites to Allah and does righteousness and says, \"Indeed, I am of the Muslims’?\nAnd not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.\nBut none is granted it except those who are patient, and none is granted it except one having a great portion [of good].\nAnd if there comes to you from Satan an evil suggestion, then seek refuge in Allah . Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing”\n[Fussilat 41:33-36].\nSee also the answer to question no. 111362\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of ignorance (jahil) as an excuse for a person's actions is a nuanced topic. Generally, knowledge and intention play significant roles in determining the moral responsibility of an individual.\n\n1. **Accountability**: In Islamic teachings, individuals are held accountable for their actions based on their knowledge and intention. The Qur'an states that Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity (Qur'an 2:286). This suggests that if someone genuinely does not know a certain rule or obligation, they may not be held to the same level of accountability as someone who does know.\n\n2. **Obligatory Knowledge**: However, ignorance is not an excuse for actions that are clearly defined in the religion. For example, every Muslim is expected to seek knowledge about the basic tenets of the faith, such as the Five Pillars of Islam, the obligations of prayer, and prohibitions like theft or fornication. Failing to seek this knowledge may lead to accountability.\n\n3. **Sincere Ignorance**: In cases where a person genuinely does not have access to the necessary knowledge or has made a sincere effort to learn, they might be considered less culpable. Scholars emphasize the importance of intention. If someone commits a mistake while unaware of its nature, they may be forgiven upon repentance.\n\n4. **Repentance and Forgiveness**: In Islam, the door of repentance (Tawbah) is always open. If an individual recognizes their ignorance and repents sincerely, seeking forgiveness from Allah, they believe that Allah is Merciful and Forgiving.\n\nIn conclusion, while ignorance can mitigate accountability in some circumstances, it is essential for Muslims to pursue knowledge and understanding of their faith actively. Each case may be viewed differently based on the specific context and intention of the individual."

        "question": "Woman in Islam is for the purpose of building a life that is based on obedience to Allah, and is not to be looked at merely as a sexual object",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Our clear and spontaneous answer to your many questions is that it is not correct at all to say that woman was created only for physical purposes or to be a sexual object, and to be nothing but a source of pleasure for a man and an object for fulfilling his physical desires. This is not only a misconception; rather we see it as a devious understanding that is connected to the nafs that is inclined towards evil, and it is based on the desires that overwhelm the thinking of many people, and cause them to miss out on the true purpose of creation and life.\nHere we will work out our answer on the basis of the teachings of our religion, which we all follow, praise be to Allah, and we are certain that it is the perfect religion which tells us what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, wants from all people in terms of worship, righteous deeds, beliefs, and morals and manners.\nFrom the teachings of Islam we know that the main purpose behind the creation of humans and jinn, both male and female, is to attain soundness and well-being on the basis of free will and reason, because of which people are regarded as accountable, in all aspects of life – soundness of worship, soundness of deeds, soundness of morals and soundness of knowledge, understanding and concepts – and to attain the highest possible level of human perfection, as Islam calls us to attain the highest and most sublime in all things, and to avoid all forms of corruption, wrongdoing, ignorance and bad manners and deeds, by way of showing devotion to Allah, may He be exalted, and drawing closer to Him, and in an attempt to reach the highest possible level of human perfection, which Allah loves for us. Therefore we strive for it wholeheartedly, and this aim should become our main focus and concern, for the sake of which we spend all our lives and our money and physical energy, until we attain real, perfect life in in the hereafter, which is the true life, as the Qur’an tells us. With regard to this holistic principle, there is no differentiation between male and female at all.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)): ‘Truly, my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, a right religion, the religion of Ibrâhim (Abraham), Hanifa [i.e. the true Islâmic Monotheism - to believe in One God (Allâh i.e. to worship none but Allâh, Alone)] and he was not of Al-Mushrikûn.’\nSay (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)): ‘Verily, my Salât (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allâh, the Lord of the 'Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).\n‘He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims’”\n[al-An‘aam 6:161-163].\nI wonder where do you see physical desire – whether of males or females – in this religion and straight path; do you find any mention of it in any of the sublime aims mentioned in the passage quoted above?\nIf you think in a fair-minded manner, far removed from the social phobia that is caused by the misconceptions that people have in their minds, this will inevitably lead you to realise that the physical body – and all that is connected to it of shortcomings and desires – has no place in the list of objectives of man’s creation and the purpose of his existence. The purpose of the physical body comes under the heading of means and tools that could help one to achieve that objective, but it does not go beyond being a means, for it is not the only means; rather it is one of several means that may vary among people, in terms of power and ability, health and sickness. Therefore divine wisdom dictated that the body should be made a means of attraction, for the purpose of perpetuating the human race and populating the earth, and for the purpose of creating love and mercy in homes, and for the purpose of trials and tests, so that Allah may know who is a wrongdoer and who is righteous. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect”\n[ar-Room 30:21].\nBut if we examine all the verses of the Qur’an and all the hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), from beginning to end, we will not find a shred of evidence to suggest that the purpose of woman’s creation is to be a source of pleasure for man in this world and the hereafter. By the same token, we will not find a shred of evidence that differentiates between man and woman with regard to the sublime aims and great purpose behind their creation and existence. Rather they are all equal in that regard, because reason – which is the cause of being accountable and is the basis of man’s free will – is something that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has granted to both sexes, therefore both of them are included in all the religious texts which outline for humanity a path that leads to sublimity and happiness in this world and the hereafter. Similarly, if you reflect upon the Prophet’s biography – which represents the most sublime human model and the ultimate representation of the purpose of the creation of mankind – you would realise that the concept of the body cannot be taken out of its real framework, which is the framework of means, and the most sublime aims may be summed up as piety and righteous deeds.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allâh is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqûn (pious). Verily, Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Aware”\n[al-Hujuraat 49:13]\n“Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)”\n[an-Nahl 16:97]\n“Verily, the Muslims (those who submit to Allâh in Islâm) men and women, the believers men and women (who believe in Islâmic Monotheism), the men and the women who are obedient (to Allâh), the men and women who are truthful (in their speech and deeds), the men and the women who are patient (in performing all the duties which Allâh has ordered and in abstaining from all that Allâh has forbidden), the men and the women who are humble (before their Lord Allâh), the men and the women who give Sadaqât (i.e. Zakât, and alms), the men and the women who observe Saum (fast) (the obligatory fasting during the month of Ramadân, and the optional Nawâfil fasting), the men and the women who guard their chastity (from illegal sexual acts) and the men and the women who remember Allâh much with their hearts and tongues. Allâh has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise)”\n[al-Ahzaab 33:35]\n“The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden)”\n[at-Tawbah 9:71].\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not look at your (outward) forms and your wealth, rather He looks at your hearts and your deeds.”\nNarrated by Muslim (2564).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt should be understood that beauty may be divided into two categories: apparent and hidden.\nHidden beauty is that which is loved for what it is; it is the beauty of knowledge, reason, generosity, dignity and courage. This hidden beauty is what Allah likes to see when He looks at His slave, and it is the cause of His love for a person. This hidden beauty adorns the outward image of a person, even if that image does not possess beauty per se, so it gives the individual beauty, respect and sweetness commensurate with what his soul has of those characteristics. For the believer will be given respect and sweetness commensurate with his faith; then whoever sees him will respect him, and whoever mixes with him will like him. We see this with our own eyes. You may see a kind, righteous man who has a beautiful attitude as one of the most beautiful of people in appearance, even if he is not good-looking, especially if he is blessed with a share of qiyaam al-layl, for it gives light to the face and makes it handsome.\nEnd quote from Rawdat al-Muhibbeen (221-223).\nAmong the most well-known proofs which demonstrate that the body is not the basis on which a woman’s personality is measured is the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “Women may be married for four things: their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4802) and Muslim (1466).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe correct view concerning the meaning of this hadith is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was speaking of what people usually do. They seek these four characteristics, and the lowest of them in priority, in their view, is religious commitment. So the one who is seeking advice concerning marriage should look for the one who is religiously committed.\nEnd quote from Sharh Muslim (10/52).",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the status and role of women are regarded with great respect and dignity. Women are seen as vital participants in the moral and spiritual development of society. The teachings of Islam emphasize that both men and women are created equal in their rights and responsibilities, and both are accountable to Allah for their actions.\n\nThe primary purpose of life for both men and women is to worship Allah and to build a life that fulfills that purpose. This includes establishing families, contributing to the community, and promoting values such as justice, compassion, and kindness. Women are encouraged to seek knowledge, engage in their communities, and pursue their personal and spiritual development.\n\nIt is important to understand that reducing women to mere objects is contrary to Islamic teachings, which promote the idea of mutual respect, love, and partnership between men and women. Women have rights over their own bodies, dignity, and personal autonomy in Islam, and any interpretation that objectifies women fails to align with the core principles of justice and respect found in Islamic teachings. \n\nTherefore, the relationship between men and women in Islam should be rooted in respect, cooperation, and a shared commitment to obeying and worshipping Allah."

        "question": "“The Secret” and “The Law of Attraction”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The book The Secret was written by an Australian TV producer called Rhonda Byrne, who belongs to the New Thought movement, whose followers believe in a number of metaphysical principles that have to do with healing and self-development, and how a thought may have an impact on the physical world. This book, The Secret, speaks of these concepts and promotes them according to the principles of this movement. As you said, the book is popular throughout the world and has recently been translated into Arabic. After examining the book and reflecting on its contents, it becomes clear that it contains a number of seriously deviant ideas concerning matters of belief and scientific matters, the most serious of which are the following:\n-1-\nThe book promotes the idea of giving up striving and not paying attention to taking measures to attain goals; rather it suggests relying on wishful thinking and dreams. That is in accordance with the so-called law of attraction, which states that like attracts like, and that whatever happens to you in your life, you are the one who attracted it to your life, and it was attracted to you because of images stored in your mind, namely the things that you were thinking of. Whatever you think of, you will attract it to you. The people who follow this principle believe that the idea in a person’s mind has an impact in and of itself on the person’s environment and surroundings, and that by means of his abstract thoughts, he may attract to himself whatever he wants of good things, without striving. They claim that thoughts have vibrations, and that these vibrations emanate from a person’s mind to the outside world in the form of electromagnetic waves, and that these thoughts can attract whatever exists in the universe of good and evil that is on the same wavelength. So if you are thinking positively, you are sending out waves with positive vibrations that will attract positive things to you. If you are thinking negative thoughts, then you are sending out waves with negative vibrations that will attract negative things to you. Undoubtedly these ideas are contrary to empirical science and common sense, and believing in them and acting upon them is contrary to Islamic teachings.\nAs for being contrary to Islamic teachings, that is because Allah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to work and strive in this world, and He has connected provision to taking measures and using available means, not to wishful thinking and illusions. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“He it is, Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e. easy for you to walk, to live and to do agriculture on it), so walk in the path thereof and eat of His provision”\n[al-Mulk 67:15].\nWith regard to it being contrary to common sense, that is because relying on wishful thinking and dreams will lead to the ruin of the world and to corruption of that which is of benefit to people and in their interests, and it will lead to casting aside all that humanity has achieved throughout the centuries of knowledge, science and civilisation. That is because, according to this theory, the sick person does not need to seek medical treatment, and people do not need engineers, builders and workers. All that the one who needs something has to do is think positive thoughts of what he wants, then ask the universe – Allah forbid – to fulfil his desire without him making any effort.\nThose who follow this movement contradict themselves when they tell the sick person who is about to die, “Don’t stop seeking medical treatment.” Otherwise, what their idea implies is that one should stop seeking medical treatment, and hospitals should be shut down, and medical schools should be turned into meditation centres where people can relax and develop wishful thinking and dreams, or what they call positive thinking – and so on and so forth in all other fields. Thus it becomes clear that this movement is contrary to common sense and contrary to what is visible of real life experience. People cannot build sound lives on the basis of such an idea.\nThe poet spoke the truth when he said:\nIf I developed wishful thinking, I could sleep all night happily, but wishful thinking is the capital of the penniless.\n-2-\nThe book goes to extremes in venerating man and bestowing upon him a halo of sanctity and greatness, as it expresses the belief that man possesses unlimited powers and huge energy, to the point that he has the power to create. So everything that happens to man, good or bad, is his own creation. The book says, for example: “Anything we focus our mind on, we can create it” (p. 141). Undoubtedly this is a serious deviation and is ascribing partners to Allah, may He be exalted, in His Lordship. Allah, may He be exalted, spoke the truth (interpretation of the meaning): “Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped)” [al-Baqarah 2:22].\n-3-\nThe book promotes belief in pantheism, which is false, by saying that the Creator and His creation are one and the same, and that that man is God in physical form – exalted be Allah far above that. This idea is reiterated and expressed in many different ways in the book.\n-4-\nThe book supports a number of Eastern beliefs and idolatrous philosophies, such as Buddhism, Hinduism and so on. We have seen how the followers of these religions celebrated this book, The Secret, because it spread and promoted the principles of their religions.\n-5-\nThe book promotes the idea of focusing on the universe in order to achieve one’s wants and desires. So if you want something, all you have to do is direct your request to the universe, and the universe will inevitably respond to your request. Islam, on the other hand, calls people to focus on Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, for it is to Him that one should turn and ask for what one needs. Turning to anyone or anything else in matters over which only Allah, may He be glorified, has power constitutes shirk – Allah forbid.\n-6-\nThe book contradicts belief in the divine will and decree, as it denies that God has foreordained the decrees of His creation and that He decided everything before it happens. The book is in harmony with the view of the extreme Qadaris who denied the divine will and decree, as it says that whatever happens in the universe is not part of God’s knowledge before it happens, and it is not already written and decreed. Undoubtedly belief in the divine will and decree is one of the pillars of faith, without which a person’s faith cannot be valid.\n-7-\nThe book promotes selfishness and egocentricity, and calls people to cast aside all Islamic teachings and moral guidelines, and to pursue the desires and pleasures of the nafs, so the criterion for deciding whether or not to go ahead with something is how much it may bring of joy and pleasure, and how much one likes it. So whatever a person likes, let him do it, and whatever he dislikes, let him avoid it, without paying any attention to morals or religious teachings. Undoubtedly this is contrary to Islamic and moral values, for the Muslim is bound by a religious and moral framework, and cannot go beyond it. What Allah has enjoined is obligatory, what He has forbidden is prohibited, and what He has permitted is permissible. What the Muslim must do is adhere to the rulings of sharee‘ah and Islam.\nThese are some of the deviant ideas contained in this book. Therefore you should avoid it. Anyone who would like to know more details about the reality of this book and the extent of the deviant ideas that it contains may refer to a research paper entitled Khuraafat as-Sirr: Qiraa’ah Tahleeliyyah li Kitaab as-Sirr wa Qanoon al-Jadhab (The Myth of the Secret: an Analytical Reading of the Book The Secret and the Law of Attraction).\n[ends].",
        "predicted_answer": "\"The Secret\" is a popular book and film that discusses the concept of the \"Law of Attraction,\" which suggests that individuals can attract positive or negative experiences into their lives through their thoughts and beliefs. This idea posits that by focusing on positive thoughts and visualizing desired outcomes, one can manifest those outcomes in reality.\n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, it's important to understand that while the intention and positive thinking are encouraged in Islam, the belief that one can manifest their desires solely through thought can be misleading. In Islam, ultimate control over events and outcomes is in the hands of Allah (God). Muslims are encouraged to have faith in Allah's wisdom and to make du'a (supplication), putting in effort while trusting in Allah's plan.\n\nThe Islamic teachings emphasize the importance of relying on Allah, performing good deeds, and having a positive mindset, rather than solely focusing on thought as a means of attracting outcomes. It is also essential to balance one's aspirations with the understanding that not all desires are guaranteed, and what may seem good may not always be beneficial in the long term.\n\nIn summary, while positivity and intention are valuable, it is crucial to maintain faith in Allah and acknowledge that He ultimately decides what is best for each individual."

        "question": "What is the ruling on wearing a cross in order to conceal one’s identity in the airport?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly:\n\n\tThe cross is one \n\tof the obvious symbols of disbelief, as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy \n\ton him) said in Ahkaam Ahl adh-Dhimmah (3/1240). Therefore there was \n\tno difference of opinion among the scholars that it is prohibited to wear \n\tit.\n\n\tIt says in \n\tal-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (12/88): It is not permissible \n\tfor the Muslim to make a cross and it is not permissible for him to issue \n\tinstructions for a cross to be made. What is meant is making a cross that is \n\tsymbolic of the crucifixion, and he should not keep it, whether he wears it \n\tor sets it up, or he does neither.\n\n\tMany of the \n\tscholars have clearly stated that the one who does that is a disbeliever.\n\t\n\n\tIt says in \n\tal-Fataawa al-Hindiyyah, one of the books of the Hanafi madhhab (2/276): \n\tA person becomes a disbeliever if he puts a Zoroastrian cap on his head, \n\taccording to the correct view, except in the case of necessity to protect \n\thimself from heat or cold; or if he puts a zunnaar [a kind of belt that was \n\tworn by non-Muslims in the past] around his waist, unless he does that by \n\tway of deceit at a time of war or he is acting as a scout ahead of the \n\tMuslim army. End quote.\n\n\tIt says in Majma‘ \n\tal-Anhur fi Sharh Multaqa al-Abhur, which is also a Hanafi book (1/698): A \n\tperson becomes a disbeliever if he puts a Zoroastrian cap on his head, \n\taccording to the correct view, except if it is  for the purpose of freeing a \n\tMuslim prisoner or it is a case of necessity to protect himself from heat or \n\tcold, according to some scholars. End quote.\n\n\tAl-Qaadi ‘Iyaad \n\tsaid: Similarly, we regard as a disbeliever anyone who does any action that \n\tthe Muslims are unanimously agreed can only come from a disbeliever, even if \n\tthe one who does it openly professes Islam, yet he does that action…\n\n\t… Such as \n\tprostrating to an idol, or to the sun or moon, or to a cross, or to fire, or \n\tgoing to churches and synagogues with their congregations, or wearing their \n\tgarments, such as wearing their zunnaar (distinctive belts) or cutting the \n\thair in the style of a monk (tonsure).\n\n\tThe Muslims are \n\tunanimously agreed that such things are only done by a disbeliever, and that \n\tthese actions are symbols of disbelief, even if the one who does them openly \n\tprofesses Islam.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tash-Shifa bi Ta‘reef Huqooq al-Mustafa – Mahdhoof al-Asaaneed \n\t(2/611). \n\n\tThe scholars of \n\tthe Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked about the ruling on \n\twearing a cross and they replied:\n\n\tIf the ruling on \n\twearing a cross is explained to him, and he is told that it is a symbol of \n\tthe Christians and is an indication that the wearer is content to be \n\tregarded as one of them and that he is content with what they believe in, \n\tyet he persists in that, he is to be deemed a disbeliever, because Allah, \n\tmay He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t“O \n\tyou who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, \n\tprotectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst \n\tyou takes them (as Auliyâ’), then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh \n\tguides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and \n\tunjust)”\n\n\t[al-Maa’idah \n\t5:51].\n\n\tIf zulm \n\t(wrongdoing) is mentioned in general terms, then what is meant is major \n\tshirk and by doing that he is indicating that he agrees with the Christians \n\tin their claim that ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) was killed, but Allah, may He \n\tbe glorified, has denied that in His book, where He says (interpretation of \n\tthe meaning):\n\n\t“but \n\tthey killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of 'Īsā (Jesus) \n\twas put over another man (and they killed that man)”\n\n\t[an-Nisaa’ \n\t4:157].\n\n\tShaykh ‘Abd \n\tar-Rahmaan al-Barraak (may Allah preserve him) said: The cross is well-known \n\tto be the idol of the Christians in their churches and in their homes, and \n\tthey wear it around their necks and on their chests. Hence it is the symbol \n\tof Christianity, and it is prohibited for the Muslim to wear it.\n\n\tIf a Muslim \n\twears it in order to appear to be a Christian, then this is a way of \n\texpressing his approval of the Christians in their religion, and approving \n\tof the Christians in their religion constitutes disbelief in Allah, except \n\tin the case of one who fears for his life, in which case he is regarded as \n\tbeing under compulsion, and Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation \n\tof the meaning):\n\n\t“Whoever \n\tdisbelieved in Allâh after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and \n\twhose heart is at rest with Faith…”\n\n\t[an-Nahl 16:106].\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tone who wears a cross out of ignorance, then he is excused because of his \n\tignorance.\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tone who wears it to please the Christians, that is prohibited and there is \n\tthe fear that it may come under the heading of disbelief in Allah… What the \n\tMuslim must do is beware of that which Allah has prohibited. There is no \n\tdoubt that it is one of the most serious kinds of imitating the \n\tdisbelievers, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n\tsaid: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Narrated by Abu Dawood \n\t(4031). So what he must do is beware of that, and we ask Allah to keep us \n\tsafe and sound. And Allah knows best. End quote.\n\n\thttp://ar.islamway.net/fatwa/8605\n\n\tBased on that, \n\tif the Muslim referred to in the question was compelled to do this, in the \n\tsense that he feared that he might be killed or imprisoned if he did not do \n\tthat, then there is no blame on him in sha Allah, so long as when he did \n\tthat his heart was at rest with faith.\n\n\tBut if the \n\tsituation has not reached the point of compulsion and having no other \n\tchoice, then it is not permissible for him to do that.\n\n\tIt is essential \n\tto differentiate between the situation of one who has been compelled to flee \n\tfrom his country and the situation of one who is compelled to wear a cross. \n\tHe may have been compelled to flee from his country in order to escape being \n\tkilled or imprisoned, but wearing a cross is not something that he is forced \n\tto do, because even if he did not wear it, he would not be subjected to \n\tkilling, imprisonment and the like.\n\n\tThis is a matter \n\tconcerning which one should be careful and understand the case of necessity \n\tin which such concessions are granted, and cases in which there is no such \n\tnecessity.\n\n\tMoreover, if he \n\tis patient and does not make an outward show of symbols of disbelief, or \n\tutter words of disbelief, this is better, even if he does fear for his life.\n\n\tMaking an \n\toutward show of symbols of disbelief in the case of necessity which makes \n\tsuch things permissible is a concession that is granted and there is no \n\tobligation to avail oneself of it; rather firm resolve is better than that.\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tfleeing for the sake of one’s religious commitment and one’s life, for fear \n\tof fitnah (persecution) or death, this is something that is prescribed in \n\tIslam and is either recommended or obligatory, according to the situation.\n\n\tAnd Allah knows \n\tbest.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, wearing symbols of other faiths, such as a cross, is a sensitive issue and can be viewed differently depending on the intention behind it and the context. \n\nThe general principle in Islam is that one should not wear symbols or items that indicate allegiance to beliefs contrary to Islam, particularly if it compromises one's Islamic identity. Wearing a cross specifically to conceal one's identity could be perceived as a form of dissimulation (taqiyyah), which is permissible in certain situations, such as to protect oneself from harm or persecution.\n\nHowever, it's essential to differentiate between situations of necessity and those of mere convenience. If a situation arises where one is in genuine danger or at risk of harm, scholars have differing opinions, but many would argue that it might be permissible as a means of protection.\n\nUltimately, the best approach is to seek alternatives that allow one to maintain their Islamic identity, such as revealing the truth of one's faith while taking necessary precautions for safety without compromising one's beliefs. Consulting with a knowledgeable scholar or authority who understands the context is also advisable in such situations."

        "question": "Guidelines on forms of the cross that are prohibited",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Making crosses, buying them, or weaving them into garments or putting them on walls, and so on come under the heading of prohibited actions that it is not permissible for the Muslim to commit. So he should not make them himself or help anyone else in doing that; rather he should fear Allah, may He be exalted, and avoid the symbols of disbelief that the Christians have fabricated in their religion.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is not permissible to make crosses, whether for payment or otherwise, or to sell crosses, just as it is not permissible to sell or make idols, as it is proven in as-Saheeh that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Verily Allah has forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat [that which is not slaughtered in the prescribed manner], pork and idols.” End quote.\nMajmoo‘ al-Fataawa (22/141). See also: al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (12/84-88)\nSecondly:\nThe cross has many forms and types, that vary according to time and place, among various Christian sects. It takes many forms, which you can see on the following link:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross\nWhat appears to us to be the case with regard to the ruling on drawing or wearing these types and forms of crosses is the following:\n1.\nIf it is drawn on the basis that it is a cross, it is not permissible for the Muslim to carry it, wear it, buy it, sell it or draw it, because the reason for the prohibition on drawing or wearing crosses is to avoid imitating the Christians and venerating their false religious symbols. This reason is applicable to all forms of the cross that are known to various Christian sects, if it is made on the basis that it is a cross so that it may be venerated and taken as a symbol for whatever they want.\n2.\nIf it is drawn as a kind of decoration, or some household items and utensils are manufactured and happen to have one of the kinds of crosses mentioned above on them, then it depends:\n(a) If it is obvious at first glance that it is the kind of cross that is well known today, as it appears in the majority of churches and among most Christians, and it is composed of two lines, one of which is vertical and the other is horizontal, and the horizontal line intersects with the vertical line, and the upper portion is shorter than the lower portion, which is the most famous form of the cross since it was adopted by the Christians, based on the wooden apparatus on which those who were to be executed were crucified – if it appears at first glance to be like this, then it must be removed or altered so that it no longer looks like a cross. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would not leave anything in his house on which there were crosses but he would alter them.\n(b) But if the shape of the cross is not obvious, and it is only part of the design and is unintentional, or if the designer of a structure decided that crossed lines were more appropriate, or it is used as a mathematical symbol, such as the plus sign and multiplication sign in arithmetic, then in this case it does not have to be altered or removed, and there is nothing wrong with making it or selling anything that contains it, because the reason for prohibition – which is imitating the disbelievers and venerating their symbols – is not present in this case, and the symbol of the cross in this case is subtle and is not noticeable.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nFirstly: it is essential to determine whether this is a cross, because there are some things that some people think are crosses, when in fact they are not.\nSecondly: we should determine whether it has been made because it is a cross, and not because it is a design on a garment, for example, because the Christians venerate the cross, so it is not possible that they would make it a decorative feature on a garment; rather they would treat it with respect.\nIt is essential to note these two points, then if we determine that it is indeed a cross, then it is obligatory, or at least Sunnah, to cut it up, and we should boycott these garments on which there are crosses, because if we boycott them and the traders do not benefit from them, they will also boycott them.\nSomething similar may be said regarding the six-pointed star which is said to be the symbol of the Jews; it comes under the same ruling as the cross, even though the Jews do not take it for worship, because it is something that is unique to them.\nWe asked some Christians who became Muslim about it (i.e., the cross) and they said: In our view the cross is the well-known cross, composed of two lines, one of which is horizontal and the other is vertical, and the vertical line is longer than the other.\nWe even asked them about the watch that they call the cross watch, and they said: This is not meant to be a cross; it is only the trademark of the company, because what they say about the Christian cross is that it is a long vertical line intersected by a horizontal line, and one part of the vertical line is longer than the other. And this reflects reality, because when a person was crucified, a piece of wood was placed horizontally so that his arms could be tied to it, so how could the piece of wood for his arms be placed halfway down the vertical piece? Rather it should be higher up. Hence we have our doubts about what was published two years ago which showed various forms and said that they were all crosses! Moreover, is the plus sign (+) a cross? It is not a cross.\nSimilarly, in times past there was the bucket with which water would be brought up from the well, which was attached by a rope to a structure composed of two pieces of wood, one horizontal and the other vertical. Such things do not come under the heading of crosses.\nWhat is regarded as a cross is that which is made on the basis that it is a cross. End quote.\nLiqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh (no. 21, question no. 7)\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\nAs for that which is obviously not intended to be a cross, so it is not venerated and is not a religious symbol, such as some mathematical signs, or what is seen on some electronic wristwatches of plus signs, there is nothing wrong with this, and it is not regarded as being a cross at all. End quote.\nMajmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (vol. 18, 114, 115, answer to question no. 9)\nIn Liqaa’aat al-Baab al-Maftooh (no. 199, question no. 9) he (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nI came across a building in one of our cities, and this building has windows in the shape of crosses; every window has this shape, and the building is ten stories high. It is very similar to the buildings designed by Westerners.\nHe replied:\nActually we need to go and see the building you are talking about. Not everything that appears in the shape of a cross is a cross, otherwise this will lead us to say that the plus sign is haraam, or in the West, where the people used to irrigate their land by drawing water from a well, at the top of which there were two intersecting pieces of wood, we would say that this is haraam! The cross has a specific shape, and other indications that it is really a cross, so we need to actually see the building you are talking about. End quote.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, any form of the cross is generally viewed with disapproval, primarily due to its association with Christianity and the belief in Tawheed (the oneness of God) in Islam. While specific rulings might vary among different scholars and schools of thought, there are some general guidelines regarding the forms of the cross that are considered prohibited.\n\n1. **Creation of Crosses**: Creating images or representations of the cross is typically discouraged. This includes both physical representations and drawings, as they may be seen as promoting beliefs that are contrary to Islamic teachings.\n\n2. **Wearing Symbols**: Wearing jewelry or clothing that displays the cross is usually considered inappropriate for Muslims, as it can signify a belief or association with non-Islamic ideologies.\n\n3. **Usage in Decoration**: Decorating spaces with crosses or any symbols associated with other faiths can also be frowned upon, as Muslims are encouraged to maintain a space that reflects Islamic values and principles.\n\n4. **Acts of Worship**: Performing acts of worship or rituals that incorporate the cross or its symbolism is strictly prohibited, as it contradicts the Islamic concept of monotheism.\n\nScholars often emphasize the importance of respecting other religions while maintaining a clear distinction in symbols and practices that represent Islamic faith. If you have a specific context or situation in mind, it's always best to consult a qualified scholar for more personalized guidance."

        "question": "He apostatised during the day in Ramadan then he came back to Islam – what must he do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Being Muslim is one of the essential conditions for the validity and acceptance of acts of worship. \nOne of the indications of that is the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say: ‘Spend (in Allah’s Cause) willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. Verily, you are ever a people who are Fasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).’\nAnd nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)); and that they came not to As-Salat (the prayer) except in a lazy state; and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly”\n[at-Tawbah 9:53-54]. \nThis verse clearly shows that the condition of an act of worship being accepted is faith, without which it is not valid. \nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words “Say: ‘Spend (in Allah’s Cause) willingly or unwillingly” mean: No matter what you spend, willingly or unwillingly, “it will not be accepted from you. Verily, you are ever a people who are Fasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).” \nThen Allah, may He be exalted, tells us of the reason for that, which is that it will never be accepted from them, is “that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)” that is, they have disbelieved, and deeds are only valid when accompanied by faith.\nEnd quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer (4/162). \nWhoever disbelieves and apostatises during his fast has rendered his fast invalid. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWe do not know of any difference of opinion among the scholars concerning the fact that the one who apostatises from Islam whilst fasting invalidates his fast, and he must make up that day when he comes back to Islam, whether he becomes Muslim again during the day or after the day has ended, and whether his apostasy had to do with some belief that he held, that constituted disbelief (kufr), or doubting a belief where doubting that belief constitutes disbelief (kufr), or because he spoke words of disbelief, either by way of mockery or otherwise. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“If you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: ‘Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that you were mocking?’\nMake no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimoon (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.)”\n[at-Tawbah 9:65-66]. \nEnd quote from al-Mughni (4/369-370) \nWith regard to expiation, we have previously explained in fatwa no. 106476 that it is not required except in the case of one who spoils the Ramadan fast by having intercourse only. As for all other things that break the fast, nothing is required except making up that day only. \nBased on that, this man has to make up one day in place of the day that he spoiled, and he does not have to offer expiation. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, if a person who has apostatized (left the faith) returns to Islam, they must sincerely repent and reaffirm their faith. When it comes to a specific situation such as apostasy during the day in Ramadan, there are particular considerations:\n\n1. **Repentance**: The individual should sincerely repent to Allah for their apostasy. This involves feeling remorse for leaving Islam, stopping any actions that contradict the faith, and reaffirming their belief in the oneness of Allah and the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n2. **Fasting**: Since the individual apostatized during the day in Ramadan and then returned to Islam, they must make up for the fast of that day. Fasting during Ramadan is obligatory for Muslims, and breaking the fast without a valid reason requires making up for that day.\n\n3. **Reaffirmation**: The individual should verbally declare their faith (Shahada) again to publicly confirm their return to Islam.\n\n4. **Further Actions**: It is also recommended to seek knowledge, engage in acts of worship, and strive to strengthen one's faith.\n\nEach case can differ based on individual circumstances, so it may be advisable for the person to consult a knowledgeable scholar or local cleric for guidance tailored to their situation."

        "question": "What Is the Evidence that Islam Is True?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Evidence for the validity of Islam\nThe evidence for the validity of Islam and the truthfulness of the Prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is abundant and can hardly be enumerated. This evidence is sufficient to convince any wise and fair-minded person who is impartially and sincerely seeking the truth. We can sum up some of this proof as follows. \nThe evidence of sound human nature\nThe call of Islam is in accordance with sound human nature, as is indicated by the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n“So set you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) turn your face towards the religion of pure Islamic Monotheism Hanifa (worship none but Allah Alone) Allah’s Fitrah (i.e. Allah’s Islamic Monotheism), with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in Khalqillah (i.e. the Religion of Allah Islamic Monotheism), that is the straight religion, but most of men know not” [ar-Rum 30:30]. \nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no child who is not born in a state of fitrah, then his parents make him a Jew or a Christian or a Magian, just as animals bring forth animals with their limbs intact, do you see any deformed one among them?” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1358) and Muslim (2658). \nThe words “animals bring forth animals with their limbs intact” mean: just as an animal is born with its limbs intact and free of defects; anything that happens to it of cuts to its ears and so on happens after it is born. \nSimilarly, every human is born with an inherent inclination towards Islam, and any deviation from Islam is undoubtedly a departure from sound human nature. Therefore, we never find anything in the teachings of Islam that is contrary to sound human nature. Rather all of its teachings on beliefs and practical matters are in accordance with sound human nature. As for religions and ideologies other than Islam, they include things that are contrary to sound human nature. This is something that is quite clear and apparent to anyone who reflects and ponders. \nRational evidence\nThere are many Islamic texts that address reason and direct people to examine the rational proof and evidence, and call upon people of sound reasoning and mature thinking to examine the definitive evidence for the soundness of Islam. \nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember” [Saad 38:29]. \nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad said concerning the miraculous aspects of the Quran:\n“In it you will see that there is an explanation of a set of divine laws; it mentions the way of proof based on reason, presents arguments against the misguided followers of different religions and sects, and argues against them on the basis of strong and clear proof, using very easy and concise language. Those who pretend to be clever tried to come up with proof and evidence like that, but they were not able to do so.” (Ash-Shifa (1/390) \nThe texts of the revelation do not contain anything that is impossible according to rational thinking or that would be rejected by reason, and the texts never presented an argument that contradicts reason or contradicts any analogy based on rational thinking. Rather the proponents of falsehood never presented any analogy to support their falsehood but the Quran refuted it on the basis of truth and an argument that is based on clear reason. \nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And no example or similitude do they bring (to oppose or to find fault in you or in this Quran), but We reveal to you the truth (against that similitude or example), and the better explanation thereof” [al-Furqan 25:33].                            \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Here Allah, may He be glorified, tells us that the disbelievers do not produce any rational argument to support their falsehood but He refutes it on the basis of truth, and presents arguments and evidence and examples that offer a better explanation thereof, are more convincing and give a clearer explanation of the truth than their argument and analogy.” (Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (4/106) \nOne of the examples of rational evidence in the Quran is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Do they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction” [an-Nisa 4:82]. \nIn Tafsir al-Qurtubi it says:\n“There is no one who speaks a great deal but you will find a lot of contradictions in his words, either in the presentation and wording, or in the meaning, or you will find discrepancies, or there will be untruths. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sent down the Quran and instructed them to reflect on it, because they will not find in it any discrepancies in the presentation of ideas, or any flaws in what it promotes, or any contradiction, or any lies in what they are told of matters of the unseen and what they conceal.” (Al-Jami‘ li Ahkam al-Quran (5/290) \nIbn Kathir said:\n“That is, if it were fabricated and made up, as the ignorant polytheists and hypocrites said to themselves, “they would surely have found therein much contradiction” that is, many flaws and discrepancies. In other words, this Book is free of discrepancies and contradictions, therefore it is from Allah.” (Tafsir al-Quran al-‘Azim (1/802) \nMiracles and signs of Prophethood\nAllah, may He be exalted, supported His noble Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with numerous miracles and tangible signs that pointed to the truthfulness of his Prophethood and the soundness of his message, such as the splitting of the moon for him, the glorification of Allah by food and pebbles in front of him, the springing forth of water from between his fingers, the increasing of food, and other miracles and signs that were seen and witnessed by huge numbers of people, and have been transmitted to us via sahih isnads (sound chains of narration) that reach the level of tawatur. This gives rise to certainty. \nAn example of that is that which is narrated in a sahih report from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud, that he said: We were with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a journey and our supply of water ran low. He said: “Bring me a little leftover water.” So they brought a vessel in which there was a little water. He put his hand in the vessel, then said: “Come to a blessed, purifying water; and the blessing is from Allah.” And I saw the water springing from between the fingers of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). And we used to hear the food glorifying Allah as it was being eaten. (Narrated by al-Bukhari (3579) \nProphecies\nWhat is meant by prophecies here is what the revelation foretold of matters and events that would happen in the future, whether that was during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or after his death. \nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never foretold anything that would happen in the future, but it would happen exactly as he foretold. This indicates that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, had revealed and disclosed to him some matters of unseen knowledge that could not be attained except by means of revelation. \nOne example of that is the report narrated by Abu Hurayrah, that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until a fire emerges in the land of the Hijaz which will illuminate the necks of the camels in Busra.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (7118) and Muslim (2902)\nAnd it happened exactly as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had foretold, in 654 AH – approximately 644 years after his death. This was mentioned by historians, including al-‘Allamah Abu Shamah al-Maqdisi, in his book Dhayl ar-Rawdatayn. He was one of the scholars who lived at the time of this historical incident. \nIt was also mentioned by al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir in al-Bidayah wa'an-Nihayah (13/219), where he said: Then the year 654 AH began, in which there appeared fire in the land of the Hijaz by which the necks of the camels in Busra were illuminated, as it says in the agreed-upon hadith. Shaykh al-‘Allamah al-Hafiz Shihab ad-Din Abu Shamah al-Maqdisi spoke at length about that in his adh-Dhayl wa Sharhuhu, based on many letters that came to Damascus from the Hijaz, describing that fire that had been witnessed and seen, and how it emerged, and the story thereof. \nTo sum up what Abu Shamah said:\nLetters came to Damascus from the Prophet’s City – may the best of blessings and peace be upon its inhabitant – speaking of the emergence of a fire in their land on 5\nth Jumada al-Akhirah this year. The letters were written on 5th Rajab, when the fire was still burning, and they reached us on 10th Sha‘ban. Then he said: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. At the beginning of Sha‘ban 654 AH, letters came to the city of Damascus from the city of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) describing a significant event that occurred there, in which there was confirmation of the hadith of Abu Hurayrah in as-Sahihayn, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until a fire emerges in the land of the Hijaz which will illuminate the necks of the camels in Busra.” Someone whom I trust from among those who saw it told me that he heard that in Tayma letters had been written by its light. \nHe said: We were in our houses during those nights, and in the house of each one of us it was as if there was a lamp, but it had no heat and did not burn, despite its greatness; rather it was one of the signs of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.”\nQualities and attributes of Prophet Muhammad\nOne of the greatest proofs of the truthfulness of the Prophethood of the Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is his own character and the noble attributes and great manners with which he was blessed, for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reached a level of human perfection in terms of good characteristics and attitudes that could only be attained by a Prophet who was sent from Allah. \nThere is no praiseworthy characteristic but he promoted it, enjoined it, encouraged it and acted in accordance with it; and there is no blameworthy characteristic but he forbade it, warned against it and was the furthest removed of all people from it. \nHis concern for good manners and attitudes reached such an extent that he gave as the reason for his mission the promotion of good attitudes and manners and striving against bad manners and attitudes. In the hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), it tells us that he said: “I have only been sent to perfect good manners and attitudes.”  (Narrated by Ahmad (8739). Al-Haythami said in al-Majma‘: It was narrated by Ahmad and its men are the men of as-Sahih. \nAl-'Ajlouni classed its isnad as sahih in Kashf al-Khafa. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘ (2349) \nMiracles are indicative of the truthfulness of the Messenger. He told the people that he had been sent by Allah, may He be exalted, and some of them challenged him to prove that. So Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, supported him with miracles, which are extraordinary events. And he was also granted miracles without anybody challenging him or claiming that he was lying, which served to increase his followers in steadfastness. \nThe essence of the call of Prophet Muhammad\nThe basis of the call of the noble Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) may be summed up as the aim to build sound beliefs on a sound textual and rational foundation. It is a call to believe in Allah and affirm His oneness in terms of His divinity and lordship. None is deserving of worship except one God, namely Allah, may He be glorified, for He is the Lord, Creator and Sovereign of this universe, Who controls it and disposes of its affairs; He governs it by His command, and is the One Who possesses the power to cause harm or bring benefit, and Who controls the provision of all creatures – and no one has any share of that with Him. Nothing is equal or like unto Him, so He, may He be glorified, is far above having any partners, rivals, peers or equals. \nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)): ‘He is Allah, (the) One. ‘Allah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks). ‘He begets not, nor was He begotten; ‘And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him’” [al-Ikhlas 112:1-4]\n“Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)): ‘I am only a man like you. It has been inspired to me that your Ilah (God) is One Ilah (God i.e. Allah). So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord '' [al-Kahf 18:110]. \nThe call of the noble Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was a call to destroy shirk of all kinds and to rid the two races (of mankind and the jinn) of everything that was worshipped on a basis of falsehood. So there is to be no worship of rocks, stars and graves, or of wealth, whims and desires, or the tyrannical rulers of the earth. \nRather it is a call that came to liberate humanity from the worship of other people and to bring them forth from the humiliation of idolatry and the oppression of tyrants, and to free them from the captivity of whims and desires. \nThis blessed call is regarded as a continuation and affirmation of the previous divinely revealed messages that called to belief in the oneness of Allah. Therefore Islam called people to believe in all the messengers and prophets, and to respect them and venerate them, and to believe in the Books that were revealed to them. A call such as this is undoubtedly true. \nForetelling of Islam\nThe Books of the prophets foretold the coming of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The Noble Quran tells us of the clear foretelling of the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in the Torah and Gospel, including cases where his name and description are clearly mentioned.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) whom they find written with them in the Taurat (Torah) (Deut, xviii, 15) and the Injeel (Gospel) (John xiv, 16), - he commands them for Al-Ma’ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibat ((i.e. all good and lawful) as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabaith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allah’s Covenant), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them” [al-A‘raf 7:157]\n“And (remember) when ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you confirming the Taurat ((Torah) which came) before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad” [as-Saff 61:6]. \nIn the books of the Jews and the Christians – the Torah and the Gospel – there are still glad tidings that foretell his coming and his message, and describe some of his characteristics, despite the continual attempts to erase and distort these glad tidings. An example of that is what is mentioned in the Book of Deuteronomy, 33:2:\n“The Lord came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran… ” [New International Version] \nIt says in Mu‘jam al-Buldan (3/301):\n“Paran is a Hebrew word that is Arabized as Faran. It is one of the names of Makkah that is mentioned in the Torah, and it was said that it is a name for the mountains of Makkah. \nIbn Makula Abu Bakr Nasr ibn al-Qasim ibn Quda‘ah al-Quda‘i al-Farani al-Iskandarani said: I heard that this refers to the mountains of Paran, which are the mountains of the Hijaz. \nAnd in the Torah it says: Allah came from Sinai and dawned from Seir and shone forth from Paran. \nHis coming from Sinai refers to His speaking to Musa (peace be upon him). His dawning from Seir – which refers to the mountains of Palestine – refers to His sending down the Gospel to ‘Isa (peace be upon him). And His shining forth from the mountains of Paran refers to His sending down the Quran to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).”\nThe Noble Quran as a proof of the validity of Islam\nThis is the greatest of miracles and signs, and the clearest of proof. It is the ultimate proof of Allah against His creation on the Day of Resurrection. It is miraculous from several angles, such as rhetorical, scientific, and legislative, and in the way in which it spoke of future events and unseen matters. \nCommentary on at-Tur 52:34\n With regard to what is meant by the verse (interpretation of the meaning), “Let them then produce a recital like unto it (the Quran) if they are truthful” [at-Tur 52:34], it is a response to those who claimed that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was making up the Quran by himself. \nTherefore the Quran challenged them to produce something like it, if they were telling the truth in their claim, because the implication of these claims was that this was something within the capability of human beings. If that was true, then what was preventing them from producing something like it, when they were masters of eloquence and rhetoric? \nAllah challenged the disbelievers to produce something like it, but they were unable to do that, as the Quran tells us (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say: ‘If mankind and the jinns were together to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another’” [al-Isra 17:88]. \nAnd He challenged them to produce ten surahs like it, but they were unable to do that:\n“Or, they say, ‘He has forged it.’ Say, ‘Then bring ten chapters similarly forged and call for aid from whom you can besides Allah, if what you say is the truth’” [Hud 11:13]. \nAnd He challenged them to produce a single surah like it, but they were unable to do that:\n“And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Quran) to Our slave (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful” [al-Baqarah 2:23]. \nWith regard to the nature of the miracle with which the Quran challenged them , the scholars differed concerning that. There are several views, the most likely of which to be correct is what al-Alusi said: \n“The Quran as a whole, and parts of it, even the shortest surah of it, is a miracle in terms of its composition and eloquence, and its speaking of the unseen, and its harmony with reason and its precise meanings. All these aspects may appear in one verse, or some of them may not be present, such as telling of the unseen. There is no harm in that and no flaw, because what is there is sufficient.” (Ruh al-Ma‘ani (1/29) \nAll the proofs mentioned above in general terms may be discussed in much more detail, but we do not have room to do so here. It is more appropriate to read about that in specialised books. Every Muslim is advised to seek knowledge of the Quran and Sunnah, and to study the books of correct ‘aqidah, and to learn about his religion so that he can be a good Muslim and worship his Lord with understanding.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The question of whether Islam is true can be approached from various perspectives, including theological, historical, and experiential avenues. Here are some points that are often cited as evidence by Muslims:\n\n1. **The Qur'an**: Muslims believe the Qur'an is the literal word of God (Allah) revealed to the Prophet Muhammad over 23 years. They often highlight the inimitability of the Qur'an, its linguistic excellence, prophecies, and scientific insights as evidence of its divine origin.\n\n2. **Life of the Prophet Muhammad**: Muslims view the life and character of the Prophet Muhammad as a testament to Islam's truth. His honesty, trustworthiness, and moral integrity before and after his prophethood, as well as the immense impact he had on the world, are often cited as evidence of his authenticity as a messenger of God.\n\n3. **Historical Evidence**: The rapid spread of Islam after the death of Muhammad and the establishment of a vast Islamic civilization are viewed as indicators of the religion's truth. The preservation of Islamic texts and the robust oral tradition also contribute to this perspective.\n\n4. **Fulfilled Prophecies**: Believers often point to specific prophecies in the Qur'an and Hadith that they believe have come to pass as evidence of its divine message. \n\n5. **Rational Arguments**: Many Muslims argue that Islam is compatible with reason and logic. They believe that the fundamental beliefs of Islam provide answers to existential questions and moral dilemmas that can be coherently understood.\n\n6. **Spiritual Experience**: Individual spiritual experiences and transformations that individuals report upon embracing Islam or practicing its teachings are powerful personal testimonies to the faith's truth for many believers.\n\n7. **Consistency with Human Nature**: Many argue that the teachings of Islam align with human instincts and the intrinsic sense of morality, suggesting they are divinely inspired.\n\n8. **Unity and Community**: The global Muslim community (Ummah) fosters a sense of belonging and shared purpose, which some see as evidence of a true and divinely-ordained faith.\n\nEach of these points is part of a broader dialogue and is interpreted within various contexts. Different individuals may find different forms of evidence more compelling. Ultimately, proofs of truth in matters of faith can be deeply personal and may vary from one person to another. Engaging with someone knowledgeable about the faith, such as an Ulama (scholar), can provide further insights and understanding."

        "question": "Some criticisms of the belief of Ibn Rushd (Averroes)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly: \n\n\tIbn Rushd is a name that was shared between Ibn Rushd the \n\tgrandson (known to the West as Averroes) and Ibn Rushd the grandfather. Both \n\tof them had the kunyah Abu’l-Waleed, and both of them had the name Muhammad \n\tibn Ahmad. Both were appointed as qaadi (judge) of Cordoba. \n\n\tThe one referred to in the question is Ibn Rushd the grandson \n\t(Averroes), who died in 595 AH. He is famous for his focus on philosophy and \n\twriting books in that field. As for Ibn Rushd the grandfather, he did not \n\tget involved in philosophy; he died in 520 AH.\n\n\tAl-Abbaar said: \n\n\tHe attained a level of perfection, knowledge and virtue that \n\twas unsurpassed in Andalusia. He was a modest and humble man, of whom it was \n\tsaid that he was never distracted from researching and studying academic \n\tissues since he reached the age of discernment, except on two nights: the \n\tnight his father died and his wedding night. In terms of books and other \n\twritings he filled almost ten thousand pages. He had a strong inclination \n\ttowards philosophy, and became a leading figure in that field. People would \n\tturn to him to ask him his verdict on medical issues as much as they would \n\task him about matters of fiqh. He also had a deep knowledge of the Arabic \n\tlanguage, and it was said that he had memorised the diwaans (collected \n\tpoems) of Abu Tammaam and al-Mutanabbi. \n\n\tAmong the most famous of his works were the following: \n\tBidaayat al-Mujtahid, on fiqh; al-Kulliyaat (Generalities) on \n\tmedicine; Mukhtasar al-Mustasfa on usool; and many other works on \n\tphilosophy, in which he summarised the thoughts of the Greek philosophers. \n\tSo he wrote Jawaami‘ Kutub Aristotalis;  a summary of al-Ilaahiyyaat \n\tby Nicolaus of Damascus, a Greek philosopher; and a summary of Aristotle’s\n\tMetaphysics) b Aristotle. He also summarised many other books, of \n\twhich there are too many to list here, to the point that he was known as the \n\tone who propagated and carried the banner of Aristotelian thought. That \n\tultimately led to him becoming isolated, and he was shunned by the people of \n\this era because of the strange views that he expressed and the weird, alien \n\tknowledge that he propagated. \n\n\tShaykh ash-Shuyookh Ibn Hamawiyyah said: \n\n\tWhen I entered the city, I asked about Ibn Rushd and I was \n\ttold that he was under house arrest on the orders of the caliph Ya‘qoob, and \n\tno one was allowed to visit him, because of the many strange views that were \n\tnarrated from him, and the many shunned branches of knowledge that were \n\tattributed to him. He died under house arrest in Marrakesh. \n\n\tYou can see his biography in Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’ \n\t(21/307-310) \n\n\tSecondly: \n\n\tThere has been a lengthy debate on the real nature of the \n\tbeliefs of Ibn Rushd, and many books have been written both supporting him \n\tand opposing him. There has been a great deal of confusion as to his real \n\tbeliefs and views. \n\n\tBecause here we do not have the time or space for a detailed \n\tdiscussion of the beliefs of Ibn Rushd, it will suffice to point out some of \n\tthe flawed ideas in his books that are subject to controversy. \n\n\t1.\n\tInterpretation of Islamic teachings so as to be in \n\tharmony with Aristotelian philosophy\n\n\tPerhaps looking at the brief biography of Ibn Rushd referred \n\tto above will be sufficient to highlight this inclination in the thought of \n\tIbn Rushd. He was infatuated with the thought of Aristotle to the extent \n\tthat Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said of him: \n\tHe is one of the most adherent of people to the views of Aristotle. End \n\tquote from Bayaan Talbees al-Jahamiyyah (1/120). Ibn Rushd tried hard \n\tto explain Aristotelian thought and present it to the people in a new Arabic \n\tstyle. Whilst doing that, when he saw a contradiction between Aristotelian \n\tthought and the fundamentals of Islam, he would try to find a far-fetched \n\tinterpretation that could lead to undermining and destroying Islam. It was \n\tas if Aristotelian philosophy was the counterpart of the teachings of Islam \n\twhich came from the Lord of the Worlds and are embodied in the texts of the \n\tQur’an and Sunnah. It was on this basis that he wrote his famous book \n\tFasl al-Maqaal fi Taqreer ma bayna ash-Sharee‘ah wa’l-Hikmah min al-Ittisaal \n\t(The Decisive Treatise, Determining the Nature of the Connection between \n\tReligion and Philosophy). \n\n\t2.\n\tHis belief that Islamic teachings have both exoteric \n\t(apparent) and esoteric (hidden) meanings\n\n\tIbn Rushd said: \n\n\tIslamic teachings are of two categories: exoteric (apparent) \n\tand esoteric (hidden). The exoteric or apparent meanings are for the masses \n\tto adhere to and follow, and the esoteric or hidden meanings are for the \n\tscholars. As for the masses, what they must do is understand Islamic \n\tteachings according to the apparent meaning, and refrain from interpreting \n\tthem in any manner other than the apparent meaning. It is not permissible \n\tfor the scholars to explain them to the masses in any way other than in \n\taccordance with the apparent meaning. As ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with \n\thim) said: Tell the people what they can understand; do you want the words \n\tof Allah and His Messenger to be rejected? End quote. \n\n\tAl-Kashf ‘an Manaahij al-Adillah \n\t(p. 99); published by Markaz Diraasaat al-Wahdah al-‘Arabiyyah \n\n\tIbn Rushd discussed this esoteric idea at length in his \n\tbooks, to the extent that he regarded it as one of the main characteristics \n\tof the saved group of the ummah of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be \n\tupon him) who adhere to the exoteric aspects of the teachings of Islam, and \n\tthey do not disclose their esoteric meanings to the people. End quote. \n\n\tAl-Kashf ‘an Manaahij al-Adillah \n\t(p. 150) \n\n\tHence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on \n\thim) wrote at length refuting the views of Ibn Rushd in this book and \n\texplaining that esoteric interpretation of Islamic texts is flawed. These \n\tdiscussions appear in his two significant books, Bayaan Talbees al-Jahamiyyah \n\tand Dar’u Ta‘aarud al-‘Aql wa’n-Naql.\n\n\tShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid:\n\n\tWhen Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and his ilk realised that the words \n\tof the Messenger cannot be interpreted in this philosophical manner – rather \n\tthey became certain that the meaning that he intended was what the people \n\tunderstood – they tried to explain that by saying: He was addressing the \n\tmasses in a manner that they could understand, even though he knew that the \n\ttruth with regard to that particular issue was not as the people understood \n\tit. Hence what these people were effectively saying was that the Messengers \n\tlied in order to serve a purpose. This is the way of Ibn Rushd (Averroes) \n\tand others who follow esoteric interpretations (baatiniyyah). End quote. \n\n\tMajmoo‘ al-Fataawa \n\t(19/157) \n\n\t3.\n\tFavouring philosophical views regarding the resurrection \n\tand requital\n\n\tWith regard to the issue of resurrection and requital, he \n\tfavoured the view of the philosophers that the resurrection would be of \n\tsouls only. In fact in this regard he fell into misguidance that was more \n\tgrievous than simply believing in the philosophical view that the \n\tresurrection would be of souls only, as he regarded this issue as being one \n\tthat is subject to ijtihaad, and said that what is required of anyone who \n\texamines the matter is to believe in the conclusion that he reaches. He \n\tsaid: \n\n\tThe truth concerning this issue is that what every individual \n\tmust do is believe the conclusion to which his research leads him. End \n\tquote. \n\n\tAl-Kashf ‘an Manaahij al-Adillah \n\t(p. 204) \n\n\tShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid:\n\n\tThe followers of philosophy are further removed from the path \n\tof Islam than ahl al-kalaam: \n\n\tAmong them are some who think that this is part of the \n\treligion of Islam. \n\n\tAnd among them are some who have more knowledge of religious \n\ttexts than others, so they started to reject the views of ahl al-kalaam \n\tunless they are supported by a text. Whenever there was a text to support \n\ttheir views, they would deal with that text in one of two ways: either they \n\twould accept it completely, if it was in accordance with their understanding \n\tand thoughts, or they would deal with it like all other similar cases, and \n\tsay that the Messengers spoke of that by way of comparison in order to help \n\tthe people understand (and it is not to be taken literally), because there \n\twas no other way to explain it and therefore they needed to put it in these \n\twords. Ibn Rushd and others like him followed this method, therefore they \n\tare closer to Islamic teachings than Ibn Sina and his ilk. In terms of \n\tpractical issues, they were closer to the limits of Islam than those who \n\tneglected Islamic duties and regarded as permissible that which Islam \n\tforbids. However both groups are somewhat deviant, commensurate with the \n\textent to which they went against the Qur’an and Sunnah, and they are \n\tcorrect and sound in as much as they are in harmony with them. \n\n\tHence with regard to the issue of the universe being created \n\t(and not having existed from eternity) and the resurrection of bodies, Ibn \n\tRushd took a neutral stance and stated that both views were valid, although \n\the was more inclined in his heart to his predecessor (Aristotle). He \n\tresponded to the comments of al-Ghazaali in Tahaafut at-Tahaafut, but \n\tmany of his arguments are incorrect and al-Ghazaali was in the right. He \n\tattributed some of his arguments to Ibn Sina and not to his predecessor \n\t(Aristotle), and he attributed any mistakes to Ibn Sina. In some of his \n\targuments he spoke ill of al-Ghazaali and accused him of being unfair, \n\tbecause he based his views on flawed kalaami arguments, such as the idea \n\tthat God does not have to have a reason or wisdom behind what He does, and \n\tthat the One Who is all powerful and able to choose may decide to choose one \n\tthing over another for no reason. And some of his arguments were very \n\tconfused and unclear. End quote. \n\n\tMinhaaj as-Sunnah \n\t(1/255) \n\n\t4.\n\tFailure to pay attention to the Sunnah as a source of \n\tlegislation\n\n\tOne of the main characteristics of the methodology of Ibn \n\tRushd in his books, which at the same time was one of the main reasons for \n\this errors, was his failure to pay attention to the Prophetic Sunnah as a \n\tsource of legislation. \n\n\tDr Khaalid Kabeer ‘Allaal (may Allah preserve him) said: \n\n\tIbn Rushd did not pay due attention to the Prophetic Sunnah \n\tand its status as a main source of Islamic legislation after the Holy \n\tQur’an, and he did not quote it widely in his books of kalaam and \n\tphilosophy. Therefore he missed out on many hadiths that are directly \n\tconnected to many of the academic topics that he discussed. Moreover, in \n\tmany cases he did not correctly understand many of the hadiths that he did \n\tquote in his books, and he subjected them to misinterpretation in order to \n\tsupport his views and his Aristotelian ideas. End quote. \n\n\tNaqd Fikr al-Faylasoof Ibn Rushd \n\t(p. 97) \n\n\tThis is a brief overview that highlights some of the \n\tscholarly criticism of the beliefs of Ibn Rushd (Averroes). This criticism \n\tmay be summed up by noting that he overlooked many of the Islamic guidelines \n\tthat were clearly laid out by the Lawgiver, and he promoted the method of \n\tinterpreting the texts in a manner other than their apparent meaning and \n\tsubjecting some clear texts to ijtihaad, on the basis of some weird, alien \n\tideas that had come from ancient civilisations that have perished.\n\n\tBecause of that, he is celebrated by many of those who are \n\tpart of the liberal secular trends today, to the point that they think of \n\tthe philosopher Ibn Rushd as a pioneer of enlightenment, even though they \n\tknow that much of the knowledge in his books is regarded as extinct and \n\twrong by modern standards of knowledge. But their aim is to glorify all \n\tliberal thoughts and ideas that are not in harmony with the fundamentals of \n\tIslam and are contrary to the facts mentioned in Islamic texts, and they \n\tresort to interpreting these texts in a very weird manner, whilst at the \n\tsame time presenting themselves as people of religious commitment and \n\tIslamic knowledge and understanding. In Ibn Rushd they see what they are \n\tlooking for, and they regard his books as pioneering works. We think that in \n\this books you will find promotion of adherence to Islam and referring to it, \n\twhich we do not find in the books of these modern thinkers. He adhered to \n\tthe practical side of Islamic teachings and venerated those teachings in the \n\tfields of fiqh, judicial rulings and issuing fatwas, that would not be \n\tpleasing to these modern thinkers, and they would not even match up to one \n\ttenth of his level of knowledge. “May \n\tAllah destroy them, how they are deluded away from the truth!”[at-Tawbah \n\t9:30]. \n\n\tAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Ibn Rushd, known as Averroes in the West, was a prominent Islamic philosopher, physician, and commentator on Aristotle in the 12th century. His work sought to reconcile Islamic theology with Aristotelian philosophy, which led to both admiration and criticism within the Islamic community. Here are some common criticisms of his beliefs:\n\n1. **Reason vs. Revelation**: One of the primary criticisms was his strong emphasis on reason as a means of understanding the universe and religious truths. Critics argued that his approach undervalued the importance of divine revelation and faith in Islam. They believed that reliance solely on reason could lead to skepticism about core Islamic beliefs.\n\n2. **Philosophical Implications**: Ibn Rushd's interpretations of Aristotle sometimes led to conclusions that some scholars felt were incompatible with Islamic teachings. For example, his views on the eternity of the world and the nature of God were seen as conflicting with certain theological positions, particularly those of Asharism, which holds a created view of the universe.\n\n3. **Influence of Hellenistic Thought**: His integration of Greek philosophical thought into Islamic discourse was viewed unfavorably by scholars who believed that such influences could lead to a dilution of Islamic principles. They feared that the incorporation of Hellenistic ideas might result in heretical beliefs that stray from established Islamic doctrine.\n\n4. **Views on the Afterlife**: Ibn Rushd’s philosophical perspective included a rational approach to the afterlife, which some critics felt undermined the traditional Islamic eschatological views. His interpretations sometimes suggested a more metaphorical understanding of spiritual truths, which was not universally accepted.\n\n5. **Limited Scope of Philosophy**: Some critics argued that Ibn Rushd's philosophy limited itself to naturalistic explanations and did not adequately address metaphysical issues, which are crucial in Islamic thought. They believed that his philosophical framework could not satisfactorily explain essential aspects of faith.\n\nThese criticisms stem from a broader intellectual debate within Islamic thought regarding the role of philosophy, reason, and rationality in understanding faith and theology. While Ibn Rushd is praised for his rationalist approach and contributions to both Islamic and Western philosophy, these criticisms highlight the tensions that arose in the intersection of philosophy and theology within the medieval Islamic world."

        "question": "Shar‘i evidence that the one who is ignorant is excused with regard to issues of shirk and kufr",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to the ignorant person who does acts of kufr or shirk, one of the following two scenarios must apply: \n-1-\nThe first scenario is: he is not Muslim, whether he follows another religion or does not have a religion. \nIf that is the case, then such a person is a disbeliever, whether he knows what he is doing or is ignorant, or he is basing his disbelief on some misinterpretation. He is not subject to the same rulings as a Muslim in this world, and he is subject to the rulings on disbelievers, because he has not entered Islam in the first place, so how can we deem him to be Muslim when he has never claimed to be Muslim? \nWith regard to the hereafter, if he was truly ignorant, and the call of Islam never reached him at all, or it reached him in a distorted manner in such a way that proof is not established against one like him, then with regard to his fate on the Day of Resurrection, there was a lengthy debate among the scholars. \nThe most correct scholarly view concerning him is that he will be tested on the Day of Resurrection. Then whoever obeys Allah will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys Him will enter Hell. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThere are numerous reports which state that in the case of a person whom with the message did not reach in this world, a messenger will be sent to him on the Day of Resurrection.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (17/308) \nThis has been discussed previously in the answers to questions no. 1244 and 215066 \n-2-\nThe second scenario is: he claims to be a Muslim and fulfils the conditions of being described as such, and he openly declares his complete belief in Islam and his belief in the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). \nIn the case of such a person, if he does a deed that makes him a disbeliever out of ignorance, he is not to be deemed a disbeliever because of that, and the description of being Muslim is not to be taken away from him, unless proof that he is wrong is established and is explained to him. \nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di said:\nWith regard to anyone who believes in Allah and His Messenger and remains steadfast in obeying them, but denies some of that which the Messenger brought, out of ignorance or lack of knowledge that the Messenger brought it – even though that constitutes disbelief and the one who does it is a disbeliever – the fact that he was ignorant of what the Messenger brought makes it disallowed to deem that particular person a disbeliever, regardless of whether the matter has to do with a fundamental or minor issue, because disbelief means rejecting what the Messenger brought, or rejecting some of it, knowingly. \nThus you may know the difference between the disbeliever who disbelieves in the Messenger and the believer who rejects some of what he brought out of ignorance and misguidance, not knowingly and out of stubbornness.\nEnd quote from al-Fataawa as-Sa‘diyyah (p. 443-447) \nThe excuse of ignorance is something that is valid and established with regard to all issues of religion, whether they are issues of belief, tawheed and shirk, or issues of fiqhi rulings. \nThe fact that a Muslim may be excused for ignorance with regard to matters of belief is indicated by several points of shar‘i evidence, as follows: \n1.\nThe shar‘i texts which indicate that the one who makes mistakes is excused, such as the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error” [al-Baqarah 2:286]. And Allah, may He be exalted, said [in a hadith qudsi]: “I have granted that”, as is narrated in Saheeh Muslim (126). \nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And there is no sin on you if you make a mistake therein, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Ahzaab 33:5]. \nAnd the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my ummah their mistakes and forgetfulness, and what they are forced to do.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani. \nThese texts indicate that whoever does something that is contrary to what he is obliged to do, because he forgot or out of ignorance, is to be pardoned. The one who is mistaken also includes the one who is ignorant, because the one who is mistaken is anyone who does something contrary to the truth without intending to. \nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di said: This is general in meaning and applies to every case in which the believers make mistakes, whether it has to do with deeds or beliefs.\nEnd quote from al-Irshaad ila Ma‘rifat al-Ahkaam (p. 208) \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ignorance is undoubtedly a mistake. Based on that, if a person does something that constitutes disbelief, in word or deed, not knowing that it constitutes disbelief – i.e., he is ignorant of the shar‘i evidence – then he is not to be deemed a disbeliever.\nEnd quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (14/449). \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: Allah, may He be exalted, said in the Qur’an (interpretation of the meaning): “Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error” [al-Baqarah 2:286]. And Allah, may He be exalted, said [in a hadith qudsi]: “I have granted that”, And He did not differentiate between mistakes with regard to definitive issues or issues based on probability… So whoever says that the one who is mistaken with regard to definitive issues or issues based on probability is sinning has gone against the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the consensus of the early generations.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (19/210). \nAnd he said: Moreover, my attitude – and those who have spent time with me know that about me – is that I am the one who most emphatically forbids deeming a specific person to be a disbeliever, evildoer or sinner, unless it is known that definitive proof has been established against him, of the kind of proof that anyone who goes against it or rejects it becomes a disbeliever, evildoer or sinner. I affirm here that Allah has forgiven this ummah for their mistakes, which includes mistakes in issues of beliefs, words and practical actions. \nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (3/229) \nIbn al-‘Arabi said: With regard to the ignorant and those who make mistakes among this ummah, even if they do acts that constitute disbelief and shirk, the kind of deeds that result in the doer being deemed a mushrik or a disbeliever, they are to be excused for their ignorance and mistakes until proof is established against them, of the type of proof that whoever rejects it becomes a disbeliever and it is clearly explained to the degree that a man of his calibre would not be confused after such an explanation. End quote. This was narrated from him by al-Qaasimi in Mahaasin at-Ta’weel (3/161). \nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Mu‘allimi said: Even if we sometimes say that this is calling upon someone other than Allah, may He be exalted, and it is an act of worship and shirk, we do not mean that everyone who does that is a mushrik. Rather the mushrik is the one who does that with no excuse. As for the one who does that with an excuse, then perhaps he is one of the best slaves of Allah, may He be exalted and one of the most virtuous and pious.\nEnd quote from Athaar ash-Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Mu‘allimi (3/826) \n2.\nThe texts indicate that Allah’s proofs against people cannot be established except after they have knowledge of the proof, such as the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We never punish unless We have sent a Messenger”\n[al-Isra’ 17:15]\n“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:165]\n“And Allah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them as to what they should avoid”\n[at-Tawbah 9:115]\nand there are other verses which indicate that proof cannot be established except after knowledge and clear explanation. \nThese verses indicate that the accountable person is not required to carry out Islamic duties except having acquired knowledge concerning them. If he does not know of them, then he is excused. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said, explaining what we learn from this verse, “Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning…” [an-Nisa’ 4:165]: \nThe most important thing we learn is that the excuse of ignorance is a valid excuse, even with regard to the fundamentals of religion, because the Messengers brought both fundamental and minor issues, so if a person is ignorant and no messenger came to him, then he has an excuse before Allah.\nEnd quote from Tafseer Soorat an-Nisa’ (2/485). \nIbn al-Qayyim said: \nThe shar‘i rulings only become binding upon a person when he reaches puberty and when the rulings reach him. Just as the rulings are not binding upon him before he reaches puberty, by the same token they are not binding upon him before they reach him. \nEnd quote from Badaa’i‘ al-Fawaa’id (4/168). \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ar-Radd ‘ala al-Ikhnaa’i, annoted by al-‘Anzi (p. 206): \nSimilarly, if a person calls upon someone other than Allah and performs the Hajj rituals for someone other than Allah, he is also a mushrik, and his actions constitute disbelief, but he may not be aware that this is shirk which is forbidden. \nWhen many of the Tatars and others entered Islam, they had small idols made of felt and other things, which they sought to draw close to and venerated. They did not know that this was prohibited in the religion of Islam. They would also seek to draw close to (and worship) fire, not knowing that doing so is prohibited. There are many kinds of shirk which some of those who enter Islam may be unaware of and not realise that it is shirk. Such a person is misguided and the deed in which he associates others with Allah is invalid, but he does not deserve to be punished unless proof is established against him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped)” [al-Baqarah 2:22]. End quote. \n3.\nThe texts which tell the stories of some who fell into shirk or disbelief but were excused. They include the following: \n(i) The story of the man who issued instructions that his body was to be burned and who denied the power of Allah over him\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There was a man who transgressed against his soul (by committing a great deal of sin). When he was dying he said to his sons: ‘When I die, burn me, then grind my bones, then scatter me in the wind, for by Allah, if my Lord grasps hold of me, He will punish me as He has never punished anyone else.’ When he died, that was done to him, but Allah commanded the earth: ‘Gather together whatever of him there is in you.’ So it did that, then the man was standing there. Allah said: ‘What made you do what you did?’ He said: ‘O Lord, I feared You.’ So He forgave him.”\nAgreed upon. \nWhat this man said constituted major disbelief that puts one beyond the pale of faith, because it was an implicit denial of the power of Allah to gather his scattered dust after he died. Moreover the divine attribute of power is one of the most obvious and clear of divine attributes, which is obviously connected to the Lordship and divinity of Allah. In fact it is one of the most significant attributes of the Lord. But this man was not deemed a disbeliever, because he was excused for his ignorance. \nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr said: The scholars differed concerning the meaning of this hadith. Some of them said: This was a man who was ignorant of one of the attributes of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, namely His power. So he did not know that Allah has power to do whatever He wills. They said: If a person is ignorant of one of the attributes of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, but he believes in and knows all the other divine attributes, his ignorance of some of the attributes of Allah does not mean that he is to be deemed a disbeliever. And they said: rather the disbeliever is the one who stubbornly rejects the truth, not one who is ignorant of it. \nThis is the view of the earlier scholars and of later scholars who followed in their footsteps.\nEnd quote from at-Tamheed lima fi’l-Muwatta’ min al-Ma‘aani wa’l-Asaaneed (18/42). \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:\nThis was a man who had some doubts about the power of Allah and His ability to bring him back to life if his dust was scattered. Rather he believed that Allah would not be able to resurrect him, which constitutes disbelief according to Muslim consensus. But he was ignorant and did not know that, although he was a believer who feared that Allah would punish him. Therefore Allah forgave him for that.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (3/23 1). \nHe also said:\nThis man believed that Allah would not be able to gather his dust if he did that, or he doubted that Allah could do that, and believed that He would not resurrect him. In both cases, such beliefs constitute disbelief, and the one for whom such proof has been established is to be deemed a disbeliever. But this man was ignorant of that and no knowledge had reached him to dispel his ignorance, yet he had faith in Allah and believed in His commands and prohibitions, His promises and warnings, and therefore he feared His punishment. So Allah forgave him because of his fear of Him. \nIf one of those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Last Day, and do righteous deeds, make some mistakes in their understanding of some issues of belief, they will not be worse off than this man. Allah may forgive their errors or He may punish them, if they fell short and do not make sufficient efforts to find out about the truth and follow it. \nAs for deeming a person who is known to have faith to be a disbeliever for simply making mistakes with regard to some issues of belief, that is a serious matter indeed. \nEnd quote from al-Istiqaamah (1/164) \nImam ash-Shaafa‘i said: \nAllah has names and attributes that are mentioned in His Book, and of which His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has told his ummah. No one to whom proof has been presented clearly can reject that, because they are mentioned in the Qur’an and are mentioned in saheeh reports from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). \nTherefore if a person goes against that after clear proof has been presented to him, then he is a disbeliever. However, before clear proof has been presented to him, he may be excused for his ignorance, because knowledge of such matters cannot be figured out on the basis of reasoning or on the basis of reflecting and thinking. We do not deem anyone to be a disbeliever for not knowing it, except after knowledge thereof reaches him.\nEnd quote from Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’ (10/79) \n(ii) The story of the Children of Israel with Moosa\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We brought the Children of Israel (with safety) across the sea, and they came upon a people devoted to some of their idols (in worship). They said: ‘O Moosa (Moses)! Make for us an ilahan (a god) as they have aliha (gods).’ He said: ‘Verily, you are a people who know not (the Majesty and Greatness of Allah and what is obligatory upon you, i.e., to worship none but Allah Alone, the One and the Only God of all that exists).’\n(Moosa (Moses) added:) ‘Verily, these people will be destroyed for that which they are engaged in (idols-worship). And all that they are doing is in vain.’\nHe said: ‘Shall I seek for you an Ilahan (a God) other than Allah, while He has given you superiority over the Alameen (mankind and jinns of your time)?’”\n[al-A‘raaf 7:138-140]. \nThey demanded that Moosa (peace be upon him) should make them an idol so that they could seek to draw close to Allah by worshipping it, as those mushrikeen had taken an idol for worship. \nIbn al-Jawzi said: \nThis shows how great their ignorance was, as they thought that it was permissible to worship something other than Allah, after they had seen the signs.\nEnd quote from Zaad al-Maseer (2/150) \nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Mu‘allimi said:\nIt seems from the response of Moosa (peace be upon him) that even though he denounced them for their ignorance, he did not regard their demand as apostasy from faith. This is supported by the fact that they were not taken to task at this point as they were taken to task when they took the calf for worship. It is as if in this instance – and Allah knows best – they were excused because they were new in their faith.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ Rasaa’il al-Mu‘allimi (1/142) \n(iii) The story of Dhaat Anwaat\nIt was narrated that Abu Waaqid al-Laythi said: We set out with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) towards Hunayn, and we passed by a lote-tree. We said: O Prophet of Allah, make this into a dhaat anwaat for us as the disbelievers have a dhaat anwaat. The disbelievers used to hang (yanootoona) their weapons on a lote-tree and stay around it, showing devotion to it. \nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allahu akbar! This is what the Children of Israel said to Moosa, ‘Make for us a god as they have gods’! You will certainly follow in the footsteps of those who came before you.”\nNarrated and classed as saheeh by at-Tirmidhi (2180). It was also narrated by Imam Ahmad (21900) and classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani. \nThey asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to do something that constituted shirk akbar (major shirk); they wanted him to prescribe for them to hang their weapons on trees, as the mushrikeen did. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) regarded their words as being akin to the words of the Children of Israel to Moosa. \nMuhammad Rasheed Rida said: Those who said that to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were new Muslims who had recently given up shirk, so they thought that if the Prophet allocated something like that for that purpose, it would be acceptable and would not be contrary to Islam. \nEnd quote from his comment on Majmoo‘ ar-Rasaa’il wa’l-Masaa’il an-Najdiyyah (4/39) \nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi was asked about the grave-worshippers who believe in the dead and ask of them. The shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They are apostates from Islam, if proof is established against them. Otherwise they are excused for their ignorance, like those who asked for a dhaat anwaat.\nEnd quote from Fataawa ash-Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi (p. 371) \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:\nAfter learning what the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought, we inevitably learn that he did not prescribe for his ummah to call upon any of the dead, whether they were Prophets, righteous people or anyone else, whether in the sense of seeking help or otherwise, whether by way of seeking refuge or in any other way. \nSimilarly, he did not prescribe for his ummah to prostrate to anyone, dead or otherwise, and the like. Rather we know that he prohibited all such things, and that these things come under the heading of shirk which Allah and His Messenger forbade. \nBut because of the prevalence of ignorance and lack of knowledge of Islamic teachings among many of the later generations, it is not possible to deem them disbelievers because of that, until they learn and find out what the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought, and what contradicts it. \nEnd quote from ar-Radd ‘ala al-Kubra (2/731) \nShaykh ‘Abd al-Muhsin al-‘Abbaad said:\nAs for calling upon the occupants of the graves and seeking their help, and asking them to meet one’s needs and relieve distress, this is major shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam. \nSuch actions should be described as shirk and disbelief, but it should not be said that the one who does that is a mushrik and a disbeliever, because whoever does that and is ignorant is excused because of his ignorance, unless proof is presented to him and he understands it, then he persists in that. In that case he may be deemed to be a disbeliever and an apostate. \nConfusion concerning graves is something that many people have fallen into, who were raised in an environment where venerating graves and calling upon their occupants was regarded as a sign of loving the righteous, especially if there was among them one of the pseudo-scholars who are leading the people in venerating graves and seeking the help of their occupants, claiming that they are mediators who will bring people closer to Allah. \nEnd quote from Kutub wa Rasaa’il al-‘Allaamah al-‘Abbaad (4/372) \n(iv) The hadith of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan (may Allah be pleased with him)\nIt was narrated that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam will wear out as colour on a garment wears out, until no one will know what fasting, prayer, Hajj and charity (zakaah) are. The Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will be taken away at night, and not one verse of it will be left on earth. And there will be some people left, old men and old women, who will say: We saw our fathers saying these words, Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, so we say them too.”\nSilah said to him: What good will (saying) Laa ilaaha ill-Allah do them, when they do not know what fasting, prayer, Hajj and charity are? \nHudhayfah turned away from him. He repeated his question three times, and Hudhayfah turned away from him each time.\nThen he turned to him on the third time and said: O Silah, it will save them from Hell, three times.\nNarrated by Ibn Maajah (4049), classed as saheeh by al-Buwaysiri in Misbaah az-Zujaajah (2/291); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (1/171). \nThis hadith indicates that those people will have nothing but faith in the general sense of affirming Tawheed; they will know nothing of Islam except simply affirming what they found their fathers saying. \nIbn Taymiyah said:\nMany people may grow up in places and times where a lot of the teachings of Islam are worn out, so that there is no one left to convey that with which Allah sent His Messenger of the Book and wisdom, so they do not know much of that with which Allah sent His Messenger, and there will be no one to convey to them. Such a person cannot be deemed a disbeliever, therefore the leading scholars are unanimously agreed that whoever is brought up in the wilderness, far away from people of knowledge and faith, and is new in Islam, and denies something of these obvious rulings that were established through mutawaatir texts, is not to be deemed a disbeliever until he learns what the Messenger brought. \nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (11/407) \nConclusion: \nThe type of ignorance for which a person is excused is that whereby he does not know about the truth and no one mentions the truth to him. This may be a reason why he cannot be labelled a sinner and he cannot be labelled as his deed would dictate. Then if he claims to be a Muslim and testifies that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, then he is to be regarded as one of them. If he does not claim to be a Muslim, then in this world he is to be deemed a member of the religion to which he belongs. \nAs for the hereafter, his case is like that of people who lived in the period between Prophets, and he will be judged by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, on the Day of Resurrection. The soundest scholarly opinion concerning them is that they will be tested in whatever way Allah wills; whoever among them obeys will enter Paradise, and whoever among them disobeys will enter Hell.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (2/128) \nSee also the answers to questions no.  215338 and 111362 \nFor more information, please see Ishkaaliyyah al-I‘dhaar bi’l-Jahl fi’l-Bahth al-‘Uqadi by Dr Sultaan al-‘Umayri. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of being excused due to ignorance in matters of shirk (associating partners with Allah) and kufr (disbelief) is supported by several pieces of Shar‘i evidence from the Qur'an and the Sunnah.\n\n1. **Qur'anic Evidence**: Allah addresses the issue of ignorance in relation to worship and belief in different verses. One such example is in Surah Al-Isra (17:15), where Allah states: \n\n   \"And We do not punish until We have sent a Messenger.\" \n\n   This verse implies that people are not held accountable until they have been given clear guidance through a messenger. If someone is unaware of the truth due to a lack of knowledge, they cannot be punished for their disbelief.\n\n2. **Hadith Evidence**: There are also prophetic traditions that illustrate this concept. For instance, in a hadith reported in Sahih Muslim, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) mentioned that those who are not aware of the Islamic message would be judged by their actions and circumstances:\n\n   \"There are three categories of people whose excuses will be accepted: the person who is insane, the person who is sleeping until he wakes up, and the child until he reaches puberty.\" \n\n   This hadith shows that certain individuals, including those who lack understanding or knowledge, are not judged by the same standards as those who have received clear guidance.\n\n3. **Scholarly Consensus**: Islamic scholars have discussed this issue extensively, and many agree that ignorance can be an excuse in cases of shirk and kufr, provided the individual did not have the means to learn about the truth of Islam. The principle of \"La ikraha fi al-din\" (There is no compulsion in religion) also supports the idea that belief must be based on knowledge and understanding.\n\nIn summary, the Quranic verses, hadith, and scholarly consensus affirm that individuals who are genuinely ignorant of the tenets of Islam, including matters of shirk and kufr, may be excused from accountability until they receive the proper guidance and knowledge."

        "question": "The view of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen regarding the “excuse of ignorance”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We could not find the words of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) to which the questioner referred as being in Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, but we found his words in most of his printed books and audio fatwas, and we did not find any contradiction in his words, or any retraction of anything he said.\nWe may sum up what the Shaykh said about the “excuse of ignorance” in the following points:\n1.\nThe basic principle according to the Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) is that ignorance is an excuse. In fact he thinks that no one can produce evidence to prove that the one who is ignorant is not excused, and he thinks that were it not for the excuse of ignorance, there would be no need to send the Messengers; people would be accountable on the basis of what is instilled in their innate nature, and there would be no need to send the Messengers!\n2.\nThere is no differentiation, with regard to the excuse of ignorance, between issues of belief and practical issues.\n3.\nThere is no differentiation, with regard to the excuse of ignorance, between issues that are clear and issues that are subtle and ambiguous, because clarity and ambiguity are something relative that may vary from one environment to another and from one person to another.\n4.\nDisbelief that puts a person beyond the pale of Islam may be connected to beliefs, words uttered, actions done, or something that one fails to do. The Shaykh does not differ concerning the fact that these things could put a person beyond the pale of Islam, but the point of the discussion here is how to apply the description of disbelief to a particular person, because he may be excused, in which case he is not to be regarded as a disbeliever.\n5.\nA person who does an act of disbelief is not a disbeliever if he is ignorant and unaware of the shar‘i ruling concerning his action, or if he asked a scholar who gave him a fatwa saying that his action was permissible.\nHowever he does become a disbeliever if proof is established and presented to him, and any confusion or misunderstanding on his part was dealt with.\n6.\nThe excuse of ignorance cannot be accepted from everyone who claims to be ignorant, because he may have been negligent about learning or careless about asking and finding out, or he may be stubborn and not accept the truth or try to seek it. In all these cases, the individual is not excused according to the Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him). An exception is made, with regard to having fallen short, if it did not occur to a person that this action could be haraam, and he had no scholar to advise him. In this case he is excused.\n7.\nThe ignorant person among those who are originally disbelievers is to be dealt with as a disbeliever according to shar‘i rulings in this world, and in the hereafter his fate will be decided by Allah. The correct view is that he will be tested (in the hereafter).\nThe ignorant person among those who claim to be Muslim but who fell into disbelief that puts one beyond the pale of Islam is to be treated outwardly as if he is a Muslim, according to shar‘i rulings, and his fate will be decided by Allah in the hereafter.\n8.\nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted texts from the Qur’an and Sunnah, and the views of scholars, to support this view concerning this issue, and explained that this is the view of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allah have mercy on him) – contrary to those who misunderstood his views. Here we will discuss in some detail what we have summed up of the words of the Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him), and we may quote in brief some of what he said. Whoever would like to know more may consult the references we will mention below.\nI.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the excuse of ignorance with regard to matters of belief.\nHe replied:\nHaving different views concerning the excuse of ignorance is like any other fiqhi issue that is subject to different views. The difference may be in wording sometimes, by way of applying the ruling to a particular person. In other words, all are agreed that a certain statement (made by the person in question) constitutes disbelief, or a certain action constitutes disbelief, or a failure to do something constitutes disbelief, but is the ruling applicable to this particular person, because the reason to apply the ruling to him is valid and there is no impediment, or is it not applicable because there are some reasons to indicate that the conditions of applying it are not met in his case, or that there is some impediment to doing so?\nIgnorance of that which makes one a disbeliever is of two types:\nThe first type is when the individual does not believe in Islam, or does not believe in anything, and it has never crossed his mind that there is a (true) religion other than that which he is following. In shar‘i terms he is to be treated as he appears to be in this world; as for the hereafter, his fate will be decided by Allah, may He be exalted. The most correct view is that he will be tested in the hereafter in whatever way Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, wills, and Allah knows best what they will do, but we know that he will not enter the Fire except for a sin that he commits, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “and your Lord treats no one with injustice” [al-Kahf 18:49].\nRather we said that he is to be treated as he appears to be in this world – which means that he is to be treated as a disbeliever according to shar‘i rulings – because he is not a Muslim, so he cannot be treated as a Muslim. The reason why we said that the most correct view is that he will be tested in the hereafter is that there are many reports to that effect, which were quoted by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) in his book Tareeq al-Hijratayn, when he discussed the eighth view concerning the children of the mushrikeen [and their fate in the hereafter].\nThe second type is when there is ignorance on the part of an individual who is a Muslim, but he grew up believing in (or practising) that thing that makes one a disbeliever, and it never crossed his mind that it is contrary to Islam, and no one advised him of that. Such a person is to be treated as a Muslim, and in the hereafter his fate will be decided by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. That is indicated by the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the words of the scholars.\nThe evidence from the Qur’an includes the following:\n“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)”\n[al-Isra’ 17:15]\n“And never will your Lord destroy the towns (populations) until He sends to their mother town a Messenger reciting to them Our Verses. And never would We destroy the towns unless the people thereof are Zalimoon (polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah, oppressors and tyrants)”\n[al-Qasas 28:59]\n“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:165]\n“And We sent not a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order that he might make (the Message) clear for them. Then Allah misleads whom He wills and guides whom He wills”\n[Ibraaheem 14:4]\n“And Allah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them as to what they should avoid”\n[at-Tawbah 9:115]\n“And this is a blessed Book (the Quran) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. saved from the torment of Hell).\nLest you (pagan Arabs) should say: ‘The Book was only sent down to two sects before us (the Jews and the Christians), and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.’\nOr lest you (pagan Arabs) should say: ‘If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been better guided than they (Jews and Christians).’ So now has come unto you a clear proof (the Quran) from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy”\n[al-An‘aam 6:155-157].\nAnd there are many similar verses which indicate that proof cannot be established except after knowledge has been conveyed and explained.\nWith regard to the Sunnah, in Saheeh Muslim (1/134) it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no one among this nation, Jew or Christian, hears of me then dies not believing in that with which I was sent, but he will be one of the people of the Fire.” \nWith regard to the words of the scholars, it says in al-Mughni (8/131):\nIf he is one of those who are not aware that (a certain ruling) is obligatory, such as one who is new in Islam, or one who grew up in a non-Islamic country, or in the wilderness far away from cities and scholars, then he is not to be deemed a disbeliever. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fataawa (3/229, Majmoo‘ Ibn Qaasim): \nI am always – and those who spent time with me know it – one of those who most emphatically forbid accusing a specific individual of being a disbeliever, or of being an evildoer or of being a sinner, unless it is known that proof based on the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah has been established against him, concerning matters which, if anyone goes against that proof, he is either a disbeliever, evildoer or sinner. I affirm that Allah, may He be exalted, has forgiven this ummah for its mistakes, which includes mistakes that have to do with beliefs or words uttered, or that have to do with actions and practices. The early generations kept disputing concerning many issues, but none of them accused another of being a disbeliever, evildoer or sinner. \n… I used to explain that what has been transmitted from the scholars and imams of the early generations, of stating in general terms that whoever says such and such becomes a disbeliever, is true and correct, but we must differentiate between general statements and a statement about a specific individual. \n… Regarding someone as a disbeliever is like a threat of punishment, because a person may even say something that implies rejection of what the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, but the person who says it may be new in Islam, or he may have grown up in the remote wilderness. Such a person cannot be accused of being a disbeliever for rejecting what he rejected, until proof is established against him. He may not have heard those texts, or he may have heard them but they were not proven to him to be sound, or the text may contradict something that is well-established in his mind, which dictated that he should interpret the text in a manner other than its apparent meaning, even though he may be mistaken. \nShaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab said in ad-Durr as-Saniyyah (1/56):\nWith regard to deeming a person to be a disbeliever, I regard as a disbeliever anyone who learns about the religion brought by the Messenger, then after learning it he reviles it and tells people not to follow it, and he opposes those who do follow it. This is the person whom I regard as a disbeliever. \nOn p. 66 he said: As for what they say of lies and fabrications about us, when they say that we label people as disbelievers in general terms, and we say that it is obligatory for anyone who is able to migrate to join us to do so, all of that is lies and fabrications by means of which they turn people away from the religion of Allah and His Messenger. As we do not regard as disbelievers those who worship the idol [i.e., the built-up tomb] on the grave of ‘Abd al-Qaadir, or the idol on the grave of Ahmad al-Badawi and the like, because of their ignorance and because there is no one to advise them, then how can we regard as a disbeliever the one who does not associate anything with Allah, just because he does not migrate to join us and does not regard others as disbelievers and fight them?! \nIf (the view mentioned above, which is not to regard anyone as a disbeliever until proof is established against him) is based on the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah and the words of the scholars, then it is also in accordance with the wisdom, kindness and mercy of Allah, may He be exalted. For He will never punish anyone until He has established proof that leaves them with no excuse. Reason could not, on its own, attain knowledge of the duties that one has towards Allah, may He be exalted. If that were possible, then proof would not depend on the sending of Messengers. \nTherefore the basic principle concerning the one who claims to be a Muslim is that he is to be regarded as a Muslim unless that description becomes no longer applicable on the basis of shar‘i evidence. \n… \nSo before deeming somebody to have become a disbeliever, two things must be examined. \nThe first is that there should be clear evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah that the matter in question makes a person a disbeliever, so as not to fabricate lies about Allah. \nThe second is that the ruling should be applicable to this specific individual, so that the conditions of deeming somebody to have become a disbeliever are met in his case, and it is established that there are no impediments to doing so. \nOne of the most important conditions is that he should be aware of his mistake that led to him being regarded as a disbeliever, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:115]. \nThis verse stipulates the condition that the punishment of Hell becomes due if a person opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him. But is it stipulated that he should be aware of the consequences of his infraction and that it leads to him becoming a disbeliever and so on, or is it sufficient for him to know that it is an infraction, even if he is unaware of the implications of his error?\nWhat appears to be the case is the latter, i.e., the mere fact of his being aware that it is an infraction is sufficient for the application of the ruling connected to this infraction, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) made it obligatory for the one who had intercourse during the day in Ramadan to offer expiation because he was aware that it was an infraction, even though he was not aware of the requirement of expiation. Moreover the previously-married zaani who is aware of the prohibition on zina is to be stoned, even if he was ignorant of the consequences of his zina, and perhaps if he had been aware of the consequences he would not have committed zina. …\nTo sum up, the one who is ignorant may be excused for what he says or does of that which may constitute disbelief, just as he may be excused for that which he says or does that may be regarded as evildoing. That is based on evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah, rational thinking, and the words of the scholars. \nMajmoo‘ Fataawa ash-Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (2/answer to question 224). \nII.\nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \nWe have read an answer you gave about the excuse of ignorance with regard to acts that lead to a person being deemed a disbeliever, but in the book Kashf ash-Shubuhaat by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab, he said there is no excuse for ignorance, and he said something similar in his book at-Tawheed. Even though in your answer you quoted the views of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab, and those of Ibn Taymiyah in al-Fataawa and of Ibn Qudaamah in al-Mughni. We hope that you can explain. \nHe replied: \nShaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allah have mercy on him) stated in his essays that no one is to be deemed a disbeliever if he is ignorant. If he is stated in Kashf ash-Shubuhaat that there is no excuse for ignorance, it is to be understood that what he was referring to was the kind of ignorance that results from a person being negligent in not making any effort to learn, such as if he knows that there is a view different to what he is following, but he is negligent and too careless to find out and learn. In that case, ignorance is not an excuse. \nDuroos wa Fataawa al-Haram al-Makki (1411 AH, tape 9, side A)\nIII. \nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Can a person be excused for ignorance regard to Tawheed? \nHe replied: \nThe excuse of ignorance is proven with regard to all issues of religion, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily, We have inspired you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) as We inspired Nooh (Noah) and the Prophets after him…\nMessengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers””\n[an-Nisa’ 163-165]\n“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)”\n[al-Isra’ 17:15]\n“And Allah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them as to what they should avoid”\n[at-Tawbah 9:115]. \nand because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no one among this nation, Jew or Christian, hears of me then dies not believing in that with which I was sent, but he will be one of the people of the Fire.”\nAnd there are many texts to that effect. \nTherefore the one who is ignorant will not be brought to account, because of his ignorance, with regard to any issue of religion. But we should note here that some of the ignorant are somewhat stubborn – i.e., when they are told about what is right and correct, they do not go and research the matter or follow it; rather they carry on following what their shaykhs and those whom they venerate teach them, and they follow them. In fact such an individual is not excused, because proof has reached him which at the very least should have created some doubt that would prompt him to go and search for the truth. This person who venerates whomever he venerates of his leaders is like those of whom Allah tells us that they said (interpretation of the meaning): “ ‘We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps’”[az-Zukhruf 43:22], and in the following verse, He tells us that they said: “ ‘We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps’” [az-Zukhruf 43:23].\nConclusion: \nThe ignorance for which a person may be excused is when he does not know the correct view and he has not been told about it. This is what excuses him for sin. The ruling on how this person is to be dealt with depends on his deeds. Moreover, if he claims to be a Muslim and he testifies that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, he is to be regarded as a Muslim. If he does not claim to be a Muslim, then in this world he is to be treated like the people of the religion that he claims to follow. As for the hereafter, then he comes under the same heading as the people of the period between Prophets, and his fate will be decided by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, on the Day of Resurrection. The most correct view concerning them is that they will be tested however Allah wills; whoever among them obeys will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys will enter Hell. But it should be noted that we are living at a time where there is hardly any place on earth that the call of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has not reached through various media, and through people mixing with one another, and disbelief usually stems from stubbornness. \nMajmoo‘ Fataawa ash-Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (2/answer to question no. 222) \nIV. \nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \nWhat is the ruling on describing those who are excused for ignorance as holding the views of the Murji’ah? \nHe replied: \nAs for the excuse of ignorance, this is based on the general meanings of the texts, and no one can produce evidence to prove that the one who is ignorant is not to be excused. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)”\n[al-Isra’ 17:15]\n “Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:165]. \nWere it not for the excuse of ignorance, there would be no need to send the Messengers; people would be accountable on the basis of what is instilled in their innate nature, and there would be no need to send the Messengers. The excuse of ignorance is what is indicated by the Qur’an and Sunnah, as was stated by the leading scholars such as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), and Shaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allah have mercy on him). But a person may be negligent in seeking knowledge, so he is sinning in that respect. In other words, it may be possible for him to learn, but he does not care to do so; or he may be told that something is haraam, but he does not care. In this case he is falling short in this regard and he is sinning thereby. As for a man who lives among people who commit a sin and think that it is permissible, then we say that he is accountable for his sin, when the message did not reach him, this is far-fetched. In fact we cannot issue rulings on the basis of our emotions; rather we issue rulings on the basis of what is indicated by sharee‘ah. The Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, says: “My mercy prevails over My wrath.” So how can we take a person to task for his ignorance when it has never crossed his mind that this is haraam? In fact Shaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We do not regard as kaafirs those who placed an idol [i.e., a built-up tomb] on the grave of ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilani or on the grave of al-Badawi, because of their ignorance and the lack of anyone to advise them. \nLiqaa’aat al-Baab al-Maftooh (33/question no. 12). \nV. \nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nBut there remains the issue of a man who was negligent and put no effort into seeking the truth, because he was heedless and he saw what people were doing and did likewise, without researching the matter. Such a person may be sinning; in fact he may be falling short in seeking the truth, and he may not be excused in this case. Or he may be excused if it never occurred to him that this action was an infraction but he had no scholar to advise him. In this case he may be excused. Hence the most correct view is that if someone lives in the wilderness, far away from the cities, and he did not fast Ramadan because he thought that it was not obligatory, or he used to have intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadan, thinking that doing so was permissible, then he does not have to make up the fast, because he was ignorant, and one of the conditions of being accountable for adhering to sharee‘ah is that the accountable person should have heard of the ruling and learned of it. \nTo sum up: a person may be excused for ignorance, but he will not be excused for falling short in seeking knowledge of the truth. \nLiqaa’aat al-Baab al-Maftooh (39/question no. 3) \nVI. \nThe Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \nWhat is your view on one who says Laa ilaaha ill-Allah Muhammad Rasoolullah, then he slaughters a sacrifice for something other than Allah? Is he a Muslim? Please note that he grew up in a Muslim country. \nThe Shaykh said: \nThe one who seeks to draw close to something other than Allah by means of offering a sacrifice to it is a mushrik in the sense of major shirk, and he will not benefit from saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, or from praying or any other deed, unless he grew up in a remote land, where the people did not know of this ruling. In that case he is excused for his ignorance, but he should be taught, like one who lives in a remote land where they offer sacrifices to something other than Allah, such as offering sacrifices to graves or to the awliya’ (“saints”), and they do not see anything wrong with that, and they do not know that this is shirk or that it is haraam. Such a person may be excused for his ignorance. But as for a person who is told that this constitutes disbelief, but he says: No, I will not stop offering sacrifices to the “saint”, in this case proof has been established against him, so he is to be deemed a disbeliever. \nQuestioner: \nIf he is given advice and told that this is shirk (but he persists in it), can I describe him as a mushrik or kaafir? \nShaykh: \nYes, he is a mushrik, kaafir and apostate. He should be asked to repent, and if he repents, all well and good; otherwise he is to be executed. \nQuestioner: \nIs there a difference between issues that are very clear and issues that are subtle and ambiguous? \nShaykh: \nThat which is ambiguous needs to be discussed, such as this issue. If we assume that he says: “I live among people who slaughter sacrifices to the saints (awliya’), and I do not know that this is haraam,” then this matter is ambiguous for him, because what is ambiguous or clear is something relative. That which is clear to me may be ambiguous to you, and that which is clear to you may be ambiguous to me. \nQuestioner: \nHow can I establish proof against him? What is the proof that I should present to him? \nShaykh: \nThe proof against him is what it says in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)): ‘Verily, my Salat (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists).\n‘He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded…’”\nAl-An‘aam 6:162, 163]\n“Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad (Peace be upon him)) Al-Kauthar (a river in Paradise),\nTherefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only)”\n[al-Kawthar 108:1, 2]. \nThis indicates that offering sacrifices as a means of drawing close and veneration is an act of worship, and whoever directs worship to anything or anyone other than Allah is a mushrik. \nIf proof is conveyed and he is told that this act of his constitutes shirk (but he persists in it), then he no longer has any excuse for doing it. \nQuestioner: \nShould he be told then? \nShaykh: \nHe has to be told. \nQuestioner:\nThere is a specious argument which says that his action is shirk but he is not a mushrik. How should we respond?\nShaykh:\nThis is correct. He is not a mushrik if no proof has been established against him. Didn’t the one who said “O Allah, You are my slave and I am your Lord” speak words of disbelief? Yet he did not become a disbeliever thereby, because he made that mistake out of extreme joy (at finding his lostcamel in the wilderness, as mentioned in a lengthy hadith). Is it not the case that the one who is forced to disbelieve may disbelieve outwardly but he does not do so in his heart, for his heart is at ease with faith? With regard to the scholars who say that a word of disbelief is distinct from the one who utters it, this applies if no proof has been established and we do not know his situation. But if we do know his situation, then what do we do now? Do we say that he cannot be deemed a disbeliever? Does it mean that no one can be deemed a disbeliever, or that no one can become a disbeliever, and even the one who does not pray cannot be described as a disbeliever? Even Ibn Taymiyah said that if proof reached him, then proof has been established against him (and he is left with no excuse). … It is not enough for proof to reach him, unless he also understands it, because if we assume that someone is a non-Arab and we recite the Qur’an to him morning and evening, , but he does not know what it means, can we say that proof has been established against him? Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We sent not a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order that he might make (the Message) clear for them”\n[Ibraaheem 14:4].\nLiqaa’aat al-Baab al-Maftooh (48/question no. 15)\nWe hope that the matter has become clear, and that you understand the meaning of what Shaykh ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said, and that his view is that ignorance is an excuse. This is applicable in the case of one who is new in Islam, or one who lives far away from places of knowledge, or who lives among people to whom it has never occurred that they are going against Islamic teachings, even though in fact their actions are causing them to fall into major shirk.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, a prominent Saudi Islamic scholar and jurist, held views on the idea of the \"excuse of ignorance\" (jahl) in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh). He emphasized that ignorance can be a legitimate excuse under certain circumstances, particularly in relation to rulings of Islam that are not well known to individuals or communities.\n\n1. **Types of Ignorance**: Ibn ‘Uthaymeen differentiated between types of ignorance. There is a type of ignorance that is considered excusable, such as when a person has not been informed about a particular ruling or does not know it is obligatory. On the other hand, ignorance that stems from negligence, lack of effort in seeking knowledge, or willful disregard of Islamic teachings is typically not excusable.\n\n2. **Context of Ignorance**: The context and circumstances of the individual's knowledge play a vital role in determining whether ignorance is a valid excuse. For example, someone living in a remote area with little access to Islamic knowledge might be excused for failing to learn certain rulings. However, those living in a well-connected society where knowledge is accessible might not be excused for the same ignorance.\n\n3. **Accountability**: Ibn ‘Uthaymeen highlighted that while ignorance can be a mitigating factor, it does not completely absolve one of accountability. A person is still encouraged to seek knowledge actively, as ignorance is generally not a valid excuse for actions that are clearly prohibited in Islam.\n\n4. **Principle of Relief**: He also pointed out the principle of relief in Islam, which denotes that Allah does not burden a person beyond what they can bear. Therefore, if a person genuinely did not know, and they acted according to their understanding, then they could be judged with leniency.\n\nIn summary, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen acknowledged the concept of the \"excuse of ignorance\" in Islam, clarifying that it can apply in specific situations, particularly where individuals have made sincere efforts to seek knowledge or where they lack access to it. However, he emphasized the importance of striving to learn and understand Islamic obligations and prohibitions."

        "question": "Is there scholarly consensus on all ten things which nullify Islam that were mentioned by Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The things that nullify Islam are ten; they were mentioned by Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab, and there is scholarly consensus on all of them except one, namely sihr (magic, witchcraft), which is subject to further discussion, but with regard to some forms of it, the scholars are unanimously agreed that it nullifies Islam, as we shall see below. \nWe may sum up these things that nullify Islam as follows: \n1. Shirk or associating others in worship with Allah, may He be exalted\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:48]\n“Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers”\n[al-Maa’idah 5:72]. \nThat includes: calling upon the dead, seeking their help, and making vows and offering sacrifices to them. \nThe evidence for this in the Qur’an and Sunnah is more than can be listed, and the scholarly consensus on this point is well established. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe basis of shirk (ascription of partners to Allah) is when you equate Allah, may He be exalted, with His creation in terms of some of that which He alone deserves to have ascribed to Him, because no one ever equated anything to Allah in all respects. So whoever worships anything other than Him, or puts his trust in that thing is a mushrik who has associated something else with Him.\nEnd quote from al-Istiqaamah (1/344) \nIbn ‘Abd al-Haadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a person comes to the bier of a dead person, calling upon him instead of Allah and seeking his help, this is shirk and is haraam according to Muslim consensus.\nEnd quote from as-Saarim al-Munki (p. 436) \n2. Ascribing intermediaries to Allah\nWhoever makes intermediaries between him and Allah, calls upon them, asks them to intercede for him and puts his trust in them, is a disbeliever according to scholarly consensus. \nThe evidence for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And they worship besides Allah things that hurt them not, nor profit them, and they say: ‘These are our intercessors with Allah.’ Say: ‘Do you inform Allah of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?’ Glorified and Exalted be He above all that which they associate as partners with Him!”\n[Yoonus 10:18].\n Whoever does that is akin to those who worship idols. \nHence Ibn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Furoo‘ (3/553):\nBecause that is like the deeds of idol worshippers who say: We only worship them so that they may bring us closer to Allah. End quote. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhoever makes the angels and Prophets intermediaries, calling upon them, putting his trust in them, asking them to bring benefits and ward off harm – such as asking them for forgiveness of sins, guidance, relief of distress and meeting of needs – is a disbeliever according to Muslim consensus.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (1/124) \nThe scholars learned about this consensus from Shaykh al-Islam, and confirmed it in their books, in the chapters on the rulings on apostates, as was quoted by al-Mirdaawi in al-Insaaf (10/327), where he says:\nThe same ruling applies if he makes intermediaries between himself and Allah, putting his trust in them, calling upon them and asking of them. That is according to scholarly consensus. End quote. \nSee: Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ by al-Bahooti (6/168); al-Furoo‘ by Ibn Muflih (3/553) \n3. Not regarding the mushrikeen as kuffaar (disbelievers)\nWhoever does not regard the mushrikeen as kuffaar (disbelievers) and doubts whether they are disbelievers, or regards their beliefs are sound, is himself a disbeliever. \nWith regard to this nullifier of Islam, there is scholarly consensus that the one who does this is a disbeliever. What is meant by the “mushrikeen” here is one who was originally a disbeliever. Connected to them are those who commit an act of apostasy on which the scholars are unanimously agreed that it is definitely apostasy, with regard to an issue that is well-known to be a fundamental part of the religion, such as one who denies the resurrection, or who rejects a verse of the Book of Allah, and other clear causes of apostasy concerning which there is no ambiguity.\nAl-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that there was scholarly consensus on this matter, and he said:\nThere is consensus that one who does not regard any of the Jews and Christians as disbelievers, or does not regard anyone who leaves the religion of the Muslims as a disbeliever, or does not take a stand with regard to this issue, or is unsure about it, is himself a disbeliever. \nEnd quote from ash-Shifa’ (2/281) \nSee also the answer to question no.  210595 \n4. Believing that the guidance of someone other than the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is more perfect than his guidance, etc\nWhoever believes that the guidance of someone other than the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is more perfect than his guidance, or that the rule of someone other than him is better than his rule, such as those who prefer the rule of man-made laws over the Prophet’s rulings, is a kaafir (disbeliever). \nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis category includes those who believe that the systems and laws invented by people are superior to the sharee‘ah of Islam, or that they are equal to it, or that it is permissible to refer to them for judgement, even if they believe that judging according to sharee‘ah is preferable; and those who believe that the Islamic system is not fit to be applied in the twentieth century, or that it was a cause of the Muslims’ decline, or that it should be limited to a person’s relationship with his Lord, and should have nothing to do with other matters of life. \nThat also includes those who think that implementing the rulings of Allah with regard to cutting off the hand of the thief or stoning the previously-married adulterer is not appropriate in the present age. And it also includes everyone who believes that it is permissible to rule by something other than the laws of Allah in the case of transactions, hudood punishments, and other matters, even if they do not believe that that is preferable to the ruling of sharee‘ah, because by doing that they are regarding as permissible that which Allah has prohibited, according to scholarly consensus, and whoever regards as permissible that which Allah has prohibited, and that is one of the well-known fundamental teachings of the religion – such as zina, alcohol, riba, and ruling by something other than the laws of Allah – is a disbeliever according to Muslim consensus. \nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz (1/132) \nIn fatwa no. 111923 we stated that there is scholarly consensus regarding this nullifier of Islam. \n5. Hating something that was brought by the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)\nWhoever hates something that was brought by the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), even if he complies with it, is a disbeliever, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“That is because they hate that which Allah has sent down (this Quran and Islamic laws, etc.), so He has made their deeds fruitless”\n[Muhammad 47:9]. \nThere is scholarly consensus that the one who hates that which was brought by the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is a disbeliever, as was stated by al-Bahooti in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (6/168). \n6. Ridiculing any aspect of the religion of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)\nWhoever ridicules any part of the religion of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or its promises of reward or warnings of punishment, is a disbeliever. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“…Say: ‘Was it at Allah and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that you were mocking?’\nMake no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed”\n[at-Tawbah 9:65-66]. \nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe foundation of Islam is built on veneration of Allah and respect for His religion and His Messengers, and any mockery thereof is contrary to this principle and is in sharp contrast to it.\nEnd quote from Tayseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan (p. 342) \nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAll the scholars are unanimously agreed that if the Muslim reviles or criticises the religion, or reviles or criticises the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or ridicules him, then he is an apostate and a disbeliever, who may be executed and his wealth seized.\nEnd quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb (1/139) \nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 163627 \n7. Sihr (magic or witchcraft)\nWhoever does that or approves of it is a disbeliever. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, ‘We are only for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us)’”\n[al-Baqarah 2:102]. \nWith regard to this nullifier of Islam, there is no scholarly consensus on all forms of it. \nSo if the practitioner of witchcraft does something that constitutes kufr (disbelief), such as disrespectfully handling a copy of the Qur’an, or prostrating to the devils, and the like, then he is a disbeliever according to scholarly consensus. \nBut if he does not do any such things, then most of the scholars are of the view that he is also a disbeliever just because of his practising magic or witchcraft. This has been discussed previously in fatwa no. 69914 \nWe also referred to the difference of scholarly opinion concerning this matter in fatwa no. 13914 \nFor more information, please see fatwa no. 148099 \n8. Supporting the mushrikeen and helping them against the Muslims.\nThe evidence for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if any amongst you takes them as Auliya (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust).”\n[al-Maa’idah 5:51]. \nWhat is meant by that is if a Muslim helps, supports and aids the disbelievers against the Muslims, and he forms an alliance with their party, instead of the party of the believers. \nIn his commentary on the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning), “Let not the believers take the disbelievers as Auliya (supporters, helpers, etc.) instead of the believers, and whoever does that will never be helped by Allah in any way” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:28], At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nDo not, O believers, take the disbelievers as a source of help and support or ally yourself with them in support of their religion, supporting them against the Muslims instead of the believers, and telling them about the Muslims’ weak points, for whoever does that “will never be helped by Allah in any way”. What is meant is that he has disavowed Allah and Allah has disavowed him because of his apostasy from His religion and his becoming a disbeliever. “except if you indeed fear a danger from them” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:28], that is, unless you are under their rule and you fear that they may kill you, so you pay lip service to giving them support, whilst concealing enmity towards them in your hearts, and you do not support them in what they are following of disbelief or help them against any Muslim in any way.\nEnd quote from Tafseer at-Tabari (3/140) \nThe scholars of Morocco issued a fatwa stating that Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah as-Sa‘di, one of the kings of Marrakesh, became a disbeliever when he sought the help of the King of Portugal against his paternal uncle. \nSee: al-Istiqsaa’ li Akhbaar Duwal al-Maghrib al-Aqsa (2/70) \nIn al-Qada’ min Nawaazil al-Imam al-Burzuli (may Allah have mercy on him) it says that the ruler of the Muslims, Yoosuf ibn Taashfeen al-Lamtooni (may Allah have mercy on him) asked the scholars of his time (may Allah be pleased with them) about Ibn ‘Abbaad al-Andalusi writing to the Franks (i.e., Christians) asking for help against the Muslims. Most of them (may Allah be pleased with them) replied that he was an apostate and a disbeliever.\nSee: al-Istiqsaa li Akhbaar Duwal al-Maghrib al-Aqsa (5/75) \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on) issued a fatwa concerning those who joined the Tatars and fought the Muslims, stating that such a person was an apostate, and he said: \nIf the Sahaabah called those who withheld zakaah apostates – even though they fasted and prayed, and did not fight the main body of the Muslims – then how about those who have joined the enemies of Allah and His Messenger to fight the Muslims? \nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Shaykh al-Islam (28/530-531) \n9. Believing that it is permissible for some people to go beyond the bounds of sharee‘ah (and follow a religion other than Islam)\nWhoever believes that it is permissible for some people to go beyond the bounds of the sharee‘ah of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) (and follow a religion other than Islam) is a disbeliever, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:85]. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is well known in Islam, and all the Muslims are unanimously agreed, that whoever thinks that any religion other than Islam is valid, or that following a set of laws other than the laws of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is acceptable, is a disbeliever. This is like the disbelief of one who believes in part of the Qur’an and disbelieves in part of the Qur’an. \nEnd quote from al-Fataawa al-Kubra (3/543) \n10.  Turning away from the religion of Allah, and not learning it or acting in accordance with it\nThe evidence for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, then he turns aside therefrom? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the Mujrimoon (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, etc.)”\n[as-Sajdah 32:22].\nWhat is meant by the “disbelief of turning away” is turning away from that which the Messenger brought, not paying any attention to it, not learning it from him, and not paying it any heed.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the “disbelief of turning away”, it means turning away from the Messenger and ignoring him, neither believing him nor disbelieving him, neither taking him as an ally nor taking him as an enemy, and not paying any attention to what he brought at all.\nEnd quote from Madaarij as-Saalikeen (1/347)\nShaykh ‘Abd al-Lateef ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Hasan Aal ash-Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in a detailed response concerning that:\nPeople’s conditions vary greatly, and they vary according to their level of faith. This applies if faith is present in the first place, but negligence has to do with things that are less important than faith, such as some deeds that are obligatory or mustahabb.\nBut if there is no faith at all – meaning a kind of faith by which a person is  regarded as a Muslim – and he turns away from it altogether, then this is the “disbelief of turning away”, concerning which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And surely, We have created many of the jinns and mankind for Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not, they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not (the truth). They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones”\n[al-A‘raaf 9:179]\n“But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Quran nor acts on its orders, etc.) verily, for him is a life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection”\n[Taa-Haa 20:124].\nBut you should understand that what matters is knowing the reality of faith, even if the expressions and wording vary.\nEnd quote.\nSee: Nawaaqid al-Eemaan al-I‘tiqaadiyyah by Dr Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahhaab al-Wuhaybi (128-129).\nWe have not come across anyone who said that there was scholarly consensus concerning this type of disbelief.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 142392\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic scholarship, the ten things that are said to nullify one’s Islam, as articulated by Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab, are often discussed, but there isn't a universally accepted scholarly consensus on the list. While the concepts are derived from the broader understanding of Islamic teachings, interpretations can vary among different scholars and schools of thought.\n\nThe ten nullifiers typically include acts that demonstrate a rejection of core beliefs or principles of Islam, such as associating partners with Allah (shirk), denying any of the fundamentals of Islam, or showing disdain for the religion. \n\nDifferent Islamic scholars may have differing views on the details of these nullifiers and their implications, as well as the circumstances under which they might apply. It is crucial for individuals to consult knowledgeable scholars from their own sect or tradition when considering sensitive matters of faith such as these. \n\nIn conclusion, while Imam Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab presented a significant list of nullifiers, individual interpretations and scholarly opinions can vary. It's important to approach such topics with careful consideration and seek guidance from qualified scholars."

        "question": "Extraordinary events that happen at the hands of non-Muslims are a test and a trial",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If you hear or see such stories, reports and cases, then remember two important things, that should be constantly borne in mind:\n1.\nRemember the Dajjaal, who is mentioned in mutawaatir hadiths which tell us that he will emerge at the end of time; the books of Saheeh and Sunans are filled with such reports, in which it is proven that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will cause a number of apparently extraordinary feats to occur at his hands, as a test to people, to see whether they will follow him or reject him, because fitnah and trials cannot occur except through such great extraordinary feats, to the extent of raising the dead, causing crops to grow, bringing down rain, talking to animals, and so on. After that, will you believe any proponent of falsehood who claims to confirm his falsehood with some extraordinary feats?\nCan anyone other than the Dajjaal – among these practitioners of magic, charlatans, priests, monks, Buddhists, Sikhs, Hindus and atheists, and others who we see today performing extraordinary feats – can all of these people be stronger in influence and do greater extraordinary feats and performances, than the Dajjaal, such that we would believe in their religions and reject the Dajjaal?\nImam ash-Shaatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNot every extraordinary feat that occurs at the hands of the human being is a karaamah (miracle). Rather some of them may be karaamaat, whilst others are not.\nTo explain with examples: those who try to control things by concentrating their thoughts, and those who deal with astrology, may perform extraordinary feats, but it is all darkness upon darkness, and there is no way it could be sound or valid\nIf it involves focusing one’s thoughts on a thing until those thoughts have an impact on it, that is not proven by any religious text, and there is no basis for it at all. Rather the basis for that is philosophical and it has no basis in religious teaching. Even if this extraordinary feat, having an impact on the object, happens, that does not prove that it is sound or valid. It may even have a visible impact in the form of killing or wounding, and that impact may be reached by means of magic or the evil eye, and the like, but that does not prove that it is sound or valid. Rather it is completely invalid and is pure transgression. The common folk are usually deceived by that, as are many of the elite.\nEnd quote from al-Muwaafaqaat (2/444-446)\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nYou will find that in many such cases, their evidence to support their belief that someone is a wali or close friend of Allah is that he foretold some future events, or performed some extraordinary feats, such as pointing to a person and he died, or flying through the air to Makkah or elsewhere, or walking on water, or filling a vessel out of thin air, or spending some time in the unseen, or sometimes disappearing from people’s view, or people sought his help when he was absent or dead, then they saw him come and meet their needs, or telling people what has been stolen from them, or telling them how an absent loved one is doing, or healing a sick person, and so on.\nThere is nothing in any of these cases to indicate that the one who does them is a wali or close friend of Allah. Rather the close friends of Allah are unanimously agreed that if a man flies through the air or walks on water, no one should be deceived by him until he examines how closely he follows the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the extent to which he complies with his commands and prohibitions.\nThe karaamaat (miracles) of the awliya’ (close friends of Allah) are greater than these things. Even though the one who does these extraordinary feats may be a wali or close friend of Allah, he may also be an enemy of Allah, because these extraordinary feats may be done by many of the disbelievers, polytheists, people of the Book and hypocrites, or they may be done by followers of innovation and may even be done by the devils.\nSo it is not permissible to think that everyone who performs some of these feats is a close friend of Allah. Rather the close friends of Allah are to be recognised by their attributes, deeds and character as indicated by the Qur’an and Sunnah, and they are to be recognised by the light of faith and the Qur’an, and the level of faith they have in their hearts, and how they comply with the outward teachings of Islam.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (11/213)\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:\nAmong the various types of polytheists – such as the polytheists of the Arabs, and the polytheists of the Indians, Turks, Greeks and others – there are those who strive to seek knowledge, practice asceticism and engage in worship, but they are not following the Messengers, and they do not believe in the message they brought or accept what they told people, and they do not obey their commands. Such people are not believers and are not close friends of Allah; rather the devils become their close companions, and they descend upon them. So (these charlatans) may disclose some matters of the unseen to people, and they have extraordinary feats that are akin to magic. They are of the same ilk as the soothsayers and magicians upon whom the devils descend. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Shall I inform you (O people!) upon whom the Shayaateen (devils) descend?”\n[ash-Shu‘ara’ 26:221].\nAll of those who claim to be able to predict the future and perform extraordinary feats, if they are not following the Messengers, are inevitably lying, the devils are inevitably lying to them, and among their deeds there are inevitably actions that constitute sin and immorality, such as some type of shirk, wrongdoing, shameful deeds, exaggeration or innovation in worship. Therefore the devils descend upon them and become their close companions, and they become close friends of the Shaytaan, not close friends of the Most Gracious. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whosoever turns away (blinds himself) from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent (Allah) (i.e. this Quran and worship of Allah), We appoint for him Shaitan (Satan devil) to be a Qareen (an intimate companion) to him”\n[az-Zukhruf 43:36].\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (11/172)\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nExtraordinary feats may be granted to a heretic by way of letting him get carried away and become misguided, just as they may be granted to one who is strong and true in faith by way of honour and blessing. The only way to know the difference between them is by seeing which of them is following the Qur’an and Sunnah.\nEnd quote from Fath al-Baari (12/385)\nSecondly:\nWith regard to this issue, most – if not all – of what is circulated in the media today and what people see with their own eyes, that they think of as extraordinary feats, is nothing but tricks, deceit and optical illusions, or acting, no more and no less, to the point that believing that such things are extraordinary feats is very naive and foolish. There are dozens of research-based documentaries that explain these tricks and tell it as it is, explaining the methods of acting used by those who are involved in these so-called feats. The most recent example is what happened to one of the most famous magicians, who flew through the air before an audience, but soon the media showed what really happened, which was that he was suspended by very fine yet very strong threads that were barely visible to the eye.\nFor more information, please see: Talbees Iblees by Ibn al-Jawzi (p. 340-342)\nWe have also previously explained on our website that it is haraam to seek ruqyah from non-Muslims, especially priests and monks. Please see the following questions: 180492  and 147094\nConclusion:\nMost of what appears of extraordinary feats performed by people other than the righteous slaves of Allah is only tricks, deceit and acting. If any such thing happens for real, then it is more akin to the actions of magicians and soothsayers, or happens with the help of the jinn and the Shaytaan. The most that can be said of any of them is that he is like the Dajjal – then what?!\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, extraordinary events or miracles that occur through the hands of non-Muslims can indeed be understood as tests and trials. These events may serve various purposes:\n\n1. **Test of Faith**: Such occurrences can test the faith of believers. They might provoke questions about belief, the nature of God's power, and the understanding of divine wisdom.\n\n2. **Demonstration of God's Sovereignty**: Ultimately, all power and control belong to Allah. Extraordinary events, regardless of who performs them, can serve as a reminder that Allah's wisdom surpasses human understanding and that He can choose to manifest His signs in different ways.\n\n3. **Opportunity for Reflection**: For Muslims, witnessing extraordinary events can encourage reflection on one's faith and relationship with God. It can be an opportunity to seek deeper understanding and reinforce belief.\n\n4. **Call to Unity**: In some instances, such events might serve to call people toward unity and mutual understanding, encouraging dialogue between different faiths.\n\nIn conclusion, while extraordinary events by non-Muslims may challenge believers, Islam teaches that true faith requires resilience and the ability to discern signs from Allah, regardless of their source."

        "question": "What is the ruling on calling an illegitimate child after the father?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\t\tThe scholars are unanimously agreed that the bed is the \n\t\tbasic principle in establishing lineage. What is meant by the bed is \n\t\tmarriage between the man and the woman. \n\n\tHowever the scholars differed with regard to the zaani if he \n\twants to acknowledge his illegitimate child and call him after himself: does \n\tthat prove the child’s lineage in shar‘i terms, or not? There are two \n\twell-known views: \n\n\t1.\n\tThat the illegitimate child is not to be attributed to \n\tthe zaani even if he acknowledges him and names him after himself.\n\n\tThis is the view of most of the scholars of the four madhhabs, \n\tand of the Zaahiris (literalists) and others. \n\n\tBased on this view, the illegitimate child – whether male or \n\tfemale – is not to be attributed to the zaani and is not to be described as \n\this child; rather he is to be attributed to his mother, and he is a mahram \n\tto her and inherits from her like her other children. \n\n\tFatwas were issued on the basis of this view by Shaykh Ibn \n\tIbraaheem, as in his Fataawa (11/146); Shaykh Ibn Baaz, as in \n\tMajmoo‘ al-Fataawa (18/124); and by the Standing Committee (al-Lajnah \n\tad-Daa’imah, 20/387). \n\n\tThat is because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n\tupon him) said: “The child is to be attributed to the bed (i.e., to the \n\thusband) and the adulterer deserves nothing.” Agreed upon. The relevant \n\tpoint here is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n\tdid not describe the child as belonging to anyone other than the bed (i.e., \n\tthe husband), and he said that the adulterer did not deserve anything at \n\tall. Attributing the child to the adulterer is attributing the child to \n\tsomeone other than the husband. \n\n\tThe words: “The child is to be attributed to the husband” \n\timply that attribution of the child is to be to the marriage only. \n\n\t2.\n\tThat if the zaani acknowledges his illegitimate child, \n\tthen he is to be attributed to him.\n\n\tThis is the view of ‘Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, Sulaymaan ibn \n\tYasaar, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibn Sireen, Ibraaheem an-Nakha‘i, and Ishaaq ibn \n\tRaahawayh, as was narrated from them by Ibn Qudaamah in al-Mughni \n\t(9/123) \n\n\tThis view was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may \n\tAllah have mercy on him) and his student Ibn al-Qayyim. \n\n\tAmong contemporary scholars it was also favoured by Shaykh \n\tMuhammad Rasheed Rida in Tafseer al-Manaar (4/382), and by Shaykh Ibn \n\t‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him), as in ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ \n\t(12/127). \n\n\tThat is because this child was born from his sperm, so he is \n\this son in reality, and there is no clear, sound, shar‘i evidence to \n\tindicate that he should not be attributed to him. \n\n\tWith regard to the hadith “The child is to be attributed to \n\tthe bed (i.e., to the husband) and the adulterer deserves nothing”, it \n\trefers to the case where there is a marriage, and the issue under discussion \n\there has to do with a case where there is no marriage. \n\n\tThis is supported by what is mentioned in the story of the \n\tdevoted worshipper Jurayj, when he spoke to the child whose mother had \n\tcommitted zina with the shepherd: “He said: ‘Who is your father, O child?’ \n\tThe child said: ‘The shepherd.’” Agreed upon. \n\n\tThe speech of this infant was by way of a miracle and \n\textraordinary event bestowed by Allah, and he stated that the shepherd was \n\this father, even though the relationship was one of zina. This proves that \n\tpaternity may be attributed to the zaani. \n\n\tMoreover, the Lawgiver seeks to protect lineages and take \n\tcare of children, and to give them the best upbringing and protect them from \n\tbeing lost. \n\n\tWe have previously discussed the matter in detail and \n\texplained the different scholarly opinions concerning it, and the evidence \n\tfor each view, in the answer to question no. 192131. \n\n\tConclusion: \n\n\tThe view that it is forbidden or permissible (to attribute an \n\tillegitimate child to his father) are two scholarly views that carry weight. \n\tThis issue is one of the matters that are open to ijtihaad, so every case \n\tshould be examined on its own merits. If the child will miss out on some \n\treligious or worldly interests (by not being attributed to his father), then \n\twe should adopt the view that it is permissible to attribute him to his \n\tfather, in the interest of protecting him and ensuring that he will be taken \n\tcare of, which is a legitimate shar‘i interest. \n\n\tAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, an illegitimate child, often referred to as a child born out of wedlock, cannot be attributed to the father. Islamic law (Sharia) maintains that lineage and inheritance rights are established through a legitimate marriage. \n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) stated that \"the child belongs to the bed\" (i.e., the marriage), meaning that the lineage is traced through lawful unions. Therefore, it's prohibited to call an illegitimate child by the name of the biological father, as this would imply a legal status that does not align with Islamic principles. \n\nInstead, such a child may use the mother's surname or a surname that does not attribute them to their biological father. This ruling aims to uphold the sanctity of marriage and protect the rights of all parties involved. It's important for the community to treat all individuals with compassion and dignity, regardless of their circumstances."

        "question": "Guidelines regarding the kind of misinterpretation that does not constitute kufr on the part of the one who follows that misinterpretation, and some other comments on this issue",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\t\tThis issue is very important, and we will discuss it in \n\t\tthe following points: \n\n\t-1-\n\n\tThere is no difference between excusing a person for forming \n\ta mistaken idea on the basis of a misinterpretation and excusing him for his \n\tignorance of the religion; in fact the one who bases his mistaken idea on \n\tmisinterpretation is more deserving of being excused than one who is \n\tignorant, because he is not ignorant of what he has to believe; rather he \n\tbelieves that it (whatever he believes) is true, and he quotes evidence for \n\tit and defends it. It makes no difference whether the matter in question, \n\tfor which the one who bases his idea on a misinterpretation, is a practical \n\tmatter or a theoretical matter. \n\n\tShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid: The one who bases his idea on a misinterpretation, if his intention is \n\tto follow the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he is \n\tnot to be regarded as a kaafir or as an evildoer, if he tried to work it out \n\tbut got it wrong. This is something that is well established among people \n\twith regard to practical matters. With regard to matters of belief, many \n\tpeople regard as a kaafir the one who has mistaken notions concerning them, \n\tbut this view is not known from any of the Sahaabah or those who followed \n\tthem in truth, or from any of the leading scholars of the Muslims. Rather \n\tthis was originally one of the views of the innovators.\n\n\tEnd quote from Minhaaj as-Sunnah (5/239) \n\n\t-2-\n\n\tThis does not mean that they do not deserve the hadd \n\tpunishment, as Qudaamah ibn Maz‘oon was given the hadd punishment with \n\tregard to his view which was based on his misinterpretation concerning the \n\tdrinking of alcohol – and it does not mean that they do not deserve \n\tpunishment and blame, or even that their ideas do not deserve to be \n\tdescribed as misguidance or disbelief, as we shall see in detail below. In \n\tfact the matter may reach the level of fighting them, because the aim behind \n\tthat is to put people off this innovation and to protect the religion of \n\tIslam. \n\n\tShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid: What I have mentioned – about a Muslim who forsakes some obligatory \n\tduty or does some prohibited action on the basis of misinterpretation and \n\twrong conclusions, or as a result of following the view of others – is clear \n\tin my mind. Such a person is in a better position, with regard to his view, \n\tthan the disbeliever who bases his disbelief on misinterpretation and wrong \n\tnotions. But that does not rule out fighting the one who transgresses \n\t(against the Muslims) and holds views based on misinterpretation, or \n\tflogging the one who drinks alcohol and believes it to be permissible on the \n\tbasis of misinterpretation, and the like, for misinterpretation does not \n\twaive punishment in this world in all cases, for the aim of the punishment \n\tis to ward off the harm that may be caused by the action of the \n\ttransgressor. \n\n\tEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (22/14) \n\n\tAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tWith regard to the one who openly displays that which may be \n\tharmful (of actions or beliefs), his harm must be warded off even if that is \n\tby means of punishing him, and whether he is a Muslim who is an evildoer or \n\tsinner, or a man of good character who tried to work it out but got it \n\twrong, and indeed even if he is a righteous man or a scholar, whether he is \n\tone over whom we have power or otherwise (we should still try to ward off \n\this harm)… Similarly, whoever promotes bid‘ah that may harm people with \n\tregard to their religious wellbeing should be punished even though he may be \n\texcused for having tried to work it out (but got it wrong) or for having \n\tfollowed the view of someone else. \n\n\tEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (10/375) \n\n\t-3-\n\n\tNot every alternative interpretation is justifiable or \n\texcusable according to sharee‘ah. No alternative interpretation is \n\tacceptable with regard to the twin testimony of faith, the Oneness of Allah, \n\tmay He be exalted, the affirmation of the message of the Prophet (blessings \n\tand peace of Allah be upon him), the resurrection, or Paradise and Hell. \n\tCalling this  an alternative interpretation in the first place is not \n\tacceptable; rather this is a baatini and heretical approach that leads to \n\tinvalidation of religion. \n\n\tAbu Haamid al-Ghazaali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It \n\tis essential to point out another principle, which is that if a person holds \n\ta view that is contrary to a mutawaatir text and claims that it is just an \n\talternative interpretation, but his view that is based on misinterpretation \n\tis far removed from the linguistic meaning, and is not close at all, rather \n\tit is very far-fetched, this is tantamount to kufr and the one who holds \n\tthat view is a liar, even if he claims to base his view on his own \n\tinterpretation. An example of that is what I have read in the words of some \n\tof the Baatinis, that Allah, may He be exalted, is One in the sense that He \n\tgrants and creates oneness, and He is All-Knowing in the sense that He \n\tgrants knowledge to others and creates it, and He exists in the sense that \n\tHe brings others into existence. But as for Him being One in Himself, or \n\texisting or being All-Knowing in the sense that this is His own attribute, \n\tthat is not correct according to their view. This is blatant kufr, because \n\tinterpreting oneness as creating oneness cannot be an alternative \n\tinterpretation at all, and it has no basis in the Arabic language, and it is \n\tnot possible to interpret it in this way at all. These are all examples of \n\twords of disbelief described as alternative interpretations.\n\n\tEnd quote from Faysal at-Tafriqah (p. 66, 67). \n\n\tIbn al-Wazeer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Similarly, \n\tthere is no difference of opinion regarding the kufr of one who rejects that \n\twhich is well-known and well-established to all, and tries to conceal it \n\twith the excuse of giving his own interpretation with regard to something \n\tthat cannot be interpreted in any way other than its apparent meaning, such \n\tas the heretics in their misinterpretation of all the divine names, and even \n\tof the entire Qur’an and all the rulings of Islam, and matters of the \n\thereafter such as the resurrection and Paradise and Hell.\n\n\tEnd quote from Eethaar al-Haqq ‘ala al-Khalq (p. 377) \n\n\t-4-\n\n\tThe kind of interpretation that may be valid is that which \n\tdoes not lead to undermining the religion of Islam, is acceptable on a \n\tlinguistic basis according to the rules of the Arabic language, and the one \n\twho holds this view sincerely intends to seek the truth in accordance with \n\tthe principles of knowledge. Such people have a valid excuse if their \n\tinterpretation turns out to be wrong. This is the very excuse which the \n\tscholars mentioned with regard to the reasons why scholars may have \n\tdifferent views on practical matters. \n\n\tShaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is \n\thow we should examine people’s statements in cases where the one who holds \n\tsuch a view becomes a kaafir. The texts that could help a person to reach \n\tthe right conclusion may not have reached a scholar; or he may have been \n\taware of them but they were not proven to him to be sound or he was not able \n\tto understand them; or he may have developed some misunderstanding because \n\tof which Allah may excuse him. Whoever among the believers strives his \n\tutmost to seek the truth, but then reaches a wrong conclusion, Allah will \n\tforgive his mistake, no matter what it is, whether it has to do with \n\ttheoretical or practical issues. This is the view of the Companions of the \n\tProphet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the majority of the \n\tleading scholars of Islam.\n\n\tEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (23/346). \n\n\tAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The \n\tscholars said: Anyone who reaches a wrong conclusion but may be excused for \n\this misinterpretation is not a sinner, provided that his interpretation may \n\tbe valid from a linguistic point of view and that he has some measure of \n\tknowledge.\n\n\tEnd quote from Fath al-Baari (12/304) \n\n\t-5-\n\n\tThere is a saheeh hadith which indicates that if a person has \n\ta wrong view on ‘aqeedah (beliefs) that is based on misinterpretation, if \n\tthis misinterpretation will not lead to making religion appear meaningless, \n\tthen he is not a kaafir. That is the hadith in which the Prophet (blessings \n\tand peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Jews split into seventy-one \n\tsects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy in Hell. The Christians \n\tsplit into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which will be in Hell and one \n\tin Paradise.  My ummah will split into seventy-three sects, one of which \n\twill be in Paradise and seventy-two in Hell.” It was said: O Messenger of \n\tAllah, who are they? He said: “The jamaa‘ah (the main body of the Muslims).” \n\tNarrated by Ibn Maajah (3992); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. \n\n\tAbu Sulaymaan al-Khattaabi (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid:  The words “My ummah will split into seventy-three sects” indicates \n\tthat all these sects are not outside the boundaries of Islam, because the \n\tProphet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) described them all as \n\tbeing part of his ummah. This indicates that the one who holds a view that \n\tis based on some interpretation does not go beyond the bounds of Islam, even \n\tif he is mistaken in his interpretation.\n\n\tEnd quote from Ma‘aalim as-Sunan by al-Khattaabi \n\t(4/295). See also: as-Sunan al-Kubra by al-Bayhaqi (10/208) \n\n\tIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The same \n\tapplies to all seventy-two sects: whoever among them is a hypocrite is \n\tinwardly a disbeliever, and whoever is not a hypocrite – rather he believes \n\tin Allah and His Messenger inwardly – is not inwardly a disbeliever, even if \n\the is wrong in some views that are based on misinterpretation, no matter how \n\tserious his mistake. \n\n\tWhoever says that each of the seventy-two sects are kuffaar \n\twhose kufr puts them beyond the pale of Islam has gone against the Qur’an \n\tand Sunnah, and the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with \n\tthem), and indeed the consensus of the four imams and others. There is no \n\tone among them who ever regarded each of the seventy-two sects as kuffaar; \n\trather those sects may regard one another as kuffaar because of their views \n\tand beliefs.\n\n\tEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (7/218, 219) \n\n\t-6-\n\n\tThose among the scholars who ruled that some of those who \n\tfollow innovation – that does not constitute disbelief – are kuffaar were \n\treferring to kufr of a lesser degree than that which puts one beyond the \n\tpale of Islam. \n\n\tImam al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What we \n\thave narrated from ash-Shaafa‘i and other imams about regarding these \n\tinnovators as kuffaar only refers to lesser forms of kufr.\n\n\tEnd quote from Sunan al-Bayhaqi al-Kubra (10/207). \n\n\tImam al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ash-Shaafa‘i \n\tregarded it as permissible to accept the testimony of innovators and to pray \n\tbehind them, with no restrictions, even though he regarded that as makrooh. \n\tThis view of his indicates that if he describes some of them as kaafirs on \n\tany occasion, what he meant was lesser kufr, as in the verse in which Allah, \n\tmay He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever \n\tdoes not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the Kafiroon (i.e. \n\tdisbelievers - of a lesser degree as they do not act on Allah’s Laws)” [al-Maa’idah \n\t5:44]. \n\n\tEnd quote from Sharh as-Sunnah (1/228) \n\n\tImam ash-Shaafa‘i may have used the word kufr as a means of \n\twarning against that belief. \n\n\tShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid:\n\n\tIt may be narrated from one of them that he regarded as a \n\tkaafir one who held some view, but what he meant was that this view \n\tconstituted kufr, so as to warn against it; it does not necessarily mean \n\tthat if a view constitutes kufr, everyone who holds that view as the result \n\tof ignorance or misinterpretation of a text is to be regarded as a kaafir. \n\tAffirming kufr in the case of a specific individual is like a confirmation \n\tthat he is deserving of punishment in the Hereafter – and there are specific \n\tconditions and impediments with regard to doing that.\n\n\tEnd quote from Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah \n\t(5/240) \n\n\t-7-\n\n\tWith regard to the difference of opinion among the leading \n\tscholars concerning the people of bid‘ah who believe in an idea that that \n\tconstitutes kufr, and whether they are kaafirs or not, that is based on the \n\tdifference between regarding the view as constituting kufr and regarding a \n\tspecific individual as a kaafir. They may rule that a particular belief \n\tconstitutes kufr in itself, but they do not apply the ruling of kufr to any \n\tspecific individual who believes in that view, unless the conditions are met \n\tand the impediments are absent. \n\n\tShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid: \n\n\tBut what we are trying to say here is that the leading \n\tscholars’ views on takfeer (judging someone to be a kaafir) are based on \n\ttheir differentiation between the idea and the individual who holds this \n\tview. Hence some of them narrated that there was some dispute concerning \n\tthis matter, but these people did not properly understand what they said. \n\tSome narrated two reports from Ahmad concerning the issue of regarding the \n\tpeople of bid‘ah as kuffaar in all cases, to the point that it seems that \n\tthere was a conflict between these reports as to whether the Murji’ah and \n\tthe Shi‘ah who give precedence to ‘Ali are to be regarded as kuffaar. \n\tPerhaps this group (who narrated the two reports) thought that that they \n\tshould be regarded as kuffaar who will abide forever in Hell, but this is \n\tnot the view of Ahmad or any of the other leading scholars of Islam. Rather \n\this view is definitely that he did not regard as kuffaar the Murji’ah who \n\tsay that faith is words to be uttered and is not connected to deeds, and he \n\tdid not regard as kuffaar those who gave precedence to ‘Ali over ‘Uthmaan. \n\tRather his statements clearly indicate that we should refrain from regarding \n\tthe Khaarijis, Qadaris and others as kuffaar; and he only regarded as \n\tkuffaar the Jahamis who denied the names and attributes of Allah, because \n\ttheir views are clearly and obviously contrary to that which was brought by \n\tthe Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and because the \n\treality of their view is that it leads to denying the Creator. He had dealt \n\twith them and he knew about their reality and that their views boiled down \n\tto denial of the Creator. Moreover, regarding the Jahamis as kuffaar was \n\tsomething that was well established and was narrated from the early \n\tgenerations and the leading scholars, but he did not regard specific \n\tindividuals among them as kaafirs, because the one who promotes a view is \n\tworse than one who merely holds that view, and the innovator who persecutes \n\tthe one who disagrees with him is worse than one who merely calls to it, and \n\tthe one who describes anyone who disagrees with him as a kaafir is worse \n\tthan the one who merely persecutes him. Furthermore, those who were in \n\tauthority (at the time of Ahmad) held Jahami views, that the Qur’an was \n\tcreated, and that Allah would not be seen in the Hereafter, and so on, and \n\tthey called people to that, and tried them and punished them if they did not \n\tagree with them, and they regarded as kaafirs all those who did not agree \n\twith them, to the extent that if they arrested someone they would not let \n\thim go until he accepted the Jahami view that the Qur’an was created, and so \n\ton. They would not appoint anyone to a position of authority or give any \n\tstipend from the bayt al-maal to anyone, unless he held those views. Yet \n\tdespite that, Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) would pray for mercy \n\tfor them, and pray for forgiveness for them, because he knew that it was not \n\tclear to them that they were disbelieving in the Messenger (blessings and \n\tpeace of Allah be upon him) and rejecting what he had brought; rather they \n\tbased their views on the interpretation of some text, but they got it wrong \n\tand followed those who taught them that. \n\n\tSimilarly, when Hafs al-Fard said that the Qur’an was \n\tcreated,  ash-Shaafa‘i said to him: You have disbelieved in Allah the \n\tAlmighty, and he explained to him that this view constituted kufr. But he \n\tdid not rule that Hafs had apostatised just because he held that view, \n\tbecause proof had not yet been established to him such that he might be \n\tregarded as a kaafir if he rejected it. If ash-Shaafa‘i had believed that he \n\twas an apostate, he would have tried to get him executed. And he clearly \n\tstated in his books that testimony may be accepted from those who follow \n\tbid‘ah, and prayers may be offered behind them.\n\n\tEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (23/348, 349) \n\n\t-8-\n\n\tWith regard to the views of Ash‘aris in particular, there can \n\tbe no doubt that they have some wrong notions in their beliefs that are \n\tcontrary to the beliefs of the early generations, and they have prominent \n\tfigures among the scholars to whom they refer and whom they follow, but they \n\tare not all of the same level with regard to beliefs; rather there are \n\tdifferent schools of thought among them. The nearest of them to the three \n\tbest generations are the closest of them to the truth. By applying the \n\targument mentioned above (about differentiating between ideas and \n\tindividuals) to the Ash‘aris, we may realise that any of the scholars who \n\tregarded some of what they say as kufr was only referring to elements of \n\tkufr in their ideas, and it does not mean that he ruled that they themselves \n\tas individuals became kaafirs because of that, or that he meant anyone who \n\tholds this view is a kaafir. What he was referring to was a kind of lesser \n\tkufr. This group is not one of the sects that are beyond the bounds of \n\tIslam, and its individuals are not kaafirs. Rather they are to be excused, \n\tbecause they base their ideas on some misinterpretation with regard to what \n\tthey discussed of issues and beliefs. \n\n\tShaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I do \n\tnot know of anyone who regards the Ash‘aris as kaafirs.\n\n\tEnd quote from Thamaraat at-Tadween (no. 9) by Dr \n\tAhmad ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Qaadi \n\n\t-9-\n\n\tWe may sum up the shar‘i ruling on the innovating groups by \n\tquoting what Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid in a clear and scholarly comment: \n\n\tWhoever denies that which the Messenger (blessings and peace \n\tof Allah be upon him) brought, or denies some of it, without basing that on \n\tsome misinterpretation of a text by the people of bid‘ah, is a kaafir, \n\tbecause he has disbelieved Allah and His Messenger, and is too arrogant and \n\tstubborn to accept the truth. \n\n\t(a)\n\tWith regard to the innovator among the Jahamis, Qadaris, \n\tKhaarijis, Raafidis and their ilk, if he knows that his innovation is \n\tcontrary to the Qur’an and Sunnah, yet he persists in it and supports it, \n\tthen he is a disbeliever in Allah the Almighty, and is opposing Allah and \n\tHis Messenger after true guidance has become clear to him.\n\n\t(b)\n\tIf a person among the innovators believes in Allah and \n\tHis Messenger both outwardly and inwardly, and he venerates Allah and His \n\tMessenger, and adheres to that which was brought by the Messenger, \n\t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but he develops a notion or \n\tpractice that is contrary to the truth, and gets it wrong in some of his \n\tconclusions, and is wrong in some of his interpretations, without \n\tdisbelieving or rejecting the guidance that is clear to him, then he is not \n\ta kaafir, but he is an evildoer and an innovator, or he is a misguided \n\tinnovator, or he may be pardoned because the issue was too subtle for him \n\tand he put effort into finding out what was correct, but he did not succeed.\n\n\tHence the Khaarijis, Mu‘tazilah, Qadaris and other followers \n\tof bid‘ah are regarded as being of different categories: \n\n\t(a)\n\tSome of them are undoubtedly kaafirs, such as the extreme \n\tJahamis who denied the divine names and attributes, although they realised \n\tthat their innovation was contrary to that which had been brought by the \n\tMessenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Such people knowingly \n\tdisbelieved the Messenger.\n\n\t(b)\n\tSome of them are misguided innovators and evildoers, such \n\tas the Khaarijis who based their wrong views on misinterpretation, and the \n\tMu‘tazilah who do not disbelieve in the Messenger, but they were misguided \n\tbecause of their innovation, and thought that what they were following was \n\tthe truth. Hence the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were \n\tunanimously agreed that the Khaarijis were innovators and rebels, as was \n\tnarrated in the saheeh hadiths that speak of them. But they were also \n\tunanimously agreed that they were not beyond the bounds of Islam, even \n\tthough they regarded it as permissible to shed the blood of the Muslims, and \n\tthey denied that intercession may be granted for those who commit major \n\tsins, and they denied many other fundamentals of the religion. But because \n\tthey based their views on their misinterpretation of some text, they cannot \n\tbe regarded as kaafirs.\n\n\t(c)\n\tSome of the innovators held ideas that were less serious \n\tthan this, such as many of the Qadaris, and the Kilaabis and Ash‘aris. These \n\tpeople are innovators who are misguided with regard to some fundamental \n\tissues, in which they developed views that were contrary to the Qur’an and \n\tSunnah. This is something that is well known and well established. Their \n\tinnovation is of different levels, according to how far away from or close \n\tto the truth they are, and according to their transgressions against the \n\tfollowers of truth by labelling them as kuffaar, evildoers or innovators, \n\tand according to their ability to reach the right conclusion and their \n\tefforts to do so or otherwise. A detailed discussion of this matter would \n\ttake too long.\n\n\tEnd quote from Tawdeeh al-Kaafiyah ash-Shaafiyah \n\t(156-158) \n\n\tWe hope that what we have mentioned above has clarified the \n\tmatter for you. We ask Allah to help us and you to attain beneficial \n\tknowledge and do righteous deeds. \n\n\tAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of misinterpretation of religious texts can be complex, and scholars have provided guidelines to determine when a misinterpretation constitutes kufr (disbelief) or when it may be considered excusable. Here are some key points to understand this issue:\n\n1. **Intention and Knowledge**: A central factor in determining whether a misinterpretation is kufr involves the person's intention and knowledge. If someone genuinely misunderstands a concept or holds an erroneous belief due to a lack of knowledge or exposure to the correct teaching, this is typically not considered kufr. Many scholars agree that a person is judged based on their intention and the level of understanding they possess.\n\n2. **Sincerity in Seeking Truth**: If an individual is sincerely striving to learn and understand their faith, their misinterpretations may be viewed with compassion rather than condemnation. This is especially important for those who may not have access to proper education, scholarly guidance, or resources to learn accurately.\n\n3. **Type of Misinterpretation**: Misinterpretations that stem from cultural practices (as opposed to deliberate rejection of Islamic principles), or those that emerge from a common misunderstanding (not grounded in denial or opposition to the core tenets of Islam), often do not lead to kufr. Discrepancies in scholarly opinions (ijtihad) should also be approached with an understanding that different interpretations may exist among scholars.\n\n4. **Avoiding Takfir**: Takfir, the act of declaring someone a disbeliever, is a serious matter in Islamic jurisprudence. Scholars stress the importance of caution and prudence in declaring someone as having committed kufr, emphasizing that we should not hastily judge those who might be deviating from what we consider the correct path unless it is clear and evident.\n\n5. **Community and Non-judgment**: Engaging in respectful discourse, education, and support can help address misunderstandings without alienating individuals. The broader Muslim community should work towards fostering an environment of learning so that individuals are guided back to the correct interpretations.\n\n6. **Mutual Respect Among Scholars**: Differing opinions among scholars should be treated with respect. Acknowledging the legitimacy of varying viewpoints can prevent discord within the community and emphasizes the importance of scholarly dialogue.\n\nIn conclusion, the determination of whether a misinterpretation constitutes kufr or is excusable is a nuanced issue that requires considering factors such as intention, sincerity, context, and the broader Islamic teachings on compassion and understanding. It is advisable to consult knowledgeable scholars and engage in constructive learning to address any misconceptions while maintaining respect for the diversity within the Islamic community."

        "question": "Weakness of the hadeeth “The bonds of Islam and the foundations of the faith are three…”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      It was narrated by Abu Ya‘la \n      in his Musnad (2349), al-Laalkaa’i in Sharh I‘tiqaad Ahl as-Sunnah \n      (1576), Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in al-Istidhkaar (2/154) via Mu’ammil ibn \n      Ismaa‘eel: Hammaad ibn Zayd told us: ‘Amr ibn Maalik an-Nukri told us, \n      from Abu’l-Jawza’, from Ibn ‘Abbaas – Hammaad said: I do not know but that \n      he attributed it to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n      – he said: “The bonds of Islam and the foundations of the faith are three, \n      on which Islam is based; whoever forsakes one of them becomes a \n      disbeliever thereby whose blood may be shed. (They are) the testimony that \n      there is no God but Allah, the prescribed prayer, and fasting in \n      Ramadan.” \n\n    This is a da‘eef (weak) hadeeth; \n    there are several problems with it: \n\n    Firstly: Mu’ammil ibn Isma‘eel \n    has a poor memory. Abu Haatim said: He is sadooq and strictly adheres to the \n    Sunnah, but makes many mistakes. Al-Bukhaari said: his hadeeth is to be \n    rejected. Abu Zar‘ah said: there are many mistakes in his hadeeth.\n\n    Mizaan al-I‘tidaal \n    (4/228) \n\n    Secondly: it is mawqoof. \n    Someone who is more trustworthy disagreed with it and ended the isnaad with \n    Ibn ‘Abbaas. \n\n    Ibn Rajab said: \n\n    It was narrated by Qutaybah \n    from Hammaad ibn Zayd, who narrated it as a mawqoof hadeeth, and left it \n    incomplete and cut it short. \n\n    It was also narrated by Sa‘eed \n    ibn Zayd – the brother of Hammaad – from ‘Amr ibn Maalik in a marfoo‘ report \n    (i.e., attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him)). \n\n    The more correct view is that \n    it is mawqoof and the isnaad ends with Ibn ‘Abbaas. \n\n    End quote from Fath al-Baari \n    (1/23-24) \n\n    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah \n    have mercy on him) said: \n\n    It is most likely that this \n    hadith, if it has a basis that was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas, is mawqoof and \n    the isnaad ends with him. Hammaad ibn Zayd was hesitant about attributing it \n    to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Yes, S ‘eed ibn \n    Zayd, the brother of Hammaad, confirmed that it is to be attributed to the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but this Sa‘eed cannot \n    be taken as an authority, as as-Sa‘di said. An-Nasaa’i and others said: He \n    is not qawiy (strong).\n\n    End quote from Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth \n    ad-Da‘eefah (1/212). \n\n    Thirdly: ‘Amr ibn Maalik an-Nukri \n    was not regarded as trustworthy by anyone except Ibn Hibbaan. He is one of \n    the unknown narrators, because Ibn Hibbaan (may Allah have mercy on him) was \n    lenient in regarding narrators as trustworthy, but despite that he said in \n    his biography of him: His hadeeth, other than those narrated from him by his \n    son, are regarded as containing errors and being odd.\n\n    See: at-Tahdheeb (8/96) \n\n    Therefore this hadeeth is \n    da‘eef and is not saheeh in any report, whether it is attributed to the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or otherwise. It was \n    classed as da‘eef by al-Albaani in ad-Da‘eefah (94). \n\n    Even if we were to assume that \n    it is proven, it is to be understood – with regard to things other than the \n    prayer – as being a stern warning and that the disbelief mentioned is a \n    lesser kind of disbelief (minor kufr), or it is to be understood as \n    referring to the one who thinks it is permissible not to do these things. \n\n    Ibn Rajab said:\n\n    Ibn ‘Abbaas regarded forsaking \n    these pillars of Islam as constituting disbelief, but in some cases it is \n    disbelief that makes shedding blood permissible, and in other cases it is \n    not. This indicates that in some cases disbelief puts one beyond the pale of \n    Islam, and in other cases it does not. \n\n    Most of the scholars of hadeeth \n    are of the view that abandoning prayer constitutes disbelief, unlike other \n    pillars of Islam. This was narrated from them by Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Marwazi \n    and others.\n\n    End quote from Fath al-Baari \n    (1/25) \n\n    Al-Mannaawi (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said:\n\n    This hadeeth is more akin to a \n    warning and highlights the seriousness of the matter, or may be understood \n    as referring to the one who regards it as permissible to abandon these \n    pillars. \n\n    End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer \n    (4/311) \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    It was narrated by Imam Ahmad \n    (25121), Abu Ya‘la (4566), and al-Haakim (49) from ‘Aa’ishah that the \n    Messenger of Allah (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There \n    are three things I swear to: Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, does \n    not regard one who has a share in Islam like one who does not have a share. \n    The shares of Islam are three: prayer, fasting and zakaah. Allah, may He be \n    glorified and exalted, does not take care of anyone in this world then \n    abandon him to someone else on the Day of Resurrection. And no man loves \n    people but Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will join him to them. \n    And there is a fourth thing – if I swear to it, I hope that I will not be \n    sinning: Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, does not conceal a person’s \n    faults in this world but He will also conceal his faults on the Day of \n    Resurrection.” \n\n    It was classed as saheeh by al-Haakim. \n    Al-Haythami said:\n\n    It was narrated by Ahmad and \n    its men are thiqaat (trustworthy). It was also narrated by Abu Ya‘la.\n\n    End quote from Majma‘ \n    az-Zawaa’id (1/37) \n\n    Al-Busayri said in Ithaaf \n    al-Kheerah (1/102): Its isnad is jayyid \n\n    It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani \n    in as-Saheehah (1387) \n\n    This is the correct view. As \n    for the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas, it is da‘eef and is not saheeh as either a \n    marfoo‘ report or a mawqoof report, as stated above, so it cannot be quoted \n    as evidence. \n\n    See also the answer to question \n    no. 9400 and 106481\n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you are referring to, which speaks about the three fundamental principles of Islam, is often cited to highlight key aspects of the faith. However, if you are looking for information on its authenticity or weakness, it is essential to examine its chain of narration (isnad) and the text (matn) in detail.\n\nIf the hadith is classified as weak (da'if), this could be due to several factors, such as:\n\n1. **Issues with the Narrators**: Some narrators in the chain may not meet the criteria of trustworthiness (adalah) or accurate memory (dabt) required for strong hadiths.\n   \n2. **Break in the Chain**: There could be a break in the chain of transmission, meaning one or more narrators did not directly receive the hadith from their source.\n\n3. **Contradiction with Stronger Narrations**: The content of the hadith may contradict more authentic narrations, leading scholars to deem it unreliable.\n\n4. **Late Compilation**: If the hadith was recorded significantly after the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) without strong supporting evidence, it might be viewed skeptically.\n\nScholars of hadith, such as al-Bukhari and Muslim, have specific criteria and methods for assessing the authenticity of narrations.

        "question": "Her husband denounced her as a disbeliever because she will not denounce people as disbelievers",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      There is a great lesson for us and for all those who read \n      your question, which is so that we may see how specious arguments may lead \n      a person to damage his worldly and religious affairs, divert him from the \n      right path, cause him to deny the rights that others have over him, and \n      cause him to lose the closest of people to him, namely his wife and \n      children. All of that is because of ignorance, which is the worst enemy of \n      man. \n\n    We will start with the personal aspects of your question, \n    which is the fact that your husband’s belief that you are a disbeliever does \n    not in fact have any effect on the marriage contract, so long as he has not \n    uttered the word of divorce. That is because his notion of regarding you as \n    a disbeliever, which he has come to believe strongly, is flawed and does not \n    count for anything. No scholar ever said such a thing and no shar‘i ruling \n    can be based on it. \n\n    The reason for your husband’s confusion is his mistaken \n    understanding of the principle that “whoever does not regard a disbeliever \n    as such is himself a disbeliever,” which was quoted by Shaykh Muhammad ibn \n    ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allah have mercy on him) in Nawaaqid al-Islam, \n    where he said: … The one who does not denounce the mushrikeen (polytheists) \n    as disbelievers, or who has doubts as to whether they are disbelievers, or \n    who regards their view as sound, is himself a disbeliever. \n\n    This principle is speaking about two groups of people: \n\n    The first group is those who are originally disbelievers and \n    polytheists, such as the idol worshippers, Jews, Christians and those whom \n    Allah has called disbelievers in the Holy Qur’an, such as Pharaoh and Abu \n    Lahab. With regard to these people, whoever does not regard them as \n    disbelievers is himself a disbeliever. \n\n    The second group is those who definitively fall into \n    apostasy, according to scholarly consensus, with regard to matters that are \n    part of Islam that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing, such as one who \n    denies the resurrection, or rejects a verse of the Book of Allah, and other \n    kinds of blatant apostasy about which there can be no confusion and there is \n    no difference of opinion concerning them. These people too must be denounced \n    as disbelievers. Anyone who becomes aware of such people and their \n    situation, and proof is established for him with regard to the issue by the \n    scholars and fuqaha’, but he insists that they are not disbelievers, is \n    himself a disbeliever. \n\n    This is a matter on which the scholars were unanimously \n    agreed, as was narrated by al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him), \n    who said: \n\n    There is scholarly consensus on the fact that the one who \n    does not regard any of the Jews and Christians, or anyone who abandons the \n    religion of the Muslims, as disbelievers, or who refrains or hesitates to \n    describe them as disbelievers, is himself a disbeliever.\n\n    End quote from ash-Shifa (2/281) \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam mentioned some of the baatini (esoteric) \n    sects which are definitively proven to be disbelievers, as he said: \n\n    The views of these groups are worse than the views of the \n    Christians, and contain contradictions similar to those in the views of the \n    Christians. Therefore sometimes they speak of divine incarnation, and \n    sometimes of the oneness of all that exists. So it is a view that is \n    self-contradictory. Therefore they confuse the one who does not understand \n    it, and all of this is disbelief, inside and out, according to the consensus \n    of every Muslim. Whoever doubts that these people are disbelievers after \n    coming to know their views and coming to know the religion of Islam, is \n    himself a disbeliever, like the one who doubts that the Jews, Christians and \n    polytheists are disbelievers.\n\n    End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (2/368) \n\n    With regard to issues concerning which there is controversy \n    as to whether they constitute disbelief, or where the matter is not clear to \n    ordinary people (non-scholars), or issues that are not quite clear, or \n    concerning which it is assumed that there is consensus but it is not \n    definitive, or concerning which there is a difference of opinion as to \n    whether the ruling on apostasy may be applied to a particular individual – \n    with regard to all these issues, it is not permissible to regard as a \n    disbeliever one who does not have a clear view on this issue, or who has a \n    different view, because in principle the issue of takfeer in these cases is \n    subject to ijtihaad and different views. So it is more appropriate that the \n    one who has a different view on takfeer in such cases is to be excused. How \n    could it be said of such a person that he is to be deemed a disbeliever, or \n    even be regarded as a follower of innovation or misguided? These issues do \n    not come under the heading of “the one who does not regard a disbeliever as \n    such is himself a disbeliever” at all, according to what was explained \n    above. Rather the clear, well-established principle is that certainty cannot \n    be undermined by doubt. Based on the former, sound principle, anyone who \n    claims to be Muslim and shows it (in words and deeds), and is content with \n    Islam, is to be regarded as a Muslim, and no one is to be deemed an apostate \n    unless it is proven in a definitive manner, not on the basis of mere doubts \n    or misinterpretation (of his actions). \n\n    At the time of Shaykh ‘Abd al-Lateef ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn \n    Hasan – one of the leaders of the Najdi da‘wah and one of the grandsons of \n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab – some extremists went too far in \n    takfeer (denouncing people as disbelievers) because of their \n    misunderstanding of this principle. So he wrote to them, denouncing them and \n    saying: \n\n    “In the year sixty-four, I came to know about two deviant men \n    of your ilk in al-Ahsa’. They kept away from Jumu‘ah and jamaa‘ah (prayers \n    in congregation) and regarded the Muslims in that land as disbelievers. \n    Their argument was like yours; they said: The people of al-Ahsa’ sit with \n    Ibn Fayrooz and mix with him and people like him who do not regard taaghoot \n    (rulers who do not implement sharee‘ah) as disbelievers, but nobody regards \n    as a disbeliever his grandfather, who rejected the call of Shaykh Muhammad, \n    and he did not accept it and he opposed it. \n\n    “They said: Anyone who does not clearly state that he is a \n    disbeliever is himself a disbeliever in Allah, because he did not reject \n    taaghoot (rulers who do not implement sharee‘ah), and whoever sits with him \n    is like him. On the basis of these two false and misguided notions they \n    established the rulings that are applicable in the case of blatant apostasy, \n    to the extent that they stopped returning greetings of salaam. The matter \n    was referred to me, so I summoned them, warned them and spoke harshly to \n    them. First of all they claimed to be following the ‘aqeedah (beliefs) of \n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab, and to have copies of his essays, so I \n    discussed their specious arguments and defeated their misguided notions with \n    whatever I was able to in my meeting with them. \n\n    “I told them that the Shaykh  had nothing to do with \n    this belief and view, and that no one should be regarded as a disbeliever \n    except on the basis of what all the Muslims are agreed that the one who does \n    it is a disbeliever, such as major shirk (ascription of partners to Allah), \n    or rejection of the revelations and Messengers of Allah, or of any of them, \n    after proof has been established and has definitively reached them, \n    such as denouncing as disbelievers those who worship the righteous or call \n    upon them alongside Allah, or treat them as rivals to Him with regard to His \n    rights over His creation of worship and devotion. \n\n    “This is what the scholars and believers, and all schools of \n    thought, are unanimously agreed upon. They gave special attention to this \n    issue (takfeer or denouncing people as disbelievers) when they discussed the \n    rulings thereon and what constitutes apostasy and is regarded as such, and \n    they discussed the issue of shirk. Ibn Hajar paid special attention to this \n    issue in a book entitled al-I‘laam bi Qawaati‘ al-Islam. “The two \n    Persian men mentioned expressed repentance and regret, and claimed that the \n    truth had become clear to them both, then they left for the coast. But they \n    went back to the same view, and we heard that they regarded the leading \n    scholars of the Muslims as disbelievers because they send letters to the \n    Egyptian kings. Moreover, they regard as a disbeliever anyone who mixes with \n    any Muslim religious leader who wrote to them (the Egyptian kings). We seek \n    refuge with Allah from misguidance after having been guided. \n\n    “We have heard similar things about you, and that you \n    indulge in discussing similar matters that no one should discuss except \n    scholars of great knowledge and those who are endowed with deep \n    understanding of the revelation of Allah, those who have been granted wisdom \n    and knowledge. \n\n    “As for denouncing people as disbelievers on the basis of \n    these matters that you thought might render Muslims as disbelievers, this is \n    the way of the deviant Khaarijis who rebelled against the caliph ‘Ali ibn \n    Abi Taalib and the Sahaabah who were with him.” \n\n    End quote from ad-Durar al-Saniyyah fi’l-Ajwibah an-Najdiyyah \n    (1/466) \n\n    The Standing Committee were asked a question in which it was \n    said: \n\n    In our country there is the phenomenon of widespread grave \n    worship, and at the same time there are people who defend those who do that \n    and say that they are still Muslims and may be excused because of their \n    ignorance, so there is nothing wrong with them marrying our daughters, and \n    we can pray behind them, and they have all the rights that one Muslim has \n    over another. \n\n    In their reply they said: \n\n    … It is not permissible for the people of Tawheed, who \n    believe that grave worshippers are disbelievers, to regard as disbelievers \n    their fellow believers in Tawheed who do not regard them (the \n    grave-worshippers) as disbelievers unless proof is established against them, \n    because their refraining from denouncing them as disbelievers is based on \n    what they think of as a good reason, which is that they believe that it is \n    essential to establish proof against those grave-worshippers before \n    denouncing them as disbelievers. This is in contrast to those concerning \n    whom there is no reason to doubt that they are disbelievers, such as the \n    Jews, Christians, communists and their ilk. In the latter case, there is no \n    reason to doubt that they are disbelievers, or to doubt that the one who \n    does not regard them as disbelievers is himself a disbeliever. And Allah is \n    the One Who grants success; we ask Him, may He be glorified, to set straight \n    the affairs of the Muslims and to bless them with understanding of their \n    religion, and to grant us and them refuge from the evils of our own selves \n    and from our bad deeds, and from speaking about Allah, may He be glorified, \n    and about His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) without \n    knowledge, for He is able to do that. \n\n    And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings \n    and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. \n\n    Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas \n\n    President: ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Baaz \n\n    Vice President: ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi. \n\n    End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah \n    (2/150-151) \n\n    Dr. Naasir al-‘Aql (may Allah preserve him) said – when he \n    was asked whether there was any difference between the idea that “Whoever \n    does not regard a disbeliever as such is himself a disbeliever” and the idea \n    that “whoever does not regard the polytheists as disbelievers is himself a \n    disbeliever” – he said: \n\n    There is undoubtedly a difference, because most of those who \n    speak of the one who does not regard the disbeliever as such are referring \n    to one who is a disbeliever according to their own judgement, whilst others \n    may differ with them concerning their judgement. \n\n    As for those who do not regard the polytheist as a \n    disbeliever, this is an issue that is undoubtedly clear, because the \n    polytheists are undoubtedly disbelievers, as are the hypocrites whose \n    hypocrisy Allah made known, although we cannot know who exactly is a \n    hypocrite. This also applies to the Jews and Christians, and everyone who \n    does not bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is \n    the Messenger of Allah – he is a disbeliever and whoever does not describe \n    him as such is in principle also a disbeliever, but this matter requires the \n    regular procedure to establish what exactly he is saying and what he knows, \n    and whether he is ignorant or not, and so on. \n\n    End quote from Sharh at-Tahhaawiyyah by Naasir al-‘Aql \n    (67/15). \n\n    To sum up, we advise you to be patient with your husband, \n    continue to advise him and treat him kindly, and refer him to people of \n    knowledge and understanding, in the hope that he will give up this attitude \n    of going to extremes in the issue of takfeer, and to give you your rights \n    that Allah has ordained for you, and to protect himself from the danger of \n    going to extremes and overstepping the limits. \n\n    For more information, please see no. \n    85102 and 153830 \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, declaring someone as a disbeliever (kafir) is a serious matter and should not be taken lightly. It requires knowledge, understanding of the person's beliefs, and consideration of the broader context of faith. A husband denouncing his wife as a disbeliever simply because she refuses to denounce others may not be justified, especially if she holds her beliefs sincerely and does not reject the core tenets of Islam.\n\nIt's essential to approach such situations with wisdom and compassion. Open and respectful dialogue may help address differences in belief and understanding. Furthermore, if there's a genuine concern about faith or practice, it might be beneficial to seek guidance from a knowledgeable scholar or imam who can provide clarity based on Islamic teachings.\n\nUltimately, it's important for both spouses to engage in constructive communication, seeking to understand each other rather than resorting to harsh labels that can have significant emotional and spiritual consequences."

        "question": "Why do we not say that the Big Bang came before everything else?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    If you say that \n    the Big Bang came before everything else, this means that you have not \n    studied the theory of the Big Bang itself, and you are contradicting its \n    meaning and basic idea, because this theory affirms that, if it is proven \n    that the universe is constantly expanding, that must mean that in the past \n    it was close together, and this being close together means that \n    gravitational force and compactness between its parts was so great that \n    there was no space between them, (near the beginning) the pressure was so \n    intense that all the matter that forms the universe was the size of an atom, \n    then (further back in time, to the point of the beginning) the size was \n    infinitely small and was nothing. This implies that at that point there was \n    no time or space, because matter itself did not exist. \n\n    Therefore when \n    this universe began – when its age was less than a billionth part of a \n    second – which was approximately fifteen billion years ago, as the \n    proponents of this theory say – the size of its matter was very close to \n    zero. Then this pressurised matter exploded and scattered its particles in \n    the form of rays, then it began to cool down, and our universe was gradually \n    formed from it. Hence this theory is called the Big Bang. … This is the view \n    of Stephen Hawking, whom some people called the Newton of the modern era, \n    when he said: “The greatest misunderstanding of the Big Bang is to say that \n    it started with a mass of matter somewhere in outer space. Matter is not the \n    only thing that was created during the Big Bang; rather time and space were \n    also created. Therefore in the same sense that we say place has a beginning, \n    we also say that time has a beginning.” [The Universe, Bozlo, p. 46] \n\n    He also says: \n    “This means that the very beginning of the universe was chosen with great \n    care, if the theory of the hot Big Bang was correct from the beginning of \n    time. It is very difficult to explain why the universe began in this \n    particular way, unless we say concerning that that there was indeed a \n    Creator who wanted to create beings like ourselves” [A Brief History of \n    Time, Hawking, p. 127]. See: al-Feeziya’ wa Wujood al-Khaaliq (p. \n    87-96). \n\n    This question \n    is obviously flawed, because the Big Bang cannot – rationally – have come \n    before everything, unless you believe that this Big Bang was the Necessary \n    Existent, that has all attributes of perfection, but that description refers \n    to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, if this is what you mean, then we \n    accept from you this claim that the Big Bang came before everything, and we \n    will agree with you that the universe was created by a Creator Who is \n    eternal. \n\n    But when the \n    question demands that we regard as equal the Creator Who is the Necessary \n    Existent Who is possessed of all attributes of perfection and the Big Bang \n    which is an incident that came into being after not having existed at all, \n    then the argument is flawed on two counts: \n\n    1.\n    \n    Because it describes the Big Bang as something that had no beginning, but at \n    the same time it is regarded as an incident that came into being after not \n    having existed at all, and this is self-contradictory, because that which \n    existed from eternity (and had no beginning) cannot be an incident\n\n    2.\n    \n    Because it describes the Big Bang as being eternal (having no beginning), \n    and does not pay attention to the prerequisites of a thing being eternal, \n    the most important of which is that it must necessarily exist and possess \n    the attributes of perfection, and that refers to Allah, may He be glorified \n    and exalted. Anyone who describes the universe as having existed from \n    eternity falls into this contradiction. What he should have done is refer \n    (the matter of creation) to something other than this created universe, and \n    that is Allah, the Creator, may He be glorified and exalted.\n\n    As for the \n    Muslim, he does not fall into this contradiction, because he will tell you \n    that the Creator existed from eternity and He was and there was nothing \n    before Him, because He is the Necessary Existent, and with Him the chain of \n    all created beings ends. When the Muslim describes Him as being before all \n    things, that is because He cannot be compared with created beings, \n    possibilities or incidents; rather He is greater than that. As for the \n    atheist who affirmed that this universe came into being after not having \n    existed, he is trying to explain it by referring to the Big Bang, which in \n    itself is of the same nature as the universe, with regard to it coming under \n    the heading of possibilities or incidents, then he ascribed to it the \n    attribute of existing from eternity, but this is not possible at all. \n\n    We believe that \n    it is easy for the human mind to believe in the idea that the universe is \n    created, whereas it is difficult for it to believe in a universe that \n    existed from eternity and had no beginning, when he sees at the same time \n    all the signs that show that it is not eternal as it is clearly and \n    obviously subject to constant alterations and changes. \n\n    As for the \n    concept of the Creator existing from eternity, that is something easy for \n    man to believe, because of a simple and straightforward reason, which is \n    that the Creator is not of the same nature as the created being, which means \n    rejecting all the rules of comparison and analogy that humans use and try to \n    apply to the Creator, may He be glorified and exalted. In that case the \n    explanation (that there is a Creator Who existed from eternity) makes \n    perfect sense. Although the Creator is unseen, the believer believes in Him \n    because He the Necessary Existent who is the Knower of the unseen world. \n\n    As for the one \n    who believes that the universe is an incident or created thing that existed \n    before everything, he believes in something that is impossible from a \n    rational point of view. Undoubtedly believing in the Creator is much easier \n    than believing in a created thing that existed from eternity. \n\n    In other words, \n    we may ask this atheist, is the Big Bang a possibility or a necessity? \n\n    If he says that \n    it is a possibility, then that which is possible could not have existed from \n    eternity. \n\n    If he says that \n    it is a necessity, then he has affirmed the existence of that which \n    necessarily exists from eternity and has no creator. In that case he has \n    affirmed the idea that there is a divine being. \n\n    The matter is \n    as simple as that. \n\n    Here we will \n    give some simple examples for that. \n\n    If you see some \n    important decision, that could change the course of the company, being made \n    in some large company, and then people differed concerning the source of \n    this decision, there are two possibilities: \n\n    1.\n    \n    either a group of employees, all of whom held positions at the same level, \n    and none of them has more authority than another, and every time one is \n    asked to make a decision he defers it to his colleague because he has no \n    authority to make a decision, so the matter kept going in this sequence \n    until the decision was made as a result of this sequence;\n\n    2.\n    or an \n    employee of a higher rank, who has absolute authority and has no colleague \n    at an equal position in the company, so that the matter could be passed \n    between him and that person, took this audacious decision, so that it was \n    done after not having being done,\n\n    then which \n    possibility is more reasonable and which do you feel more at ease with? \n\n    Undoubtedly it \n    is the second possibility, even though you may not know about this \n    highest-ranking employee who is the one who made the decision – how he was \n    appointed and who gave him this authority – but you find this to be \n    something acceptable, because of the difference in rank and position between \n    this employee and the other, ordinary employees. That was sufficient for you \n    as an explanation of how major decisions are made in this company. \n\n    However, if you \n    continue in the sequence (mentioned in the first scenario) and say that this \n    employee ordered that employee, ad infinitum in the realm of lower level \n    employees, that will not be convincing at all as an explanation of the \n    matter, unless you explain the way the decision was made by referring it to \n    one who is in a leading position, who does not need to be appointed by \n    anyone else or wait for the decision of anyone else. \n\n    Allah, may He \n    be glorified and exalted, is the One Who is the first and only \n    decision-maker with regard to the creation of this universe and bringing it \n    into existence; He is the One Who does not ask for permission from anyone \n    else. “He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be \n    questioned” [al-Anbiya’ \n    21:23]. \n    For He is the Creator, Who is different from created beings. Then (after \n    concluding that there is a Creator) you have to attribute to this Creator, \n    may He be glorified and exalted, that which is hidden from you of absolute \n    perfect attributes, such as existence from eternity, because you are \n    speaking about a very significant matter that has nothing to do with \n    anything ordinary; rather it has to do with something beyond human \n    capability and beyond that with which humans are familiar, namely the \n    creation of this universe from nothing. So it is more appropriate that you \n    should refer (the creation of the universe) to a Creator Who is the \n    Necessary Existent, First and Last, rather than referring it to any created \n    being and attributing to it existence from eternity to eternity. In other \n    words, we say that referring the issue of creation to a Creator who is \n    eternal and has no beginning is the inevitable conclusion of the process of \n    thinking about the cause of this universe and how it came about, because \n    alternative explanations, which say that the universe is eternal (and had no \n    beginning) or that it created itself, or that things came into existence by \n    themselves after having been nothing, are clearly false, as is obvious to \n    anyone who examines these ideas. Therefore he has no choice, as he will be \n    compelled by his rational thinking, and also by his common sense, to believe \n    in another cause, far beyond that with which we are familiar and that we \n    know, that cannot have a beginning, or it cannot be that anyone created Him, \n    and that is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. \n\n    If, after this \n    conclusion, you again ask: then who created Allah? This means that you did \n    not understand the different stages of examining and thinking mentioned \n    above, and you have not understood how those who believe in Allah, may He be \n    glorified and exalted, reached that conclusion; you want to take the debate \n    back to square one. \n\n    Dr Ja‘far \n    Shaykh Idrees (may Allah preserve him) said – answering the specious \n    argument of Hume which says that if the universe needed a cause, then God \n    also needs a cause: \n\n    I never thought \n    that a thinker – whether he was a believer or a nonbeliever – could \n    seriously ask this question: who created God? When he knows what this word \n    (God) signifies. \n\n    But it seems \n    that some prominent Western physicists take this question seriously and in \n    fact regard it as one of the main flaws in the view that there is a Creator. \n    We see Hawking also saying about God: who created Him? \n\n    The answer to \n    this question, which these philosophers, scientists and many others think is \n    a dilemma, is very easy: \n\n    If the opponent \n    (in an argument) accepts that the universe, which is an incident or created \n    thing, must have a cause that is not an incident, then if he accepts that \n    this cause is not an incident – i.e. it is eternal – which is called God, \n    then his question about the Creator or cause of God has no meaning at all, \n    for it is a question on the part of one who does not understand what he is \n    saying; it is a question that contains a very weird contradiction, because \n    the cause by necessity precedes the effect, and that which is eternal, by \n    necessity is not preceded by anything. So how can it have a cause? \n\n    For someone to \n    say “Who created God?” is the equivalent of saying: “What preceded the thing \n    before which there was nothing?” Or “what comes after the thing after which \n    there is nothing?” Does such a question even make sense? If you tell a man \n    that So-and-so came first in a race, is it acceptable for him to say: Fine, \n    but who came before him? Similarly in this case proof is established that \n    God is the First and there is nothing before Him, so how can it be said \n    “what was the cause of Him?” or “who created Him?”? \n\n    However, Davies \n    and Pareau, and others who followed them in imitating Hume, give the \n    impression that those who base their evidence for the existence of the \n    Creator on the existence of the universe have decided on the basis of pure \n    whims and desires that the universe requires a cause to bring it into \n    existence. Then they foolishly decided that God does not need this cause, \n    hence they claimed that we cannot stop at the universe (so there must be \n    something beyond it). But when they got to God, they stopped with Him and \n    did not go any further. There is no difference – according to their claim – \n    between stopping here or stopping there. \n\n    From both of \n    them, and from others, this is a sign of confusion because they overlooked \n    the huge difference between the nature of the universe, which is an incident \n    or created thing, and the nature of the Creator, Who is eternal.\n\n    End quote from\n    al-Feeziya’ wa Wujood al-Khaaliq (120-124). \n\n    We will quote \n    here a fictional debate that was written by one of those who specialise in \n    debating with atheists, which will highlight the reality of this confusion \n    into which the questioner has fallen. \n\n    The atheist \n    said: Your stating that Allah is the Creator of all things is a statement \n    that could be undermined by asking: So who is it that created Allah? \n\n    The Muslim \n    said: No, it does not undermine it, because we say that if there is any \n    being that has the attribute of creation (being able to create), yet at the \n    same time there is someone who created him, then he is like his creation: he \n    is also a created being. And any maker who could be described as such yet at \n    the same time there is someone who made him, is also made, like the things \n    that he makes.\n\n    Does this \n    statement imply that it is not possible to have a supreme Creator outside of \n    this circle, who has no creator or maker, and no one is equal to Him, and He \n    is the origin and initiator of all things? \n\n    Not at all; \n    rather this Creator is the Necessary Existant, who must exist on a rational \n    basis, because he is the end of that chain, which reason cannot accept but \n    that it must end with Him. We are talking about the Creator who is not a \n    created being, who is completely outside this system, so He is not subject \n    to the rules of the system, and cannot be compared to any (hypothetical) \n    “creator/created being”, because He is the one who ordained the rules in \n    this universe, and initiated (those rules) on the basis of His power and \n    creation in the first place. \n\n    So the created \n    thing cannot create itself; rather it must have been created by something \n    else and this chain must inevitably, according to rational thinking, end \n    with the first initiator, the first creator, who was not created by anything \n    and is not part of that chain and does not form one link in it at all. \n    Rather he is the one who created the entire chain and everything in it; so \n    He is not part of it and is not limited by its limits or subject to its law. \n    Such is Allah, the All-Knowing Creator. \n\n    The atheist \n    said: If He is not subject to its laws, and we cannot perceive Him with our \n    senses, then how can we be expected to imagine Him in our minds and believe \n    in Him in our hearts? \n\n    The Muslim \n    said: Reason is able to perceive the concept, but not the nature or reality, \n    and the difference between them is an essential difference for any rational \n    person. \n\n    I understand on \n    the basis of reason the possibility of the existence of billions upon \n    billions of stars in the galaxies of this vast universe, but can my reason \n    understand how that is or imagine it? Could I imagine the ratio of my size \n    to the size of the earth alone, let alone that which is far bigger of the \n    stars and planets around us? Not at all! I know of the existence of the soul \n    in bodies which, if it is removed the living man dies, and my reason \n    confirms the necessity of its existence and its essence as a concept and \n    idea, but could my reason imagine anything about its nature and essence, or \n    could I measure it or estimate it mathematically? Not at all! \n\n    This is the \n    difference between a concept that reason rejects and does not accept in the \n    first place, and a concept that reason does not reject, but it cannot \n    compare its description to anything that is conceivable or visible, with \n    regard to its nature and essence. So people’s minds would not be able to \n    imagine that concept, yet they affirm the soundness of the concept, and the \n    possibility – or necessity – of its existence. \n\n    So if you think \n    of the Christian belief in the Trinity, for example, you will see this \n    subtle difference, for they believe in something with regard to the divine \n    essence that is impossible, from a rational point of view, to exist as an \n    idea or concept.\n\n     It is not \n    rationally possible for three to be one or one to be three. This is what \n    makes you atheists able to prove the utter falseness of their Trinity. \n\n    But when you \n    come to examine the belief of monotheist Muslims in their Lord, you will \n    have no reason to criticise their belief in the essence and attributes of \n    their Lord. You have no criticism except that you cannot comprehend this \n    Lord and you cannot compare Him to something that you do comprehend and \n    understand. It is as if you are concluding that it is impossible for Him to \n    exist according to rational thinking, as is the case with the Trinity! They \n    say that it is a “too easy” answer to the problem, as if the simplicity of \n    the monotheistic belief in the unseen is something for which they should be \n    condemned and is an indication that it is false. They say that there is no \n    existing being that cannot be subject to the laws of the universe. It is as \n    if you travelled beyond this universe and saw that there was nothing beyond \n    it, so nothing could exist except something that is like what you are \n    subject to in this universe. \n\n    The difference \n    between us and you is that we accept what is indicated by every breath in \n    our own bodies, and by everything, small or great, in this precise and \n    well-made universe around us, so we do not attribute its existence except to \n    a Creator Who is greater than it and outside of it, Whose essence and \n    attributes cannot be compared to anything in it. As for you, because of your \n    corrupt way of reasoning and understanding, you insisted on denying the \n    Creator completely and rejecting any possibility of His existence, and you \n    insisted on putting something created and insignificant in His place, such \n    as genes, for no other reason except that you would be able to comprehend \n    its essence. It is as if your minds – which if they were able to understand \n    the language of monkeys, you would have heard them criticising your minds \n    and way of thinking – will not accept anything except that of which it can \n    imagine the nature and essence by means of comparing it to something similar \n    or equal. \n\n    So tell me, O \n    atheist, don’t you believe that this universe has a limit at which it stops? \n    Is that not so? \n\n    The atheist \n    said: Yes indeed. \n\n    The Muslim \n    said: Great! Even though that of which they have calculated the diameter is \n    the visible universe, and not the entire universe, and they have even \n    suggested that it is still expanding. \n\n    But this is not \n    my concern. My question to you is: do you have anything in this world to \n    which you could compare the limit of the universe at which it ends? \n\n    In other words: \n    have you seen in this world that which will help you to understand how that \n    limit, within which is the matter of the universe, could be, and after it \n    there is something that you do not know and cannot imagine, and you cannot \n    but accept the fact that it exists there, whatever that thing may be? \n\n    The atheist \n    thought for a while, then said: No doubt beyond this universe there is empty \n    space and infinite nothingness. \n\n    The Muslim \n    said: Surely you are lying! Do you know why? \n\n    The atheist \n    said: Why? \n\n    The Muslim \n    said: Because the one who bases certain knowledge on the phrase “no doubt”, \n    basing his certainty on an assumption for which he has no rational or \n    physical evidence, is a liar. \n\n    Whatever the \n    case, what I mean is that there is something beyond this universe and \n    outside of it, and you cannot imagine the nature of it, no matter what it \n    is, even though you affirm, on a rational basis, that there is a possibility \n    that something exists (beyond the universe), and that the nature of that \n    thing, by necessity, is different from what is within the universe. \n    Otherwise it would not be possible to say – from a linguistic point of view \n    – that this is the boundary at which the universe ends. Is that not so? \n\n    The atheist did \n    not answer. \n\n    The Muslim \n    said: So why do you insist that the mere fact that you are unable to imagine \n    the essence of God – which we believe is sublime and above the heavens and \n    all that exists, and His attributes cannot be denied on the basis of reason \n    and cannot be compared to any of His creation – is evidence that He cannot \n    exist? \n\n    End quote from \n    Islamweb.net on the following link: \n\n\n    http://articles.islamweb.net/media/index.php?page=article&lang=A&id=198814\n\n    Because of the \n    importance of your question, we will quote to you another debate with an \n    atheist: \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad \n    al-Ghazaali (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Qadhaa’if al-Haqq \n    (p. 197-203): \n\n    I had a lengthy \n    discussion with an atheist in which I controlled myself and tried to be \n    patient, until he disclosed all the specious arguments that he had up his \n    sleeve, so that I could defeat with clear arguments and evidence what he \n    uttered of specious arguments. \n\n    He said: If \n    Allah created the universe, then who created Allah? \n\n    I said to him: \n    It is as if, by asking this question or raising this objection, you are \n    affirming that everything must have a Creator. \n\n    He said: Let us \n    avoid getting into a vicious circle; just answer my question. \n\n    I said to him: \n    There is no need for waffle. You think that this universe has no creator, \n    which means that He existed by Himself without any need for someone to bring \n    Him into existence, so why do you accept the view that this universe existed \n    by itself for eternity, yet you find it strange that religious people say \n    that the existence of God, Who created this universe, has no beginning? \n\n    It is the same \n    concept, so how come you believe yourself when you confirm this concept (of \n    existing from eternity, with regard to the universe), but you reject the \n    view of others when they affirm the same concept (with regard to God having \n    no beginning). If you think that to believe in a God Who has no creator is a \n    myth, then a universe that has no creator is also a myth, according to the \n    logic that you are following! \n\n    He said: We are \n    living in this universe and we can feel its existence, so we cannot deny \n    it! \n\n    I said to him: \n    Who asked you to deny the existence of the universe? \n\n    When we travel \n    in a car or ship or plane that is zooming along with us in a very terrifying \n    way, our question is not whether the car exists; rather our question is: is \n    it travelling by itself or does it have a driver or pilot who has \n    experience? \n\n    Therefore let \n    us go back to your first question, which is to be thrown back at you. Both \n    of us accept that there is a being that exists and there is no way to deny \n    it. You claim that it has no beginning as far as matter is concerned, and I \n    think that it has no beginning with regard to its creator. \n\n    If you want to \n    poke fun at a being that has no beginning, then poke fun at yourself first, \n    before you poke fun at religious people. \n\n    He said: Do you \n    mean that the rational assumption is the same for both groups? \n\n    I said: I am \n    going along with you for arguments sake, only to expose to you the flawed \n    and false arguments on which atheism is based. As for the rational \n    assumption, it is not the same for believers and disbelievers. \n\n    Imagine that \n    you and I are looking at a standing building. After thorough examination, I \n    can conclude that an engineer must have built it, but you think that some \n    lumber, metal, stone and paint took up the appropriate positions to prepare \n    this building for people to live in, all by themselves. The difference \n    between our views is like this: if I see a satellite orbiting in space, and \n    you tell me that it went into orbit by itself, without any supervision or \n    control, and I tell you that it was launched by rational people who are \n    controlling and supervising it, these rational assumptions are not the same. \n    In my case, my assumption is the ultimate truth that cannot be denied, \n    whereas your assumption is falsehood that is undoubtedly false. All the \n    atheists of the current era are very skilled in insulting us believers and \n    saying all manner of bad things about us, at the time when they describe \n    themselves as being smart, progressive and brilliant. We are living on an \n    earth that is comfortable and fit for living, beneath a star filled sky, and \n    we possess reason and intellect by means of which we can research and judge, \n    and with this reasoning and intellect we contemplate, reach conclusions, \n    discuss and believe. On the basis of this reason and intellect we refuse to \n    imitate blindly, just as we reject nonsensical ideas. If people want to make \n    fun of those whom they regard as backward, trapped in the past and rigid in \n    their thinking, they might as well also make fun of those who kill reason in \n    the name of reason, and stomp on the conclusions of science in the name of \n    science, for they – unfortunately – constitute the majority of atheists!\n\n    … and so on.\n\n\n    http://fatwa.islamweb.net/fatwa/index.php?page=showfatwa&Option=FatwaId&Id=218512\n\n    And Allah knows \n    best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In discussing the origins of the universe from an Islamic perspective, it's important to consider the beliefs about creation as described in Islamic texts. According to Islamic teachings, Allah (God) is the Creator of everything that exists, and He created the universe from nothing (ex nihilo). \n\nThe Big Bang theory describes the rapid expansion of the universe from a singular point approximately 13.8 billion years ago. In terms of Islamic theology, saying that the Big Bang \"came before everything else\" may not fully capture the Islamic understanding of the nature of creation and time. From an Islamic perspective:\n\n1. **Creation is God's Action:** Islam teaches that God exists outside of time and space; He is not bound by the physical laws that govern the universe. Thus, any scientific understanding of the universe's beginnings should be seen as part of God's creation rather than a sequence that precedes God.\n\n2. **Different Realms of Understanding:** The Big Bang theory is a scientific explanation for the physical origins of the universe, while Islamic teachings provide a theological understanding of creation and existence. Both can coexist, but they are understood in different contexts.\n\n3. **Theism vs. Naturalism:** While some may interpret the Big Bang as a purely naturalistic explanation, Muslims believe that God initiated creation. Thus, rather than attributing the \"first\" event to the Big Bang independent of God, Muslims see the Big Bang as part of the overall divine plan of creation.\n\n4. **Role of Faith and Revelation:** In Islam, the ultimate source of knowledge is divine revelation. This means that while science can explore and explain the workings of the universe, theological truths come from religious texts.\n\nIn summary, while the Big Bang may describe the origins of the universe from a scientific viewpoint, it does not challenge the Islamic belief that everything originates from Allah, who is beyond and prior to anything that can be scientifically quantified."

        "question": "The hadith “Woe to ‘Ammaar; he will be killed by the transgressing group; he will be calling them to Paradise and they will be calling him to Hell,” and refutation of the specious argument which quotes it to cast aspersions upon Mu‘aawiyah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    What is required is to think positively of those whom Allah chose to \n    accompany His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): for they \n    are the best companions of the best Prophet, and it is not permissible to \n    say anything of them but the highest words of praise; if anyone criticises \n    them, then this gives rise to suspicion about the sincerity of his religious \n    commitment. \n\n    Abu Zar‘ah ar-Raazi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If you see a man \n    criticising any of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him), then know that he is a heretic. That is because \n    in our view, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) is true, and the Qur’an is true. No one transmitted this Qur’an and the \n    Sunnah to us except the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him). They only seek to undermine our witnesses (to \n    the authenticity of the texts) in order to declare the Qur’an and Sunnah \n    false, but these people are more deserving of criticism, for they are \n    heretics.\n\n    End quote from al-Kifaayah fi ‘Ilm ar-Riwaayah by al-Khateeb \n    al-Baghdadi (p. 49). \n\n    See also the answer to question no. \n    187689 \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    The Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    fought one another ,and each party had a reason to fight, which was based on \n    their own understanding of the texts and on their own ijtihaad, whereby each \n    party believed it was in the right. Hence when it became clear to some of \n    them that they were mistaken, they regretted going out and fighting, and \n    regret is repentance, and repentance erases what comes before it, especially \n    in the case of the noblest of mankind, and the highest in status and most \n    respected of them after the Prophets and Messengers of Allah. \n\n    Whoever examines this matter properly will realise that this fighting was \n    caused by those who sought to spread discord by spreading rumours and false \n    ideas.  \n\n    Many of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) went out during this \n    fighting seeking to reconcile between the people. Fighting was the most \n    hateful thing to them, but the decree of Allah inevitably came to pass. \n\n    Thirdly: \n\n    Al-Bukhaari (447) narrated from Abu Sa ‘eed al-Khudri, in the report about \n    the building of the mosque (in Madinah), that he said: We would carry one \n    brick at a time, but  ‘Ammaar would carry two bricks at a time. The Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw him and brushed the dust from \n    him, saying: “Woe to ‘Ammaar; he will be killed by the transgressing group; \n    he will be calling them to Paradise and they will be calling him to Hell”. \n    ‘Ammaar said: I seek refuge with Allah from tribulation. \n\n    What is meant by calling to Paradise in this hadith is calling to the means \n    of attaining it, which is obedience to the caliph (Ameer al-Mu’mineen), and \n    what is meant by calling to Hell is calling to that which leads to it, which \n    is opposing the caliph and rebelling against him. \n\n    But whoever did that on the basis of ijtihaad and valid interpretation is \n    excused. \n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    This hadith is one of the signs of Prophethood, as the Prophet (blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him) foretold to ‘Ammaar that he would be killed \n    by the transgressing group, and he was killed by the people of ash-Shaam \n    (greater Syria) in the battle of Siffeen, when ‘Ammaar was with ‘Ali  and \n    the people of Iraq, as will be explained in detail below. ‘Ali had more \n    right to rulership than Mu‘aawiyah did. \n\n    The fact that the companions of Mu‘aawiyah are described as transgressors \n    does not imply that they were disbelievers, as the ignorant followers of the \n    misguided sects, such as the Shi‘ah  and others, try to claim. That is \n    because their decision to fight was based on their own ijtihaad and \n    interpretation of the texts, and not everyone who engages in ijtihaad gets \n    its right; rather the one who gets it right will have a twofold reward and \n    the one who gets it wrong will have a single reward. \n\n    Those who added to this hadith after the phrase “you will be killed by the \n    transgressing group” the words “Allah will not grant them my intercession on \n    the Day of Resurrection” fabricated this additional material, falsely \n    attributing it to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him), for he did not say it, as it was not narrated via any acceptable \n    chain of narration. And Allah knows best. \n\n    With regard to the words “he will be calling them to Paradise and they will \n    be calling him to Hell”, ‘Ammaar and his companions were calling the people \n    of greater Syria to reconciliation and unity, whereas the people of greater \n    Syria wanted to seize power from one who was more entitled to it, and they \n    wanted the people to be divided, with each part of the Muslim lands having \n    its own ruler, which would lead to disunity and division of the ummah, for \n    this was the implication of their view and the consequences to which it \n    would lead, even if they did not intend that. And Allah knows best.\n\n    End quote from al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah (4/538) \n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nIf \n    it is said: “He was killed at Siffeen, when he was with ‘Ali, and those who \n    killed him were with Mu‘aawiyah, with whom were some of the Sahaabah, so how \n    can it be said that they were calling to Hell?” \n\n    The answer to that is that they thought that they were calling to Paradise, \n    and their action was based on ijtihaad, so there is no blame on them for \n    following what they thought was best. What is meant by calling people to \n    Paradise is calling them to that which leads to it, which is obeying the \n    ruler. This was the stance of ‘Ammaar, who was calling them to obey ‘Ali, \n    who was the ruler whom it was obligatory to obey at that time, whereas they \n    (Mu‘aawiyah and his followers) were calling people to something other than \n    that, but they are excused for the wrong conclusion they reached, which was \n    based on misinterpretation of the texts. \n\n    End quote from Fath al-Baari (1/542). See also: Majmoo‘ Fataawa \n    Shaykh al-Islam (4/437) \nSo \n    it is essential to differentiate between the one who tries to work it out \n    but reaches a wrong conclusion, and the one who deliberately causes mischief \n    and turmoil. \n\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “And if two \n    parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace \n    between them both, but if one of them rebels against the other, then fight \n    you (all) against the one that which rebels till it complies with the \n    Command of Allah; then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them \n    justly, and be equitable. Verily! Allah loves those who are equitable.\n\n    The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic \n    religion). So make reconciliation between your brothers, and fear Allah, \n    that you may receive mercy”\n\n    [al-Hujuraat 49:9-10]. \n\n    This indicates that it is possible for fighting to occur among the \n    believers, without that meaning that one of the groups is regarded as no \n    longer being believers because of their fighting the other group. Then \n    Allah, may He be exalted, says: “The \n    believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic religion). So make \n    reconciliation between your brothers” \n    [al-Hujuraat 49:9-10]. \nSo \n    Allah described them as being brothers, despite their fighting, and He \n    commanded the Muslims to reconcile between them. \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, explains that despite their fighting \n    and transgression against one another, they are still believers and \n    brothers, and He enjoined reconciling between them. But if one of them \n    transgresses after that, then the transgressing group is to be fought, but \n    He did not enjoin fighting from the outset. \n\n    The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that the \n    groups that would pass out of the faith [the Khawaarij or Khaarijis] would \n    be killed by the closer of the two groups to the truth, and ‘Ali ibn Abi \n    Taalib and those who were with him were the ones who fought \n    them.                                      \n\n    The words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicate \n    that they were closer to the truth than Mu‘aawiyah and those who were with \n    him, although both groups were believers.\n\n    End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (25/305-306) \nIt \n    was narrated that Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri said: The Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “A group will secede from \n    my ummah at a time of division among the Muslims, and they will be killed by \n    the group that is closer to the truth.”\n\n    Narrated by Muslim (1064). \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n    This saheeh hadeeth indicates that both of the groups who engaged in \n    fighting – ‘Ali and his companions, and Mu‘aawiyah and his companions – were \n    following the truth, and that ‘Ali and his companions were closer to the \n    truth than Mu‘aawiyah and his companions.\n\n    End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (4/467). See also: Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa \n    (4/437-438). \n\n    For more information, see the answers to questions no. \n    147974 and 140984\nTo \n    sum up: \n\n    The words “they will be calling him to Hell” do not imply disbelief – Allah \n    forbid. The one who says that is only highlighting his extreme ignorance. \n    Rather these hadiths come under the heading of the hadiths of warning, like \n    those hadiths which say that the one who consumes riba will be in the fire, \n    and the one who consumes the orphan’s wealth will be in the fire, and other \n    hadiths that contain warnings; they do not necessarily imply that the person \n    who does that is a disbeliever, although they do indicate that his deed is \n    haraam and is in fact a major sin. \nIn \n    fact some of the scholars interpreted the words “they will be calling him to \n    Hell” as referring to the Khawaarij (Kharijites). \n\n    Ibn Battaal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The words “he will be calling them to Paradise and they will be calling him \n    to Hell” can only be correctly applied to the Khawaarij to whom ‘Ali sent \n    ‘Ammaar to call them to join the jamaa‘ah (main body of the Muslims); they \n    cannot be correctly applied to any of the Sahaabah, because it is not \n    possible for any of the Muslims to interpret any of their actions except in \n    the best manner, because they were the companions of the Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), whom Allah praised and testified \n    to their virtue, and said (interpretation of the meaning): \n    “You  \n    are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind” \n    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:110]. \n\n    The commentators said: This refers to the Companions of the Messenger of \n    Allah. It is narrated in a saheeh report that ‘Ali sent ‘Ammaar to the \n    Khawaarij to call them to join the jamaa‘ah (main body of the Muslims), with \n    whom there is protection from error. \n\n    End quote from Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari (2/98-99) \n\n    For more information, please see the answer to question no.\n    171167\n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you refer to is narrated in several sources, including Sahih Muslim and other collections. It speaks about 'Ammaar ibn Yasir, a prominent companion of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and foretells of his martyrdom at the hands of a group that deviates from the truth. This hadith has often been cited in discussions regarding the conflicts during the time of the early Islamic community, particularly the Fitna (civil strife) involving 'Ali ibn Abi Talib and Mu‘aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan.\n\nIt's important to address the context of this hadith properly. The phrase that 'Ammaar would be \"killed by the transgressing group\" is often interpreted to mean that he would be killed by those who are unjust, which is commonly understood as referring to the side of Mu‘aawiyah during the Battle of Siffin. However, scholars emphasize that this hadith does not categorically offer a blanket condemnation of Mu‘aawiyah or his supporters.\n\nThe argument that uses this hadith to disparage Mu‘aawiyah often overlooks several important points:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The political circumstances of that era were complex, and both sides had their justifications based on their understandings of legitimacy, leadership, and governance in Islam. The conflicts were fueled by political, social, and tribal factors in addition to theological disagreements.\n\n2. **Recognition of Mu‘aawiyah's Contributions**: Mu‘aawiyah is recognized as a companion of the Prophet and an important figure in early Islamic history. Many scholars acknowledge his contributions to the consolidation of the Islamic state and the spread of Islam.\n\n3. **Differentiation of Truth and Actions**: Islamic teachings emphasize understanding the intentions and contexts of individuals rather than simply labeling them based on specific actions. Mu‘aawiyah can be seen as a figure who played a significant role in Islamic governance, even if he may have been on the opposing side during a particular conflict.\n\n4. **Mutual Respect among Companions**: The companions of the Prophet had diverse opinions, and while some had disputes, it is essential for Muslims to respect their status as companions and avoid casting aspersions without rigorous grounds.\n\nIn conclusion, while the hadith regarding 'Ammaar can be referenced in discussions about the early conflicts in Islam, it does not serve as a definitive condemnation of Mu‘aawiyah. Instead, it should remind us of the complexities of human actions, the necessity of contextual understanding, and the importance of maintaining respect for all companions of the Prophet. Muslims are encouraged to focus on unity and learning from the lessons of history rather than division."

        "question": "Ruling on studying psychology and law",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Studying these two subjects (psychology and law) involves studying matters \n    that are explained and discussed in a manner that is contrary to Islamic \n    teachings. This is something clear and makes sense, because the law in the \n    view of non-Muslims is a counterpart to sharee‘ah for the Muslims, and \n    psychology is a counterpart to morals and manners, asceticism, softening the \n    heart with fear of Allah, purification of the soul, good conduct and \n    discipline. Because the people do not follow the religion of Islam, no \n    matter what their religion and view, it is logical to say that they base \n    their laws and morals on something other than the law of Allah, may He be \n    exalted, that He has chosen for His slaves. Rather they base all of that on \n    their experience, reason, feelings or customs, or on other things that they \n    believe in, and they regard it as the system to be followed. \nAs \n    that is the case, studying these two subjects, and similar subjects – such \n    as philosophy and non-Islamic economics – is not permissible for the Muslim \n    if the aim is to benefit from all of that without discretion, and to believe \n    what they contain of misguidance and put it into practice, take it as a way \n    of life and derive from it rules to follow. All goodness is in following the \n    guidance and light that the Prophet brought. \n\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “O mankind! \n    Verily, there has come to you a convincing proof (Prophet Muhammad \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) from your Lord, and We sent down \n    to you a manifest light (this Quran)”\n\n    [an-Nisa’ 4:174]\n\n    “Indeed, \n    there has come to you from Allah a light (Prophet Muhammad (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him)) and a plain Book (this Quran)”\n\n    [al-Maa’idah 5:15]\n\n    “Say: O you \n    mankind! Now truth (i.e. the Quran and Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace \n    of Allah be upon him)), has come to you from your Lord. So whosoever \n    receives guidance, he does so for the good of his own self, and whosoever \n    goes astray, he does so to his own loss, and I am not (set) over you as a \n    Wakeel (disposer of affairs to oblige you for guidance)”\n\n    [Yoonus 10:108]. \n\n    The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade the Muslims \n    to read the books of the People of the Book and others. He (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) got angry when he saw in the hand of ‘Umar (may \n    Allah be pleased with him) one of the books of the Jews, as it was narrated \n    in Musnad Ahmad (14623): ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab came to the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with books that he had got from \n    some of the People of the Book. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon it) saw it and got angry. He said: “Are you confused about it, O son of \n    al-Khattaab? By the One in Whose hand is my soul, I have brought it (i.e., \n    the message of Islam) to you clean and pure. Do not ask them about anything, \n    lest they tell you something true and you disbelieve in it, or they tell you \n    something false and you believe in it. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, \n    if Moosa (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were alive, he would \n    have no option but to follow me.”\n\n    [Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’, 6/34] \n\n    The prohibition is emphasised when it comes to learning and studying these \n    branches of knowledge, if the Muslim does not have sufficient knowledge to \n    recognise what is evil in these subjects and distinguish between it and what \n    they contain of goodness, for if that is the case he will inevitably be \n    affected by some of their evil. We have seen this in many of the Muslims who \n    studied these subjects in the last two centuries, who were called the \n    “pioneers of enlightenment” in the Arab world; they caused confusion and \n    were the first to call for sharee‘ah to be abolished from Muslim countries \n    and they replaced it with Roman and French law. They tried and worked hard \n    to give Muslim societies a western flavour in all fields of life, and they \n    branded those Muslims who adhered to their religion as backward, stagnant, \n    fundamentalists, lovers of darkness and other such words that stemmed from \n    the European environment. \n\n    But if a Muslim has strong faith and is mature in his thinking, so that \n    there is no fear of a man of his calibre becoming confused by the specious \n    arguments that are present in these subjects, then it is permissible for him \n    to study them. In fact it may be obligatory in the case of particular \n    individuals, so that they may follow the latest trends in the theories, \n    ideas and philosophies of the non-Muslims, and refute them and explain what \n    they contain of misguidance, if they find their way to the Muslim lands in \n    the guise of literature, art, culture, academic curricula, economics, social \n    studies, and systems of rulings and management. \n\n    The importance of the matter becomes more urgent if there is an instruction \n    to do so from the Muslim ruler who is sincere to his ummah, as the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed Zayd ibn Thaabit to \n    learn the language of the Jews. \n\n    Al-Bukhaari mentioned that in a chapter in his Saheeh (6/2631) in \n    which he said: Chapter on translating for rulers; is it permissible to have \n    one translator? Khaarijah ibn Zayd ibn Thaabit narrated from Zayd ibn \n    Thaabit that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    instructed him to learn the language of the Jews, until I wrote letters for \n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and I read to him \n    their letters if they wrote to him.\n\n    Narrated and classed as saheeh by at-Tirmidhi (no. 2639); classed as saheeh \n    by al-Albaani in al-Mishkaat (4659) \nA \n    similar question was asked of the Standing committee for Issuing Fatwas and \n    they replied as follows: \nIt \n    is not permissible to learn man-made laws in order to apply them, so long as \n    they are contrary to the laws of Allah. But it is permissible to study law \n    and learn it in order to explain its flaws and how it has deviated from the \n    right path, and to highlight the justice and fairness that there is in \n    Islam, how sound it is and how it is sufficient for people’s interests. It \n    is not permissible for a Muslim to study philosophy, man-made laws, and the \n    like, if he is not able to distinguish between what is right and what is \n    wrong in them, lest he become confused and deviate from the straight path. \n    But that is permissible for one who is able to understand it after having \n    studied the Qur’an and Sunnah, so that he is able to distinguish the bad \n    from the good in these subjects, so that he will be able to confirm the \n    truth and nullify falsehood, so long as that will not distract him from more \n    important duties. Thus it is known that it is not permissible to teach these \n    subjects in schools and universities, and it should only be for the elite \n    who are qualified for that, so that they may undertake their Islamic duty of \n    supporting the truth and refuting falsehood.\n\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah \n    (14/232-233) \n\n    Our advice to our brother is to examine his own situation: does he meet the \n    conditions referred to above, namely knowledge of sound belief (‘aqeedah) \n    and adherence to it, mature thinking that can distinguish between truth and \n    falsehood, the ability to refute specious arguments and misguidance on the \n    basis of sound evidence, and sincerity towards Islam. If, after examining \n    himself, he feels that he meets these conditions, then he may go ahead and \n    study these two subjects, after praying to Allah, may He be exalted, for \n    guidance in making that decision (istikhaarah). Otherwise it is \n    better for him to forget about that and study some other, purely scientific, \n    subject. \n\n    And he should remember that whoever gives up something for the sake of \n    Allah, Allah will replace it with something better than it. \nWe \n    ask Allah to help you and guide you to that which will benefit you in \n    religious and worldly terms. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the permissibility of studying psychology and law can be approached from several angles, mainly focusing on the intentions and applications of the knowledge acquired. \n\n1. **Psychology**: Studying psychology can be seen as beneficial if it aims to help individuals understand their mental health, improve well-being, and address issues related to behavior and emotions. Knowledge in this field can assist in providing care and support to those in need, which aligns with Islamic values of compassion and helping others. However, it is essential that the study does not contradict Islamic teachings or promote ideas that are incompatible with Islam. \n\n2. **Law**: Studying law is generally viewed as permissible and even commendable, especially if it aims to promote justice, protect people's rights, and uphold societal order. Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) emphasizes the importance of justice, and a solid understanding of legal principles can aid in enforcing and interpreting Islamic law (Sharia). Additionally, studying secular law can help Muslims navigate legal systems in non-Muslim countries while maintaining their religious obligations.\n\nIn both cases, the key factors are the intention behind studying these fields and the application of the knowledge gained. If the study serves to fulfill a beneficial purpose in line with Islamic principles, it is typically viewed as permissible and even encouraged. \n\nAs always, it is advisable for individuals to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars and apply their learning in ways that bring about positive contributions to society while staying true to their faith."

        "question": "Can he continue to follow the Hanafi madhhab, and how can he determine which view is correct?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Our advice to all the Muslims who are not specialists in Islamic sciences is \n    to adhere in their beliefs and practice of Islam to the straight path that \n    is protected from error, that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has \n    enjoined them to adhere to, and all that which may guide to it. This may be \n    explained as follows: \n\n    -1-\n\n    The Qur’an and saheeh Sunnah, for in them is guidance and light, and in them \n    is protection from error and misguidance. We are certain that the people \n    will not be able to thoroughly examine the Qur’an and Sunnah in order to \n    develop proper understanding as the scholars and fuqaha’ do, but we are \n    certain that there is something in common that any rational Muslim can learn \n    and understand of the Holy Qur’an. This is what is called the clear and \n    unambiguous texts or general principles, that cannot be hidden from anyone \n    who reads this great Book, such as the call to affirm the Oneness of Allah (Tawheed) \n    and devote worship only to Him; to avoid shirk and kufr; to believe in Allah \n    and His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and the divine \n    decree, both good and bad; to promote virtues, good character and good \n    traits; the prohibition on wrongdoing, transgression, murder, theft, zina, \n    drinking alcohol, consuming orphans’ wealth, and other major sins and bad \n    characteristics. All of that we find clearly stated in the Book of Allah, \n    may He be exalted, and in the Sunnah and biography of the Prophet (blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him). Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, \n    says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “And We have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and \n    remember, then is there any that will remember (or receive admonition)?”\n\n    [al-Qamar 54:17]\n\n    “Do they not then think deeply in the Quran, or are their \n    hearts locked up (from understanding it)?”\n\n    [Muhammad 47:24].\n\n    Were it not that the Qur’an is clear and unambiguous with regard to the \n    basic and general principles of Islam for everyone who reads it and \n    contemplates it, there would be no benefit in it, and it would have been a \n    book for the elite, which no one would read except a certain class of highly \n    educated people. In that case its light and the purpose for which it was \n    revealed would be lost. If an Arab from the time of Jaahiliyyah (i.e., \n    before Islam), one of the disbelievers of Quraysh, came across the verses of \n    the Holy Qur’an, he would sense what it contained of guidance and light, and \n    he would understand what it was telling him of the call of truth, justice \n    and goodness. But some of them would believe and some of them would be \n    stubborn and arrogant. It cannot be the case that the Muslim who grows up in \n    a Muslim family today, at a time of knowledge and reason, would be less \n    capable of understanding the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and knowing \n    its basic principles, general rulings and noble guidelines. \n\n    -2-\n\n    Learning from the trustworthy scholars and fuqaha’ – of whom there are many \n    nowadays, praise be to Allah. They are the ones to whose knowledge, \n    understanding and righteous deeds the ummah testifies and bears witness that \n    they have attained a high level in that regard, by virtue of their efforts, \n    patience and sincerity towards this religion. \n\n    Their sign is that you will always find them quoting as evidence the verses \n    of the Qur’an and the hadeeths of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \n    be upon him), distinguishing what is sound from what is unsound, and fully \n    aware of what abrogates and what is abrogated, what is specific in meaning \n    and application, and what is general. \n\n    Another of their signs is that you will find them following the example of \n    the righteous early generations, namely the Sahaabah, Taabi‘een and \n    prominent imams (leading scholars), and not diverging from their teachings. \n    In every fatwa or comment they refer to one of the earlier imams, such as \n    Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, or Sufyaan and al-Azwaa‘i, or Abu Haneefah, Maalik, ash-Shaafa‘i \n    and Ahmad, and after them they refer to prominent scholars among Ahl as-Sunnah \n    and the followers of the righteous early generations, such as Ibn Taymiyah, \n    Ibn Katheer, Ibn Rajab and other similar scholars of Islam concerning whose \n    pre-eminence and sincerity the Muslims do not disagree. \n\n    One of the most prominent of their signs in general terms, which we advise \n    people to pay attention to, is the fact that they do not claim to belong \n    exclusively to any particular group and they do not have a name that sets \n    them apart from the ummah; rather they attribute themselves to this ummah as \n    a whole with its entire history. As for those who claim to belong a \n    particular ideological group, such as the Bareilawis, Deobandis, Qadianis \n    and so on, or who have a description that sets them apart from the \n    description of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah by using a made-up name or some \n    specific clerical hierarchy, in most cases that is indicative of innovation \n    (bid‘ah) or drifting away from the Sunnah, because if what they believed in \n    was the belief of the Muslims of Ahl as-Sunnah, there would be no need for \n    some other name or to call themselves by a name other than that by which \n    Allah called them. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\n\n    “And strive hard in Allah’s Cause as you ought to strive \n    (with sincerity and with all your efforts that His Name should be superior). \n    He has chosen you (to convey His Message of Islamic Monotheism to mankind by \n    inviting them to His religion, Islam), and has not laid upon you in religion \n    any hardship, it is the religion of your father Ibrahim (Abraham) (Islamic \n    Monotheism). It is He (Allah) Who has named you Muslims both before and in \n    this (the Quran), that the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah \n    be upon him)) may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind! \n    So perform AsSalat (Iqamat-as-Salat), give Zakat and hold fast to Allah \n    (i.e. have confidence in Allah, and depend upon Him in all your affairs) He \n    is your Maula (Patron, Lord, etc.), what an Excellent Maula (Patron, Lord, \n    etc.) and what an Excellent Helper”\n\n    [al-Hajj 22:78].\n\n    With regard to joining da‘wah activities in order to cooperate in practical \n    terms, this is not what we are warning against here, and neither is \n    belonging to one of the four madhhabs; rather what is meant is joining or \n    attributing oneself to a group on the basis of some specific beliefs that \n    this group has adopted, and uniting on that basis and taking people as \n    friends or enemies on that basis \n\n    -3-\n\n    Among the most important resources that non-specialists may refer to are: \n    Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Saheeh Muslim; the Sunans of Abu \n    Dawood, at-Tirmidhi, an-Nasaa’i and Ibn Maajah; the books of Imam Maalik and \n    ash-Shaafa‘i, and so on; and the saheeh reports in the books of Imam Abu \n    Haneefah and other leading scholars. There is nothing wrong with following \n    them and learning from their views on fiqh and ‘aqeedah, and reading their \n    books and learning from them, because their books are proof for the right \n    path, and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has instructed us to learn \n    from the scholars as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “And We sent not (as Our Messengers) before you (O Muhammad \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) any but men, whom We inspired, \n    (to preach and invite mankind to believe in the Oneness of Allah). So ask of \n    those who know the Scripture (learned men of the Taurat (Torah) and the \n    Injeel (Gospel)), if you know not”\n\n    [an-Nahl 16:43]. \nIf \n    any of them made a mistake, this is something that no human being can avoid \n    and it is a mistake that is forgiven; in fact they will be rewarded for it \n    by Allah’s leave. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    said: “If a judge passes a judgement having striven to reach a decision, and \n    he gets it right, he will have two rewards. If he passes a judgement having \n    striven to reach a decision and he gets it wrong, he will have one reward.”\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7352) and Muslim (1716). \n\n    Determining which scholarly view among the leading scholars of Islam is most \n    likely to be correct is not an easy matter; it is not possible for everyone, \n    and ordinary Muslims are not obliged to try to do that, because that is \n    something which is only for the scholars. What matters is that the Muslim \n    should not follow odd views, which are few and are well-known; and he should \n    only acquire knowledge from those to whose virtue, knowledge and \n    understanding the ummah has testified. \n\n    Al-‘Allaamah Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nI \n    heard our shaykh – i.e., Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy \n    on him) say: One of the Hanafi fuqaha’ came to me and said: I want to ask \n    you about something. I said: what is it? He said: I want to change my \n    madhhab. I said to him: Why? He said: Because I see that the saheeh hadeeths \n    often differ from it. I asked one of the leading scholars of the Shaafa‘i \n    madhhab about that and he said to me: If you recant your madhhab, that will \n    not affect the madhhab in any way. The madhhabs are well-established and \n    your recanting will serve no purpose. One of the Sufi shaykhs advised me to \n    turn to Allah and beseech Him, and ask Him to guide me to that which He \n    loves and is pleased with. What do you advise me to do? \nI \n    said to him: Divide the madhhab into three categories: \n\n    1.One category where \n    the truth is clearly apparent and in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah, \n    so follow it and be at ease with it.\n\n    2.Another category \n    that is not well founded, and the view that is contrary to it is based on \n    stronger evidence, so do not issue fatwas or verdicts on that basis, and \n    keep away from it.\n\n    3.A (third) category \n    containing issues that are subject to ijtihaad, for which the evidence \n    points in different directions. If you wish, you may issue fatwas on that \n    basis or if you wish you may keep away from it.\nHe \n    said: May Allah reward you with good – or words to that effect.\n\n    End quote from I‘laam al-Muwaqqi‘een (4/236-237) \n\n    Moreover, with regard to the category that is not based on well-founded \n    evidence, as mentioned here, the imam (Abu Haneefah) is not to be blamed for \n    it and this does not undermine the madhhab, because the fact that other \n    views are stronger does not mean that this view has no evidence at all, or \n    that he (Imam Abu Haneefah) based that on whims and desires or innovation. \n    All it means is that other views are stronger and more well-founded in the \n    view of other scholars, as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said: It should be noted that there is none of the great imams \n    who were widely accepted in the ummah who would deliberately oppose the \n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to \n    anything of his Sunnah, whether in minor or major issues, because they were \n    all agreed, on the basis of certainty, on the obligation of following the \n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and were \n    agreed that the view of anyone may be subject to acceptance or rejection, \n    apart from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him). \n\n    But if one of them has a view and there is a saheeh hadith that says the \n    opposite, there must be a reason why he did not follow it, and all reasons \n    can only be one of three things: either he does not believe that the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it; or he does not believe \n    that the hadith refers to that particular issue; or he believes the ruling \n    (in the hadith) was abrogated. These three reasons may be due to various \n    causes.\n\n    End quote from Raf‘ al-Malaam ‘an A’immat al-Islam (p. 8-9) \nTo \n    sum up: there is nothing wrong with continuing to follow the Hanafi madhhab \n    whilst adhering to sound beliefs. It is also permissible for you to follow \n    any of the other well-known madhhabs and views of the prominent scholars. \n\n    For more information, please see fatwas no. 69836,\n    149035 and 158755\n\n    For more information on the Bareilawi sect, please see fatwas no.\n    1487, 150265,\n    161862 and 200321\n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, following a particular madhhab (school of thought) is generally acceptable, as long as it is done sincerely and in pursuit of knowledge and practice of the faith. A person can continue to follow the Hanafi madhhab or any other madhhab that they have studied and are comfortable with. \n\nTo determine which view is correct within the Hanafi madhhab or in any other madhhab, one can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. **Consult Scholars**: Seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars who are well-versed in the Hanafi school. They can provide explanations and insights into various rulings and their evidences.\n\n2. **Study Authentic Sources**: A person can study the foundational texts of the Hanafi madhhab, such as the works of Imam Abu Hanifah and his students, and reputable commentaries on those texts. \n\n3. **Understand Evidence**: It is important to understand the principles and evidential basis (e.g., Quran, Sunnah, consensus, analogy) that the Hanafi school relies upon to make rulings. This can enhance one's appreciation of the rulings and provide clarity.\n\n4. **Check Consensus (Ijma)**: Determine if a particular matter has a consensus among scholars, as this can significantly guide one's understanding.\n\n5. **Personal Reflection**: Engage in personal reflection and prayer (dua) for guidance, trusting in Allah's wisdom and seeking clarity.\n\n6. **Cross-Madhhab Learning**: While sticking to one madhhab, it's sometimes beneficial to learn about opinions from other madhhabs to gain a broader understanding of Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nUltimately, the key is to approach the study and practice of the faith with humility, sincerity, and a willingness to learn. It’s critical to ensure that the practice aligns with authentic teachings and to avoid sectarian disputes, focusing on unity and the core tenets of Islam."

    {
        "question": "Definition of the Islamic character and its main features, and a warning against spoiling or distorting it",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThe Islamic character is one that is sound and upright; in terms of its principles, fundamentals and etiquette it is based on submission and adherence to the teachings of Islam, in obedience to Allah and His Messenger. \nIt is the character that learns its etiquette and bases its principles on the Qur’an and Sunnah. It is the character that seeks to apply those teachings by following the example of the early generations of the ummah and of the righteous among them who achieve a great deal in that field. \nIslam is very keen to describe the true Islamic character and it confirms the importance of its main features that are based on sound Islamic teaching. Islam discusses a great deal of the features of this character and its fundamentals, and its impact on the well-being of individuals and communities, so that the accurate image of true Islam, and its impact on people’s life, may be presented. \nThe Islamic character is based on belief in Allah and His Messengers, and in His promise and warning, and on adherence to Islamic conduct in a complete way, which includes truthfulness, honesty, chastity, modesty, good attitude, kindness to neighbours, hastening to do good, helping people to do what is right, refraining from harming others, and other aspects of Islamic conduct. \nThe basis of the Islamic character is belief in Allah and His Messenger, and submission to and compliance with the rulings, principles and etiquette of Islam. \nThroughout the centuries, the Islamic character has been subjected to evil campaigns aimed at distorting, deforming and scorning it. By means of what they have introduced of philosophies and cultural practices, the enemies of Islam have sought to crowd Islam out of people’s hearts, so that Islam will no longer be the only factor in building human character, and people will no longer see the sublimity, perfection and pure belief of Islamic teachings. Thus there will be distortion, alterations and changes, by means of which the enemies of Allah seek to reach their goals – which Allah will never let them reach – of extinguishing His light and altering His words. \nThe Islamic character today has no choice but to adhere to that to which their predecessors before them adhered, namely affirmation of the Oneness of Allah (tawheed) and sound commitment and loyalty to the religion of Allah, as well as complete disavowal of the enemies of Allah and their beliefs and principles, whilst adhering to the sublime conduct that Islam promotes. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I was only sent to perfect good manners and attitude.” Narrated by Ahmad (8729); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘ (2349). \nSecondly: \nAchieving that may be done by educating people and teaching them sound beliefs and how to purify their souls in word and deed, on the basis of Islamic principles and the teachings of the Qur’an and Sunnah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Indeed Allah conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) from among themselves, reciting unto them His Verses (the Quran), and purifying them (from sins by their following him), and instructing them (in) the Book (the Quran) and Al-Hikmah (the wisdom and the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) (i.e. his legal ways, statements, acts of worship, etc.)), while before that they had been in manifest error” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:164]. \nThirdly: \nThis Islamic character will have high aspirations because of its faith and certainty and belief in the promise of Allah, and because it realises the honour attained by being a Muslim and a follower of the Prophets. The Muslim’s aspiration will be commensurate with his level of faith and certainty, because actions are connected to that which is settled in the heart of certainty, faith and belief. This is something that is very clear to everyone with regard to any issue. \nAccording to the level of the Muslim’s awareness of his strength, honour and pride, his ambitions will soar and he will be of strong resolve, and his religious commitment will be sound. \nFourthly: \nNeuro-linguistic programming, according to those who believe in it, is a collection of ways and methods that are based on psychological principles, aimed at solving some psychological problems and helping people to achieve greater success in their lives. According to its promoters, the one who becomes well-versed in the methods of this school of psychology will not need help from anyone else. Hence it may be a means of self-help behavioural therapy, that tries to work out a clear plan for success, then it uses psychological techniques to reinforce the more successful behaviour and try to undo some old beliefs which are diagnosed as an obstacle to the individual’s development. Therefore it is called programming, because it reprograms the mind. \nBut in fact, after examining this new science and its fundamental principles and what it is based on, and what it results in, we realise that it has roots in philosophy and certain beliefs, and it also brainwashes the Muslim and teaches him corrupt ideas that are contrary to sound beliefs. \nContemporary scholars have issued many fatwas concerning it, and some prominent specialists in the fields of psychology and psychiatry have also warned against this programming, and have highlighted its negative effects and the danger it poses to the religious commitment and character of the Muslim. \nFor more information, please see the book Ma‘aalim ash-Shakhsiyyah al-Islamiyyah by Dr. ‘Umar Sulaymaan al-Ashqar. Another important book on Islamic education is Manhaj at-Tarbiyyah al-Islamiyyah by Prof. Muhammad Qutub (may Allah preserve him); see also his book Diraasaat fi’n-Nafs al-Insaaniyyah. We also advise you to read the book Zahara Jeel Salaah ad-Deen by Dr. Maajid ‘Arsaan al-Keelaani. \nFor more information, please see also the answer to questions no. 138390  \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of Islamic character (akhlaq) refers to the moral and ethical attributes that a Muslim is encouraged to embody in their behavior and interactions with others. This character is shaped by the teachings of the Quran, the Sunnah (the practices of the Prophet Muhammad), and the principles of Islamic theology. The Islamic character emphasizes virtues that promote harmony, justice, compassion, and integrity within the individual and society as a whole.\n\n### Main Features of Islamic Character\n\n1. **Justice (Adl)**: Upholding fairness in all dealings, whether in personal relationships or societal matters.\n\n2. **Honesty (Sidq)**: Being truthful and sincere in speech and actions, cultivating trustworthiness.\n\n3. **Compassion (Rahma)**: Showing kindness and care toward others, including family, friends, and those in need.\n\n4. **Humility (Tawadu')**: Recognizing one's limitations and treating others with respect, regardless of their status.\n\n5. **Patience (Sabr)**: Exercising self-control and resilience in the face of adversity and challenges.\n\n6. **Gratitude (Shukr)**: Acknowledging and appreciating the blessings and provisions bestowed by Allah.\n\n7. **Modesty (Haya)**: Exhibiting modest behavior, which reflects in one's actions, speech, and dress.\n\n8. **Generosity (Karim)**: Being charitable and willing to share resources with those who are less fortunate.\n\n9. **Forgiveness (Afw)**: Being willing to forgive others and seek reconciliation rather than holding grudges.\n\n10. **Respect for Others**: Valuing the dignity of all individuals regardless of their faith, background, or beliefs.\n\n### Warning Against Distorting Islamic Character\n\nDistorting or spoiling one's Islamic character can manifest in various ways, such as succumbing to arrogance, dishonesty, hatred, or injustice. Such behavior not only deviates from the core teachings of Islam but also harms the individual and the community at large. The Prophet Muhammad emphasized that good character is a key component of faith, stating that he was sent to perfect moral character.\n\nEngaging in negative traits can lead to various social and personal consequences, including discord within families, conflicts in society, and estrangement from one's faith. Therefore, Muslims are encouraged to continuously strive for self-improvement, to seek knowledge, and to hold themselves accountable for their actions.\n\nThe preservation of Islamic character is essential for fostering a peaceful and just society where the values of Islam can flourish. It is a lifelong commitment that involves self-reflection, learning, and striving for personal improvement in accordance with Islamic teachings."

        "question": "Will the Qur’an testify, on the Day of Resurrection, against those who went against it as it will testify for its companions (those who read it and acted upon it) and intercede for them?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIt is proven in the saheeh Sunnah that the Quran will intercede for its companions on the Day of Resurrection. Muslim (804) narrated that Abu Umaamah al-Baahili said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Read the Qur’aan, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection interceding for its companions.” \nImam Ahmad (6589) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting and the Quran will intercede for a person on the Day of Resurrection. Fasting will say: O Lord, I kept him from his food and desires during the day; let me intercede for him. And the Quran will say: I kept him from sleeping during the night; let me intercede for him. And they will be allowed to intercede.”\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 7329 \nSee also the answer to question no. 14035 \nSecondly: \nJust as the Quran will intercede for its companions on the Day of Resurrection, it will also testify against those who went against it by neglecting it, ignoring its obligations and transgressing against the limits it set. \nMuslim (223) narrated that Abu Maalik al-Ash‘ari said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Qur’aan is evidence for you or against you.” \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nEither it will be for you, if you sought to draw close to Allah means of it, and you fulfilled the obligations towards the Holy Quran, namely believing its stories, obeying its commands, heeding its prohibitions and venerating and respecting the Holy Quran, in which case it will be proof for you, \nOr it will be the opposite, if you disrespected the Quran and neglected its words and meanings and failed to act upon it, and you did not fulfil the obligations towards it. In that case it will be a witness against you on the Day of Resurrection. \nEnd quote from Sharh Riyadh as-Saaliheen, p. 30 \nIbn Hibbaan narrated in his Saheeh (124) from Jaabir that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Quran is an intercessor whose intercession will be accepted and an opponent whose testimony will be accepted. Whoever puts it in front of him, it will lead him to Paradise, and whoever puts it behind his back, it will drive him to Hell.” \nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, 2019; ad-Daaraqutni mentioned it in al-‘Ilal, 5/102, where he said that it was mawqoof and its isnaad stopped at Ibn Mas‘ood. \nIbn Hibbaan said, commenting on this hadith: \nThis is a report from the wording of which one who does not have deep knowledge may think that the Quran is something created, but that is not the case. The Arabs may give the name of a thing to its cause and they may give the name of the cause to the thing. Because acting in accordance with the Quran will lead a person to Paradise, the name of that thing, which is acting in accordance with the Quran, is given to its cause, which is the Quran. It does not mean that the Quran is created. \nan-Nihaayah, 4/636 \nan-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nIt says in az-Zaahir: What is meant is that the one against whom the Quran testifies and says that he fell short and neglected it will be in Hell. And it is said: Do not make the Quran an opponent, i.e., to testify against you. \nEnd quote from Fayd al-Qadeer, 4/699 \nIt was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (30667), Ibn Qutaybah in Ta’weel Mukhtalif al-hadith (p. 258), Ibn ad-Durays in Fadaa’il al-Quran (89), via Muhammad ibn Ishaaq, from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, that his grandfather said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say:\n“The Quran will appear on the Day of Resurrection in the form of a man who will bring the man who learned it but went against its commands. It will appear as a disputant against him and will say: O Lord, You made him learn about me but what a bad learner he was; he transgressed my limits, neglected my obligations, disobeyed me and did not obey me. It will keep throwing accusations at him until it is said: Do what you like with him. Then it will take him by the hand and will not let him go until it throws him onto a rock in Hell. And it will bring a righteous man who learned it and adhered to its teachings. It will appear as a defendant and will say: O Lord, You made him learn about me and what a good learner he was; he respected my limits, did the obligatory duties, avoided the sins mentioned in me and obeyed my instructions. And it will keep presenting arguments in his favour until it is said: Do what you like with him. Then it will take him by the hand and will not let him go until it dresses him in brocade and puts on him the crown of a king.” \nThis is a da‘eef (weak) isnaad, because Ibn Ishaaq is mudallis and used the word ‘an (narrating from, i.e., he did not state clearly that he heard it directly). But al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Khalq Af‘aal al-‘Ibaad (474): \n‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The Quran will appear in the form of a man on the Day of Resurrection and will intercede for its companions.”\nZuhayr ibn Harb told me: Ya‘qoob ibn Ibraaheem told us: my father told me from Ibn Ishaaq, and ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr told me, from his father, from his grandfather: I heard this from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Abu ‘Abdullah (i.e., al-Bukhaari) said: “This is his earnings and his deeds.” End quote. \nSo it is proven that Ibn Ishaaq heard the hadith from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, thus the hadith is proven. \nThe words “The Quran will appear on the Day of Resurrection…” mean that his recitation of the Quran will appear to him. \nSee the answer to question no. 91306\nIt was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (30676) and ad-Daarimi (3325) from ash-Sha‘bi, from Ibn Mas‘ood who said: “The Quran will come on the Day of Resurrection and will intercede for its companion, and it will lead him to Paradise, or it will testify against (a person) and will drive him to Hell. Ash-Sha‘bi did not hear from Ibn Mas‘ood, as it says in al-Maraaseel by Ibn Abi Haatim (p. 25). \nBut there is a corroborating report that says: “The Quran is an intercessor whose intercession will be accepted and an opponent whose testimony will be accepted. Whoever puts it in front of him, it will lead him to Paradise, and whoever puts it behind his back, it will drive him to Hell.” \nThis was narrated via a number of isnaads from Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him).See: Fadaa’il al-Quran  by al-Firyaabi (20); Fadaa’il al-Quran by Abu ‘Ubayd (44); Fadaa’il al-Quran by Ibn Durays (94); az-Zuhd by Imam Ahmad (p. 155); Shu‘ab al-Eemaan by al-Bayhaqi (2010); al-Mu‘jam al-Kabeer by at-Tabaraani (8655). \nFrom the above it is clear that just as the Quran will testify for its companions on the Date of Resurrection, it will also testify against those who went against it. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, it is understood that the Qur'an will indeed serve as a witness on the Day of Resurrection. There are numerous Hadiths and interpretations from Islamic scholars that suggest the Qur'an will intercede for those who read it, memorize it, and adhere to its teachings. This intercession is a form of honor for the companions of the Qur'an—those who engage with it sincerely and strive to live by its guidance.\n\nConversely, the Qur'an is also described as a witness against those who disregard its teachings and turn away from it. This perspective emphasizes the responsibility of Muslims to engage with the Qur'an meaningfully and to implement its guidance in their lives.\n\nIn summary, the Qur'an can be a source of intercession for its adherents while also serving as a witness against those who neglect or oppose its teachings. This dual role underscores the importance of treating the Qur'an with respect and obedience in a believer's life."

        "question": "Does the death of an elderly person cause calamity or a decrease in barakah (blessing) for his surviving family members?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Death is a great calamity and trial, with \n    which a person’s good deeds and lifespan come to an end, and the individual \n    goes to meet his Lord. If he did good then the outcome will be good, and if \n    he did evil than the outcome will be bad. Death causes tears to flow, \n    saddens the heart and provokes grief. \n\n    Allah, may He be exalted, says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): “And certainly, We shall test you with \n    something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad \n    tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.)” [al-Baqarah 2:155]. Loss \n    of lives is included among the calamities that may befall people. \n\n    And Allah knows best. \n\n    All of this has to do with general \n    guidelines. With regard to what is mentioned in the question, about the \n    death of elderly people being a cause for calamity to befall the family, or \n    a cause of a decrease in barakah, this is something for which there is no \n    evidence whatsoever. People older and younger are constantly dying; if the \n    death of an elderly person was a cause for a decrease in barakah or of \n    calamity occurring, barakah would have been erased in this world and one \n    calamity after another would have befallen the members of every household. \n    But this is contrary to what is seen and known, and it is different from the \n    way in which Allah has ordained things should occur in this world. How many \n    elderly people have died, yet their families enjoyed blessing after they \n    were gone, either because of wealth that was left to them or because of a \n    blessing that was bestowed upon them, or because of a woman getting married \n    and other things that are seen and well-known. \n\n    Moreover, what connection do the living \n    have with the death of the elderly person, such that calamity as mentioned \n    by this questioner would befall them, regardless of whether the deceased was \n    righteous or otherwise? Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of \n    the meaning):\n\n    “Whoever goes right, then he goes right \n    only for the benefit of his own self. And whoever goes astray, then he goes \n    astray to his own loss. No one laden with burdens can bear another’s burden”\n\n    [al-Isra’ 17:15]. \n\n    Rather real calamity befalls people with \n    the death of a scholar of whose knowledge the people are now deprived, or \n    one who was devoted to worship and obedience, or one who did things that \n    bring benefit to people, such as striving in jihad for the sake of Allah, \n    enjoining what is good, forbidding what is evil, giving charity and zakaah, \n    and so on. All of that has nothing to do with whether a person is young or \n    old; rather it has to do with how he is, the benefits he brings to people, \n    and the blessings he brings to his surroundings. Undoubtedly the death of \n    such people is a loss of goodness and barakah, and detracts from people’s \n    religious and worldly interests. Those who are most sorely affected by their \n    loss are those who are close to them, but this does not mean that another \n    calamity will befall them after that, unless they do after that an action \n    that deserves that. It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas \n    said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) say: “Allah will not take away knowledge by snatching it away from the \n    people, rather He will take away knowledge by taking away the scholars \n    until, when there is no scholar left, people will turn to ignorant leaders \n    who will be asked questions and will issue fatwas without knowledge. They \n    will go astray and lead others astray.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (100) and \n    Muslim (2673) \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the death of an elderly person is viewed with a mix of sorrow and acceptance, as death is a natural part of human life and a decree from Allah. It is a time for mourning and reflection, as the deceased leaves behind a legacy, experiences, and wisdom that can greatly impact their family and community.\n\nThe concept of calamity (fitnah) and barakah (blessings) is nuanced in Islamic teachings. While the death of a loved one can create feelings of loss and grief, it is important to understand that such events do not inherently bring calamity or decrease barakah. Instead, they can serve as an opportunity for the family to come together, strengthen their bonds, and seek to carry on the values and teachings of the deceased.\n\nIn fact, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught that enduring the loss of a loved one with patience and faith can bring about greater rewards and blessings from Allah. The way the surviving family members respond to the loss—through prayer, charity, and continued remembrance of the deceased—can also invite barakah into their lives.\n\nUltimately, while death can change the dynamics of a family, it is not necessarily a cause for ongoing calamity or a permanent decrease in barakah. It is an occasion to reunite in faith and support one another, remembering the virtues and lessons learned from the departed."

        "question": "He is asking: why are most of the people on earth disbelievers, and why does Allah want them to enter Hell?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    First of all we \n    should point out that what the questioner mentioned about Allah’s love for \n    His creation being “seventy times greater than the love of a mother for her \n    child” has no basis in the Qur’an or Sunnah. Allah, may He be exalted, does \n    not love the transgressors, and He does not love the evildoers, and He does \n    not love the disbelievers, so how can it be affirmed that Allah, may He be \n    exalted, loves all of His creation when the vast majority of them are these \n    types of people? Rather Allah, may He be exalted, loves those who do good, \n    and He loves the pious, and He loves those who repent, and He loves those \n    who purify themselves, and He loves those who are patient, and He loves \n    those who put their trust in Him, and He loves those who are fair and just. \n    These types of people are the ones for whom Allah, may He be exalted, \n    affirmed His love and they – naturally – cannot be any but those who affirm \n    His Oneness and not those who associate others with Him. \n\n    But despite all \n    that, among the names of Allah, may He be glorified, are the names \n    ar-Rahmaan (the Most Gracious), ar-Raheem (the Most Merciful); His mercy \n    precedes His wrath, and His pardon precedes His punishment, and He is more \n    merciful to His slaves than a mother to her child. \n\n    It was narrated \n    that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \n    \n    Some prisoners were brought to the Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and there was a woman among the \n    prisoners who was searching for someone. When she found a small boy among \n    the prisoners, she clasped him to her and started to breastfeed him. The \n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to us: \n    “Do you think that this woman would throw her child into the fire?” We said: \n    No, by Allah, she would never do that if she is able not to. The Messenger \n    of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah is more \n    merciful towards His slaves than this woman is towards her child.”\n\n    Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari, 5999; Muslim, 2754. \n\n    There is a \n    difference between mercy and love. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, \n    has sent down a share of His mercy by virtue of which people show compassion \n    towards one another, He grants provision to His slaves, gives them more \n    time, is forbearing towards them and bears patiently their disbelief and \n    offensive words. All of that is in this world; but in the hereafter, His \n    mercy will be only for those who believed in Him and submitted to Him. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    With regard to the \n    question, “Why are most people on earth non-Muslims?” The answer to that is: \n    because they are the ones who have chosen disbelief over Islam. Here we will \n    set aside those who are excused because the message did not reach them, and \n    let us ask: what is the matter with those who read about Islam and whom the \n    call reached, and they saw thousands of their coreligionists race towards \n    Islam, and they saw the millions who follow this great religion, and they \n    saw the clear signs that point to the truthfulness of the Prophet (blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him) and the truthfulness of his call, and the \n    truthfulness and miraculous nature of the Qur’an, and they heard the debates \n    in which the enemies of Islam were defeated and their specious arguments \n    refuted – yet despite all of that, and much more besides, they did not \n    believe in Islam and they did not accept it as their religion; rather \n    billions of them were content to worship a cross that they made or an idol \n    that they carved, or a grave that they built up, or a cow that they \n    worshipped instead of Allah. There is no power and no strength except with \n    Allah. \n\n    The truth is \n    obvious and clear; the signs that point to the greatness of Islam are too \n    many to be counted; no wise person can argue against the evidence that what \n    these disbelievers are doing is false; sound human nature and reasoning \n    reject those (false) acts of worship and the taking of other gods as lords \n    instead of Allah, the One. Allah, may He be exalted, has highlighted the \n    evidence and has established proof against them. Yet despite that, most \n    people insist on disbelieving and you will not find most people to be \n    grateful monotheists; rather they are disbelievers and polytheists. \n\n    Thirdly: \n\n    As for the answer \n    to the question, So why does Allah want the majority of His creation to \n    enter Hell?, The answer is that Allah, may He be exalted, does not approve \n    of the disbelief of these people and He does not like it, but they liked it \n    for themselves. The Almighty Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, has \n    stated in His holy Book that He is not pleased with the disbelief of the \n    disbelievers, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “If \n    you disbelieve, then verily, Allaah is not in need of you; He likes not \n    disbelief for His slaves. And if you are grateful (by being believers), He \n    is pleased therewith for you”\n\n    [az-Zumar 39:7].\n\n    This is a clear \n    statement that Allah, may He be exalted, does not like disbelief for His \n    slaves; rather He likes Tawheed (affirmation of the Oneness of Allah) and \n    Islam for them. Rather they are the ones who like disbelief as a religion \n    for themselves, and they refused to join the ranks of those who affirm the \n    Oneness of Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, does not force anyone to become \n    a Muslim or to become a disbeliever; rather He, may He be glorified and \n    exalted, has explained the paths of truth and falsehood, right and wrong, \n    Islam and disbelief, then He has given people the choice, along with His \n    promise to the Muslims of reward and His warning to the disbelievers of \n    Hell. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “29. And say: \n    ‘The truth is from your Lord.’ Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and \n    whosoever wills, let him disbelieve. Verily, We have prepared for the \n    Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers), a Fire whose walls will be \n    surrounding them (disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah). And if they ask for \n    help (relief, water), they will be granted water like boiling oil, that will \n    scald their faces. Terrible is the drink, and an evil Murtafaq (dwelling, \n    resting place)!\n\n    30. Verily, as \n    for those who believed and did righteous deeds, certainly We shall not make \n    the reward of anyone who does his (righteous) deeds in the most perfect \n    manner to be lost.\n\n    31. These! For \n    them will be ‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens); wherein rivers flow \n    underneath them; therein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and \n    they will wear green garments of fine and thick silk. They will recline \n    therein on raised thrones. How good is the reward, and what an excellent \n    Murtafaq (dwelling, resting place)!”\n\n    [al-Kahf \n    18:29-31] \n\n    “2. Verily, We \n    have created man from Nutfah (drops) of mixed semen (sexual discharge of man \n    and woman), in order to try him, so We made him hearer and seer.\n\n    3. Verily, We \n    showed him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful.\n\n    4. Verily, We \n    have prepared for the disbelievers iron chains, iron collars, and a blazing \n    Fire.\n\n    5. Verily, the \n    Abraar (the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism) shall drink of a cup (of \n    wine) mixed with (water from a spring in Paradise called) Kaafoor.\n\n    6. A spring \n    wherefrom the slaves of Allah will drink, causing it to gush forth \n    abundantly.”\n\n    [al-Insaan \n    76:2-6]. \n\n    Here we will quote \n    an example of how Allah offered guidance to people by sending Messengers \n    with clear signs, yet they chose disbelief over Islam. They were the people \n    of Thamood. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “17. And as for \n    Thamood, We showed and made clear to them the Path of Truth (Islamic \n    Monotheism) through Our Messenger (i.e. showed them the way of success), but \n    they preferred blindness to guidance; so the Saa‘iqah (a destructive awful \n    cry, torment, hit, thunderbolt) of disgracing torment seized them because of \n    what they used to earn.\n\n    18. And We \n    saved those who believed and used to fear Allaah, keep their duty to Him and \n    avoid evil.”\n\n    [Fussilat \n    41:17-18]. \n\n    This is an \n    example, and similar to these people are all those who disbelieved in their \n    Lord and rejected their Messengers, and were content with disbelief in this \n    world and eternity in the Fire in the Hereafter. These modern disbelievers \n    have a precedent; messengers brought the truth from their Lord to them, and \n    Allah, may He be exalted, made the Messenger to each people one of their \n    own, so that they would recognise his truthfulness and honesty, and He gave \n    each one of them a sign that is enough proof for people, yet despite that, \n    they said that their Messengers were sorcerers or madmen. The disbelievers \n    of Quraysh demanded a sign from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him) so that they would believe. He showed them the splitting of the \n    moon, and they said that it was sorcery. So the words of Allah concerning \n    them are true (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “and even if \n    they see every one of the Ayaat (signs) they will not believe therein”\n\n    [al-An‘aam \n    6:25]. \n\n    Those people did \n    not stop at rejecting the Messengers of their Lord; rather they conspired \n    against them, to kill them or expel them from their lands. Allah, may He be \n    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “And those who \n    disbelieved, said to their Messengers: ‘Surely, we shall drive you out of \n    our land, or you shall return to our religion.’ So their Lord revealed to \n    them: ‘Truly, We shall destroy the Zaalimoon (polytheists, disbelievers and \n    wrongdoers)’”\n\n    [Ibraaheem \n    14:13]. \n\n    And Allah, may He \n    be exalted, tells us that the people of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) said:\n\n    “So nothing was \n    the answer of [Ibraaheem’s (Abraham’s)] people except that they said: ‘Kill \n    him or burn him.’ Then Allah saved him from the fire. Verily, in this are \n    indeed signs for a people who believe”\n\n    [al-‘Ankaboot \n    29:24]. \n\n    And Allah, may He \n    be exalted, says concerning our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him):\n\n    “And (remember) \n    when the disbelievers plotted against you (O Muhammad\n    صلى الله عليه وسلم) to imprison you, or \n    to kill you, or to get you out (from your home, i.e. Makkah)”\n\n    [al-Anfaal \n    8:30]. \n\n    If this was the \n    case with regard to those to whom the Messenger, whom they knew, brought the \n    message from his Lord, and they saw the signs with their own eyes, then what \n    about those Indians, Chinese and Europeans, if the Arabian Prophet Muhammad \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) came to them as a bringer of \n    glad tidings and a warner?? \n\n    When some of the \n    polytheists claimed that Allah, may He be exalted, approved of their \n    disbelief and that if that was not the case, He would have diverted them \n    from it, our Lord, may He be blessed and exulted, showed them to be liars \n    and explained that they were only following their whims and desires and \n    their forefathers who had gone astray. Allah, may He be exalted, said \n    (interpretation of the meaning)\n\n    “And those who \n    joined others in worship with Allah said: ‘If Allah had so willed, neither \n    we nor our fathers would have worshipped aught but Him, nor would we have \n    forbidden anything without (Command from) Him’”\n\n    [an-Nahl 16:35]. \n\n    Then Allah, may He \n    be exalted, refuted them by saying:\n\n    “And verily, We \n    have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \n    ‘Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghoot (all false \n    deities, i.e. do not worship Taaghoot alongside Allah).’ Then of them were \n    some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was \n    justified”\n\n    [an-Nahl 16:36]. \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad \n    al-Ameen ash-Shanqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    In these verses, \n    Allah explains that He did not approve of their disbelief, and that He sent \n    a Messenger to every nation, commanding them on the Messenger’s lips to \n    worship Allah alone and to avoid taaghoot (false gods), i.e., to keep away \n    from the worship of any deity besides Him. He also told them that Allah \n    guided some of them to worship Him alone, and that some of them went astray; \n    in other words, their disbelief and doom were confirmed. \n\n    Allah, may He be \n    exalted, says in Soorat al-An‘aam (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “Say: ‘With \n    Allah is the perfect proof and argument, (i.e. the Oneness of Allaah, the \n    sending of His Messengers and His Holy Books, to mankind); had He so willed, \n    He would indeed have guided you all’”\n\n    [al-An‘aam \n    6:149].\n\n    The fact that He \n    alone can help and guide people is the perfect proof and argument against \n    His creation. In other words: whoever We guide and bless with Our help, that \n    is grace and mercy from Us. And whoever We do not do that for, that is \n    justice and wisdom from Us, because he was not owed that by Us and did not \n    deserve it from Us. Rather if We grant that, it is grace, and if we do not \n    grant it, it is justice.\n\n    End quote from\n    \n    Adwa’ al-Bayaan, \n    7/95, 96. \n\n    Fourthly: \n\n    The questioner \n    says: Is it true that no one will ever enter Paradise except Muslims, and \n    Ahl as-Sunnah in particular? That is subject to further discussion: \n\n    Following the \n    sending of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then yes, \n    no one will enter Paradise except a Muslim, because Islam abrogated all the \n    previous religions; Allah, may He be exalted, commanded all His creation to \n    enter this religion, and stated that He will never accept any other religion \n    from anyone, and that whoever meets Him with any other religion will be \n    among the losers. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n    meaning):\n\n    “And whoever \n    seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in \n    the Hereafter he will be one of the losers”\n\n    [Aal ‘Imraan \n    3:85].\n\n    Because of that, \n    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed Bilaal to \n    call out to the people: “No one will enter Paradise except a Muslim.”\n\n    Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari, 3062; Muslim, 178. \n\n    With regard to the \n    previous nations, everyone who believed in his Prophet and Messenger will \n    enter Paradise; they were the Muslims of their time. Allah, may He be \n    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “Verily, those \n    who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever \n    believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have \n    their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they \n    grieve”\n\n    [al-Baqarah \n    2:62]. \n\n    With regard to the \n    question of Paradise being for Ahl as-Sunnah in particular, this is an \n    incorrect view. None of the scholars have said such a thing; rather all of \n    the ummah of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who \n    responded to his call will enter Paradise; no one will be deprived of it \n    except those who turned on their heels (apostatized) and nullified their \n    Islam by doing something that took them out of Islam altogether, and those \n    innovators who went against sharee‘ah and opposed Ahl as-Sunnah. They, like \n    other sinners among the monotheists, will be subject to the will of Allah, \n    may He be glorified and exalted: if He wills, He will punish them, and if He \n    wills, He will forgive them, then the final destination of any one of them \n    will be Paradise, if he died believing in Tawheed. \n\n    This also applies \n    to those who committed some sins or fell into some innovation, but were \n    among Ahl as-Sunnah in general; they will also be subject to the will of \n    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted: if He wills, He will punish them, \n    and if He wills, He will forgive them. However, adhering to the Sunnah, \n    defending it and following it in word and deed will increase the hope of \n    entering Paradise and being saved from the punishment of Allah. \n\n    Fifthly: \n\n    The one who \n    understands from the hadeeth about divisions and from the words of the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about the seventy-two \n    different sects who go against Ahl as-Sunnah, “All of them will be in the \n    Fire”, that they will abide forever in the fire of Hell, is mistaken and has \n    gone against the consensus of the Muslims. The fact that these sects have \n    gone astray and have been given a warning of Hellfire does not mean that \n    they will abide therein forever. \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam \n    Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    Whoever says that \n    the seventy-two sects have all committed kufr (disbelief) in a way that puts \n    them beyond the pale of Islam has gone against the Qur’an, Sunnah and the \n    consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them all), and also the \n    consensus of the four imams and others. There is no one among them who \n    regarded each one of the seventy-two sects as disbelievers.\n\n    End quote from \n    Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 7/218 \n\n    Describing those \n    who differ as disbelievers is the way of the followers of innovation and \n    misguidance; it is not the way of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah. \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam \n    Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The Khaarijis were \n    the first ones to regard the Muslims as disbelievers, saying that they \n    become disbelievers because of committing sins. They also regarded as \n    disbelievers those who disagreed with their innovation and regarded it as \n    permissible to kill them and take their wealth. This is how the innovators \n    are: they introduce an innovation and regard as disbelievers those who \n    differ with them, concerning it. Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah follow the \n    Qur’an and Sunnah, and obey Allah and His Messenger; they follow the truth \n    and show compassion to all people.\n\n    End quote from \n    Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 3/279 \n\n    And he said \n    concerning the seventy-two sects: They regard one another as disbelievers \n    because of some of the ideas they believe in.\n\n    End quote from \n    Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 7/218\n\n    For reports of the \n    hadeeth about division and some comments on it, please see the answer to \n    question no. 90112\n\n    For a description \n    of Ahl as-Sunnah and the saved sect, please see the answers to questions no.\n    10777 and\n    206\n\n    Sixthly: \n\n    By the mercy of \n    Allah, may He be exalted, to His slaves, He will not punish with Hell those \n    whom the call of Islam did not reach. For those who are alive at the \n    present, or who lived before, whom news of Islam did not reach, they will be \n    tested on the Day of Resurrection. We have discussed this matter in the \n    answers to questions no. 1244 and\n    130271.\n\n    And Allah knows \n    best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the question of why many people may not accept faith and why some may enter Hell is complex and rooted in various theological concepts. Here are a few key points to understand this issue:\n\n1. **Free Will**: Islam teaches that Allah has granted humans free will to choose between belief and disbelief. Each individual has the capacity to accept or reject faith. This choice is central to the Islamic understanding of accountability in the Hereafter.\n\n2. **Guidance from Allah**: According to Islamic belief, Allah provides guidance through the prophets, scriptures, and signs in creation. However, not all people respond positively to this guidance. The Qur'an emphasizes that guidance is ultimately in the hands of Allah, and He allows people to choose their paths.\n\n3. **Test of Faith**: Life is viewed as a test, where individuals are given the opportunity to prove their faith and righteousness. This entails facing challenges and making choices that reflect one’s beliefs. The presence of disbelievers is part of this test, where believers are encouraged to invite others to the faith.\n\n4. **Justice and Mercy**: Allah’s justice is an essential concept in Islam. Those who reject faith despite recognizing the truth, after having had the opportunity to accept it, will face consequences in the Hereafter. However, Allah's mercy is also vast, and there are beliefs concerning His compassion and the circumstances that lead people to disbelief.\n\n5. **Hell as a Consequence, Not a Desire**: It is important to note that Allah does not desire for anyone to enter Hell. The Qur'an indicates that Hell is a consequence of one's own choices and actions in life. Allah invites all to His mercy and forgiveness, and His wish is for all to accept faith and receive His guidance.\n\nIn summary, the prevalence of disbelief among people is a reflection of free will, the complexities of guidance and choice, the test of life, and the broader themes of justice and mercy in Islamic theology. Each individual is ultimately responsible for their beliefs and actions, and Allah provides ample opportunity for guidance and repentance."

        "question": "Praying behind someone who writes amulets",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    It is not \n    permissible to wear amulets, even if they contain words from the Holy \n    Qur’an, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever wears an amulet, may \n    Allaah never fulfil his wish and whoever wears a seashell, may Allaah never \n    protect him from what he fears.” Narrated by Ahmad (17440); classed as hasan \n    by Shu‘ayb al-Arna’oot in Tahqeeq al-Musnad. \n\n    And he \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever wears an amulet \n    has committed shirk (i.e., associated something with Allah).” \n\n    Narrated by \n    Ahmad and al-Haakim; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, \n    no. 6394. \n\n    If amulets \n    contain verses from the Qur’an, there is a scholarly difference of opinion \n    concerning that, but the most correct opinion is that they are not allowed, \n    because of the general meaning of the evidence, and so as to block the means \n    that may lead to shirk, and because that usually involves treating the \n    verses with disrespect, because people usually sleep wearing the amulet, or \n    enter the washroom with it, and so on. \n\n    It says in \n    Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (1/212): The scholars are unanimously \n    agreed that it is haraam to wear amulets if they contain anything other than \n    words from the Qur’an, but they differed if they do contain words from the \n    Qur’an. Some said that it is permissible to wear them and others said that \n    it is not permissible. The view that it is not permitted is more likely to \n    be correct, because of the general meaning of the hadeeths and so as to \n    block the means that may lead to shirk. End quote. \n\n    See: Question \n    no. 10543 and\n    20349 \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    If the amulets \n    that are written by this imam contain any elements of shirk, such as asking \n    of anyone other than Allah, may He be exalted, among the jinn or angels or \n    righteous people, or this imam is one of those who practice this kind of \n    shirk, or he claims to have knowledge of the unseen, it is not permissible \n    to pray behind him. But if it is free of shirk and he is one of the people \n    of Tawheed (i.e., he affirms the Oneness of Allah), then prayers offered \n    behind him are valid. It is essential to advise him in either case, because \n    amulets of all types are haraam, as stated above. \n\n    The Standing \n    Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked about praying behind someone who \n    writes amulets for people, and they replied: It is permissible to pray \n    behind one who writes amulets from the Qur’an and du‘aa’s prescribed in \n    Islam, but he should not write them because it is not permissible to wear \n    them. But if the amulets contain any elements of shirk, one should not pray \n    behind the one who writes that and it is essential to explain to him that \n    this is shirk. The one who should advise him is the one who knows that he \n    does that. \n\n    End quote from\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah, 3/65 \n\n    Shaykh Saalih \n    al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) was asked about praying behind someone \n    who writes amulets, and he replied:\n\n    With regard to \n    what you have mentioned about writing amulets, amulets are subject to \n    further discussion. If these amulets contain phrases of shirk, supplication \n    to anyone other than Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and unknown \n    names, it is not permissible to write them or use them, according to \n    scholarly consensus, because they are shirk. One should not pray behind this \n    man (who writes such amulets). But if these amulets contain words from the \n    Holy Qur’an, permissible du‘aa’s and du‘aa’s narrated in reports (from the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), then this is a matter \n    concerning which there was a difference of opinion among the scholars. Some \n    of them regarded it as permissible and others said that it is not allowed, \n    and not allowing it is more on the safe side, because opening the door to \n    writing them and wearing them is a means that may lead to haraam types of \n    amulets, and because writing the Holy Qur’an in the form of amulets exposes \n    it to disrespectful treatment and taking it into places where it is not \n    permissible to take it. But there is nothing wrong with praying behind the \n    one who writes them. \n\n    To sum up: if \n    writing amulets involves phrases of shirk, unknown names, calling upon \n    anyone other than Allah or seeking the help of the devils, created beings or \n    jinn, these are phrases of shirk, and the one who writes them or uses them, \n    knowing what they contain, is a mushrik. But if they are from the Holy \n    Qur’an, to be on the safe side it is better to avoid them and not use them.\n\n    End quote from\n    al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Fawzaan \n\n    Shaykh Ibn \n    Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to pray \n    behind an imam who is a fraud and a charlatan, knowing that some of them can \n    recite Qur’an very well? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good. \n\n    He replied:\n\n    If the imam is \n    a fraud and claims to have knowledge of the unseen or he follows myths and \n    does evil actions, it is not permissible to appoint him as an imam or to \n    pray behind him, because the one who claims to have knowledge of the unseen \n    is a kaafir – we ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. Allah, may He be \n    glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: None \n    in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allah” [an-Naml \n    27:65]. The same applies to one who practices witchcraft; he comes under \n    the same rulings as the kuffaar because Allah, may He be glorified and \n    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “They \n    followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the \n    lifetime of Sulaiman (Solomon). Sulaiman did not disbelieve, but the \n    Shayatin (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came \n    down at Babylon to the two angels, Haroot and Maroot, but neither of these \n    two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said: We are only for \n    trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).”\n\n    [al-Baqarah \n    2:102]. \n\n    But if he \n    commits some sins but does not do any acts of kufr such as witchcraft or \n    claiming to have knowledge of the unseen, then prayers offered behind him \n    are valid, although it is better to look for someone else who is of good \n    character and righteous, in order to protect the people’s religious \n    commitment and avoid going against those scholars who say that it is not \n    permissible to pray behind him. Sinners should not be taken as imams, but if \n    they are already imams, it is valid to pray behind them because the people \n    may be being tested with them, and it may be necessary to pray behind them. \n    But in the case of one who calls upon anything other than Allah, or who \n    seeks the help of the dead, one should not pray behind him, because by doing \n    these things he comes under the same heading as the kuffaar, as these are \n    the acts of the mushrikeen whom the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him) fought in Makkah and elsewhere. We ask Allah to set the affairs of \n    the Muslims straight, to bless them with understanding of their religion, \n    and to appoint over them the best of them, for He is All-Hearing, Ever Near.\n\n    End quote from\n    Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 9/278 \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the permissibility of praying behind someone who writes amulets (ta'wiz or ruqiyah) depends on the beliefs and practices of the individual. Writing amulets can be controversial among scholars.\n\n1. **Islamic Perspective**: Many scholars consider the act of writing amulets that contain verses from the Qur'an or authentic supplications to be acceptable, provided the intention is to seek protection through Allah's words, not as an act of shirk (associating partners with Allah). However, amulets that contain non-Islamic invocations or superstitions are generally deemed unacceptable.\n\n2. **Praying Behind Such Individuals**: If the person writing amulets is known to hold beliefs in line with Islamic teachings, is not engaging in shirk, and is recognized as a practicing Muslim, then it may be permissible to pray behind them. However, if their beliefs are questionable or they engage in practices considered not permissible in Islam, it would be better to avoid praying behind them.\n\n3. **Best Practice**: It is advisable to seek knowledge from qualified scholars and consider local or cultural practices. Additionally, the focus should always be on strengthening one’s own faith and reliance on Allah for protection and guidance.\n\nUltimately, the decision should be made with careful consideration, informed by knowledge, and with reliance on genuine Islamic teachings."

        "question": "What Are the Degrees of Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Yes, there are three degrees of Islam, which are: Islam, iman and ihsan. Each of them has a meaning and certain pillars or essential parts. \nThe first degree is Islam \nIslam, which in Arabic means submission. In Sharee’ah terminology, its meaning varies according to usage, and it may mean one of two things: \n(1) When the word is used on its own and is not accompanied by the word iman (faith, belief), it refers to the religion as a whole, including both major and minor issues of belief, words and deeds, as in the verses where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.” [Aal ‘Imran 3:19] \n“and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:3] \n“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him.” [Aal ‘Imran 3:85]\nHence some of the scholars defined it as meaning: Submitting to Allah by affirming that He is One (Tawhid) and submitting to Him by obeying Him and disavowing shirk and its people. \n(2) When it is used in conjunction with the word iman (faith, belief), in which case it refers to outward deeds and words , as in the verses where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The bedouins say: ‘We believe.’ Say: ‘You believe not but you only say, “We have surrendered (in Islam),”for Faith has not yet entered your hearts’…” [Al-Hujurat 49:14]\nIn Saheeh al-Bukhaari (27) and Saheeh Muslim (150) it is narrated from Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) distributed (Zakah) amongst (a group of) people while Sa’d was sitting there. Sa’d said: But the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left a man who I thought the best of them all, and did not give him anything. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, why did you leave out So and so? By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Or (merely) a Muslim.” I remained quiet for a while, but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, why did you leave out So and so? By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Or (merely) a Muslim.” I remained quiet for awhile, but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, why did you leave out So and so? By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Or (merely) a Muslim. I give to one person even though another is dearer to me, for fear that he might be thrown on his face in the Fire.” \nWith regard to the Prophet’s words “or (merely) a Muslim,” when Sa’d (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him, “By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer” mean: You do not know about his faith, all you can see is his Islam in the sense of his outward actions. \nThe second degree is iman (faith)\nIman (faith), which in Arabic means belief which is committed to submission. In Islamic terminology its meaning varies according to usage and it may mean one of two things: \n(1) When the word is used on its own and is not accompanied by the word Islam, it refers to the religion as a whole, as in the verses where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Allah is the Wali (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light.” [Al-Baqarah 2:257] \n“and put your trust in Allah if you are believers indeed.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:23]\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one will enter Paradise except the believers.” (Narrated by Muslim, 114)\nHence the Salaf were unanimously agreed that iman means “affirming in the heart – which includes actions of the heart – and saying with the tongue and acting with one’s physical faculties. It increases by doing acts of obedience and decreases by committing sin.” \nHence Allah limited the word iman to those who adhere to His religion in full, inwardly and outwardly, when He said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Verses (this Qur’an) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Lord (Alone);\nWho perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as- Salaah) and spend out of that We have provided them.\nIt is they who are the believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness and a generous provision (Paradise)” [Al-Anfal 8:2-4]\nAnd Allah referred to iman as including all of that when He said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“but Al-Birr is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to the kinsfolk, to the orphans, and to Al-Masaakeen (the poor), and to the wayfarer, and to those who ask, and to set slaves free, performs As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and gives the Zakât, and who fulfil their covenant when they make it, and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles). Such are the people of the truth and they are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious.” [Al-Baqarah 2:177]\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) referred to iman as including all of that in the hadith about the delegation of ‘Abd al-Qays which is narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhari (53) and Saheeh Muslim (17), where he said: “I enjoin you to believe in Allah alone. Do you know what belief (or faith) in Allah alone is?” They said: “Allah and His Messenger know best.” He said: “To bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish regular prayer, to pay zakaah, to fast Ramadaan, and to give one-fifth of the war-booty (the khums).” \nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described fasting the month of Ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward as being part of faith; he also said the same concerning spending the night of Laylat al-Qadar in prayer, fulfilling one's trusts, jihad, Hajj, attending funerals, etc. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (9) and Saheeh Muslim (35) it says: “Faith has seventy-odd branches, the highest of which is saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god except Allah) and the least of which is removing a harmful thing from the road.” It would take too long to mention all the verses and hadiths that speak of this topic. \n(2) When the word iman is used in conjunction with the word Islam. In this case it is understood as referring to inward beliefs as in the hadith of Jibril etc., and as in the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the funeral du’aa’: “O Allah, whomever among us you cause to live, cause him to live in Islam, and whomever among us you cause to die, cause him to die in faith.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1-24; he said it is hasan saheeh. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani, as stated in Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1/299. That is because physical actions can only be accomplished during life, but when one is dying all that is left is the words and actions of the heart.\nDifference between Islam and Iman\nThe point is that when either word, iman or Islam , is used alone, there is no difference between them, rather each of them when used alone refers to the entire religion. If there is any difference between them, then the word Islam refers to outward physical actions and the word iman refers to inward actions of the heart. This is what is indicated by the hadith of Jibreel which was narrated by Muslim in his Sahih (8) from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab who said: \nOne day when we were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there appeared before us a man whose clothes were exceedingly white and his hair was exceedingly black, and there were no signs of travel on him. No one among us recognized him. He came and sat down by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and rested his knees against his and placed the palms on his hands on his thighs. He said: “O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is to testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish regular prayer, to pay zakah, to fast Ramadan and to go on pilgrimage to the House if you are able to.” He said: “You have spoke the truth.” And we were amazed at his asking that and saying that he had spoken the truth. Then he said: “Tell me about iman (faith, belief),” He said: “It means believing in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, and believing in al-qadar (the divine will and decree), both good and bad.” He said: “You have spoken the truth.” He said: “Tell me about ihsan.” He said: “It means worshipping Allah as if you can see Him, and although you cannot see Him, He can see you.” He said: “Tell me about the Hour.” He said: “The one who is being asked does not know more about it than the one who is asking.” He said: “Then tell me about its signs.” He said: “The slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, and you will see the barefoot, naked, destitute herdsmen competing in constructing lofty buildings.” Then he departed and I stayed for a while. Then he said to me: “O ‘Umar, do you know who the questioner was?” I said: “Allah and His Messenger know best.” He said: “That was Jibreel, who came to teach you your religion.” \nThe third degree is ihsan\nIhsan means doing something well, perfectly and sincerely. In Islamic terminology its meanings vary according to usage and it may mean one of two things: \n(1) When it is used alone and is not mentioned in conjunction with Islam or iman, it refers to the religion as a whole, as stated above with regard to the words Islam and iman.\n(2) When it is used in conjunction with either or both of the words Islam and iman, the meaning is perfecting one’s outward and inward deeds. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained it in a manner that no other created being apart from him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) could have explained it, because of the gift of concise speech that Allah bestowed upon him. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It means worshipping Allah as if you can see Him, and although you cannot see Him, He can see you.” This is the highest degree of Islam. Those who attain this are the foremost in doing good, the ones who will be closest to Allah in the highest degrees of Paradise.\nCategories of ihsan\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that the degree of ihsan is of two categories, one of which is higher than the other. \nThe first position is the higher of the two: This means worshipping Allah as if you can see Him. This means that a person acts as if he can see Allah in his heart, so his heart is filled with light and the matters of the unseen become almost like that which is visible (i.e., it becomes very real to him). Whoever worships Allah with awareness of His nearness and turning to Him and acts as if he is before Allah and looking at Him is bound to fear Him and venerate Him. \nThe second position is that of sincerity and awareness that Allah is always watching. This means that a person acts with an awareness that Allah can see him and is close to him. If a person bears this in mind and acts accordingly, then he will be sincere towards Allah because this awareness will prevent him from paying attention to anyone other than Allah or doing anything for the sake of anyone else. If a person achieves this position, it will become easy for him to reach the position described above. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “and although you cannot see Him, He can see you.” If a person truly understands when worshipping Allah that He can see him and knows all his deeds, hidden and visible, inward and outward, and that nothing is hidden from Him, then it will be easy for him to move from the lower position to the higher, which is the constant awareness that Allah is close to His slave and is with him, because it is as if he can see Him. We ask Allah of His great bounty. \nFor more, see answers No. (219 ), (14055 ), and (208110 ).\nReference:\n\nMa’arij al-Qubul by Shaykh Hafizh al-Hakami, 2/20-33, 326-328;\nAl-Majmu’ al-Thamin by Ibn Uthaymeen, 1/49, 53.’ \nJami’ al-‘Ulum wa’l-Hikam by Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali, 1.106.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of degrees or levels can be understood through the classification of faith into three main categories, which are often referred to as the \"three degrees of Islam\". These levels are:\n\n1. **Islam (الْإِسْلَام)**: This is the outer level and refers to the physical practice of the Islamic faith. It includes the Five Pillars of Islam:\n   - **Shahada** (Testimony of Faith): Declaring the oneness of Allah and the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n   - **Salat** (Prayer): Performing the five daily prayers.\n   - **Zakat** (Charity): Giving a portion of one’s wealth to those in need.\n   - **Sawm** (Fasting): Observing fast during the month of Ramadan.\n   - **Hajj** (Pilgrimage): Undertaking the pilgrimage to Mecca, if financially and physically capable.\n\n2. **Iman (الإيمان)**: This refers to the inner belief and faith in the heart. It involves believing in the Six Articles of Faith:\n   - Belief in Allah (God)\n   - Belief in angels\n   - Belief in the Books of Allah\n   - Belief in the Prophets\n   - Belief in the Day of Judgment\n   - Belief in Divine Predestination (Qadr)\n\n3. **Ihsan (الإحسان)**: This is the highest degree and signifies excellence in worship and seeking closeness to Allah. It is defined in a famous hadith, where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that Ihsan is to \"worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you do not see Him, know that He sees you.\" This level emphasizes sincerity, awareness, and striving for the best in one’s actions and intentions.\n\nThese three degrees provide a framework for understanding the comprehensive nature of a Muslim's faith and practice, highlighting the importance of both outward actions and inner beliefs."

        "question": "Ruling on one who apostatises repeatedly",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The important principle that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, confirms in His revelation and states that it is the foundation of reckoning and the criterion of reward and punishment, is that repentance wipes out whatever came before it, and that Islam erases all that came before it; the gate of repentance is open to every individual, even if he falls into sin and kufr time after time. The grace and mercy of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, towards His slaves decrees that He should accept the repentance of the one who repents and forgive him his sins. \nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven” [al-Anfaal 8:38]. \nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not know that Islam destroys whatever came before it, and that hijrah destroys whatever came before it, and that Hajj destroys whatever came before it?” Narrated by Muslim, 121. \nThere are also verses which indicate that the repentance of the apostate, if he comes back to Islam and repents sincerely, is accepted. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“How shall Allaah guide a people who disbelieved after their Belief and after they bore witness that the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) is true and after clear proofs had come unto them? And Allaah guides not the people who are Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers).\nThey are those whose recompense is that on them (rests) the Curse of Allaah, of the angels, and of all mankind\nThey will abide therein (Hell). Neither will their torment be lightened, nor will it be delayed or postponed (for a while).”\nAnd yet after all that, Allah, may He be glorified, says:\n“Except for those who repent after that and do righteous deeds. Verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:86-88, 89]. \nBut if a person apostatises and then goes further in disbelief and wrongdoing, and he does not repent or come back to Islam, this is the one to whom the verse in Soorat al-Nisa’ –which the questioner mentioned – refers, and the verses from Aal ‘Imraan also indicate that his repentance will not be accepted. \nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily, those who disbelieved after their Belief and then went on increasing in their disbelief (i.e. disbelief in the Qur’aan and in Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) — never will their repentance be accepted (because they repent only by their tongues and not from their hearts). And they are those who are astray.\n91. Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them even if they offered it as a ransom. For them is a painful torment and they will have no helpers”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:90-91]. \nAnd He says:\n“Verily, those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe (again), and (again) disbelieve, and go on increasing in disbelief; Allaah will not forgive them, nor guide them on the (right) way”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:137]. \nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tafseer al-Qur’aan al-‘Azeem (1/753): \nHere Allah tells us about the one who enters Islam and then recants, then comes back to it, then recants and persists in his misguidance, and increases in it until he dies: there is no repentance after his death and Allah will not forgive him or grant him any way out from what he is in, and there is no way he could be guided. Hence He says: “Allaah will not forgive them, nor guide them on the (right) way.” Ibn Abi Haatim said: … It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said concerning the verse, “and go on increasing in disbelief”: They persist in their disbelief until they die. This was also the view of Mujaahid. End quote. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (16/28-29): \nConcerning these whose repentance will not be accepted, there were several opinions: \nIt was said that it is because of their hypocrisy, or because they repented from sins less grave than shirk but did not repent from shirk, or it was said that their repentance would never be accepted after death. But the majority, such as al-Hasan, Qataadah, ‘Ata’, al-Khorasaani and al-Suddi said: Their repentance will never be accepted when death comes to them. So this is like the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: ‘Now I repent;’ nor of those who die while they are disbelievers” [al-Nisa’ 4:18]. \nAnd the same applies to the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe (again), and (again) disbelieve, and go on increasing in disbelief; Allaah will not forgive them, nor guide them on the (right) way”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:137]. \nMujaahid and other mufassireen said: “and go on increasing in disbelief” means, they remain steadfast in that until they die. \nI [Ibn Taymiyah] say: That is because the one who repents is giving up kufr, whereas the one who does not repent is persisting in it and adding kufr to kufr. The words “and go on increasing in disbelief” are like saying, they persisted in kufr and continued in kufr and remained in kufr. So they became disbelievers after becoming Muslim, then their kufr increased and did not grow less. The repentance of these people will not be accepted, referring to their repentance when they are dying, because the one who repents before death comes has repented soon enough and recanted his kufr, so it did not increase; rather it decreased, unlike the one who persisted in kufr until the time of death. End quote. \nThere is no difference of opinion among the scholars that if the apostate repents sincerely and comes back to Islam, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will accept him and forgive him for what is past, even if he has apostatized repeatedly. \nThis is with regard to Allah in the Hereafter. \nAs for the rulings in this world, some of the scholars said that if a person apostatises repeatedly he should be executed and his repentance not accepted. The difference of opinion among the scholars about accepting repentance has to do with rulings in this world only and does not have to do with a person’s standing before Allah in the Hereafter, may He be glorified and exalted. \nIbn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (12/271): \nTo sum up, the difference of opinion among the imams concerning the acceptance of their repentance has to do with rulings in this world, not executing them, and affirming that they should be treated as Muslims. \nAs to whether Allah accepts their repentance and forgives the one who repents and gives up (apostasy) both inwardly and outwardly, there is no difference of opinion concerning that. End quote. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 30/16: \nWhen the fuqaha’ differed concerning the acceptance of the repentance of one who apostatises repeatedly and the acceptance of the repentance of the heretic, that only has to do with the ruling on outward appearances, because the repentance of such people cannot be trusted. But if he is sincere in his heart towards Allah in his repentance then he is included in the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53]. \nAccording to the correct scholarly opinion, the repentance of one who has apostatised repeatedly is to be accepted with regard to rulings in this world too, and he comes under the same rulings as any other Muslim. This is the view of the majority of Hanafi and Shaafa‘i scholars and is the well-known view among the Maalikis, and is the second of the two views of Ahmad ibn Hanbal. \nSee Haashiyat Tabyeen al-Haqaa’iq, 3/284; Fath al-Qadeer, 6/68; al-Insaaf, 10/332-335; Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj, 9/69; Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘, 6/177-178; al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 14/127-128. In al-Mabsoot (10/99-100) it is attributed to ‘Ali and Ibn ‘Umar that they did not accept the repentance of one who had apostatised repeatedly. \nBased on that, the repentance of one who had given up prayer is acceptable if he is sincere, even if he repeatedly gave up prayer, but he should beware, because death may come before he is able to repent and Allah may cause his punishment to come in this world before the Hereafter. \nWe ask Allah to bestow upon us and you His great mercy. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, apostasy (rebellion or renunciation of Islam) is a serious matter, and there are guidelines regarding those who commit it. If a person repeatedly apostatizes, the ruling can differ depending on the intention, circumstances, and the approach of the individual.\n\n1. **First Instance of Apostasy**: When a person apostatizes, it is generally encouraged for them to repent and return to Islam. Islam emphasizes the mercy of Allah, and sincere repentance (Tawbah) is always accepted.\n\n2. **Repeated Apostasy**: If an individual returns to Islam but then again apostatizes, scholars might look into the reasons behind the apostasy. The individual may be struggling with faith, or they might not fully understand the implications of their beliefs.\n\n3. **Consequences**: Traditional Islamic law has varying views on the consequences of apostasy, ranging from social ostracism to legal penalties, depending on the prevailing interpretations and the legal school of thought. In many modern contexts, this is approached with an emphasis on education and dialogue rather than punishment.\n\n4. **Mercy and Guidance**: It’s important to highlight the role of community support, understanding, and patience. Muslims are encouraged to provide guidance and help those who are struggling in their faith.\n\nOverall, the approach to repeated apostasy should be compassionate, focusing on helping the individual find their way back to faith rather than strictly enforcing penalties. It is always advisable to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars or local religious authorities in such matters."

        "question": "Ruling on the wife of one who reviles religion",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Reviling religion is apostasy from Islam. The same applies \n      to reviling the Qur’aan or the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be \n      upon him): it is apostasy from Islam, and kufr (disbelief) after faith - \n      we seek refuge with Allah. But it does not mean that the wife is divorced \n      (talaaq); rather they should be separated without divorce. It cannot be \n      divorce; rather she becomes haraam for him because she is a Muslim woman \n      whereas he is a kaafir, and she remains haraam for him until he repents. \n      If he repents and her ‘iddah has not yet ended, she goes back to him \n      without any need for anything, i.e., if he repents and turns back to \n      Allah, she goes back to him. But if her ‘iddah has ended and he has not \n      repented, then she may marry whomever she wants. That is like a divorce \n      but it is not a divorce (talaaq); rather it is like divorce because Allah \n      has forbidden Muslim women for kaafir men. \n\n    If he repents after the ‘iddah has ended and he wants to \n    (re)marry her, there is nothing wrong with that, but it should be done with \n    a new marriage contract, so as to be on the safe side and avoid an area \n    concerning which the scholars differed. Some scholars think that she is \n    permissible for him without a new marriage contract: if she chose him and \n    did not marry anyone else after the ‘iddah ended, she remains as she was \n    (i.e., still married). However, the majority say that when the ‘iddah ends, \n    she becomes irrevocably divorced from him and becomes a non-mahram to him, \n    and she cannot become permissible for him except with a new marriage \n    contract. So it is better and more on the safe side to do a new marriage \n    contract. This applies if the ‘iddah ended before he repented. But if he \n    repents before the ‘iddah ends, then she is still his wife, because the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) accepted the marriage \n    contracts of men who became Muslim after their wives did, before the wives’ \n    ‘iddahs ended.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the ruling concerning a woman whose husband reviles or disrespects Islam and its teachings can be nuanced and dependent on various factors. Here are a few considerations based on Islamic teachings:\n\n1. **Faith and Belief**: If a husband openly reviles Islam and shows disbelief, this can impact a wife's status in the marriage. It is commonly understood in Islamic law that a believer should not remain in a marriage with someone who openly rejects their faith.\n\n2. **Separation or Divorce**: In cases where the husband’s actions demonstrate outright disbelief (kufr), the wife may have grounds to seek separation or divorce. Scholars note that a husband who openly renounces Islam is considered to have severed the marital bond, and thus, the wife would typically not be obligated to remain in that marriage.\n\n3. **Advice and Dialogue**: Before taking any steps toward separation, it is advised for the wife to try to engage her husband in dialogue, providing evidence from Islamic sources about the seriousness of reviling religion. There should be consideration for attempting to guide the husband back to the faith if possible.\n\n4. **Counsel from Scholars**: It is always advisable for the affected spouse to seek counsel from knowledgeable scholars or authorities in their community who can provide personalized guidance based on their specific circumstances.\n\n5. **Personal Safety**: If the situation involves any form of abuse or threats, the wife’s safety is paramount, and she should take necessary actions to protect herself.\n\nOverall, the context, the husband’s intentions, and the wife's circumstances will play a crucial role in determining the appropriate steps to take."

        "question": "Can ahaad hadiths be accepted with regard to ‘aqeedah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Our response to the one who thinks that ‘aqeedah cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad hadiths because they are based on probability or speculation and ‘aqeedah cannot be based on speculations is: This opinion is not correct, because it is based on something that is not correct. That is for a number of reasons: \n1.The idea that ahaad hadiths are based on probability or speculation does not apply in all cases; there are some ahaad hadiths that are based on certainty if there is corroborated evidence to confirm them, such as if the ummah accepted them. An example is the hadith of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him), “Actions are but by intentions…” It is an ahaad hadith, but despite that we know that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it. This is what was confirmed by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, al-Haafiz ibn Hajar and others.\n2.The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to send individuals with basic teachings of ‘aqeedah - testimony that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah - and the fact that he sent them is binding proof. For example, he sent Mu‘aadh to Yemen, and the fact that he sent him is regarded as binding proof for the people of Yemen that they were obliged to accept him.\n3.If we say that matters of ‘aqeedah cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad reports, then it is possible to say that practical rulings cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad reports, because practical rulings are accompanied by the belief that Allah enjoined this and forbade that. If this opinion is accepted, then many of the rulings of sharee‘ah would be rendered invalid. If this idea is rejected then the idea that ‘aqeedah cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad reports should also be rejected, because there is no difference between the two, as we have explained.\nTo sum up: If an ahaad report is supported by corroborating evidence which indicates that this is true, then it becomes part of knowledge and rulings of practice and belief may be established. There is nothing to indicate that there should be any differentiation between the two. Any person who suggests that any of the imams differentiated between them has to prove that with a sound chain of narration from that imam, then he has to explain his evidence.\n4.Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined referring to the people of knowledge for the one who is unaware of what is one of the most important issues of ‘aqeedah, which is Prophethood. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We sent not (as Our Messengers) before you (O Muhammad) any but men, whom We sent Revelation, (to preach and invite mankind to believe in the Oneness of Allaah). So ask (you, O pagans of Makkah) of those who know the Scripture [learned men of the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], if you know not.\n44. With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers)” [al-Nahl 16:43, 44]\nThis includes asking one or many. End quote. \nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him)",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the status of Ahaad (singular) hadiths can vary based on the context and the subject matter they pertain to. When it comes to ‘aqeedah (belief or creed), the majority opinion among scholars is that Ahaad hadiths can generally be accepted, but there are important considerations.\n\n1. **General Rule on Ahaad Hadiths**: Ahaad hadiths are those that are reported by a single narrator (or a limited number) and are not of the same level of authenticity or mass transmission (Tawatur) as Mutawatir hadiths (those transmitted by a large number of narrators at every level). While Mutawatir hadiths have a high level of certainty and are unquestionable in matters of belief, Ahaad hadiths require additional scrutiny.\n\n2. **Acceptance in ‘Aqidah**: Many scholars agree that some Ahaad hadiths may be accepted as evidence for 'aqeedah, provided that they are authentic (sahih) and contain sound content. However, Ahaad hadiths that contradict established beliefs or other authentic sources may be rejected. The acceptance of such hadiths often depends on their consistency with the overall teachings of Islam and the consensus (ijma) of the scholars.\n\n3. **Careful Consideration**: Scholars emphasize the importance of careful examination of the Ahaad hadiths regarding their chain of transmission (isnad), text (matn), and whether they support or contradict established doctrines.\n\nIn summary, while Ahaad hadiths can be accepted regarding ‘aqeedah under certain conditions, they are not automatically given the same weight as Mutawatir hadiths, and due diligence is necessary to ensure their authenticity and consistency with core Islamic beliefs. It is always advisable to consult knowledgeable scholars for specific cases and more in-depth understanding."

        "question": "Atheism is a greater sin than shirk",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Atheism, in \n    modern terminology, means denying the Creator altogether, denying that He \n    exists and not acknowledging Him, may He be glorified and exalted. The \n    universe and everything in it, according to their claims, came about purely \n    by chance. This is a strange view which is contrary to sound human nature, \n    reason and logic, and is contrary to simple logic and indisputable facts.  \nAs for shirk \n    (polytheism or associating others with Allah), it implies belief in Allah, \n    may He be glorified and exalted, and affirmation of Him, but it also \n    includes belief in a partner to Allah in His creation, who creates or grants \n    provision or brings benefit or wards off harm. This is shirk al-ruboobiyyah \n    (ascribing partners to Allah in His Lordship). Or it means belief in a \n    partner to whom some kind of worship is devoted as an act of love and \n    veneration, as it is devoted to that person or thing as it should to devoted \n    to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. This is shirk al-‘ibaadah \n    (associating others with Allah in worship). By studying these two \n    deviations, we may see that each of them involves sin and evil which tells \n    us that they are bad and we see how Allah described them as being like dumb \n    animals. \nAllah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Have you \n    (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) seen him \n    who has taken as his ilaah (god) his own vain desire? Would you then be a \n    Wakeel (a disposer of his affairs or a watcher) over him?\n44. Or do \n    you think that most of them hear or understand? They are only like cattle\n    nay, \n    they are even farther astray from the Path (i.e. even worse than cattle)”\n\n    [al-Furqaan 25:43-44] \n“And \n    surely, We have created many of the jinn and mankind for Hell. They have \n    hearts wherewith they understand not, and they have eyes wherewith they see \n    not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not (the truth). They are like \n    cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones”\n\n    [al-A’raaf 7:179].\n\n    Nevertheless, the atheist who denies the existence of Allah and rejects His \n    Messengers and disbelieves in the Last Day, is in a greater state of kufr \n    and his beliefs are more reprehensible than the one who believes in Allah \n    and the Hereafter, but he associates something of His creation with Him. The \n    former is stubborn and arrogant to an extent that can not be imagined or \n    accepted by sound human nature. Such a person would transgress every sacred \n    limit and fall into every sin; his worldview would be distorted to an \n    inconceivable level. Yet many scholars who discussed the issue of atheism \n    doubted that this has deep roots in the hearts of the atheists, and they \n    affirmed that the atheist is only professing atheism outwardly; deep down he \n    believes in one God. \nShaykh \n    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said a great deal which indicates that this group of \n    atheists who deny and reject the existence of God are in a worse state of \n    kufr than the mushrikeen who associate partners with Him. We will quote a \n    little of what we have come across: \nHe (may \n    Allah have mercy on him) said: Kufr (disbelief) means not believing in Allah \n    and His Messengers, whether it involves rejecting or it consists of doubt \n    and uncertainty about the issue or ignoring the issue altogether, out of \n    envy or arrogance or following whims and desires that divert a person from \n    following the Message. However, the kaafir who rejects and disbelieves is in \n    a state of greater kufr, although the one who rejects and denies out of \n    envy, even though he believes that the Messengers brought the message of \n    truth, is also in a state of kufr. End quote. \nMajmoo’ \n    al-Fataawa, 17/291 \nHe also \n    said: \nThe one who \n    denies the Hereafter but believes that this universe is created is described \n    by Allah as a kaafir. The one who denies it and says that this universe \n    existed from eternity is a worse kaafir in the sight of Allah, may He be \n    exalted. End quote. \nMajmoo’ \n    al-Fataawa, 17/291 \nHe said (may \n    Allah have mercy on him) refuting those who deny the Divine attributes: \n(Denying the \n    Divine attributes) implies complete denial which reaches the point that \n    says: There is nothing that must exist and cannot have not existed. If he \n    believes that and says: I do not affirm either existence or non-existence, \n    then the answer to that is: Suppose you state that verbally and in your \n    heart you do not believe either of the two; rather you turn away from \n    knowing Allah and worshipping and remembering Him, so you never remember \n    Him, worship Him, call upon Him, put your hope in Him or fear Him; (in that \n    case) your denial of Him is worse than that of Iblees who (at least) \n    acknowledged Him. End quote. \nMajmoo’ \n    al-Fataawa, 5/356. \nAnd he (may \n    Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe arrogant \n    one is the one who does not acknowledge Allah outwardly, like Pharaoh. He is \n    in a worse state of kufr than them (meaning the mushrik Arabs). Iblees, who \n    enjoins all of that and loves it and is too arrogant to worship his Lord and \n    obey him, is in a worse state of kufr than them (the mushrikeen), even \n    though he was aware of the existence and might of Allah, just as Pharaoh was \n    also aware of the existence of Allah. End quote. \nMajmoo’ \n    al-Fataawa, 7/633 \nHe also \n    said:  \nThe view of \n    the philosophers -- those who say that the universe is eternal and that it \n    is dependent on that which inevitably must exist -- came from the minds and \n    hearts of those who worshipped heavenly bodies and made images of them on \n    Earth, such as Aristotle and his followers. This view is worse kufr and is \n    more misguided than that of the Arab mushrikeen who believed that Allah \n    created the heavens and the earth and everything between them in six days by \n    His will and power, but they attribute falsely without knowledge sons and \n    daughters to Him (cf. al-An’am 6:100) and joined others in worship with \n    Allaah, for which He had sent no authority (cf. Aal ‘Imraan 3:151). \n    Similarly, the permissive people, who do not believe in any command or \n    prohibition at all and refer to the Divine will and decree as an excuse for \n    their evil deeds, are worse off than the Jews, Christians and Arab \n    mushrikeen, because even though the latter are kaafirs, they still believe \n    in some kind of command and prohibition, and the promise and warning (i.e., \n    the Hereafter), but they had partners with Allaah (false gods) who \n    instituted for them a religion which Allaah had not ordained (cf. al-Shoora \n    42:21), unlike the permissive people who ignore all laws altogether. They \n    are only pleased with whatever suits their whims and desires, and they get \n    angry on the basis of their whims and desires; they do not get pleased for \n    the sake of Allah, or angry for the sake of Allah, or love for the sake of \n    Allah, or hate for the sake of Allah; they do not enjoin that which Allah \n    has enjoined and they do not forbid that which Allah has forbidden, unless \n    that suits their whims and desires, in which case they do it for that \n    purpose and not as an act of obedience to their Lord. Hence they do not \n    denounce what takes place of kufr, evil doing and sin unless it goes against \n    their whims and desires, in which case they will denounce it, prompted by \n    their devilish nature and not prompted by sharee’ah and love of Allah. Hence \n    the devils plunge them deeper into error, and they never stop short (cf. \n    al-A’raaf 7:202), and the devils may show themselves to them and address \n    them and help them with some of their whims and desires, as the devils used \n    to do with the mushrikeen who worshipped idols. End quote. \nMajmoo’ \n    al-Fataawa, 8/457-458. \nShaykh Ibn \n    Baaz (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It is shirk to worship something \n    other than Allah completely; that may be called shirk or kufr. Whoever turns \n    away from Allah altogether and directs his worship to something other than \n    Allah, such as trees, rocks, idols, the jinn or some of the dead, those whom \n    they call awliya’ (“saints”), worshipping them or praying to them or fasting \n    for them, and forgetting Allah altogether -- and this is the worst kind of \n    kufr and shirk. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. \nThe same \n    applies to denying the existence of Allah and saying that there is no God \n    and life is material, like the Communists and atheists who deny the \n    existence of Allah. These are the worst disbelievers among mankind, the most \n    astray, the most involved in shirk and the most misguided. We ask Allah to \n    keep us safe and sound. End quote. \nMajmoo’ \n    Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 4/32-33 \nHe also said \n    (may Allah have mercy on him): \nMeat \n    slaughtered by Communists is haraam and is like the meat of the Magians and \n    idol worshippers; in fact their meat is even more haraam, because their \n    degree of kufr is greater due to their atheism and denial of the Creator \n    (may He be glorified and exalted) and His Messenger, and other kinds of \n    kufr. End quote. \nMajmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 23/30 \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, both atheism and shirk (associating partners with Allah) are considered serious offenses, but they have different implications and contexts. \n\nShirk is commonly regarded as one of the gravest sins in Islam, as it directly contradicts the fundamental concept of monotheism (Tawheed). It involves attributing divine qualities to others besides Allah or worshipping others alongside Him. The Qur'an states that Allah does not forgive shirk unless one repents before death (Qur'an 4:48).\n\nAtheism, on the other hand, denies the existence of God altogether. While it is also viewed as a serious deviation from Islamic belief, interpretations about its severity compared to shirk can vary among scholars. Some may see shirk as more severe due to its direct implications on the worship of Allah and the covenant between Allah and His creation. Others might argue that both are severe departures from true faith.\n\nUltimately, Islamic scholarship emphasizes the need for sincere belief in Allah and warns against both shirk and atheism. Repentance and seeking guidance are encouraged for individuals who find themselves in either circumstance. As with many theological discussions, interpretations and opinions can differ, and it may be beneficial to consult with knowledgeable scholars for a deeper understanding."

        "question": "Is it obligatory to obey a ruler who does not rule according to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him)?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The ruler who does not rule according to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger should be obeyed in matters that do not involve disobedience towards Allaah and His Messenger, and it is not obligatory to fight him because of that; rather it is not permissible to do so unless he reaches the level of kufr, in which case it becomes obligatory to oppose him and he has no right to be obeyed by the Muslims. \nRuling according to anything other than that which is in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger reaches the level of kufr when two conditions are met:\n1.When he knows the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger; if he is unaware of it, then he does not commit kufr by going against it.\n2.When what makes him rule by something other than that which Allaah has revealed is the belief that it is a ruling that is not suitable for our time and that something else is more suitable than it and more beneficial for people.\nIf these two conditions are met, then ruling by something other than that which Allaah has revealed constitutes kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the Kaafiroon (i.e. disbelievers)” [al-Maa’idah 5:44]. The authority of the ruler becomes invalid and he has no right to be obeyed by the people; it becomes obligatory to fight him and remove him from power. \nBut if he rules by something other than that which Allaah has revealed whilst believing that ruling by that – i.e. that which Allaah has revealed -- is what is obligatory, and that it is more suitable for the people, but he goes against it because of some whims and desires on his part or because he wants to wrong the people under his rule, then he is not a kaafir; rather he is a faasiq (evildoer) or a zaalim (wrongdoer). His authority remains, and obeying him in matters that do not involve disobedience to Allaah and His Messenger is obligatory, and it is not permissible to fight him or remove him from power by force or to rebel against him, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) forbade rebelling against rulers unless we see blatant kufr for which we have proof from Allaah. End quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, the question of obedience to a ruler who does not govern according to the Book of Allah (the Qur'an) and the Sunnah (the practices and teachings) of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is a complex issue and can vary among scholars. \n\nGenerally, obedience to a ruler is considered obligatory as long as the ruler does not command something that is clearly in violation of Islamic law. This is based on various hadith where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) encouraged Muslims to obey those in authority over them, even if they have imperfect practices, as long as their commands do not contradict the principles of Islam.\n\nHowever, if a ruler openly goes against the commands of Allah and the Sunnah — for instance, by enjoining the unlawful or forbidding the lawful — scholars often argue that in such cases, Muslims are not obliged to obey such commands. This principle is underscored in the saying of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): \"There is no obedience to a creation in disobedience to the Creator.\"\n\nThat being said, the specifics of rebellion or resistance against a ruler are contentious and deeply nuanced, and scholars emphasize the importance of maintaining unity and avoiding fitnah (civil strife). Many scholars counsel patience, emphasizing the need to work towards reform through peaceful means whenever possible, and to address grievances through established channels.\n\nUltimately, one should seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars within their community to understand how these principles apply to specific contexts and situations."

        "question": "What Is Kufr and What Are Its Various Kinds?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The reality of kufr and its various kinds is a lengthy topic, but we may sum it up in the following points: \nThe importance of knowing what kufr is and the forms it may take\nThe texts of the Quran and Sunnah indicate that faith is not valid and is not accepted unless two conditions are met – which are what are implied by the testimony that there is no god except Allah. These two conditions are submission to Allah Alone (Tawhid ), and denouncing and shunning all kinds of kufr and shirk. \nA person cannot denounce or shun anything unless he knows what it is. From this we understand the importance of knowing what Tawhid is, so that we may act accordingly and attain Tawhid, and knowing what kufr and shirk are so that we may avoid them and steer clear of them. \n What is kufr? \nKufr in Arabic means covering and concealing something. \nIn Shar`i terminology, kufr means “not believing in Allah and His Messenger, whether that is accompanied by denial or it is not accompanied by denial but rather doubt, or turning away from faith out of jealousy or arrogance, or because one is following whims and desires that prevent one from following the message. \nSo, kufr is the attribute of everyone who rejects something that Allah has commanded us to believe in, after news of that has reached him, whether he rejects it in his heart without uttering it, or he speaks those words of rejection without believing it in his heart, or he does both; or he does an action which is described in the texts as putting one beyond the pale of faith.” (See Majmu’ al-Fatawa by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, 12/335; al-Ihkam fi Usul al-Ahkam by Ibn Hazam, 1/45) \nIbn Hazam said in his book al-Fisal: \n“Rejecting something for which there is sound proof that there can be no faith without believing in it is kufr, and uttering words for which there is proof that uttering them is kufr is kufr. Doing any action for which there is proof that it is kufr is also kufr.” \nKinds of major kufr which put one beyond the pale of Islam \nThe scholars divided kufr into a number of categories , under which they listed many forms and kinds of shirk. These are as follows: \n\nThe kufr of denial and rejection. This kufr may sometimes take the form of disbelief in the heart – which occurs rarely among the kuffar, as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said – and sometimes it takes the form of outward or apparent rejection, which means concealing the truth and not submitting to it outwardly, whilst recognizing it and knowing it inwardly, such as the Jews’ rejection of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says of them (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“then when there came to them that which they had recognised, they disbelieved in it” [al-Baqarah 2:89] \nHe also said (interpretation of the meaning]: \n“But verily, a party of them conceal the truth while they know it” [al-Baqarah 2:146] \nThat is because rejection only happens when a person knows the truth and refuses it. Hence Allah stated that the kuffar’s disbelief in the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not disbelief in the true sense of the word, because their disbelief was only outward and verbal, and inwardly they recognized the truth. \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“it is not you that they deny, but it is the Verses (the Quran) of Allah that the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) deny.” [al-An’am 6:33] \n“And they belied them (those Ayat) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof.” [al-Naml 27:14] \nSimilar to this is the kufr of permitting that which is forbidden. Whoever regards as permissible something which he knows that Islam has forbidden has disbelieved in the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and in that which he brought. The same applies to one who forbids something which he knows that Islam has permitted. \n\nThe kufr of turning away in arrogance, such as the kufr of Iblis of whom Allah said: \n\n“… except Iblis (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah)” [al-Baqarah 2:34 – interpretation of the meaning] \nAnd Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“They (hypocrites) say: ‘We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger (Muhammad), and we obey,’ then a party of them turn away thereafter, such are not believers” [al-Nur 24:47] \nSo Allah has stated that those who do not act in accordance with faith are not believers, even if they utter the words of faith. The kufr of turning away means that one ignores the truth and does not learn it or act in accordance with it, whether it is the matter of words, actions or beliefs. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“But those who disbelieve, turn away from that whereof they are warned” [al-Ahqaf 46:3] \nWhoever turns away verbally from that which the Messenger has brought is like one who says “I will not follow him.” The one who turns away by his actions is like one who runs away from hearing the truth which he brought, or puts his fingers in his ears so as not to hear, or who hears it but turns away in his heart and refuses to believe, and who refuses to act upon it. He has disbelieved in the sense of the kufr of turning away. \n\nThe kufr of hypocrisy. This takes the form of not believing in the heart and not acting, whilst submitting outwardly in order to show off to people. This is like the kufr of Ibn Salul and the other munafiqin (hypocrites) of whom Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“And of mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: ‘We believe in Allah and the Last Day,’ while in fact they believe not. They (think to) deceive Allah and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not! In their hearts is a disease (of doubt and hypocrisy) and Allah has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies. And when it is said to them: ‘Make not mischief on the earth,’ they say: ‘We are only peacemakers.’ Verily, they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive not. And when it is said to them (hypocrites): ‘Believe as the people (followers of Muhammad, Al-Ansar and Al-Muhajirun) have believed,’ they say: ‘Shall we believe as the fools have believed?’ Verily, they are the fools, but they know not. And when they meet those who believe, they say: ‘We believe,’ but when they are alone with their Shayatin (devils — polytheists, hypocrites), they say: ‘Truly, we are with you; verily, we were but mocking.’ Allah mocks them and gives them increase in their wrong-doing to wander blindly. These are they who have purchased error for guidance, so their commerce was profitless. And they were not guided. Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire; then, when it lighted all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness. (So) they could not see. They are deaf, dumb, and blind, so they return not (to the Right Path). Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder, and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap for fear of death. But Allah ever encompasses the disbelievers (i.e. Allah will gather them all together).\nThe lightning almost snatches away their sight, whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Certainly, Allah has power over all things” [al-Baqarah 2:8-20]  \n\nThe kufr of doubt , which means hesitating with regard to following the truth and being uncertain as to whether it is true, because what is required is certainty of faith (yaqin) that what the Messenger brought is truth with no hint of doubt in it. Whoever thinks that what he brought may not be true has disbelieved, in the sense of kufr of doubt, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“And he went into his garden while in a state (of pride and disbelief), unjust to himself. He said: ‘I think not that this will ever perish.  And I think not the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back to my Lord, (on the Day of Resurrection), surely, I shall find better than this when I return to Him.’ His companion said to him during the talk with him: ‘Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you out of dust (i.e. your father Adam), then out of Nutfah (mixed semen drops of male and female discharge), then fashioned you into a man? But as for my part, (I believe) that He is Allah, my Lord, and none shall I associate as partner with my Lord.’” [al-Kahf 18:35-38]  \nFrom this we may conclude that kufr – which is the opposite of iman or faith – may take the form of feelings in the heart, such as hating Allah or His signs, or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); this contradicts love and faith which support the actions of the heart. Kufr may also take the form of spoken words, such as insulting Allah, or it may be an outward action, such as prostrating to idols, or offering sacrifices to someone other than Allah. Just as faith takes the form of actions of the heart, words on the tongue and outward physical actions, so too kufr may take the form of actions of the heart, words on the tongue and outward physical actions. We ask Allah to keep us safe from kufr and its branches, and to increase us in faith and make us guided and cause us to guide others… Ameen. \n(See A’lam al-Sunnah al-Manshurah, 177; Nawaqid al-Iman al-Qawliyyah wa’l-‘Amaliyyah by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz Al ‘Abd al-Latif, 36-46; Dawabit al-Takfir by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah al-Qarani, 183, 196)\nFor more, please see this category: Basic Tenets of Faith.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Kufr in Islam refers to disbelief or denial of the core tenets of faith that are essential to being a Muslim. It comes from the Arabic root \"kafara,\" which means to cover or conceal. A person who commits kufr is referred to as a kafir (plural: kuffar), meaning one who covers or conceals the truth of faith.\n\nKufr can manifest in various forms, and scholars of Islam categorize it into different kinds. Here are some of the primary types of kufr:\n\n1. **Kufr al-Takdhib (Disbelieving in the Messenger)**: This type involves outright rejection or denial of the prophethood of the Prophet Muhammad or any of the other prophets, as well as denial of the revelations sent to them.\n\n2. **Kufr al-Istihlal (Believing that Something Haram is Halal)**: This occurs when a person believes that something which Allah has declared unlawful (haram) is, in fact, lawful (halal). For example, if someone declares that alcohol or adultery is permissible despite clear injunctions against them in Islamic teachings.\n\n3. **Kufr al-Nifaq (Hypocrisy)**: This form of kufr describes the behavior of those who outwardly profess faith in Islam while secretly harboring disbelief. It is considered a grave sin, as hypocrites mislead others regarding their true beliefs.\n\n4. **Kufr al-Juhud (Denial of Clear Truths)**: This type refers to a deliberate denial of aspects of faith that are known to be true, such as belief in the existence of Allah, the Day of Judgment, or other fundamental beliefs in Islam.\n\n5. **Kufr al-Rida (Apostasy by Acceptance)**: This can occur when a person is aware of the truth of Islam but chooses to reject it and express contentment by rejecting its core beliefs, possibly out of convenience or social pressure.\n\n6. **Kufr al-Shirk (Associating Partners with Allah)**: This is the most serious form of disbelief, characterized by the act of associating partners with Allah (Shirk). It undermines the fundamental concept of Tawhid (the Oneness of God) in Islam.\n\nIn discussions regarding kufr, it's essential to note that according to Islamic teachings, the severity and repercussions of kufr can vary, and interpretations may differ among scholars. Understanding these distinctions is vital for fostering respectful dialogues regarding faith and belief systems."

        "question": "Did Prophet Muhammad See Allah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Most of the Companions were of the view that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not see Allah with his eyes on the night of the Mi`raj. \nIt was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Whoever told you that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw his Lord was lying. He said that no vision can grasp him [Al-An`am 6:103]…” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Tawhid, 6832)\nIt was narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), `Did you see your Lord?’ He said, ‘He is veiled by Light, how could I see Him.’” (Narrated by Muslim, Al-Iman, 261) \nIt was narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “ ‘The (Prophet’s) heart belied not what he saw, and indeed he saw Him at a second descent.’ [An-Najm 53:11-12] (This means that) he saw Him twice with his heart.” (Narrated by Muslim, Al-Iman, 258).   \nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“ `Uthman ibn Sa`id Al-Darimi said in his book Al-Ru’yah that there was consensus among the Companions that he [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] did not see his Lord on the night of the Miذraj. Some of them excluded Ibn `Abbas and said that he was not one of those who said that. Our Shaykh says that this does not go against the facts, for Ibn `Abbas did not say that he saw Him with the eyes in his head, and Ahmad relied upon this in one of the two reports narrated from him, where he says that he saw Him but he did not say that that was with the eyes in his head. The wording used by Ahmad is the same as that used by Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both). What indicates that what our Shaykh said about the meaning of the hadeeth of Abu Dharr is correct is the fact that in another hadeeth he said that His veil is Light.  And Allah knows best what the Light is that is mentioned in the hadeeth of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) where it says, `I saw Light.’” (Ijtima` Al-Juyush Al-Islamiyyah, vol. 1, p. 12)\nShaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Chapter: with regard to seeing Allah, what was proven in an authentic report from Ibn `Abbas is that he said: `Muhammad saw his Lord with his heart twice, and `Aishah denied that he had seen Him. Some people reconciled these two reports by saying that `Aishah denied that he saw Him with his eyes and Ibn `Abbas affirmed that he saw Him with his heart. Some versions of the report narrated from Ibn `Abbas refers to seeing without specifying how, and others indicate that it was with the heart. Sometimes he says that Muhammad saw his Lord, and sometimes he says that Muhammad saw Him. There is no clear statement from Ibn `Abbas which says that he saw Him with his eyes. Similarly Imam Ahmad sometimes says that he saw Him and sometimes says that he saw Him with his heart. No one whom Ahmad heard said that he saw Him with his eyes. But some of his companions heard some of the words that did not specify how, and understood from that that he had seen Him with his eyes, just as some people heard the words of Ibn `Abbas that did not specify how, and understood from that that he had seen Him with his eyes. But there is nothing in the evidence to prove that he saw Him with his eyes, and that was not narrated from any of the Companions. There is nothing in the Quran or Sunnah to indicate that, rather the authentic texts which indicate that he did not see Him are more definitive. In Sahih Muslim it is narrated that Abu Dharr said: `I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Did you see your Lord?” He said, “He is veiled with Light, how could I see Him?”’ And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n`Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allah) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him]\nWho took His slave (Muhammad) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in order that We might show him (Muhammad) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.)’ [Al-Isra’ 17:1]\nIf he had seen Him with his own eyes, He would have mentioned that. The same applies to the words “Will you then dispute with him (Muhammad) about what he saw [during the Mi’raj]?” [An-Najm 53:12 – interpretation of the meaning]. If he had seen Him with his own eyes, that would have been mentioned. \nIt is proven from the authentic texts and from the consensus of the Salaf (first generations) of this Ummah that no one can see Allah with his eyes in this world , with the exception of the claim made by some that our Prophet Muhammad alone saw Him. But they agreed that the believers will see Allah on the Day of Resurrection with their own eyes just as they see the sun and the moon (in this world).” \nFor more details, please refer to the following answers: 156077 , 12478 , 14525 , 2734 , and 14096 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, it is understood that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) did not see Allah during his lifetime. The Quran states in Surah Al-An'am (6:103), \"No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision.\" This indicates that Allah cannot be seen by human eyes.\n\nHowever, during the night of Isra and Mi'raj (the Night Journey and Ascension), some scholars interpret that the Prophet had a unique experience in which he drew near to Allah in a special way. The details of this event are often debated among scholars, with many concluding that while he experienced a profound spiritual presence, he did not physically see Allah.\n\nMainstream Islamic belief maintains that seeing Allah will be a blessing afforded to the believers in Paradise. This belief is supported by various Hadith and Quranic verses indicating that the faithful will see Allah on the Day of Judgment or in Paradise, but this is distinct from the experiences of the Prophet in his earthly life."

        "question": "Ruling on sitting with one who does not pray and who denies that hijab is obligatory and mocks it, and mocks ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    These actions of the person you are asking about sitting with \n    constitute kufr and apostasy, and we are amazed that he claims to be a \n    Muslim when this is the case. Not praying is major kufr, as is proven in the \n    Qur’aan and Sunnah and by the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be \n    pleased with them). \n\n    With regard to women’s hijab, if what is meant is covering \n    the face (niqaab), there is a difference of opinion among the scholars \n    concerning it. The more correct view is that it is obligatory for all women \n    and that it does not apply only to the wives of the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him).  \n\n    Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve \n    him) said:   \n\n    With regard to niqaab, covering the face is obligatory, \n    according to the correct scholarly opinion, and this is what is supported by \n    the saheeh evidence, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their \n    bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)”\n\n    [al-Noor 24:31]. \n\n    And Allaah said concerning the wives of the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask \n    them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their \n    hearts”\n\n    [al-Ahzaab 33:53]. \n\n    The fact that it is speaking of the wives of the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) does not mean that the ruling \n    should not apply to other Muslim women, because the reason for that is \n    general, namely “that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts.” \n\n    So the reason is general and applies both to the wives of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and to other women. \n    Purity is required of all, because Allaah says in another verse \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the \n    women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies \n    (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the \n    way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable \n    women) so as not to be annoyed”\n\n    [al-Ahzaab 33:59]. \n\n    End quote from Fataawa al-Shaykh al-Fawzaan (4/242, \n    243; question no. 250). \n\n    For more information please see the answer to question no. \n    11774. \n\n    But if what is meant by hijab is covering the head, then \n    there is no difference of opinion among the scholars concerning the fact \n    that it is obligatory. His rejection of both types, and his making fun of \n    them, is apostasy from Islam, because even though covering the face is not \n    obligatory according to some scholars, they are unanimously agreed that it \n    is prescribed in Islam and that it is part of the religion of Allaah, so \n    denying it and making fun of it is kufr which puts one beyond the pale of \n    Islam. \n\n    There is no excuse at all for this heretic to make fun of the \n    Mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), rather \n    it is indicative of what is in his heart of hypocrisy and heresy, which \n    shows itself in this slip of the tongue. ‘Aa’ishah is the Mother of the \n    Believers and the wife of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him), whose innocence was declared by Allaah in verses that will be \n    recited until the Day of Resurrection. The one who makes fun of her is in \n    fact making fun of her husband, who is the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him), and the one who denies that she is the Mother of the \n    believers is putting himself outside of their circle, but he does not harm \n    her at all. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    If this is the case with this relative, then he should be \n    told that he is doing something which implies that he is an apostate, and \n    that he must repent and come back to his religion. If he meets his Lord in \n    this state, he will not be meeting Him as a Muslim. \n\n    What you must do – after advising him – is shun his company \n    and beware of him, unless the one who wants to sit with him has a sufficient \n    level of knowledge to repel his kufr. His companions should beware of his \n    evil, and upholding ties of kinship with him is not obligatory, rather it is \n    not permissible to initiate the greeting of salaam with him. \n\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And when they hear Al‑Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain \n    talk), they withdraw from it and say: ‘To us our deeds, and to you your \n    deeds. Peace be to you. We seek not (the way of) the ignorant’”\n\n    [al-Qasas 28:55].\n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on \n    him) said: \n\n    “And when they hear Al‑Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain \n    talk)” from an ignorant person who addresses it to them, “they say” \n    – the words of the slaves of the Most Merciful who have understanding – “To \n    us our deeds, and to you your deeds” i.e., each will be requited for his \n    deeds that he did by himself, and he will not bear anything of the burden of \n    another. This implies that they are innocent of what the ignorant do of \n    laghw (vain talk), falsehood and idle talk. \n\n    “Peace be to you” i.e., you will not hear anything \n    from us but good, and we will not address you as your ignorance deserves. \n    Even if you allow yourselves to indulge in this rotten talk, we declare \n    ourselves to be above it and we protect ourselves from indulging in it. “We \n    seek not (the way of) the ignorant’” in any sense. \n\n    Tafseer al-Sa’di (p. 620). \n\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: \n\n    Is it permissible for me to sit with one who does not pray? \n\n    They replied: \n\n    The one who does not pray deliberately and denies that it is \n    obligatory is a kaafir, according to scholarly consensus. If he does not \n    pray because he is heedless and lazy, then he is a kaafir, according to the \n    correct scholarly opinion. Based on that, it is not permissible to sit with \n    these people, rather they should be shunned and cut off, after explaining to \n    them that not praying is kufr, if they are the type of people who may be \n    unaware of the ruling. It is narrated in a saheeh report from the Messenger \n    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that he said: \n    “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever does not \n    pray is a kaafir.” And it is narrated in another saheeh report that he  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Between a man and kufr \n    and shirk there stands his giving up prayer.” Narrated by Muslim in his \n    Saheeh. This includes both the one who denies that it is obligatory and \n    the one who does not do it out of laziness. \n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq \n    ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan. \n\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah \n    (12/374, 375) \n\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: \n\n    Is it permissible to say salaam to one who does not pray? \n\n    They replied: \n\n    The one who does not pray because he denies it is obligatory \n    is a kaafir according to scholarly consensus, and the one who does not pray \n    out of laziness, but does not deny that it is obligatory is a kaafir, \n    according to the correct scholarly view. So it is not permissible to say \n    salaams to him, or to return his salaam if he greets you with salaam, \n    because he is regarded as an apostate from Islam.  \n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq \n    ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood. \n\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah \n    (24/141, 142) \n\n    The scholars of the Standing Committee said: \n\n    The one who makes fun of the religion of Islam or the Sunnah \n    that is proven from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him), such as letting the beard grow, shortening the clothes \n    to above the ankles or halfway up the calves, when he knows that this is \n    proven, is a kaafir. The one who mocks the Muslim and makes fun of him \n    because of his adhering to Islam, is a kaafir, because Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “Say: ‘Was it at Allaah ( عز \n    و جل ), and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, \n    revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (صلى الله \n    عليه وسلم) that you were mocking?’\n\n    66. Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had \n    believed”\n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:65-66]\n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq \n    ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood. \n\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah \n    (2/43-44). \n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said: \n\n    What you must do is shun the one who does not pray, and cut \n    off ties with him, and do not accept his invitation, until he repents to \n    Allaah from that; but you should also advise him and call him to the truth, \n    and warn him of the consequences of not praying in this world and in the \n    Hereafter, in the hope that he may repent and Allaah may accept his \n    repentance. \n\n    Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz \n    (10/266) \n\n    Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve \n    him) was asked: \n\n    Is it permissible for me to sit and eat and drink with \n    someone who does not pray and persists in not praying? \n\n    He replied: \n\n    It is not permissible for you to sit with him and eat and \n    drink with him, unless you are advising him and rebuking him, and you hope \n    that Allaah may guide him at your hands. If you are sitting with him, then \n    this is what you must do with him, because this comes under the heading of \n    denouncing evil and calling people to Allaah, and perhaps Allaah may guide \n    him at your hands. \n\n    But if you are sitting with him and eating and drinking with \n    him without denouncing him, and he is persisting in not praying, or is \n    persisting in some major sin, then it is not permissible for you to mix with \n    him. Allaah cursed the Children of Israel for something similar to this. He \n    says (interpretation of the meaning):  \n\n    “Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were \n    cursed by the tongue of Dawood (David) and ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam \n    (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allaah and the Messengers) and were \n    ever transgressing beyond bounds.\n\n    79. They used not to forbid one another from Al-Munkar \n    (wrong, evildoing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed”\n\n    [al-Maa'idah 5:78-79].\n\n    In the commentary on this verse it is narrated that one of \n    them would see another committing sin and tell him not to do that, then he \n    would meet him the next day and he would still be persisting in sin, and he \n    would not tell him not to do that and he would mix with him, and would eat \n    and drink with him and sit with him. When Allaah saw that they did that, He \n    set them against one another, and cursed them on the lips of their \n    Prophets. \n\n    And the Prophet of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) warned us against doing such things, lest there befall us the \n    punishment that befell them. \n\n    End quote from Fataawa al-Shaykh al-Fawzaan (2/246, \n    question no. 215) \n\n    See also the answer to questions no. \n    4420 and \n    47425. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the family of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), especially his wives like ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), are to be respected and honored. Mocking them is considered a serious offense. Regarding those who do not pray and deny the obligation of hijab, such beliefs can put them at odds with fundamental aspects of Islamic teachings.\n\n1. **Sitting with them**: It is generally discouraged to sit with those who openly mock the religion, its teachings, or its respected figures, as this could imply agreement or approval of their statements and beliefs. \n\n2. **Prayers (Salah)**: Salah is one of the pillars of Islam, and neglecting it can lead to serious concerns regarding a person's faith. It's recommended to advise such individuals gently and encourage them to return to the correct path.\n\n3. **Denial of Hijab**: The hijab is considered obligatory by many scholars in Islam. If someone denies this obligation, it reflects a misunderstanding or rejection of Islamic teachings. Engaging in constructive dialogue might be beneficial, but this should be done respectfully and with wisdom.\n\n4. **Mocking religious figures**: Mocking ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) or any aspect of Islam is a serious matter that calls for a response. It is important to refute such comments sensitively while maintaining respect for the person.\n\nIn all cases, one's response should strive to convey the truth of Islam and encourage better understanding and respect for the core teachings while also protecting one's own faith and integrity. If the interaction leads to any harm to one's own belief or practice, it may be prudent to distance oneself from such company."

        "question": "Conditions of righteous deeds",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh al-Shanqeeti said:\nWhat is meant in the aayah\n“…who do righteous deeds…”\n[al-Kahf 18:2 – interpretation of the meaning]\n is explained in other aayahs which indicate that a deed cannot be righteous unless it meets three conditions:\n1 – It must be done in accordance with that which was brought by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Every action that goes against that which was brought by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not righteous, rather it is false. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it” [al-Hashr 59:7]\n“He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed Allah” [al-Nisa’ 4:10]\n“Or have they partners with Allah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained?” [al-Shoora 42:21]\nand there are many similar aayahs.\n2 – The one who does it must be sincere in his intention towards Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):\n“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him)” al-Bayyinah :5]\n“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Verily, I am commanded to worship Allah (Alone) by obeying Him and doing religious deeds sincerely for His sake only.\nAnd I am commanded (this) in order that I may be the first of those who submit themselves to Allah (in Islam) as Muslims.’\nSay (O Muhammad): ‘Verily, if I disobey my Lord, I am afraid of the torment of a great Day.’\nSay (O Muhammad): ‘Allah Alone I worship by doing religious deeds sincerely for His sake only (and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship).’\nSo worship what you like besides Him’” [al-Zumar 39:11-15]\nand there are many similar aayahs.\n3 – It must be done on the basis of faith and sound belief, because the action is the roof and the belief (‘aqeedah) is the foundation. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer…”\n[al-Nahl 16:97]\nSo faith is described as the prerequisite for that.\nThe concept of this prerequisite is explained in many places, such as when Allah describes the actions of non-believers:\n“And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust” [al-Furqaan 25:23]\n“their [disbelievers’] deeds are like a mirage in a desert” [al-Noor 24:39]\n“their [disbelievers’]works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a stormy day” [Ibraaheem 14:18] \nand there are many similar aayahs as explained above.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, righteous deeds are actions that are pleasing to Allah and in accordance with His guidance. There are several key conditions that must be met for deeds to be considered righteous:\n\n1. **Sincerity (Ikhlas)**: The deed must be performed sincerely for the sake of Allah. It should not be done for showing off to others or seeking their praise.\n\n2. **Following the Sunnah**: The action must be in accordance with the teachings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This is essential to ensure that the deed is in line with Islamic principles.\n\n3. **Correct Intention (Niyyah)**: The intention behind the act should be clear and focused on pleasing Allah. This is often emphasized in the hadith: \"Actions are judged by intentions\" (Sahih Bukhari).\n\n4. **Adhering to the Shari'ah**: The deed must comply with the laws and guidelines outlined in the Quran and Sunnah. This includes avoiding any actions that are prohibited in Islam.\n\n5. **Consistency (Istiqamah)**: The individual should strive to be consistent in performing righteous deeds, maintaining commitment to their faith and practices.\n\n6. **Awareness of Limits and Conditions**: Understanding the specific limits and conditions related to particular deeds, as not all good actions are permissible in every circumstance.\n\nBy fulfilling these conditions, a believer can ensure that their actions are recognized as righteous and acceptable in the sight of Allah."

        "question": "Was a window opened above the Prophet’s grave for rain?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth referred to was narrated by Abu’l-Jawza’ Aws ibn ‘Abd-Allaah who said: The people of Madeenah were faced with a severe drought. They complained to ‘Aa'ishah who said: “Look at the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and make an opening facing the sky so that there will be no barrier between him and the sky.” They did that, then it rained until the plants grew and the camels grew exceedingly fat, and it was called the year of the exceedingly fat animals.  \nNarrated by al-Daarimi (1/56), no. 92, in the chapter: How Allaah honoured His Prophet after his death. \nAl-Daarimi said: Abu’l-Nu’maan told us, Sa’eed ibn Zayd told us, ‘Amr ibn Maalik al-Nakri told us, Abu’l-Jawza’ Aws ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: … then he quoted the hadeeth. \nThis report is da’eef (weak) and is not saheeh. The scholar al-Albaani stated that it is weak and said in his book al-Tawassul (p. 128): \nThis is a weak isnaad which cannot be used as evidence for three reasons: \n1 – Sa’eed ibn Zayd, who was the brother of Hammaad ibn Yazeed, has some weakness. Al-Haafiz said concerning him in al-Taqreeb: he is sadooq (truthful) but confused. Al-Dhahabi said in al-Mizaan: Yahya ibn Sa’eed said: (he is) weak. Al-Sa’di said: It is not evidence; they regard his hadeeth as weak. Al-Nasaa’i and others said: He is not strong. Ahmad said: There is nothing wrong with him; Yahya ibn Sa’eed did not like him. \n2 – The report is mawqoof and stops at ‘Aa’ishah, and it is not attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Even if it were saheeh it would not count as evidence, because it may be that it comes under the heading of ijtihaad of some of the Sahaabah who may make a mistake or get it right, so we are not obliged to follow it. \n3 – Abu’l-Nu’maan is Muhammad ibn al-Fadl who is known as ‘Aarim. Although he is thiqah (trustworthy), he became confused towards the end of his life. Al-Haafiz Burhaan al-Deen al-Halabi narrated it in al-Ightibaat bi man rumiya bi’l-Ikhtilaat following Ibn al-Salaah who mentioned him among the confused in his book al-Muqaddimah and said: The ruling concerning them is that the hadeeth of those who learned from them before they became confused may be accepted, but it may not be accepted from those who learned from them after they became confused or those concerning whom it is not known whether they learned from him before he became confused or after. \nI (al-Albaani) say: it is not known whether al-Daarimi heard this report before he became confused or after, so it is not acceptable and cannot be quoted as evidence. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, refuting al-Bakri: The report narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) about the opening of a hole towards the sky so that rain could fall (onto the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) is not saheeh, and its isnaad is not proven. Among the things which prove that it is false is the fact that during the lifetime of ‘Aa’ishah the house did not have any opening,  rather it remained as it was during the life of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): some of it was roofed over and some of it was open, and the sun used to shine into it, as it is proven in al-Saheehayn from ‘Aa’ishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray ‘Asr with the sun shining into her room when the shadow had not yet appeared. The apartment remained like that until al-Waleed ibn ‘Abd al-Malik expanded the mosque when he was governor, at which time the apartments were added to the mosque of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). At that time the room in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is buried was incorporated into the mosque and a high wall was built around the apartment of ‘Aa’ishah which contains the Prophet’s grave. After that the opening was made so that people could enter it when necessary in order to clean it. As for the opening being made during ‘Aa’ishah’s lifetime, this is an obvious lie. End quote. \nSecondly: \nThis hadeeth is not proof for what the extreme Sufis believe about it being permissible to seek rain by the help of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). You cannot find in the hadeeth anything which indicates that, by any stretch of the imagination. The most that can be said is that it shows how Allaah honoured his Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after he died, as al-Daarimi described in his Musnad in the chapter heading under which he included this hadeeth. This is the blessing of his pure body and his honour before Allaah. But that does not mean that it is permissible for the Muslims to go to him and seek his help whilst he is in his grave. The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did not do that, rather they opened a hole in the roof of his room so that it might be directly open to the sky, but none of them asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for rain, and they did not speak to him concerning that. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Iqtida’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem (p. 338) \nGoing to graves to offer supplication beside them, and seeking a response to du’aa’ offered there more than du’aa’s offered elsewhere, is something that was not prescribed by Allaah or His Messenger, and was not done by any of the Sahaabah, Taabi’een or imams of the Muslims. It was not mentioned by any of the earlier scholars or righteous men. Rather most of what has been narrated concerning that comes from some of the later figures, after the second century (AH). \nThe companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) were faced with drought several times, and other calamities befell them, but did they come and seek rain and seek help at the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? \nRather ‘Umar went out with al-‘Abbaas and sought rain through him, i.e. through his du’aa’; he did not pray for rain by the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). \nIndeed it was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that she uncovered he grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) so that rain might fall on it, because it (rain) is a mercy, but she did not pray for rain there, or seek divine help there. End quote. \nThus it is clear that there is no evidence in this report for the Sufis that it is permissible to seek help from the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or to seek to draw closer to Allaah by means of him or his status.  \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "According to various Islamic traditions, it is narrated that a window was opened above the grave of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) which allowed rain to fall directly on his grave. This story is often cited to illustrate the special status and honor of the Prophet in the sight of Allah.\n\nHowever, the authenticity of this narration varies among scholars and different Islamic traditions. Therefore, while this belief exists, it is important to note that not all scholars agree on its authenticity or interpretation.\n\nIf you are looking for a specific reference or deeper understanding, it might be beneficial to consult scholarly works or reliable sources within your tradition."

        "question": "He is asking about al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah is a book dealing with ‘aqeedah (basic tenets of faith) which was written by Imam al-Tahhaawi and named after him. Discussing this ‘aqeedah means that we must look at it from a number of angles. \nFirstly: \nThe author is the imam, muhaddith and faqeeh Abu Ja’far Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Salaamah al-Tahhaawi – who is named after a village in Upper Egypt – he studied with many Shaykhs and learned from them and benefited from them, and he listed their number as three hundred Shaykhs. \nHe was praised by more than one of the scholars: \nIbn Yoonus said: al-Tahhaawi was trustworthy, sincere, a faqeeh and a man of wisdom, and after him there was no one else like him.  \nAl-Dhahabi said: the faqeeh, muhaddith, haafiz, one of the prominent scholars, and he was trustworthy, sincere, a faqeeh and a man of wisdom. \nIbn Katheer said: He was one of the trustworthy, sincere and a haafiz. \nHe wrote books which were well-written, comprehensive and of great value, among which was his great book Ma’aani al-Athaar, which contains research on fiqh accompanied by evidence and discussion of controversial matters, and pointing to  which view is more correct. His books also include Mushkil al-Athaar and others. \nHe died (may Allah have mercy on him) in 321 AH and was buried in Egypt, in al-Quraafah. \nSee his biography in Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’ (15/33-37) and al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah (11/174). \nSecondly: \nThis ‘Aqeedah which was written by al-Tahhaawi mentions a number of the beliefs of the righteous salaf and those who followed them of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, which was approved by the imams of the Hanafis – as al-Tahhaawi followed the madhhab of Abu Haneefah. He explained in his introduction his aims in doing that, and said: \n“This is an explanation of the ‘aqeedah of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah according to the view of the fuqaha’ of this madhhab: Abu Haneefah al-Nu’maan ibn Thaabit al-Kufi, Abu Yoosuf Ya’qoob ibn Ibraaheem al-Ansaari, and Abu ‘Abd-Allah Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybaani, may Allah be pleased with them all, and the beliefs concerning the fundamentals of Islam, on the basis of which they submit to the Lord of the Worlds.” End quote.  \nThen he mentioned these basic beliefs, and the total number of things he mentioned was 105 things believed by Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah in general. \nHe started by explaining the Oneness of Allah, may He be exalted, and said a little about the attributes of His Lordship (sifaat ruboobiyyatihi), such as His being alive and self-sufficient, and His being the Creator and Provider, and he affirmed the attributes of perfection without discussing how or likening Him to any of His creation, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “There is nothing like Him, and He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Seer” [al-Shoora 42:11]. Then he followed that with a discussion of the obligation to believe in the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and that he was sent to all people. Then he spoke of the Holy Quran, stating that it is the word of Allah and not created, and he affirmed that the believers will see Allah in the Hereafter. Then he mentioned some matters of the unseen in which Ahl al-Sunnah believe, such as the Cistern (al-hawd), intercession, the Throne and the Footstool (al-Kursiy). Then he mentioned the pillars of belief in al-qada’ wa’l-qadar (the Divine will and decree) and what Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah believe about this topic. Then he went on to define faith and its pillars, and explained that faith may increase and decrease, and he explained the view of Ahl al-Sunnah in contrast to the views of the Khawaarij and Murji’ah. He also described what Ahl-al-Sunnah believe with regard to the noble Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), and that loving them is part of Islam, faith and ihsaan, and that hating them is kufr, hypocrisy and sin. Then he mentioned some of the portents of the Hour and what will happen on the Day of Resurrection, then he ended his essay with an discussion of how this religion is the middle path, between exaggeration and falling short. \nThirdly: \nIt is a book of ‘aqeedah that is easy to read and clear in meaning. It is comprehensive and brief. It sums up the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah and, for the most part, includes matters on which there is scholarly consensus and agreement. \nMany scholars have written commentaries on this ‘Aqeedah and explained its words and meanings. One of the most famous of them is Ibn Abi’l-‘Izz al-Hanafi, who wrote a lengthy commentary on it; among later scholars, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz and Shaykh Muhammad Naasir al-Deen al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on them) wrote commentaries on it, as did Shaykh Safar ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Hawaali (may Allah preserve him). The one who wants to understand more of the meanings of al-Tahhaawiyyah can refer to these commentaries. \nFourthly: \n‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawi discusses matters in brief and general terms, but what made it very famous and popular among the Salafis in particular is the commentary which was written by Shaykh Ibn Abi’l-‘Izz al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him), which is the most important and most detailed of its commentaries. He based his commentary on the books of Ahl al-Sunnah, especially the books of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and his student Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him). \nFifthly: \nDespite what we have referred to of the good features of this ‘Aqeedah and its commentary by Ibn Abi’l-‘Izz, it also contains a number of issues which were criticized, because they go against what the salaf believed, such as his saying, when defining faith: “Faith is affirming with the tongue and believing in the heart,” because limiting it to that is the view of the Murji’i fuqaha’ who excluded physical actions from the definition of faith. The same applies to what he said after that, “Faith is one and the same, and believers are equal with regard to the foundation of faith.” \nIt also includes some general phrases that may be understood incorrectly, and are most often used by innovators to mean things that are contrary to the beliefs of the righteous salaf, such as his saying, “exalted be He above limits and boundaries” and “exalted be He above having faculties and parts” and “He is not subject to directions and dimensions which are attributes of created beings.” Such phrases are used by those who misinterpret the attributes of Allah (al-mu’attilah)  to deny what is affirmed in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger of the sublime attributes of Allah that befit His perfection, may He be glorified and exalted, such as His Countenance, hands and eyes. They call them faculties and parts, and deny that Allah possesses them. \nAnother example is His being above His creation, and His rising above His Throne in His heaven. They call this “directions and location” and deny that it applies to Allah, may He be exalted.  \nBecause of that, it is important for the seeker of knowledge to pay attention to learning this ‘Aqeedah from a scholar of Ahl al-Sunnah who can explain it, such as Ibn Abi’l-‘Izz among classical scholars and from contemporary scholars who have written brief commentaries on it, as we have referred to above. \nThere are many audio commentaries on this book, such as the commentary by Shaykh Saalih Aal al-Shaykh, and the commentary by Shaykh Yoosuf al-Ghufays, and others. \nShaykh Safar al-Hawaali (may Allah preserve him) has commented at length on the commentary of Ibn Abi’l-‘Izz; you may refer to it on his website. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah is a foundational text of Islamic theology written by the prominent scholar Abu Ja'far al-Tahhaawi in the 10th century CE (around 321 AH). It is a concise and clear presentation of the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah, representing the Sunni perspective of Islamic creed.\n\nThe work is particularly significant because it outlines the fundamental beliefs of Islam, such as the oneness of Allah (Tawhid), the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him), the Day of Judgment, and the attributes of Allah, among other essential tenets. It is often studied by students of Islamic theology to understand the basic beliefs that every Muslim should hold.\n\nAl-Tahhaawi's approach is characterized by clarity and a rejection of the various sects and heretical beliefs that had emerged within the Muslim community. The text is organized into a series of statements that affirm core beliefs, making it accessible for both scholars and laypersons.\n\nIn summary, al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah serves as an important reference for understanding Sunni Islamic beliefs and is widely respected across the Muslim world."

        "question": "Showing disrespect to Allaah, may He be glorified, by of joking",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Belief in Allah is based on respect and veneration of Him and submission to Him. Hence Allah criticized the kaafirs and stated that they associated others with Him because they did not make a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified be He, and High be He above all that they associate as partners with Him!” [Al-Zumar 39:67]\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Almighty, by Whose might the heavens might almost be rent asunder, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Nearly the heavens might be rent asunder from above them (by His Majesty), and the angels glorify the praises of their Lord, and ask for forgiveness for those on the earth. Verily, Allah is the Oft‑Forgiving, the Most Merciful” [Al-Shoora 42:5]\nAnyone who studies the creation of Allah will see some of the signs of His greatness. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing the Kursiy (Footstool) and Throne: “The seven heavens, in comparison to the Footstool, are like a ring lying in the wilderness, and the superiority of the Throne to the Footstool is like the superiority of that wilderness to that ring.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (1/223). \nVeneration of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, cannot co-exist in one heart with mockery of Him. Hence mocking Allah, may He be exalted, or His verses or Messengers is kufr, no matter what form it takes, whether it is in earnest or in jest. Allah says in Soorat al-Tawbah (interpretation of the meaning): \n“The hypocrites fear lest a Soorah (chapter of the Quran) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: ‘(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.’\n65. If you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: ‘Was it at Allah , and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger  that you were mocking?’\n66. Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimoon (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals)” [Al-Tawbah 9:64-66]\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: This shows that mocking Allah and His verses and signs is kufr and this verse indicates that the one who belittles the Messenger of Allah in earnest or in jest is a kaafir. \nAl-Saarim al-Maslool (2/70). \nAl-Qaadi Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said in Ahkaam al-Quran commenting on this verse: What they – the hypocrites – said must have been either in earnest or in jest, but no matter what it was, it is kufr, because joking about kufr is also kufr, and there is no difference of opinion concerning this among the ummah. End quote. \nThe great scholar al-Sa’di said: Mocking Allah and His Messenger is kufr which puts one beyond the pale of Islam, because the religion is based on veneration of Allah and of His religion and His Messengers, and mocking any of that is contrary to this principle and is diametrically opposed to it. \nWhat this man said, in which he showed disrespect towards Allah – exalted be He far above what the wrongdoers say – and spoke as if he regarded Allah as equal in status to a human being and thought that he could address Him as such, is kufr, as anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the religion of Allah would realize, and no one would do that but one who is extremely ignorant or a man whose heart has no knowledge of Allah and no respect for Him. \nThen he added to his mockery and said “I must tell Allah.” Does Allah, may He be exalted, need to be told anything by an ignorant wrongdoer?! \n“Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or in the heaven” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:5]\nThis wretch has to renew his faith and enter Islam again, and repent to Allah from this blatant kufr. For the rest of his life he must do a lot of good and righteous deeds, as much as he can, in the hope that Allah may pardon him and forgive him for his ignorance and transgression. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, showing disrespect to Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala) is regarded as a serious matter. Joking about Allah, His names, attributes, or any aspect of the religion is considered disrespectful and is not permissible. The Quran and Hadith emphasize the importance of venerating Allah and maintaining a deep respect for His majesty. \n\nFor instance, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:55), Allah warns against taking His signs lightly, which can be extended to any form of mockery or jest concerning Him. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) also emphasized the importance of honoring the sacred aspects of the faith.\n\nEngaging in such behavior can lead individuals away from the core principles of Islam and can have serious spiritual implications. It is always best to approach discussions about faith with reverence and consciousness of its sanctity.\n\nIf someone has inadvertently made a light-hearted comment about Allah, it is important for them to seek forgiveness and be mindful in the future about how they express themselves regarding religious matters."

        "question": "Seeking barakah (blessing) from water in which there is said to be a hair of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The scholars are \n    unanimously agreed that it is permissible to seek barakah from the relics of \n    the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as his \n    hair, sweat and other things, because there is evidence to that effect. It \n    was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: When the Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stoned the Jamrah and offered \n    his sacrifice and shaved his head, he showed his right side to the barber \n    and he shaved it, then he called Abu Talhah al-Ansaari and gave it to him. \n    Then he showed him the left side and said: “Shave it.” So he shaved it, and \n    he gave it to Abu Talhah and said: “Share it out among the people.”  \n    Narrated by Muslim (1305).  \nAnd it was narrated from \n    Anas that Umm Sulaym used to put out a mat of leather for the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he would take a nap in her \n    house. When the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    fell asleep, she took some of his sweat and hair and kept it in a bottle, \n    then she put it in some sukk (perfume made of musk). He [Thumaamah \n    ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Anas] said: When Anas ibn Maalik was dying, he left \n    instructions that some of the sukk should be put in his hunoot \n    (perfumes used in preparation of dead for burial). Narrated by al-Bukhaari \n    (6281). \nThis and other reports \n    indicate that Allaah created barakah in the person of the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and whatever separated from it \n    of hair, sweat and so on, from which barakah may be sought and one may hope \n    for benefit therefrom in this world and the in the Hereafter. The One Who \n    bestows this goodness is Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted. \nBut the claim nowadays that \n    this is one of the hairs or relics of the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) is a claim for which there is no proof. Most of the \n    claims that are made to that effect are lies and myths, such as their saying \n    that this is a hair of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) because if it is placed in the sun it has no shadow. No attention \n    should be paid to such words. \nShaykh al-Albaani (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: We know that his relics – such as his \n    garments, hair and so on – have been lost, and it is not possible for anyone \n    to prove that any of them exist for certain. Al-Tawassul, p. 147. \nBased on this, it is not \n    permissible to seek barakah from the water you asked about, unless it is \n    known for certain that what was placed in it is a hair of the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but there is no way to prove \n    that. We should beware of charlatans and liars and propagators of bid’ah, \n    and we should acquire knowledge from people who are known to have knowledge \n    of the Sunnah and who are defenders of the Sunnah and who strive hard to \n    spread the Sunnah. It is amazing how a gathering to support the religion \n    could turn into encouraging people to believe in unproven matters. It would \n    have been better for the lecturer to call people to learn and adhere to the \n    Sunnah, because that is one of the means of success. \nMay Allaah enable us and \n    you to follow the Sunnah properly. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, seeking barakah (blessing) from physical objects or items that have a connection to the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) can be a topic of discussion among scholars. Generally, it is acceptable to hold reverence for items associated with the Prophet, such as his hair, and many Muslims do so out of love and respect for him.\n\nHowever, it is important to approach this practice with caution. The veneration of relics and seeking blessings from them can sometimes lead to misunderstandings about Tawheed (the oneness of Allah) and the proper Islamic practices. \n\nIslamic teachings emphasize that all blessings originate from Allah alone, and while it is permissible to seek blessings through certain means, it must not lead to acts of shirk (associating partners with Allah) or deviate from the core beliefs of the faith.\n\nScholarly opinions may vary regarding the specific practice of seeking barakah from water containing a hair of the Prophet. Many scholars advise that while it is acceptable to have deep respect for such relics, the ultimate source of barakah is through sincere worship, prayer, and following the teachings of Islam.\n\nIt's always beneficial to consult knowledgeable scholars or trustworthy sources within your community to gain further understanding and guidance related to specific practices."

        "question": "What Is Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Lexical meaning of Islam\nIf you refer to Arabic language dictionaries, you will find that the meaning of the word Islam is: submission , humbling oneself, and obeying commands and heeding prohibitions without objection, sincerely worshipping Allah alone, believing what He tells us and having faith in Him. \nThe word Islam has become the name of the religion which was brought by Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nWhy this religion is called Islam \nAll the religions on earth are called by various names, either the name of a specific man or a specific nation. So Christianity takes its name from Christ; Buddhism takes its name from its founder, the Buddha; the Zoroastrians became well known by this name because their founder and standard-bearer was Zoroaster. \nSimilarly, Judaism took its name from a tribe known as Yehudah (Judah), so it became known as Judaism. And so on. \nExcept for Islam ; for it is not attributed to any specific man or to any specific nation, rather its name refers to the meaning of the word Islam . What this name indicates is that the establishment and founding of this religion was not the work of one particular man and that it is not only for one particular nation to the exclusion of all others. Rather its aim is to give the attribute implied by the word Islam to all the peoples of the earth. So everyone who acquires this attribute, whether he is from the past or the present, is a Muslim, and everyone who acquires this attribute in the future will also be a Muslim. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Islam is a monotheistic Abrahamic faith that believes in the oneness of God (Allah in Arabic) and follows the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, who is considered the last prophet in a long line of prophets that includes figures such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. \n\nThe central tenets of Islam are encapsulated in the Five Pillars, which are:\n\n1. **Shahada (Faith)**: The declaration of faith stating that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger. This is the fundamental creed of Islam.\n   \n2. **Salah (Prayer)**: Performing the five daily prayers at prescribed times throughout the day, which serve as a direct link between the worshipper and Allah.\n\n3. **Zakat (Charitable Giving)**: Giving a portion of one’s wealth (typically 2.5% of savings) to those in need, which purifies wealth and promotes social equality.\n\n4. **Sawm (Fasting)**: Observing fasting during the month of Ramadan, where Muslims abstain from food, drink, and other physical needs from dawn until sunset as a means of spiritual growth and self-discipline.\n\n5. **Hajj (Pilgrimage)**: Undertaking a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca at least once in a lifetime if physically and financially able, which is a demonstration of unity among Muslims.\n\nThe holy scripture of Islam is the Qur’an, which Muslims believe to be the literal word of God as revealed to Muhammad. In addition to the Qur’an, the Hadith, which comprises the sayings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad, serves as a critical source of guidance for Muslims in matters of faith and daily life.\n\nIslam emphasizes moral and ethical conduct, justice, compassion, and community. It is practiced by over a billion people around the world and encompasses a rich diversity of cultures and traditions."

        "question": "Texts of the Revelation which confirm that Islam is a divinely-revealed religion",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThere is no difference between using the Quran or Sunnah as evidence, because both are Revelation (wahy) from Allah to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the Sunnah explains the Quran. Allah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to accept that which His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought and to abstain from that which he forbade. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  \n“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)” [al-Hashr 59:7]\nThe Sunnah is the wisdom (al-hikmah) that is mentioned in the Book of Allah in many verses, such as the following (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Similarly (to complete My Blessings on you), We have sent among you a Messenger (Muhammad) of your own, reciting to you Our Verses (the Quran) and purifying you, and teaching you the Book (the Quran) and the Hikmah (i.e. Sunnah, Islamic laws and Fiqh — jurisprudence), and teaching you that which you used not to know” [al-Baqarah 2:151] \n“And treat not the Verses (Laws) of Allah as a jest, but remember Allah’s Favours on you (i.e. Islam), and that which He has sent down to you of the Book (i.e. the Quran) and Al-Hikmah (the Prophet’s Sunnah — legal ways — Islamic jurisprudence) whereby He instructs you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything” [al-Baqarah 2:231]\nWhat prompted us to point this out is what is said in the question about looking for Quranic texts which prove the divine origin of Islam. If the question had been about texts of Revelation or evidence from the Quran and Sunnah, that would have been better and more appropriate. \nSecondly: \nIslam is a divinely-revealed religion, and it is revelation (wahy) from Allah, may He be exalted. The Qur'aan and Sunnah both come from Allah. Allah has made this religion the final religion, and has made its Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the final Prophet and Messenger. \nEvery attempt on the part of the kuffaar and atheists to destroy Islam or distort it has ended in failure and loss, because Allah has guaranteed to protect the foundations of this religion, namely the Quran and Sunnah. \nThis is sufficient evidence for the divine origin of Islam. Whoever studies the attempts to destroy Islam or distort the Quran and Sunnah, and studies how Allah has protected His religion, will know that if this religion was of human origin, the product of human thought, it would now be unknown, but Allah promised to protect His religion, and moreover He gave us the glad tidings that it would prevail over all other religions and spread throughout the world. \nThere follow some of the Quranic texts which show that Islam is divine in origin: \n1 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion” [al-Maa’idah 5:3]\n2 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]\n3 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And (remember) when Allah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allah), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allah said: ‘Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this)’” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:81]\n4 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Do they seek other than the religion of Allah (the true Islamic Monotheism worshipping none but Allah Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:82]\n5 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the Unseen; nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.’ Say: ‘Are the blind and the one who sees equal? Will you not then take thought?’” [al-An’aam 6:50]\n6 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And when Our clear Verses are recited unto them, those who hope not for their Meeting with Us, say: ‘Bring us a Quran other than this, or change it.’ Say (O Muhammad): ‘It is not for me to change it on my own accord; I only follow that which is revealed unto me. Verily, I fear the torment of the Great Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) if I were to disobey my Lord.’\n16. Say (O Muhammad): ‘If Allah had so willed, I should not have recited it to you nor would He have made it known to you. Verily, I have stayed amongst you a life time before this. Have you then no sense?’” [Yoonus 10:15, 16]\n7 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Quran)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought” [al-Nahl 16:44]\nThis indicates that the Sunnah is one of the sources of the divine sharee’ah. \n8 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance (justice) that mankind may keep up justice. And We brought forth iron wherein is mighty power (in matters of war), as well as many benefits for mankind, that Allah may test who it is that will help Him (His religion) and His Messengers in the unseen. Verily, Allah is All‑Strong, All‑Mighty” [al-Hadeed 57:25]\n9 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O mankind! Verily, there has come to you a convincing proof (Prophet Muhammad) from your Lord; and We sent down to you a manifest light (this Quran)” [al-Nisa’ 4:174]\n10 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Quran, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your breasts, — a guidance and a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers” [Yoonus 10:57]\n11 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad) Rooh (a revelation, and a mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made it (this Quran) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will. And verily, you (O Muhammad) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e. Allah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism).\n53. The path of Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Verily, all matters at the end go to Allah (for decision)” [al-Shoora 42:52-53]\n12 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“By the star when it goes down (or vanishes).\n2. Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred.\n3. Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.\n4. It is only a Revelation revealed” [al-Najm 53:1-4]\n13 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O Messenger (Muhammad)! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind. Verily, Allah guides not the people who disbelieve” [al-Maa’idah 5:67]\nAnd there are many verses which speak of this principle. We advise you to ponder the Book of Allah for yourself as you read it, and thus you will find what you are looking for and more, in sha Allah. You can also seek the help of some trustworthy tafseers (commentaries) such as the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer or Ibn Sa’di, and so on. \nIn the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) there is evidence that points to the divine origin of Islam and proves that its source is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is no more than the conveyor of the Message that his Lord revealed to him. For example: \n1 – It was narrated that al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’di Karib al-Kindi said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been given the Book and something similar along with it.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (4604) and classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. \n2 – It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I do not give to you and I do not withhold from you, rather I am a distributor and I allocate things where I am commanded to.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2949). \n3 – It was narrated from Jubayr ibn Mut’im that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, which part of the land is worst? He said: “I do not know.” When Jibreel (peace be upon him) came to him he said: “O Jibreel, which part of the land is worst?” He said: “I do not know, until I ask my Lord, may He be glorified and exalted.” Jibreel (peace be upon him) went away, and stayed away for as long as Allah willed that he should stay away. Then he came and said: “O Muhammad, you asked me which part of the land is worst and I said I did not know. I asked my Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and He said: Its markets.” \nNarrated by Ahmad (16302); classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targheeb (325). \n4 – It was narrated that Jaabir said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been commanded to fight the people until they say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah. If they say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, their blood and their wealth are protected from me, except in cases dictated by Islamic law, and their reckoning will be with Allah.” Then he recited: “you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them” [al-Ghaashiyah 88:21,22]. \nNarrated by al-Bukhari (2786) and Muslim (21) \n5 – In the lengthy hadeeth which speaks of Abu Sufyaan’s meeting with Heraclius, which is a hadeeth full of lessons, it says that Heraclius sent for him to come with a group from Quraysh, who were merchants trading in Syria at the time when the Messenger of Allah (S) had made a peace treaty with Abu Sufyaan and the kuffaar of Quraysh. He summoned them to his council where he was surrounded by the great men of Byzantium, then he called them and his translator and said: Which of you is closest in kinship to this man who claims that he is a Prophet? \nAbu Sufyaan said: I am closest to him in kinship. \nHe said: Bring him close to me, and bring his companions close and put them behind him. Then he said to his translator: Tell them that I am going to ask this one about this man, and if he lies to me they should tell me that he is lying. \nAmong the wise questions that Heraclius posed to Abu Sufyaan was: Did you ever accuse him of lying before he said what he said? \nAnd at the end of the questioning, Heraclius explained to Abu Sufyaan his purpose in asking these questions. He said concerning these questions: I asked you whether you accused him of lying before he said what he said, and you said no. I knew that if he did not tell lies about people, he would not tell lies about Allah… \nNarrated by al-Bukhari (7) and Muslim (1773). \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the principal text that confirms its divine revelation is the Qur'an, which Muslims believe to be the literal word of God (Allah) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Angel Gabriel (Jibril) over a span of approximately 23 years. The Qur'an emphasizes its own miraculous nature, authenticity, and divine origin in several verses. Here are a few key verses that highlight this:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:2)**: \n   - \"This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah.\"\n\n2. **Surah Al-Isra (17:9)**: \n   - \"Indeed, this Qur'an guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward.\"\n\n3. **Surah Al-Hijr (15:9)**: \n   - \"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian.\"\n\n4. **Surah Al-Anfal (8:30)**: \n   - \"And [mention, O Muhammad], when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you. And they plan, but Allah plans. And Allah is the best of planners.\"\n\nAdditionally, the Sunnah (the practices and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) also plays a crucial role in confirming the divine origin of Islam, as it provides context to the revelations and outlines how to implement them in daily life.\n\nMuslims also find affirmation of their faith through the historical accounts of the Prophet’s life, the early Islamic community, and the subsequent generations, as well as the consistency and preservation of Islamic teachings over time. \n\nIn summary, the Qur'an, as the foundational document of Islam, stands as the primary text that confirms Islam's status as a divinely-revealed religion."

        "question": "Meaning of the hadeeth: “The Shaytaan has despaired of ever being worshipped by the worshippers in the Arabian Peninsula”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      One of the things that are established by the scholars is \n      that shirk will take place in the ummah as is indicated by the sound \n      texts, and reality confirms this. \n\n    Many of the Arabs apostatized after the death of the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and many of them went back \n    to worshipping idols. \n\n    The mujaddid (renewer of the Faith) Muhammad ibn ‘Abd \n    al-Wahhaab said: “Chapter: Reports that some of this ummah will worship \n    idols”, then he mentioned some ahaadeeth which indicate that.  \n\n    With regard to the hadeeth: “The Shaytaan has despaired of \n    ever being worshipped…” the scholars have interpreted it in several ways: \n\n    1 – That the Shaytaan has despaired of ever getting all \n    worshippers to unite on kufr. \n\n    This view was favoured by the great scholar Ibn Rajab \n    al-Hanbali. Al-Darar al-Sunnah, 12/117. \n2 – That this is a report \n    of the despair that befell the Shaytaan when he saw the conquests and how \n    the people entered the religion of Allaah in crowds. So the hadeeth is \n    telling us what the Shaytaan thought and he expected to happen. Then what \n    really happened was something other than that, for a reason decreed by \n    Allaah. \n\n    This view was favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him). Al-Qawl al-Mufeed, 1/211. \n3 – That the Shaytaan \n    despaired of the believers whose faith is complete, because the Shaytaan has \n    no hope that they will worship him. \n\n    This view was favoured by al-Aloosi. See Da’aawa \n    al-Munaawi’een, 224. \n\n    4 – That the “al-” in the word “al-musalloon” (worshippers) \n    refers to a specific group of worshippers, and that what is meant is the \n    Sahaabah. \n\n    All of these interpretations are close in meaning, and the \n    most likely is the second. And Allaah knows best. \n\n    See Ahaadeeth al-‘Aqeedah allati yuwahham Zaahiruha \n    al-Ta’aarud fi’l-Saheehayn, 2/232-238 .",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you mentioned refers to a statement attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) indicating that the Shaytan (Satan) has given up hope of being worshipped by those who are within the Arabian Peninsula. It highlights the prominence of monotheism and the worship of Allah among the people in that region.\n\nThe broader meaning of this hadith can be understood in several ways:\n\n1. **Despair of Shaytan:** The Shaytan's despair signifies that the people in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly during the time of the Prophet, have firmly embraced the worship of Allah alone, thus rendering Shaytan's efforts to mislead them futile.\n\n2. **Strength of Faith:** It reflects the strength of faith and the acceptance of Islam by the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, suggesting that they are resolute in their beliefs and practices.\n\n3. **Geographical Context:** The Arabian Peninsula holds a significant place in Islam, being the birthplace of the Prophet and the location of the Kaaba in Mecca. The hadith underscores the spiritual significance of the region and its role as a center of monotheistic worship.\n\n4. **Encouragement for Believers:** This statement serves as encouragement for believers to maintain their faith and be vigilant against the temptations and whisperings of Shaytan, reassuring them that they are part of a broader divine narrative that emphasizes worship and devotion to Allah.\n\nIn summary, the hadith serves to reassure and encourage Muslims regarding their steadfastness in faith while also highlighting the significant role of the Arabian Peninsula in the history and practice of Islam."

        "question": "What Does Islam Say About Redemption?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Meaning of redemption\nThe doctrine of redemption, and the basis of this doctrine which is their belief that the Messiah (peace be upon him) was crucified, is one of the basic doctrines of Christianity , so much so that they would gamble the entire religion on this doctrine. \nThe English cardinal Manning says in his book “Eternal Priesthood”: “The importance of this confusing topic is obvious, for if the death of Christ on the cross is not real, then the basis of the church’s doctrine will crumble from its foundations, because if Christ did not die on the cross, then there is no sacrifice, no salvation , and no trinity … Paul, the Apostles and all the churches say that, i.e., if Christ did not die then there was no resurrection either.” \nThis is what Paul said: \n“And if Christ has not been raised, then preaching is useless and so is your faith.” I Corinthians 15:14 – New International Version (NIV)\nJust as they struggle with their belief in trinity and what it means, and how they can reconcile it with the belief in monotheism which is affirmed in the Old Testament (See the question: 12628 ), and just as they also struggle with everything that has to do with the crucifixion and its details, which is the basis of their belief in redemption which they believe is the reason for the crucifixion , we say: as confusion is inevitable for everyone who turns away from the light of revelation that came down from Allah, similarly they are confused about the doctrine of redemption. \nDoes redemption mean saving all of mankind?\nDoes redemption mean saving all of mankind, as John says: \n“…Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.\nHe is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world” I John 2:1-2 (NIV) \nOr is it only for those who believe and are baptized: \n“Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned” Mark 16:16 (NIV)\nThe one who studies the life and sayings of the Messiah will see clearly that the call of the Messiah was addressed to the Children of Israel, and that throughout his mission he forbade his disciples to call anyone else. So salvation must have been only for them. This is what we see in the story of the Canaanite woman who said to him: \n“… ‘Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession.’\nJesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, ‘Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.’\nHe answered, ‘I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.’\nThe woman came and knelt before him. ‘Lord, help me!’ she said.\nHe replied, ‘It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.’”\nMatthew 15:22-26 – NIV\nThe Messiah did not heal the daughter of the Canaanite woman, although he was able to do so, so how could he redeem all of mankind? \nWas this salvation from the “original sin” of Adam only?\nWas this salvation from the “original sin” of Adam only, or does it include all of our sins? \nBut no one can bear the sin of anyone else, or redeem him with his own self, as Allah tells us in His Noble Book (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden; and if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin. You (O Muhammad) can warn only those who fear their Lord unseen and perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah). And he who purifies himself (from all kinds of sins), then he purifies only for the benefit of his own self. And to Allah is the (final) Return (of all).” [Fatir 35:18]\nThis is what the texts of their Bible also say: \n“The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.” Ezekiel 18:20-21-- NIV\nIs there an original sin?\nThere is no inherited sin (“original sin”): \n“If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin.\nHe who hates me hates my Father as well.\nIf I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father” John 15:22-24 – NIV\nWhen there is sin – whether a person has committed it himself or inherited it from Adam or from another of his forefathers – can this sin not be erased through repentance? \nThe people of heaven rejoice over the one who repents like the shepherd rejoices when he finds his lost sheep, and the woman rejoices over her lost penny when she finds it, and a father rejoices over his prodigal son when he returns: \n“I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.” (Luke 15:7)\nWill God accept our repentance?\nGod promises those who repent that their repentance will be accepted : \n“But if a wicked man turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, he will surely live; he will not die.\nNone of the offenses he has committed will be remembered against him. Because of the righteous things he has done, he will live.” Ezekiel 18:21-23 – NIV. See also Isaiah 55:7\nPutting one's trust in one’s lineage without repenting or doing righteous deeds is a kind of madness; if a person’s deeds slow him down, his lineage will not help him to speed up, as our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said. (Sahih Muslim, 2699) \nJohn the Baptist (Yahya – peace be upon him) taught you the same things: \n“You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.\nAnd do not think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.\nThe ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire” Matthew 3:7-10 – NIV\nForgiveness of sins through the sinner’s repentance is what befits the kind and merciful God – not sacrifice and crucifixion and the shedding of blood. This is what the Bible says: \n“I desire mercy, not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners (to repentance)” Matthew 9:13 – NIV\n(the words “to repentance” do not appear in the NIV but are present in the “King James” or “Authorized” translation of the Bible).\nHence Paul says: \n“Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.\nBlessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.” Romans 4:7-8 – NIV\nWe believe that if Allah had commanded some of His slaves to kill themselves in repentance from their sins, that would not be too much for them to do, and that would not contradict His being kind and merciful. He commanded the Children of Israel to do that when they asked to see God directly, but even then no one was to be killed for anyone else, rather a person was to be killed for his own sins, not for the sins of another. That was the heavy burden and fetters that were upon them (cf. al-A’raf 7:157), from which Allah has spared this ummah (nation/community).\nAnother matter that disproves the belief in original sin is the texts which mean that each person is responsible for his own actions, as Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Whosoever does a righteous good deed, it is for (the benefit of) his own self; and whosoever does evil, it is against his own self. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves” [Fussilat 41:46]\n“Every person is a pledge for what he has earned” [al-Muddaththir 74:38]\nSimilarly it says in your Bible: \n“Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you” Matthew 7:1-2 – NIV\n“For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done” Matthew 16:27 – NIV\nJesus affirmed the importance of righteous deeds\nThe Messiah affirmed the importance of righteous deeds, and said to his disciples: \n“Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.\nMany will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?'\nThen I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'” Matthew 7:21-22 – NIV\nSimilarly, he said: \n“The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.\nThey will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Matthew 13:41-42 – NIV\nHe did not tell them of redemption by which they would be saved from the reckoning. \nThose who do righteous deeds are the only ones who will be saved on the Day of Resurrection from the reckoning, whilst those who did evil deeds will be carried off to Hell, with no salvation by the Messiah or by anyone else: \n“… for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice\nand come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. John 5:28-29 – NIV  \n“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory…\nThen he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels’” Matthew 25:31-42 – NIV\nThe Messiah said to them: \n“You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?” Matthew 23:33 – NIV\nAdolf Hernck noted that the epistles of the Apostles did not include the idea of salvation by redemption, rather they suggested that salvation is attained by good deeds, as it says in the Epistle of James: \n“What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?\n… faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.\n… faith without deeds is useless (or dead).” James 2:14 – NIV\nAnd Peter says: \n“I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism\nbut accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right” Acts 10:34-35\nThere are many similar examples in the words of the Messiah and the disciples. \nAllah the Almighty has spoken the truth (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqun (the pious)]. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware” [Al-Hujurat 49:13]\nWhat is strange is that Paul himself, who abolished this teaching and said that deeds were to no avail, and that salvation is only by faith, affirmed the importance of righteous deeds on other occasions, such as when he said: \n“A man reaps what he sows\n… Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up” Galatians 6:7 – NIV  \n“and each will be rewarded according to his own labour” I Corinthians 3:8 – NIV\n(For more information on this matter see: Dr Mundhir al-Saqqar: Hal iftadana al-Masih ‘ala al-Salib) \nSo you have no way of resolving this contradiction unless you ignore your common sense and reasoning, and delude yourself with false wishes, as you do in the case of the doctrine of trinity and unity, which is what John R Stott advises you to do in his book Basic Christianity: I do not dare to deal with this subject, before I admit frankly that a great deal of it must remain a hidden mystery… I wonder how our weak minds cannot comprehend it fully, but there will inevitably come a day when the veil will be lifted and all mysteries will be resolved, and we will see the Messiah as he really is! \n… How is it possible that God was incarnated in Christ, whilst making Christ a sacrifice for our sin? I cannot answer this, but the Apostle himself places these two truths side by side and I accept the idea completely, just as I accept that Jesus the Nazarene is human and divine in one person… If we cannot resolve this contradiction or solve this mystery, we should accept the truth as proclaimed by Christ and his disciples, that he bore our sins.” (Basic Christianity, p. 110, 121, quoting from Dr Sa’ud al-Khalaf, al-Yahudiyyah wal-Nasraniyyah, p. 238) \nYes, you and we will see the Messiah as he really is, one of the slaves of Allah who are close to Him, and one of His prophets who were sent, on that Day when the veil will be lifted and he will disavow himself of all those who took him as a god besides Allah, or who attributed to him words that he did not say. At that time there were no mysteries or puzzles: \n“And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): ‘O ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours; truly, You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen).\n‘Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them; and You are a Witness to all things. (This is a great admonition and warning to the Christians of the whole world).\n‘If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You, are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’\nAllah will say: ‘This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth: theirs are Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise) — they shall abide therein forever. Allah is pleased with them and they with Him. That is the great success (Paradise).\nTo Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is therein, and He is Able to do all things.” [Al-Maidah 5:116-120]\nWill you think about it before it is too late? \n“Say (O Muhammad): ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allah (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah.’ Then, if they turn away, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims’” [Aal ‘Imran 3:64].\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of redemption is closely tied to repentance (tawbah) and the mercy of Allah (God). Here are some key points regarding redemption in Islam:\n\n1. **Repentance (Tawbah)**: Islam emphasizes that every individual can seek forgiveness from Allah for their sins and mistakes. Repentance is considered a sincere return to God, and it involves feeling remorse for the sin, stopping the sinful behavior, and making a firm intention not to return to it. \n\n2. **Allah’s Mercy**: The Quran describes Allah as the Most Merciful and Most Forgiving. One of the fundamental beliefs in Islam is that no matter how great one’s sins are, Allah's mercy encompasses all things. Many verses in the Quran encourage individuals to repent and assure them of Allah's readiness to forgive. For example, in Surah Az-Zumar (39:53), Allah invites believers to turn to Him with sincere repentance.\n\n3. **Conditions for Forgiveness**: For repentance to be accepted, it should be sincere. Scholars emphasize that there are conditions for repentance which include:\n   - Acknowledging the sin.\n   - Feeling genuine remorse.\n   - Stopping the sin immediately.\n   - Making a firm intention not to commit the sin again.\n   - If the sin involves the rights of others, making amends to them is also necessary.\n\n4. **Continuous Opportunity for Redemption**: Unlike some other faith traditions, Islam teaches that there is always an opportunity for individuals to seek forgiveness and attain redemption as long as they are sincere before their death. The concept of \"last minute\" repentance is especially emphasized, as long as it is genuine.\n\n5. **Salvation**: In terms of salvation, Islam teaches that salvation is attained through faith (iman) and righteous deeds (amal). Believers are encouraged to seek Allah’s forgiveness regularly and perform good deeds to earn His pleasure and mercy.\n\nOverall, redemption in Islam is accessible, and every individual is encouraged to take steps towards repentance and to always hope for Allah’s mercy."

        "question": "Jihad against the hypocrites",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Undoubtedly this is a problem from which the ummah suffers \n      from time to time, especially when it is faced with trials and \n      tribulations and these hypocrites feel secure and feel that they will not \n      be punished if they attack the foundations of this religion and try to \n      spread division and tribulation. \n\n    Undoubtedly the damage that these people do is greater than \n    that caused by the kuffaar whose kufr is obvious, as Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “They are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allaah curse \n    them! How are they denying (or deviating from) the Right Path?”\n\n    [al-Munaafiqoon 63:4]\nBecause of that, it is \n    prescribed to wage jihad against them and to treat them harshly. \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said concerning the Nusayris, among whom were some who expressed their kufr \n    and heresy openly and others who made a hypocritical show of loving Ahl \n    al-Bayt (the members of the Prophet’s household): \n\n    Undoubtedly waging jihad against these people and carrying \n    out the hadd punishments against them is one of the greatest acts of \n    obedience and most important obligatory actions. It is better than waging \n    jihad against those mushrikeen and people of the Book who do not fight the \n    Muslims, for waging jihad against these comes under the same heading as \n    waging jihad against the apostates. Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq and all the Sahaabah \n    started with jihad against the apostates before they engaged in jihad \n    against the kuffaar of the people of the Book, for jihad against these (the \n    apostates) is a means to protect the lands that are already under Muslim \n    rule, and to deter anyone who wants to apostatize. Jihad against the \n    mushrikeen and people of the Book who are not fighting us is an additional \n    manifestation of the power of this religion. Protecting the capital takes \n    precedence over making profit. \n\n    Moreover the harm that these people (hypocrites) cause to the \n    Muslims is greater than that caused by others (kaafirs), indeed their harm \n    is like that caused by the mushrikeen and people of the Book who fight the \n    Muslims. The damage that they do to the religious commitment of many people \n    is worse than the damage done by those mushrikeen and people of the Book who \n    wage war on us. Every Muslim must do as much as he can of his duty. It is \n    not permissible for anyone to keep quiet about anything that he knows about \n    them, rather he must broadcast it so that the Muslims will know what they \n    really are. It is not permissible for anyone to help them to remain among \n    the troops and government employees, or for anyone to keep quiet and refrain \n    from carrying out against them that which Allaah and His Messenger have \n    enjoined. It is not permissible for anyone to speak against carrying out \n    what Allaah and His Messenger have enjoined. This is one of the greatest \n    types of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and of striving \n    in jihad for the sake of Allaah. Allaah said to His Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O Prophet (Muhammad)! \n    Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh \n    against them”\n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:73]\n\n    These people are included in this phrase “the disbelievers \n    and the hypocrites”. \nThe one who helps to put \n    a stop to their evil and to guide them as much as he can will have of reward \n    that which is known only to Allaah, for the primary purpose is to guide them \n    as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“You (true believers in \n    Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah) \n    are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind”\n    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:110] \n\n    Abu Hurayrah said: You are the best of people for people, you \n    bring them in chains and fetters until they enter Islam. (al-Bukhaari, \n    4557). \nThe purpose of jihad and \n    of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, is to guide people to \n    what is best for them in this world and in the Hereafter, as much as \n    possible; then whomsoever Allaah guides will find happiness in this world \n    and in the Hereafter, and whomsoever He does not guide, his evil will be \n    contained. \n\n    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 35/159-160 \n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    said: \n\n    The Muslim ummah must respond in kind when it is attacked. So \n    with regard to those who fight Islam with ideas and words, we must explain \n    the falseness of what they say using rational evidence as well as shar’i \n    evidence, so that the falseness of what they say will become apparent. \n\n    With regard to those who fight Islam by economic means, we \n    must ward them off and attack them if possible, by using the same means with \n    which they attack Islam. We must explain that the best way to strengthen the \n    economy in a just manner is the Islamic way. \n\n    With regard to those who attack Islam with weapons, we must \n    resist them in a similar fashion. Hence Allaah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \n\n    “O Prophet (Muhammad)! Strive hard against the \n    disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh against them, their abode is \n    Hell, — and worst indeed is that destination”\n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:73]\nIt is well known that \n    jihad against the hypocrites is not like jihad against the kuffaar, because \n    jihad against the hypocrites is fought with knowledge and argument, whilst \n    jihad against the kuffaar is fought with swords and arrows. \n\n    Fataawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haraam, \n    p. 1733.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic terminology, \"jihad\" broadly refers to striving or struggling in the way of Allah. It encompasses a variety of meanings, including personal struggles to improve oneself, efforts to promote justice, and, in some contexts, armed struggle against oppression. \n\nThe term \"hypocrites\" (or \"munafiqun\" in Arabic) refers to those who outwardly profess Islam but do not genuinely believe in their hearts. The Qur'an addresses the issue of hypocrisy in several verses, highlighting that hypocrites can be more dangerous to the Muslim community than open enemies because they undermine faith from within.\n\nWhen discussing \"jihad against the hypocrites,\" it is important to clarify that:\n\n1. **Spiritual and Moral Struggle**: Much of the struggle against hypocrisy involves spiritual and moral striving—not physical violence. Muslims are encouraged to promote truth, sincerity, and good character and to address hypocrisy through education, personal behavior, and community leadership.\n\n2. **Community Cohesion**: Engaging with those who exhibit hypocritical behavior often means working towards unity and understanding within the community rather than physical confrontation. The emphasis is on outreach, correction, and guidance.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: In the early Islamic community, there were instances where the Prophet Muhammad and his companions dealt with individuals who were hypocritical in their allegiance to Islam. These situations were handled with care and often involved warnings, discussions, and calls to sincerity rather than outright conflict.\n\n4. **Interpretation and Application**: Different scholars and sects within Islam may interpret the nature and extent of jihad against hypocrites in various ways. Most contemporary scholars emphasize the importance of internal reflection, teaching, and community cohesion over any form of violent confrontation.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of jihad against hypocrites should be understood as a call for educational efforts, personal integrity, and community building rather than a directive for violence. It emphasizes the need for sincerity among Muslims and the importance of addressing issues within the community with wisdom and compassion."

        "question": "Types of ‘uboodiyyah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah and his family and companions. \nYou should note – may Allaah guide you to obey Him – that ‘uboodiyyah (servitude to Allaah) is of two types: a specific type and a general type. \n‘Uboodiyyah in the specific sense means the servitude of love, submission and obedience by which a person is honoured. This is what is referred to in verses such as the following (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Allaah is very Gracious and Kind to His slaves”\n[al-Shoora 42:19]\n“And the (faithful) slaves of the Most Gracious (Allaah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness”\n[al-Furqaan 25:63]\nThis kind of ‘uboodiyyah or servitude applies only to the believers who obey Allaah, and is not shared with the kuffaar who rebel against the laws, commands and prohibitions of Allaah. People vary greatly with regard to this servitude; the more a person loves Allaah, follows His commands and submits to His laws, the greater his servitude. The ones who achieved the highest level in this regard were the Prophets and Messengers, and the greatest of all was our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Hence no one is described as being a true slave of Allaah in the most complete sense in the Qur’aan except him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah describes him as His slave in the context of Revelation, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, Who has sent down to His slave (Muhammad) the Book (the Qur’aan), and has not placed therein any crookedness”\n[al-Kahf 18:1]\nAnd in the context of the Isra’ [Night Journey] (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allaah) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him]\nWho took His slave (Muhammad) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid Al-Haraam (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem)”\n[al-Isra’ 17:1]\nand in the context of supplication (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And when the slave of Allaah (Muhammad) stood up invoking Him (his Lord Allaah) in prayer they (the jinn) just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other (in order to listen to the Prophet’s recitation)”\n[al-Jinn 72:19]\nand there are other similar verses. \nAll honour is to be found in achieving this servitude in the fullest sense, which can only be achieved by acknowledging one’s complete dependence on Allaah and feeling completely independent of other people. This can only be achieved when a person combines love for Allaah with fear of Him and hope for His bounty and reward. \nWith regard to servitude in the general sense, no created being is excluded from this. It is called compulsory servitude. In this sense all people are slaves of Allaah and are subject to His rulings, and His decree is carried out on them. No one has the power to do harm or do good for himself except by the Leave of his Lord and Sovereign Who controls him. This is the kind of servitude that is referred to in verses such as the following (interpretation of the meaning): \n“There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allaah) as a slave”\n[Maryam 19:93]\nThis kind of servitude does not imply any kind of honour. Whoever turns away from the specific type of servitude mentioned above is still subjugated to servitude in the general sense, and cannot be excluded from that in any circumstances. All creatures are the slaves of Allaah by His will, so whoever does not want to be a slave of Allaah by choice is still a slave of Allaah by compulsion. \nWe ask Allaah to make us among His sincere slaves and close friends, for He is All-Hearing, Ever-Close and Ever Responsive. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon His slave Muhammad and upon all his family and companions. \nSee Mafaaheem yanbaghi an tusahhah by Shaykh Muhammad Qutb, 20-23, 174-182; al-‘Uboodiyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, \"‘uboodiyyah\" (عبودية) refers to servitude or worship of Allah. It encompasses various dimensions of one's relationship with the Creator. The concept of ‘uboodiyyah can be broadly classified into several types:\n\n1. **‘Uboodiyyah al-Ibadah (عبودية العبادة)**: This is the most common type and refers to the worship and acts of devotion performed by Muslims, such as prayer (Salah), fasting (Sawm), almsgiving (Zakat), and pilgrimage (Hajj). It encompasses all forms of worship that are mandated in Islam.\n\n2. **‘Uboodiyyah al-Khalq (عبودية الخلق)**: This refers to the servitude of all created beings to Allah. It acknowledges that every creature is under the dominion of Allah, whether they consciously worship Him or not. This type encompasses the belief that all of creation inherently submits to the will of Allah.\n\n3. **‘Uboodiyyah al-Hub (عبودية الحب)**: This form of servitude emphasizes love for Allah. It involves cultivating a deep affection for the Creator, leading believers to seek closeness to Him through sincere devotion and righteous actions.\n\n4. **‘Uboodiyyah al-Istighfar (عبودية الاستغفار)**: This type involves seeking forgiveness from Allah for one’s sins. It reflects the recognition of human imperfections and the need for divine mercy, emphasizing humility and repentance.\n\n5. **‘Uboodiyyah al-Tawakkul (عبودية التوكل)**: This aspect pertains to placing complete trust in Allah’s plans and provisions. It signifies reliance on Allah in all affairs of life, believing that He is the ultimate planner and sustainer.\n\n6. **‘Uboodiyyah al-Dhikr (عبودية الذكر)**: This is the remembrance of Allah, which involves constant reflection and mindfulness of Allah’s presence. It includes practices like reciting the Qur'an and engaging in supplications (du'a).\n\nThese types of ‘uboodiyyah highlight the multifaceted nature of worship in Islam, encompassing both formal acts of worship and the broader aspects of recognizing Allah's sovereignty and being in a state of servitude to Him in every aspect of life."

        "question": "He said that he committed zina with a woman but he was lying",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah to forgive your sin and to \n    conceal your fault, and to help you avoid temptations both obvious and \n    hidden. With regard to your question, it can be answered in the following \n    points: \n1 – It seems from your question that the one \n    whom you accused of committing forbidden actions is a specific woman whom \n    you and your cousin know. If it is a specific, known, woman, then this is \n    slander by you against her, which is a major sin and an abhorrent forbidden \n    action, because it is a slander against her honour and a transgression of \n    the limits set by Allaah. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said, as was narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him): “Avoid the seven sins that doom one to Hell.” They said: “O Messenger \n    of Allaah, what are they?” He said: “Associating others with Allaah (shirk), \n    witchcraft, killing a soul whom Allaah has forbidden us to kill, except when \n    it is lawful, consuming riba, consuming the orphan’s wealth, running away \n    from the battlefield, and slandering chaste believing women who never even \n    think of anything touching their chastity (cf. al-Noor 24:23).” Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari, no. 2615; Muslim, 89. \nAs well as slandering that woman, you are \n    also saying that you yourself committed zina, even if you are lying. \nBut if it is not a specific women, for \n    example you said, “I did such and such with a woman,” and did not refer to a \n    specific woman, then this is not regarded as slandering anyone, but you are \n    still saying that you committed zina for which a hadd punishment is \n    deserved, so you have to clear your own name.  \nIt says in Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’: If a \n    person says, “I committed zina with a woman, but I do not know who she \n    was,”, his confession is valid and he should be punished. Badaa’i’ \n    al-Sanaa’i’, 7/51 \n2 – If it is a specific woman, but you have \n    repented and regret what you did, part of your repentance is to tell others \n    that you were lying, so you have to tell your cousin that you were not \n    telling the truth, because you have to clear the name of that chaste woman. \n    It is not permissible for you to give precedence to the friendship with your \n    cousin by slandering the honour of a Muslim woman. \nIbn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: \nThe apparent meaning of Ahmad’s words \n    is that the repentance of the slanderer is to state that he was lying. So he \n    should say, “I was lying when I said that.” This is the view of al-Shaafa’i. \n    Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: Those who said that also include Sa’eed ibn \n    al-Musayyib, ‘Ata’, Tawoos, al-Shu’bi, Ishaaq, Abu ‘Ubayd and Abu Thawr.\n‘Abd al-Razzaaq narrated in al-Musannaf \n    (5/77) that Tawoos said: His repentance (i.e., the one who accused someone \n    of zina) is to say that he was lying. \n3 – You should note that the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever seeks the \n    pleasure of Allaah by angering people, Allaah will suffice him against \n    people, but whoever seeks to please people by angering Allaah, Allaah will \n    leave him to the people.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2414; classed as \n    saheeh by al-Albaani.\nThis hadeeth indicates that what you fear of \n    a bad relationship between you and your cousin is an insignificant matter. \n    Whoever obeys Allaah and seeks to please Him, Allaah will suffice him \n    against people. So you should care more about your relationship with your \n    Lord than your relationship with your cousin. Remember that this is one of \n    the trials with which Allaah tests you, so do what is right and put your \n    trust in Allaah, and do not fear the blame of anyone. Pray a great deal for \n    forgiveness, repent and make du’aa’ to Allaah, asking him to make you \n    steadfast in speaking the truth, and to reconcile you and your cousin, for \n    the hearts of men are between two of the fingers of the Most Merciful, and \n    He turns them however He wills. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, zina (fornication or adultery) is a serious offense, and admitting to it is a significant matter. If someone falsely claims to have committed zina, they may incur liability for falsehood and slander. \n\nAccording to Islamic jurisprudence, false accusations can lead to severe consequences, especially if it involves discrediting someone's honor or reputation. The person who falsely admitted to zina could be guilty of lying, which is prohibited in Islam. Additionally, if this false confession was made in an attempt to seek a punishment for themselves, it may reflect a misunderstanding of the severe consequences of such admissions within Islamic law.\n\nFor someone seeking forgiveness or counsel, it is important to clarify their intentions and circumstances to a knowledgeable and trustworthy person in the community or a qualified scholar (Ulama) to understand the proper steps for seeking repentance and rectifying the situation. It is always encouraged to seek forgiveness from Allah sincerely in such matters."

        "question": "Advice to a fortune teller who reads coffee cups",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This question involves two issues: \n1 – The ruling on this action. \nUndoubtedly fortunetelling, witchcraft and astrology are among the most serious of evil actions and corruption on earth and harming the Muslims unlawfully.  \nThe scholars differed as to whether the fortuneteller is to be regarded as a kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam, or whether it is a lesser form of kufr. Those who say that this makes him a kaafir quoted as evidence the hadeeth narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad (9171), which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever comes to a fortune-teller or soothsayer and believes him has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5942. \nThis also involves claiming to have knowledge of the unseen, and whoever claims to have knowledge of the unseen is a kaafir. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“(He Alone is) the All-Knower of the Ghayb (Unseen), and He reveals to none His Ghayb (Unseen).”\n27. Except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of the Unseen as much as He likes)” [al-Jinn 72:25-26]\n“Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allaah” [al-Naml 27:65]\n2 – Our advice to this woman who does this thing is that she should give it up and keep away from it, and repent to Allaah, because this action is one of the major sins that doom a person to Hell. She should fear Allaah and not annoy the Muslims by means of this evil action. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, they bear (on themselves) the crime of slander and plain sin” [al-Ahzaab 33:58]\nSo she has to repent to Allaah from this action before the Angel of Death comes to her suddenly and the time for regret is over. She has to turn to her Lord, in Whose hand is all benefit and harm, in all her affairs, and not let the Shaytaan trick her and lead her to Hell – we seek refuge in Allaah. \nHer actions are a source of temptation and trial to those Muslims who are weak in faith. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, those who put into trial the believing men and believing women (by torturing them and burning them), and then do not turn in repentance (to Allaah), then they will have the torment of Hell, and they will have the punishment of the burning Fire” [al-Burooj 85:10]\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nAstrology, palm-reading, reading coffee cups, divination, and other things practised by fortunetellers and practitioners of witchcraft are all sciences of jaahiliyyah which are forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger, and are actions which Islam came to declare false and warn against doing them or going to those who do them and asking them about anything or believing what they say – because that is knowledge of the unseen which Allaah has kept to Himself. \nOur advice to everyone who has anything to do with these things is to repent to Allaah and seek His forgiveness, and to put their trust in Allaah Alone in all their affairs, whilst also taking the appropriate means as prescribed or permitted in sharee’ah. They should give up these things and keep away from them, and beware of asking these people anything or believing them, in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and so as to protect their religious beliefs and commitment, and for fear of the anger of Allaah, and so as to keep away from the things that lead to shirk and kufr, which if a person dies believing such things he will be a loser in this world and in the Hereafter. Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 2/120-122 \nWe should also note here that whatever this woman takes in payment for this evil and haraam work is haraam income, because of the hadeeth narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (2237) and Saheeh Muslim (1567) from Abu Mas’ood al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the price of a dog, the wages of a prostitute and the payment made to a fortuneteller. \nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this hadeeth (10/490): Al-Baghawi, one of our companions, and al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said: the Muslims are agreed that the payment made to a fortuneteller is haraam, because it is payment for something forbidden, and because it consuming people’s wealth unlawfully.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, seeking knowledge of the unseen or attempting to predict the future through practices such as fortune-telling, astrology, or reading coffee cups is considered impermissible (haram). This is because such practices attribute knowledge of the unseen to individuals, which is solely reserved for Allah (SWT).\n\nIf you are advising a fortune teller or someone involved in such practices, it might be helpful to share the following points:\n\n1. **Tawhid (Oneness of Allah)**: Remind them that belief in Tawhid emphasizes that only Allah possesses knowledge of the unseen and controls all aspects of the future.\n\n2. **Hadith**: Refer to the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in which he discouraged seeking knowledge from soothsayers and fortune-tellers. For example, there is a hadith where he said, “Whoever goes to a fortune teller and asks him about anything, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days.” (Narrated by Muslim).\n\n3. **Encouragement toward Halal Alternatives**: Encourage them to seek halal means of earning a living and to engage in professions or activities that are permissible in Islam, such as counseling or other forms of guidance that do not involve haram practices.\n\n4. **Repentance**: Encourage them to seek forgiveness and turn back to Allah. Repentance (Tawbah) is always open, and individuals can seek to realign their actions with Islamic teachings.\n\n5. **Seek Knowledge**: Suggest that they invest their time in learning about Islam, which can provide both spiritual fulfillment and more beneficial means of guiding others.\n\nUltimately, the objective is to help them understand the teachings of Islam regarding these practices and to encourage them to seek a path that is pleasing to Allah."

        "question": "Will Disbelievers Enter Jannah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Will Disbelievers Enter Jannah? \nYou should note that all the disbelievers who hear the message of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and do not enter Islam will go to Hell . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, those who disbelieve (in the religion of Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad) from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al-Mushrikun will abide in the fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures.” [Al-Bayyinah 98:6]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one of this nation, Jew or Christian, hears of me then dies without having believed in that with which I was sent, but he will be one of the people of the Fire.” (Narrated by Muslim, 153)\nIll-Mannered conduct towards Allah\nThe point is not whether their morals are good , rather the point is whether they submit to Allah and obey his commands. Do you not see the Magians [Zoroastrians] or the Buddhists, for example, who worship fire or idols instead of Allah, and they do not worship Allah or submit to Him alone, and the Christians who say that God has a son, and other Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah). They are being ill-mannered towards Allah, and insulting and reviling Him. \nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah says, `The son of Adam denied Me and he had no right to do so. And he reviled Me and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: He will not remake me as He made me at first - and the initial creation [of him] is no easier for Me than remaking him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: Allah has taken to Himself a son, while I am the One, the Everlasting Refuge. I begot not nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4974) \nSo how can their morals be good when they are so ill-mannered towards Allah, even though Allah has given them hearing and sight, and has made everything easy for them, and has sent His Messengers to them and revealed His Books to them, and bestowed His blessings upon them, so it is His right that they should thank Him and not be ungrateful to Him or disbelieve in Him. If they do not do that then they deserve His punishment and wrath. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“and your Lord treats no one with injustice.” [Al-Kahf 18:49]\nThe fate of the children of disbelievers \nWith regard to the situation of their children who die when still young , Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz was asked about that and he said: \nIf one who is not yet accountable dies among non-Muslim parents , then he comes under the same rulings as them in this world, so he should not be washed and the funeral prayer should not be offered for him, and he should not be buried in the Muslim graveyard. \nBut in the Hereafter his case is referred to Allah. It was narrated in an authentic report that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about the children of the Mushrikin he said: “Allah knows best what they would have done.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1384)  \nSome of the scholars were of the view that Allah’s knowledge about them will be made manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and that they will be tested, as will the people who lived during the Fatrah (interval between two Prophets) and others . \nIf they do what they are told to do then they will enter Paradise, and if they disobey then they will enter Hell. There are authentic Hadiths from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which say that the people who lived during the Fatrah (interval between two Prophets) will be tested on the Day of Resurrection. These are the people whom the call of the Messengers did not reach and those who come under a similar ruling, such as the children of the Mushrikin, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).” [Al-Isra’ 17:15]\nThis is the most correct view among the various opinions concerning the people who lived during the Fatrah and others whom the call did not reach, and it is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim, and a number of the earlier and later generations. (Majmu` Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawwi`ah, 3/163-164)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, Jannah (Paradise) is reserved for those who have faith in Allah and follow the teachings of Islam. According to the majority of Islamic scholars, disbelievers (kuffar) will not enter Jannah. The Qur'an makes it clear that belief in Allah and His Messenger is a prerequisite for entering Paradise.\n\nFor example, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:254), it is stated that those who disbelieve in Allah's signs will face consequences. Similarly, Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:72) emphasizes that those who associate partners with Allah or deny His oneness will not attain Paradise.\n\nHowever, it is also important to note that Muslims believe in Allah's mercy and justice. Ultimately, the fate of individuals is in Allah's hands, and He knows what is in the hearts of all people. Some scholars hold that there may be exceptions based on Allah's overwhelming mercy, but the general teaching remains that disbelief excludes one from entering Jannah.\n\nFor a more nuanced understanding, it's always advisable to refer to scholarly interpretations and teachings from qualified scholars."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth is mawdoo’ (fabricated). It was narrated by al-Hakim via ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muslim al-Fahri (who said), Isma’eel ibn Muslimah narrated to us, ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam told us, from his father, from his grandfather, from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “When Adam committed his sin…” Then he quoted the hadeeth as the questioner quoted it. \nAl-Hakim said: The isnad (chain of narrators) of this hadeeth is saheeh. \nThis is what al-Hakim said! But a number of scholars rebuked him and denounced him for classing this hadeeth as saheeh. They ruled that this hadeeth is false and fabricated, and they pointed out that al-Hakim contradicted himself when commenting on this hadeeth. \nThere follow some of their comments: \nAl-Thahabi said, criticizing the words of al-Hakim quoted above: \nRather it is mawdoo’ (fabricated), and ‘Abd al-Rahman is not reliable, and I do not know who ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muslim al-Fahri is. \nAl-Thahabi also said in Meezan al-I’tidal: It is a false report. \nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar agreed with him in Lisan al-Meezan. \nAl-Bayhaqi said:  \n‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam is the only one who narrated it with this isnad, and he is da’eef (weak). Ibn Katheer agreed with him in al-Bidayah wa’l-Nihayyah, 2/323. \nAl-Albani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 25: (it is) mawdoo’. \nAl-Hakim himself (may Allah forgive him) accused ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd of being a fabricator of hadeeth, so how could his hadeeth be saheeh? \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Qa’idah al-Jaleelah fi’l-Tawassul wa’l-Waseelah (p. 69): \nAl-Hakim’s narration of this hadeeth is something for which he was denounced, and he himself said in his book al-Madkhil ila Ma’rifat al-Saheeh ‘an al-Saqeem:  \n‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam narrated fabricated hadeeths from his father, and it is obvious to any competent hadeeth scholar that he is the one to blame for fabricating hadeeths. I say: ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam is da’eef (weak) because he made a lot of mistakes.\n See Silsilat al-Ahadeeth al-Da’eefah by al-Albani, 1/38-47.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic literature, there are various narrations and interpretations regarding the events involving Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) and his relationship to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). One such narration is that Adam prayed for forgiveness by invoking the name of Muhammad.\n\nHowever, scholars have differing opinions regarding the authenticity of these narrations. Some scholars consider them to be weak or fabricated, while others may accept them with the understanding of their context. \n\nIt's important to note that the notion of praying through the virtue of the Prophet Muhammad is a debated topic among scholars and has its bases in some traditions, but the interpretation can vary widely. \n\nWhen discussing the narrations or Hadith concerning such topics, it's crucial to refer to reliable sources and scholarly interpretations, as well as to consult knowledgeable scholars for guidance. In Islam, authenticity of Hadith is a significant matter, and scholars have developed rigorous criteria to determine which Hadith are considered strong, weak, or fabricated. \n\nIf you seek more detailed information about specific Hadiths or interpretations related to Adam praying through the Prophet Muhammad, it is best to consult a qualified scholar or reputable Islamic literature."

        "question": "Intuition",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThe kashf (intuition, insight, finding out about things that are unseen) that may happen to a person is of several kinds. One type is psychological, which both Muslims and kaafirs have in common. Another kind is spiritual, which comes via revelation. A third type is satanic, which comes via the jinn.                                 \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: \nWe do not deny that people may experience some kind of kashf, whether when awake or in their dreams when the soul is less connected to the body, either by means of spiritual practices or otherwise. This is the psychological kashf which is the first type of kashf. \nBut it is also proven through rational evidence as well as shar’i evidence that the jinn exist and that they tell people things about the unseen, as happens in the case of soothsayers, those who are possessed and the like. \nThe second type is that which is done by outside forces, such as the jinn who tell the soothsayers many things. This is something that is well known, especially to those who have experienced it, and we have come to know about these things on many occasions. This is a type of kashf that has nothing to do with the first type, and this is the second type of kashf. \nWith regard to the third type, it is what is conveyed by the angels and this is the noblest type, as is indicated by the texts and by rational evidence. Information about the unseen may come from psychological sources, or from evil sources, whether they are satanic or not, or it may come from angelic sources. \nAl-Safadiyyah, p. 187-189 \nIbn al-Qayyim said: \nPartial kashf is something which both believers and kaafirs, righteous and immoral, may share, such as knowing what is in a person’s house or what is in his hand or under his garment, or whether his wife is pregnant with a boy or girl after the gender has been determined, or things that cannot be seen such as things that are taking place far away, and so on. This may come from the Shaytaan sometimes and from one's own self sometimes, hence it may happen to the kuffaar such as the Christians and people who worship fire or the cross. Ibn Sayyaad told by means of kashf the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) what he was hiding for him. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “You are from among the brethren of the soothsayers.” He told him that his kashf was like the kashf of the soothsayers. Similarly the liar Musaylimah, even though he was a kaafir of the worst type, could tell his companions of what one of them had done in his house and what he had said to his wife, because his shaytaan told him that so that he could mislead the people. The same was true of al-Aswad al-‘Anasi and al-Haarith al-Mutanabbi al-Dimashqi, who emerged at the time of ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan, and others of their ilk, whose numbers are known only to Allaah. We ourselves and others have seen a group of them and people have witnessed the kashf of monks who worship the cross, as is well known. \nSpiritual kashf of this type is like the kashf of Abu Bakr when he told ‘Aa’ishah that his wife was pregnant with a girl; and the kashf of ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he said, “O Saariyah, the mountain!” – i.e., stay close to the mountain. There are many such instances among the close friends (awliya’) of Allaah. \nMadaarij al-Saalikeen, 3/227, 228 \nSecondly: \nWhat happened to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) is saheeh and is well proven. Naafi’ said that ‘Umar sent out a military detachment and he appointed a man called Saariyah in charge of them. Whilst ‘Umar was delivering the khutbah one Friday, he said, “O Saariyah, the mountain! O Saariyah, the mountain!” And they found out that Saariyah had moved towards the mountain at that moment on the Friday even though there was the distance of a month’s journey between them. \nNarrated by Ahmad in Fadaa’il al-Sahaabah, 1/269; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1110 \nThis was a miracle (karaamah) bestowed upon ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him); either it happened by means of inspiration and his voice reached Saariyah – as is the view of Ibn al-Qayyim – or it happened by means of psychological kashf and his voice reached Saariyah – which is what we will see below in the words of Shaykh al-Albaani. In either case, it was undoubtedly a miracle (karaamah). \nThirdly: \nWith regard to what happens to the Sufis, it is not spiritual kashf, rather it is either psychological kashf which is something that they have in common with the kuffaar, or it is of satanic origin, which is usually the case. \nSpiritual kashf only happens to the close friends (awliya’) of Allaah who establish sharee’ah and venerate it. It is known that the Sufis do not do that. What happened to ‘Umar, although it is correct to describe it as kashf, was spiritual kashf. \nShaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nThere can be no doubt that the call mentioned was inspiration from Allaah to ‘Umar. That is nothing strange, because he was “muhaddath” (inspired) as was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but that does not mean that ‘Umar was shown the situation of the army or that he saw them with his own eyes. The use of this as evidence by some of the Sufis for the claims that they make about the awliya’ (“saints”) having kashf and that they can see what is in people’s hearts is utter falsehood. How can it be otherwise, when that is one of the unique attributes of the Lord of the Worlds Who alone has knowledge of the unseen and sees what is in people’s hearts? \nI wonder, how can they make such a false claim when Allaah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning): \n“(He Alone is) the All‑Knower of the Ghayb (Unseen), and He reveals to none His Ghayb (Unseen).\nExcept to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen”\n[al-Jinn 72:26-27]? \nDo they believe that those awliya’ are Messengers of Allaah so that it may be said of them that they can know the unseen as much as Allaah tells them?! Glory be to You (O Allaah)! This is a great lie (cf. al-Noor 24:16). \nThis story is saheeh and is proven. It was a miracle (karaamah) with which Allaah honoured ‘Umar, by means of which the Muslim army was saved from capture or destruction. But it does not mean that he had knowledge of the unseen, as the Sufis claim. Rather it was a kind of inspiration, in the sense defined in sharee’ah, or a kind of telepathy, which is not infallible. It may be correct, as in this incident, or it turn out to be wrong, as usually happens to people. Hence every close friend of Allaah (wali) must adhere to sharee’ah in everything that he does or says, lest he do something that goes against sharee’ah and thus lose the status of being a friend of Allaah, which Allaah has described in comprehensive terms when He said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“No doubt! Verily, the Awliyaa’ of Allaah, no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.\nThose who believed, and used to fear Allaah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds)”\n[Yoonus 10:63]\nAnd the poet said: \n“If you see a man flying through the air or walking on the water, but he does not adhere to the limits of sharee’ah,\nthen you should realize that this is a temptation which is leading him astray, and he is a man of bid’ah.” \nAl-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 3/102-104 \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, intuition can be understood as a form of inner knowing or insight that may guide an individual's understanding of spiritual matters or moral decisions. It is not specifically addressed as a distinct concept in Islamic texts, but it can be related to the broader understanding of human perception, reasoning, and the heart's understanding, as mentioned in the Qur'an and Hadith.\n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, intuition may be informed by one’s knowledge, experiences, and the guidance of Allah. It is often recommended that Muslims seek knowledge and wisdom through religious texts, scholarly advice, and prayer (du'a) to ensure that their intuitions align with Islamic teachings.\n\nIf you have a more specific question about intuition or its role in Islamic practice, please elaborate, and I would be happy to address it further!"

    {
        "question": "Conditions of Worship in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n“Firstly: the worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah in its reasons. Any person who worships Allah by doing an act of worship that is not done for a reason proven in Shari`ah is doing an act of worship that will be rejected and is not enjoined by Allah and His Messenger. \n\nAn example of that is celebrating the Mawlid or birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or celebrating the twenty-seventh night of Rajab, claiming that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on that night. This is not in accordance with Shari`ah so it is to be rejected. \n\nThere is no historical proof that the Mi'raj (ascent into heaven) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took place on the twenty-seventh night of Rajab. The books of hadith that we have do not contain even a single letter that indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on the twenty-seventh night of Rajab. It is known that this is the kind of information that cannot be accepted without sound isnads.\nEven if it were proven, do we have the right to innovate some kinds of worship on that date or to make it a festival? Not at all. Hence when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah and saw that the Ansar had two days on which they would play, he said: “Allah has replaced these for you with something better,” and he mentioned to them ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha. This indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked any festival to be innovated in Islam apart from the Islamic festivals, of which there are three: the two annual ‘Eids, which are ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha, and the weekly festival which is Friday. Even if it were proven that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on the twenty-seventh of Rajab – which it is impossible to prove – we cannot innovate anything on that occasion without the permission of the Lawgiver.\n\nAs I have said to you, bid’ah (innovation) is a serious matter which has a bad effect on the heart even if a person feels softness in his heart at that moment. For the matter will subsequently be the opposite, because if the heart rejoices in falsehood, that joy will not last, rather it will be followed by pain and regret. Every bid’ah is serious because it implies criticism of the Messenger, because this bid’ah implies that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not bring the complete Shari`ah, even though Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion” [Al-Maidah 5:3]\nIt is strange that you find some of those who indulge in these innovations strongly urge people to follow them, but they are negligent about matters which are more beneficial, more sound and more useful. \nHence we say that celebrating the night of the twenty-seventh of Rajab as the night in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven is a bid’ah, because it is based on something that is not mentioned in Shari`ah. \n\nSecondly: the act of worship should be in accordance with Shari`ah in its type or nature.\n\nFor example, if a person were to sacrifice a horse, that would be contrary to the Shari`ah in the nature of the action. Because a sacrifice can only involve an animal of the an'am class, namely a camel, a cow or a sheep. \n\nThirdly: the act of worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah in its amount. If someone were to say that he was going to pray Zuhr as six rak'ahs, would this act of worship be in accordance with Shari`ah? Not at all, because it is not in accordance with it in terms of the amount or number. If someone were to say Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah), al-Hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah) and Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great) thirty-five times following a prescribed prayer, would this be correct? The answer is that if your aim is to worship Allah by saying it this number of times because you believe this is the proper way, then you are mistaken. If you deliberately add something to what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has prescribed, but you believe that the proper way prescribed in Islam is thirty-three, then the extras are fine, because you are not suggesting that the higher number is the proper way that is prescribed. \nFourthly: The act of worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah in how it is done. \n\nIf a person does an act of worship that is acceptable in its type, amount and reason, but he goes against Shari`ah in the manner in which he does it, then it is not valid. For example, a man breaks wind etc. and does wudu, but he washes his feet and then wipes his head, then washes his hands, then washes his face – is his wudu valid? Not at all, because he has gone against Shari`ah in the way in which he did it. \n\nFifthly: the act of worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah with regard to its timing. \n\nFor example, if a person fasts Ramadan in Sha’ban, or in Shawwal, or he prays Zuhr before the sun has passed its zenith, or after the shadow of an object becomes equal in length to it – because if he prays before the sun has passed its zenith he is praying before the time has come, and if he prays after the shadow of an object becomes equal in length to it he is praying after the time has gone –his prayer is not valid. \nHence we say that if a person deliberately does not pray until the time for that prayer is over, with no valid excuse, his prayer will not be accepted even if he prays a thousand times. Hence we follow an important principle in this regard which is that in the case of every act of worship that is to be done at a certain time, if a person does it outside of the proper time with no valid excuse, it will not be accepted, rather it will be rejected. \nThe evidence for that is the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected. \n\nSixthly: the act of worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done. \n\nIf a person stands in Muzdalifah on the day of ‘Arafah, this standing is not valid, because the act of worship is not in accordance with Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done. Similarly, for example, if a person were to do i'tikaf in his own house, that would not be valid, because the place of i'tikaf is the mosque. Hence it is not valid for a woman to do i'tikaf in her house, because this is not the place for i’tikaf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw some of his wives had set up tents in the mosque; he told them to take them down and not to do i’tikaf, but he did not tell them to do i'tikaf in their houses. This indicates that the women should not do i'tikaf in their houses because that goes against Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done. \nSo with regard to these six factors, an act of worship is not regarded as following Shari`ah unless it combines all six: \n\nReason\nType\nAmount\nManner\nTime\nPlace\n\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the conditions of worship (ibadah) are guidelines that help ensure that acts of worship are performed in alignment with Islamic teachings. The fundamental conditions can be categorized into two main areas: **conditions of the act of worship itself** and **conditions for the worshiper**. \n\n### 1. Conditions of the Act of Worship:\n\n- **Intention (Niyyah)**: The worshiper must have a sincere intention to worship Allah. The intention must be made in the heart, and it is not necessary to verbally express it.\n\n- **Conformity to Sunnah**: The act of worship must conform to the teachings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This means following the way it was prescribed and performed.\n\n- **Correctness (Sihhah)**: The act must be performed correctly according to its rules and regulations. Ignorance or negligence in performing the act of worship can invalidate it.\n\n- **Appropriate Timing**: Some acts of worship, like the five daily prayers (Salah), have specific times during which they must be performed. Performing them outside of these times can render the act invalid.\n\n- **Purity**: Certain acts of worship, such as Salah, require physical purity. This includes being in a state of Wudu (ablution) and, for men, being free of major impurities (Janaabah). \n\n### 2. Conditions for the Worshiper:\n\n- **Faith (Iman)**: The worshiper must be a believer in Allah and His Messenger. Disbelief invalidates acts of worship.\n\n- **Islam (Submission)**: The worshiper must be a Muslim, meaning someone who has submitted to the will of Allah. Non-Muslims are not obligated to perform certain acts of worship.\n\n- **Rationality (Aql)**: The individual must be of sound mind. Acts of worship are not obligatory for those who are mentally incapacitated or insane.\n\n- **Maturity (Bulugh)**: Generally, acts of worship become obligatory upon reaching the age of maturity (puberty). Prior to this, children may be encouraged to perform them, but they are not held accountable.\n\n- **Freedom from Major Hindrances**: The worshiper should not be prevented from worship by valid legal reasons (e.g., being in a state of travel, illness).\n\nThese conditions highlight the importance of sincerity, knowledge, and adherence to the prescribed methods in Islam. Muslims are encouraged to seek knowledge about the correct performance of their acts of worship to ensure that they fulfill these conditions."

        "question": "Studying in a Catholic school",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Undoubtedly these schools pose a great danger to the Muslim \n    who is ignorant of Islam and its teachings, because they give lessons and \n    teach information in which there is approval and praise of the kaafirs and \n    their religions and beliefs, and usually attack Islam and condemn the \n    Muslims. But if the student in these schools has a sound understanding of \n    the beliefs of Islam, and knows the pillars of Islam and what is halaal and \n    what is haraam in Islam, and he needs to go to such a school in order to \n    learn a skill or profession or a gain specific knowledge, and he is \n    confident that he will not be influenced by their lessons and teachers, and \n    he will not be forced to learn any of the subjects that have to do with \n    Catholicism, then in that case we think that it is o.k. for him to study \n    there. Rather we worry about one who is ignorant and does not understand the \n    plots of the kaafirs and their tricks against the Muslims. But whoever is \n    confident and adheres to the beliefs and practices of Islam, then usually \n    such a person would not be affected by their teachings and practice.",
        "predicted_answer": "Studying in a Catholic school as a Muslim can be a topic of concern for some individuals and families. Here are some key considerations:\n\n1. **Intention and Purpose**: If the intention behind attending a Catholic school is to receive a quality education and there are no other suitable options available, it may be permissible. It's essential to weigh the benefits against any potential drawbacks.\n\n2. **Faith and Beliefs**: A Muslim student should be mindful of their own faith and beliefs. Engaging with different religious teachings can provide opportunities for interfaith dialogue, but it's crucial to maintain one's identity and beliefs without compromising them.\n\n3. **Education Environment**: Catholic schools often promote moral values and ethics, which can be beneficial. Parents and students should assess whether the school's environment is respectful and accepting of diversity, including different religious beliefs.\n\n4. **Extracurricular Activities**: Participation in school activities related to Catholic teachings may require careful consideration. It’s advisable to avoid activities that contradict Islamic teachings.\n\n5. **Family and Community Support**: It's important to have support from family and the Muslim community to navigate any challenges that may arise and to reinforce one’s own beliefs.\n\nUltimately, the decision to study in a Catholic school should be made after thoughtful consideration of the above factors, and families should seek guidance from knowledgeable individuals within their community if they feel uncertain."

        "question": "Ruling on a believer who commits some sins",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    If believers die believing in Allaah but having committed \n    sins less than major shirk that puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, one \n    of two scenarios may apply: \n\n    1 – they repented from those sins during their lives. If they \n    repented sincerely, Allaah will accept that from them, and they will once \n    again become like those who did not commit any sin, and they will not be \n    punished for their sins in the Hereafter. Indeed, their Lord may honour them \n    and turn their bad deeds (sayi’aat) into good deeds (hasanaat). \n\n    2 – those who die without having repented from their sins, or \n    whose repentance was imperfect and did not meet the required conditions, or \n    their repentance was not accepted. What is proven in the verses of the \n    Qur’aan and the Sunnah of the Prophet, and on which the righteous salaf was \n    agreed is that these – the sinners among those who believe in Tawheed (the \n    oneness of Allaah) – fall into three categories: \n\n    The first category: People who \n    have many hasanaat (good deeds) to their credit, which outweigh these \n    sayi’aat (bad deeds). Allaah will forgive them for their bad deeds and admit \n    them to Paradise. The Fire will never touch them, as a kindness and blessing \n    from Allaah. According to a hadeeth narrated by Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him), the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said:  “Allaah will bring the believer close and will shelter him with \n    His screen, then He will say, ‘Do you remember such and such a sin? Do you \n    remember such and such a sin?’ and he will say, ‘Yes, O Lord,’ until He \n    makes him confess his sins and he thinks that he is doomed. Then [Allaah] \n    will say, ‘I concealed it for you in the world and I forgive you for it \n    today.’ Then he will be given the book of his good deeds (hasanaat). But as \n    for the kaafir and the hypocrite, the witnesses will say, ‘These are the \n    ones who lied against their Lord!’ No doubt! the curse of Allaah is upon the \n    zaalimoon (wrongdoers) [cf. Hood 11:18].’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2441; \n    Muslim, 2768). \n\n    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “So as for those whose Scale (of good deeds) will be \n    heavy, they will be the successful (by entering Paradise)”[al-A’raaf 7:8]\n\n    “Then as for him whose Balance (of good deeds) will be \n    heavy, \n\n    He will live a pleasant life (in Paradise)”[al-Qaari’ah \n    101:6-7]\n\n    The second category: people \n    whose hasanaat and sayi’aat are equal, so their sayi’aat are enough to keep \n    them away from Paradise, but their hasanaat are enough to save them from \n    Hell. These are the people of al-A’raaf (a wall with elevated places) whom \n    Allaah says will stand between Paradise and Hell as long as Allaah wills, \n    then they will be granted permission to enter Paradise, as Allaah says after \n    telling us of the entrance of the people of Paradise to Paradise and the \n    people of Hell to Hell. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And between them will be a (barrier) screen and on \n    Al-A‘raaf (a wall with elevated places) will be men (whose good and evil \n    deeds would be equal in Scale), who would recognise all (of the Paradise and \n    Hell people), by their marks (the dwellers of Paradise by their white faces \n    and the dwellers of Hell by their black faces). And they will call out to \n    the dwellers of Paradise, ‘Salaamun ‘Alaykum’ (peace be on you), and at that \n    time they (men on Al-A‘raaf) will not yet have entered it (Paradise), but \n    they will hope to enter (it) with certainty.\n\n    And when their eyes will be turned towards the dwellers of \n    the Fire, they will say: ‘Our Lord! Place us not with the people who are \n    Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers).’\n\n     And the men on Al-A‘raaf (the wall) will call unto the \n    men whom they would recognise by their marks, saying: ‘Of what benefit to \n    you were your great numbers (and hoards of wealth), and your arrogance \n    (against Faith)?’\n\n    Are they those, of whom you swore that Allaah would never \n    show them mercy. (Behold! It has been said to them): ‘Enter Paradise, no \n    fear shall be on you, nor shall you grieve’”[al-A’raaf 7:46-39]\n\n    The third category:  People who \n    will meet Allaah persisting in committing major sins and acts of immorality, \n    so their sayi’aat will outweigh their hasanaat. These are the ones who will \n    deserve to enter Hell in a manner commensurate with their sins. Some of them \n    will be seized by the Fire as far as their ankles, some up to mid-calf, some \n    up to their knees, and for some only the mark of sujood will be spared. \n    These are the ones whom Allaah will permit to be brought forth from the Fire \n    because of the intercession of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him). He, all the Prophets, the angels, the believers and \n    whoever else Allaah wishes to honour will intercede for them. Whoever among \n    these sinners has more faith and committed less sins will have a lighter \n    punishment and remain in Hell for a shorter period and will be brought forth \n    sooner. Those whose sins were greater and whose faith was weaker, will have \n    a greater punishment and will remain for longer. We ask Allaah to keep us \n    safe and sound from all evils. \n\n    This is the situation of the sinful believers in the \n    Hereafter. \n\n    With regard to this world, so long as they do not do anything \n    that would put them beyond the pale of Islam, then they are believers whose \n    faith is lacking, as the righteous salaf agreed, basing that on the verses \n    of the Qur’aan and the ahaadeeth of the Prophet. These aayahs include: \n\n    “But if the killer is forgiven by the brother (or the \n    relatives) of the killed against blood money, then adhering to it with \n    fairness and payment of the blood money to the heir should be made in \n    fairness”\n\n    [al-Baqarah 2:178 – interpretation of the meaning]\n\n    So Allaah describes the killer as the brother of the heirs of \n    the victim. This brotherhood is the brotherhood of faith, which indicates \n    that the killer is not regarded as a kaafir, even though killing a believer \n    is one of the most serious of major sins. \n\n    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And if two parties (or groups) among the believers fall \n    to fighting, then make peace between them both. But if one of them outrages \n    against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which outrages \n    till it complies with the Command of Allaah. Then if it complies, then make \n    reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily, Allaah loves \n    those who are the equitable.\n\n    The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic \n    religion). So make reconciliation between your brothers, and fear Allaah, \n    that you may receive mercy”[al-Hujuraat 49:9-10]\n\n    So Allaah described each of the fighting parties as \n    believers, even though fighting is a major sin. Indeed, He described the \n    ones who reconcile between them as being their brothers, which indicates \n    that the one who commits a major sin which does not reach the degree of \n    shirk and kufr is still regarded as a believer and comes under the rulings \n    on believers, but he is lacking in faith. In this way the shar’i texts may \n    be reconciled and support one another. And Allaah knows best. \n\n    See A’laam al-Sunnah al-Manshoorah, 212; Sharh \n    al-‘Aqeedah al-Waasitiyyah by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/238.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the understanding of sin and the believer's status is nuanced. All human beings are fallible and prone to sin, as indicated in various teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who stated that every son of Adam commits sin, and the best of those who sin are those who repent.\n\n1. **Nature of Believers**: A believer is someone who has faith in Allah and strives to uphold the tenets of Islam. However, being a believer does not mean being free from sin. It is part of human nature to err.\n\n2. **Types of Sins**: Sins in Islam are categorized as major (kabair) and minor (saghair). Major sins, such as shirk (associating partners with Allah), murder, and theft, have more severe consequences, while minor sins may be forgiven through good deeds, remembrance of Allah, and sincere repentance.\n\n3. **Repentance (Tawbah)**: Islam emphasizes the importance of repentance. A believer who commits sins should sincerely repent by feeling remorse, stopping the sinful action, and intending not to commit it again. Allah's mercy is vast, and sincere repentance can lead to forgiveness.\n\n4. **Consequences**: While sins can affect one's relationship with Allah and may carry worldly ramifications (such as social consequences), a sinner who believes and repents remains within the fold of Islam. The key is the believer's intention to seek forgiveness, return to righteousness, and strive to do good.\n\n5. **Hope in Allah's Mercy**: The Quran assures believers of Allah's mercy (Surah Az-Zumar 39:53), encouraging them not to despair but rather to seek forgiveness. Believers are urged to maintain hope and consistently turn to Allah.\n\nIn summary, committing sins does not remove someone from the status of being a believer, provided they continue to have faith in Allah, strive for goodness, and seek forgiveness for their wrongdoings. It is crucial to remember that Allah is the Most Merciful and Forgiving, ready to accept the repentant sinner."

        "question": "Conditions of righteous deeds",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.An action cannot be an act of worship unless it includes two things: complete love and complete humility. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else)” [al-Baqarah 2:165] \n“Verily, those who live in awe for fear of their Lord” [al-Mu’minoon 23:57]\nAnd Allah mentions them together in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us” [al-Anbiya’ 21:90]\nOnce this is understood, we will realize that worship can only be accepted from a Muslim who believes in Allah alone (Tawheed), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust” [al-Furqaan 25:23]\nIn Saheeh Muslim (214) it is narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, during the Jaahiliyyah, Ibn Jud’aan used to uphold the ties of kinship and feed the poor. Will that avail him anything?’ He said, ‘It will not avail him anything because he never said, “O Allah, forgive me my sins on the Day of Judgement”’” – i.e., he did not believe in the resurrection or do good deeds hoping to meet Allah. \nMoreover, the Muslim’s worship will not be accepted unless it meets two basic conditions: \n1 – Sincerity of intention towards Allah, which means that the person’s intention in all his words and deeds, both outward and inward, is to seek the pleasure of Allah and none other. \n2 – It should be in accordance with the sharee’ah which Allah has prescribed, and he should not worship Allah in any other way. That is achieved by following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and what he brought, and shunning anything that goes against it, and not inventing any new form of worship that has not been narrated in sound reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nThe evidence for these two conditions is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \n“So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord” [al-Kahf 18:110]\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “ ‘So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord’ means his reward; ‘let him work righteousness’ means, that which is in accordance with the laws of Allah; ‘and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord’ this means seeking the Face of Allah alone, with no partner or associate. These two conditions are the basis of acceptable deeds, which must be sincerely for the sake of Allah alone and correct according to the sharee’ah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, for deeds to be considered righteous and acceptable to Allah, they must generally meet two key conditions:\n\n1. **Sincerity (Ikhlas)**: The intention behind the action must be purely for the sake of Allah (SWT). This means that the individual performs the deed out of devotion and seeks Allah’s pleasure rather than acting for show or to gain praise from others.\n\n2. **Following the Sunnah**: The action must be in accordance with the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the principles outlined in the Qur'an. This means that it should align with Islamic teachings and not deviate from the prescribed rituals and laws.\n\nIn addition to these two main conditions, scholars also emphasize the importance of fulfilling certain requirements related to actions:\n\n- **Proper knowledge**: Understanding the action being taken and ensuring it is performed correctly according to Islamic guidelines.\n- **Following the obligatory acts**: Engaging in actions that are obligatory before focusing on voluntary or supererogatory acts.\n- **Consistency and perseverance**: Regularly performing good deeds, even if they are few.\n\nBy adhering to these conditions, a Muslim ensures that their deeds are righteous in the eyes of Allah and beneficial for their spiritual growth."

        "question": "It is mustahabb to isolate oneself at times of tribulation when the Muslim fears he may lose his religious commitment",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Commentary on the hadeeth. \nThis hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari in a number of places in his Saheeh, such as (7088) Kitaab al-Fitan, where he narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Soon there will come a time when the best wealth a Muslim will have will be sheep which he will take to the mountaintops and places where rain falls, fleeing for the sake of his religious commitment from tribulation.” And Muslim narrated a similar hadeeth in his Saheeh (1888), also from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him), which says that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “Which of the people is best?” He said, “A man who strives in jihad for the sake of Allaah with his wealth and his self.” He asked, “Then who?” He said, “A believer in a mountain pass who worships Allaah and leaves the people alone.” \nThe word sha’af [in the second hadeeth] means a mountaintop. The word shi’b [in the first hadeeth] means a gap or pass between two mountains. Al- Nawawi said in Sharh Saheeh Muslim (13/34): “This does not mean the mountain pass itself, rather what is referred to is being alone and isolating oneself. A mountain pass is mentioned as a metaphor because it is usually devoid of people.” \nThe hadeeth indicates that it is preferable to isolate oneself from people and not mix with them in cases where a Muslim fears for his religious commitment because of widespread tribulation, where if he mixes with people he cannot be sure that his religious commitment will be safe and that he will not apostatize or deviate from the truth, or fall into shirk or abandon the basic principles and pillars of Islam, and so on. \nAl-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (13/42):  “This report indicates that isolation is preferable in the case of one who fears for his religious commitment.” \nAl-Sindi said in his footnotes on al-Nasaa’i (8/124): “This shows that it is permissible to isolate oneself, indeed it is preferable at times of tribulation.” \nIn the second hadeeth quoted above the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) mentioned the believer who isolates himself second in virtue only to the mujaahid who fights for the sake of Allaah. Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (6/6): “The believer who isolates himself is second in virtue only to the mujaahid because the one who mixes with people cannot guarantee that he will not commit sin, and these sins may be greater in number than the hasanaat (rewards for good deeds) that he gains as a result of mixing with people. But being isolated is regarded as preferable only in cases where there is tribulation.” \nAs for isolating oneself at times other than times of tribulation when a Muslim fears for his religious commitment, the scholars differed in their views in this case. The majority said that mixing with people is preferable to withdrawing from them, and they quoted several texts as evidence for that, including the following: \n1 – That this was the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Prophets before him (peace be upon them), and the majority of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). (Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi, 13/34). \n2 – The report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (5207) and Ibn Maajah (4032), which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The believer who mixes with people and patiently bears their annoyance will have a greater reward than the believer who does not mix with people and patiently bear their annoyance.” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2035). \nAl-Sindi said in his footnote on Ibn Maajah (2/493): “This hadeeth indicates that the one who is patient and mixes with people is better than the one who isolates himself.” \nAl-San’aani said in Subul al-Salaam (4/416): “This indicates that mixing with people whereby one enjoins what is good and forbids what is evil and deals with them in a good manner is better than keeping away from them and not putting up with mixing with them.” \n3 – The report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1574) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “One of the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came upon a mountain pass where there was a small spring of fresh water, which delighted him because it was so good. He said, ‘What if I were to withdraw from the people and settle in this mountain pass? But I will not do it until I seek the permission of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ So he mentioned it to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: ‘Do not do that, for if any one of you remains striving for the sake of Allaah, it is better than praying in His House for seventy years. Do you not want Allaah to forgive you and admit you to Paradise? Fight in Allaah's cause. He who fights in Allaah's cause as long as the time between two milkings of a she-camel will be assured of Paradise.’” (It was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1348). \nThe benefits that the Muslim gains by mixing with people for legitimate shar’i purposes, include establishing the rituals of Islam, increasing the number of the Muslims, spreading all kinds of goodness among them by helping and aiding them etc., attending Jumu’ah (Friday) prayers and prayers in congregation, attending funerals, visiting the sick, attending dhikr circles, etc. (Fath al-Baari, 13/43); Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi, 13/34).  \nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and all his family and companions, and grant them peace.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is viewed as mustahabb (recommended) for individuals to isolate themselves during times of tribulation or testing when they fear losing their religious commitment. This practice aligns with the Islamic principle of preserving one's faith and maintaining one's connection with Allah. \n\nIsolation in this context does not mean complete withdrawal from society, but rather finding a space for contemplation, prayer, and reflection, away from distractions that might lead one astray. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) himself sought solitude for deep reflection and prayer, especially during times of distress.\n\nAdditionally, during such times, it is encouraged to increase acts of worship, engage in dua (supplication), and seek knowledge that strengthens one’s faith. The ultimate goal is to seek Allah’s guidance and support, thereby reinforcing one’s commitment to the values and teachings of Islam. \n\nHowever, it is also important to remember that Islam encourages community and support among believers, so balancing isolation with seeking help and advice from trusted companions or scholars can also be beneficial."

        "question": "The view of Ahl al-Sunnah towards the Sahaabah and the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.One of the basic principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah is that they have nothing against the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and they do not say anything against them. Their hearts are free of any hatred, resentment and rancour (towards them) and they do not say anything (about them) that is not appropriate or befitting, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And those who came after them say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful’”[Al-Hashr :10]\nAnd they obey the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “Do not revile my companions, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend in charity gold equal to the size of Mount Uhud, he would not achieve the status of one of them, or even come halfway.” (narrated by al-Bukhari, 3637; Muslim, 2541).\nOne of the basic principles of Ahl al-Sunnah is that they accept that which has been narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and the consensus of the scholars, concerning the virtues and status (of the Sahaabah). They give precedence to those who spent and fought before the victory – the treaty of al-Hudaybiyah – over those who spent and fought afterwards, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Not equal among you are those who spent and fought before the Victory. Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all Allah has promised the best (reward). And Allah is All-Aware of what you do” [Al-Hadeed 57:10]\nThey give precedence to the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And the foremost to embrace Islam of the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success”\n[Al-Tawbah 9:100.] So the aayah gives precedence to the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar.\nThey believe that Allah said concerning the people of Badr – who numbered three hundred and umpteen – “Do whatever you like, for I have forgiven you,” because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Maybe Allah looked at the people of Badr and said, ‘Do whatever you like, for I have forgiven you.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3007; Muslim, 2494 - from the hadith of ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib) \nThey believe that no-one who gave the oath of allegiance (bay’ah) under the tree will enter Hell, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said. Rather Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and they numbered more than one thousand and four hundred. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they gave the Bay‘ah (pledge) to you (O Muhammad) under the tree, He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down As-Sakeenah (calmness and tranquillity) upon them, and He rewarded them with a near victory”[Al-Fath 48:18]\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In sha Allah, no one among the companions of the tree, those who gave their oath of allegiance beneath the tree, will enter Hell.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2496). Among those who pledged allegiance beneath the tree were Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with them all. \nAnd they (Ahl al-Sunnah) bear witness that those will enter Paradise who the Messenger of Allah bore witness that they would enter, such as the ten (who were given the glad tidings of Paradise), and Thaabit ibn Qays ibn Shammaas, and others among the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Abu Bakr will be in Paradise, ‘Umar will be in Paradise, ‘Uthmaan will be in Paradise, ‘Ali will be in Paradise, Talhah will be in Paradise, al-Zubayr will be in Paradise, ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf will be in Paradise, Sa’d will be in Paradise, Sa’eed will be in Paradise and Abu ‘Ubaydah ibn al-Jarraah will be in Paradise.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4649; al-Tirmidhi, 3747; classed as saheeh by al-Albani). \nThey affirm that which has been narrated in mutawaatir reports from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) and others, that the best among this ummah after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar. It was narrated that Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah said: “I said to my father (‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib), ‘Which of the people is the best after the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?’ He said, ‘Abu Bakr.’ I asked, ‘Then who?’ He said, ‘ ‘Umar.’ I was worried that he would say ‘Uthmaan, so I said, ‘Then is it you?’ He said, ‘I am just a man among the Muslims.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3671). So they (Ahl al-Sunnah) list ‘Uthmaan as the third and ‘Ali as the fourth, may Allah be pleased with them. \nSee al-Waasitiyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, with commentary. \nSecondly: it is part of the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah that the most deserving of the people to succeed the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him). The evidence for the leadership of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) is as follows: \n1 – It was narrated from Muhammad ibn Jubayr ibn Mut’im that his father said: “A woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he told her to come back later. She said, ‘What if I come back and do not find you?’ as if she was referring to death. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘If you do not find me, then go to Abu Bakr.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3659). \n2 – It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Take as your leaders those who come after me, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3805; classed as saheeh by al-Albani). \n3 – It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whilst I was standing by a well, drawing water from it, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar came. Abu Bakr took the bucket and drew one or two buckets, but there was some weakness in his drawing. May Allah forgive him. Then ‘Umar bin Al-Khattaab came and the bucket turned into a very large one in his hands. I had never seen such a mighty person as he in doing such hard work till all the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels that knelt down there.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3676).  \nIbn Hajar said in his commentary on this hadith: \n“Whilst I was standing by a well” means, in a dream. “Drawing water from it” means, filling a bucket with water. “He drew one or two buckets (dhanooban aw dhanoobayn)”: dhanoob refers to a large bucket when it is full of water. It seems to me that this refers to the major conquests which took place during his reign (as khaleefah), which numbered three. Hence the hadith does not refer to the number of buckets in the case of ‘Umar, rather it describes his drawing of water as ‘mighty’, referring to the many conquests that would occur during his reign as khaleefah. And Allah knows best. \nAl-Shaafa’i mentioned the interpretation of this hadith in al-Umm, where after quoting it he said: The meaning of the phrase “but there was some weakness in his drawing” is that his time of leadership was short, because of his untimely death and the fact that the war against the apostates (ahl al-riddah) kept him from reaching the level of conquests attained by ‘Umar during his lengthy reign as khaleefah. \nWith regard to the phrase “May Allah forgive him,” al-Nawawi said: This is a du’aa’ on the part of the one who is speaking, i.e., there can be no other interpretation. Others said that it was an indication that the death of Abu Bakr was close. A similar case is to be seen in the aayah in which Allah says to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \n“So glorify the Praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives”[Al-Nasr 110:3 – interpretation of the meaning]\nThis aayah was an indication that the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was close. I say: it may be that it was an indication that the small number of conquests during his time was not his fault, because the reason for that was the brevity of his rule, and the meaning of forgiveness is to remove any blame from him. \n“And the bucket turned into a very large one in his hands” means, it became a huge bucket. “I had never seen such a mighty person as he” means that he achieved the ultimate. \n4 – It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me when he was sick, ‘Call Abu Bakr for me, your father and your brother, so that I may dictate a letter. For I am worried lest someone who is ambitious says that he is more entitled to the position of leadership, but Allah and the believers will not accept anyone other than Abu Bakr.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2387). \n5 – During his final illness, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq to lead the Muslims in prayer and he did not accept anyone else to take his place. The fact that he was appointed to take his place in the case of minor leadership (leading the prayers) indicates that he would succeed him in the case of major leadership (as imam or khaleefah). \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah, which refers to the mainstream Sunni scholars and their followers, hold a highly respectful and positive view towards the Sahabah (the companions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). Sunni Muslims believe that the Sahabah were exemplary figures who dedicated their lives to supporting the Prophet and spreading the message of Islam. They consider them to be trustworthy and integral to the early Islamic community.\n\nWith regard to Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him), Ahl al-Sunnah regards him as one of the greatest figures in Islamic history. He was the first caliph after the Prophet's death and is known for his strong leadership and commitment to the teachings of Islam. His appointment as caliph is seen as a legitimate and divinely inspired decision by the community of believers at that time. Sunni scholars emphasize his virtues, such as his honesty, bravery, wisdom, and dedication to the welfare of the Muslim community.\n\nIn summary, Ahl al-Sunnah has great respect for the Sahabah as the chosen companions of the Prophet Muhammad and holds Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq in high esteem as a significant and respected leader in the early Islamic state. They believe that following the example and teachings of both the Prophet and his companions, particularly the rightly guided caliphs, is essential for a proper understanding and practice of Islam."

        "question": "The Standing Committee Why is Islam called so ?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.A: In Arabic, Islam means surrender . It has been taken to describe \n          the status of the one who embraces Allah’s Religion for he surrenders \n          his will to Allah and abide by the rules set by Him and conveyed via \n          His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. Allah says about Ibrahim, \n          peace be upon him, “When his Lord said to him, “Submit (be a Muslim \n          )!” He said, “I have submitted myself (as a Muslim ) to the Lord of  \n          all that exists. ” [al-Baqarah 2:131 – interpretation of the meaning] \n          .  \nThe Standing Committee",
        "predicted_answer": "Islam is derived from the Arabic root word \"s-l-m,\" which means peace, surrender, and submission. The term \"Islam\" itself can be understood to mean \"surrender\" or \"submission\" to the will of Allah (God). \n\nIn this context, Islam is called so because it emphasizes the submission of individuals to the teachings and commands of Allah, which are believed to lead to peace and harmony in the lives of believers. The core belief is that by following the Five Pillars of Islam and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), one can achieve a peaceful and fulfilling life, both in this world and the hereafter.\n\nAdditionally, the very essence of Islam encompasses not just religious practices, but also a way of life that promotes justice, compassion, and ethical conduct among individuals and society. Thus, the name \"Islam\" encapsulates its foundational principles of peace, submission to God's will, and the pursuit of a moral life."

        "question": "Islamic rights",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islamic rights are many, among the most important \n          of which are the following:  \nThe rights of Allaah  \nThe blessings of Allaah to His slaves are \n          innumerable. Every blessing deserves thanks. The rights of Allaah upon \n          His slaves are many, the most important of which include the following:  \n          \n1.Tawheed, which means believing that Allaah is One in His \n          Essence, His names, His attributes and His deeds. So we should believe \n          that Allaah alone is the Lord, the Sovereign, the Controller, the Creator, \n          the Provider, in Whose hand is Dominion and He is Able to do all things: \n          \n“Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the \n          dominion; and He is Able to do all things”[al-Mulk 67:1 – interpretation \n          of the meaning] \n2.‘Ibaadah (worship), which means worshipping Allaah alone because \n          He is their Lord, Creator and Provider. So all kinds of worship should \n          be devoted to Him alone, such as du’aa’ (supplication), dhikr (remembering \n          Allaah), seeking help, humbling oneself, submitting, hope and fear, \n          vows, sacrifices, and so on. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Worship Allaah and join none with \n          Him (in worship)” \n[al-Nisaa’ 4:36] \n3.Shukr (gratitude, giving thanks), for Allaah is the One \n          Who bestows favours and blessings upon all of creation, so they have \n          to show their gratitude for these blessings on their lips and in their \n          hearts and in their physical actions, by praising Allaah and using these \n          blessings to obey Allaah and in ways that Allaah has permitted: \n“Therefore remember Me (by praying, \n          glorifying). I will remember you, and be grateful to Me (for My countless \n          Favours on you) and never be ungrateful to Me \n[al-Baqarah \n          2:152 – interpretation of the meaning]  \nThe rights of the Messenger  \nThe sending of the Messenger  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is a great blessing for \n          all of mankind. Allah sent him to bring mankind forth from darkness \n          into light, and to show them that which will bring them happiness in \n          this world and in the Hereafter.  \nAmong the rights that the Messenger has over \n          us are that we should love him, obey him and send blessings upon him. \n          Loving him  (peace and blessings \n          of Allaah be upon him) is achieved by obeying his commands and believing \n          what he told us, avoiding that which he forbade and not worshipping \n          Allaah except in the ways that he prescribed.  \nParent’s rights  \nIslam pays special attention to the family \n          and encourages love and respect within it. The parents are the basis \n          and foundation of the family, hence honouring one's parents is one of \n          the best deeds and one of the most beloved actions to Allaah.  \n          \nHonouring one’s parents is achieved by obeying \n          them, respecting them, being humble towards them, treating them kindly, \n          spending on them, praying for them, upholding ties of kinship with those \n          to whom one is related through them, and honouring their friends:  \n          \n“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but \n          Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents”[al-Israa’ 17:23]  \n          \nThe rights of the mother in this regard \n          are greater, because she is the one who bears the child, gives birth \n          to him and breastfeeds him. A man came to the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of \n          Allaah, who is most deserving of my good companionship?” He said, “Your \n          mother.” He said, “Then who?” He said, “Your mother.” He said, “Then \n          who?” He said, “Your mother.” He said, “Then who?” He said, “Your father.”\n(Agreed upon. This version was narrated by al-Bukhaari, \n          al-Adab, 78)  \nThe rights of one Muslim over another  \nThe believers are brothers and are an integrated \n          nation, like a building parts of which support other parts. They treat \n          one another with mercy and compassion, and love one another. In order \n          to preserve this building and this brotherhood, Allaah has prescribed \n          rights which each Muslim has over his fellow Muslim. These include love, \n          sincerity (naseehah), relieving his distress, concealing his \n          mistakes, supporting him when he is in the right, respecting neighbours \n          and honouring guests.  \nThese rights also include returning greetings \n          of salaam, visiting the sick, accepting invitations, saying “yarhamuk \n          Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you) to a Muslim when he sneezes, \n          and attending his funeral. The Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The rights of one \n          Muslim over another are five: returning the greeting of salaam, saying \n          ‘yarhamuk Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you)’ when he sneezes, \n          accepting invitations, visiting the sick and attending funerals.” (Narrated \n          by Muslim, 2625) \n Neighbour’s rights  \nIslam pays attention to the issue of neighbours, \n          whether they are Muslim or not, because of the interests served by that \n          in making the nation like one body. The Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Jibreel kept on enjoining \n          the good treatment of neighbours to the extent that I thought that he \n          would include neighbours as heirs.” (Agreed upon. Narrated by Muslim, \n          2625)  \nAmong the rights of one neighbour over \n          another as affirmed by Islam are the initiation of greetings, visiting \n          him if he is sick, offering condolences if calamity befalls him, congratulating \n          him at times of joy, overlooking his mistakes, concealing his faults, \n          bearing his annoyance with patience, giving him gifts, lending him money \n          if he needs it, lowering one’s gaze from looking at his womenfolk, and \n          guiding him to that which will benefit him in his religious and worldly \n          affairs. The Prophet  (peace and \n          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:\n“The best of companions with Allaah is the one who is \n          best to his companion, and the best of neighbours with Him is the one \n          who is best to his neighbour.”(Narrated by al-Bukhaari in al-Adab \n          al-Mufrad, 115)  \nConcerning neighbours’ rights, Allaah says \n          (interpretation of the meaning):  \n“Worship Allaah and join none with Him (in worship); \n          and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masaakeen (the poor), \n          the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the \n          companion by your side…”[al-Nisaa’ 4:36]  \nIslam warns against annoying one’s neighbours \n          or treating them badly. The Messenger  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that this would \n          lead to being deprived of Paradise: “He will not enter Paradise from \n          whose harm his neighbour is not safe.” (Agreed upon. Narrated by Muslim, \n          64).  \nIn order to achieve the common interest, Islam gives \n          rights to the ruler over his subjects and to the subjects over their \n          ruler, and its gives the husband rights over his wife and the wife rights \n          over her husband, and there are other just rights which Islam has enjoined.",
        "predicted_answer": "Islamic rights refer to the entitlements and privileges granted to individuals under Islamic law (Sharia) and the broader ethical teachings of Islam. These rights can be categorized into several areas including, but not limited to:\n\n1. **Rights of Individuals**: Every individual has the right to life, dignity, and respect. The Qur'an emphasizes the sanctity of human life and prohibits unjust killing.\n\n2. **Rights of Women**: Islam recognizes the rights of women to inherit property, seek education, and participate in social, economic, and political life. The Qur'an and Hadith emphasize respectful treatment and support for women.\n\n3. **Rights of Children**: Children have rights to a proper upbringing, education, and protection from harm. Parents are obliged to care for their children and provide for their physical and emotional needs.\n\n4. **Rights of Parents**: Islam places great importance on respecting and caring for one's parents. The Qur'an commands children to honor their parents and treat them with kindness.\n\n5. **Rights of Neighbors**: Islam urges believers to treat their neighbors with kindness and respect. Good treatment of neighbors is emphasized in various Hadith.\n\n6. **Economic Rights**: Islam promotes fair transactions, the prohibition of usury (riba), and the obligation to give zakat (charitable giving), which supports the welfare of the community.\n\n7. **Social Justice**: Islam advocates for justice and equality among all individuals, regardless of race, ethnicity, or social status. The Qur'an repeatedly calls for fairness in dealings and support for the oppressed.\n\n8. **Religious Rights**: Individuals have the right to practice their faith freely. Islam advocates for tolerance and respect for the beliefs of others.\n\n9. **Right to Education**: Seeking knowledge is considered a duty for every Muslim, regardless of gender. Education is seen as essential for personal development and community welfare.\n\nThese rights stem from the teachings of the Qur'an, the Sunnah (practices of the Prophet Muhammad), and various Islamic jurisprudential rulings. Upholding these rights is seen as a fundamental part of a Muslim's faith and is essential for building a just and compassionate society."

Verily, \n          We were recording what you used to do (i.e. Our angels used to record \n          your deeds)” [al-Jaathiyah 45:29]  \nAllaah does not accept any deeds except those \n          which are done purely for Allaah in accordance with the guidance of \n          the Messenger of Allaah  (peace \n          and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as Allaah says (interpretation \n          of the meaning):  \n“So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let \n          him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship \n          of his Lord”[al-Kahf 18:110]  \nOn the Day of Resurrection, each person will \n          see what he did, acts of obedience or disobedience, good or evil, as \n          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  \n“That Day mankind will proceed in \n          scattered groups that they may be shown their deeds. \nSo whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom \n          (or a small ant) shall see it. \nAnd whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an \n          atom (or a small ant) shall see it”[al-Zalzalah :6-8]  \nOn the Day of Resurrection, each person will \n          be given his book (record of deeds) and it will be said to him: \n “Read your book.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of accountability is fundamental. It is believed that every individual is responsible for their actions and will be held accountable for them on the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyamah). This accountability extends to all aspects of life, including one's intentions, deeds, and adherence to the teachings of Islam.\n\nThe Quran emphasizes that each person will be judged according to their deeds, and no soul will bear the burden of another. For example, in Surah Al-Zalzalah (Chapter 99), it states that individuals will see the consequences of their actions laid before them:\n\n*\"So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.\"* (Quran 99:7-8)\n\nAdditionally, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught that one's intention behind actions matters significantly, as he said, \"Actions are judged by intentions\" (Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim). This highlights the importance of sincerity and the inner dimension of one’s deeds.\n\nThus, the belief in accountability encourages Muslims to act justly, uphold moral values, and seek forgiveness for their shortcomings. It serves as a reminder to live righteously and make conscious choices in accordance with Islamic principles."

        "question": "What Are the Pillars of Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Islam is about beliefs and laws\nIslam is based on five pillars which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has explained for us. The Prophet  said: “Islam is built upon five [pillars]: the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing regular prayer (salah); paying the zakah; Hajj (pilgrimage) and fasting Ramadan.” (Agreed upon; narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 8) \nIslam is both belief and laws, in which Allah and His Messenger have told us what is halal and what is haram, morals and good manners, acts of worship and how to interact with people, rights and duties, and scenes of the resurrection. When Allah completed this religion, He chose it to be the way of life for all of mankind until the Hour begins: \n“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” [al-Maidah 5:3 – interpretation of the meaning] \nWhat are the 5 pillars of Islam?\nThese are the pillars of Islam and the principles upon which it is based: \nThe first pillar of Islam: al-Shahadatayn (the twin testimony of faith) \nThis means that a person believes that Allah alone is the Lord, Sovereign and Controller, the Creator and Provider. He affirms all His most beautiful names and the sublime attributes that Allah has affirmed for Himself or that His Prophet affirmed for Him. He believes that Allah alone, and no one else, is the Only One Who is deserving of worship, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have children when He has no wife? He created all things and He is the All-Knower of everything.\nSuch is Allah, your Lord! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Creator of all things. So worship Him (Alone), and He is the Wakeel (Trustee, Disposer of affairs or Guardian) over all things.” [al-An'am 6:101-102] \nAnd he believes that Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and revealed to him the Quran, and commanded him to convey this religion to all of mankind. He believes that loving Allah and His Messenger and obeying them are duties which are obligatory upon all of mankind, and that love of Allah can only be realized by following His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \n“Say (O Muhammad to mankind): ‘If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al ‘Imran 3:31 – interpretation of the meaning] \nThe second pillar of Islam: salah (prayer) \nThe Muslim believes that Allah has enjoined upon every sane adult Muslim five (formal) prayers each day and night, which he does in a state of purity, standing before his Lord, every day in a state of purity and humility, thanking his Lord for His blessings, asking Him of His bounty, seeking His forgiveness for his sins, asking Him for Paradise and seeking refuge in Him from Hell. \nWhat are the five daily prayers in Islam?\nThe five obligatory prayers which are required day and night are Fajr (early morning, before dawn), Zuhr (mid-day, just after noon), ‘Asr (mid afternoon), Maghrib (just after sunset) and ‘Isha (at night, after dark has fallen). There are also Sunnah prayers such as Qiyam al-Layl (prayer at night), Tarawih prayers, two rak’ahs of Duha prayer, etc. \nWhat are the benefits of prayer in Islam?\nPrayer, whether it is fard or nafl, represents a sincere turning towards Allah alone in all one's affairs. Allah has commanded all the believers to guard strictly the observance of the prayers, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawat (the prayers) especially the middle Salah (i.e. the best prayer - ‘Asr). And stand before Allah with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salah (prayers)].” [al-Baqarah 2:238] \nThe five daily prayers are obligatory upon every Muslim man and woman, night and day: \n“Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.” [al-Nisa 4:103 – interpretation of the meaning] \nThe one who abandons prayer has no share in Islam. Whoever neglects it deliberately is a kafir, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“(And remain always) turning in repentance to Him (only), and be afraid and dutiful to Him; and perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salat) and be not of Al-Mushrikin (the polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah).” [al-Rum 30:31] \nIslam is based on co-operation, brotherhood and love, and Allah has prescribed coming together for these prayers and others, in order to attain these virtues. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Prayer in congregation is twenty-seven times better than prayer offered alone.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 650) \nPrayer helps the believer at times of hardship and calamity. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And seek help in patience and As-Salah (the prayer) and truly, it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Khashi‘un [i.e. the true believers in Allah — those who obey Allah with full submission, fear much from His punishment, and believe in His Promise (Paradise) and in His Warnings (Hell)].” [al-Baqarah 2:45] \nThe five daily prayers wipe out sins, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not think that if there was a river at the door of any one of you, and he were to bathe in it five times each day, would there by any dirt left on him?” They said, “No dirt would be left on him at all.” He said, “That is the likeness of the five daily prayers, by means of which Allah erases sin.” \nPrayer in the mosque is a means of entering Paradise. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever comes and goes to the mosque, Allah will prepare for him a house in Paradise for each time he comes and goes.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 669) \nPrayer brings the slave and his Creator together. It was the delight of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whenever any matter grieved him, he would turn to prayer and converse with his Lord and call upon Him, seeking His forgiveness and asking Him of His bounty. \nPrayer done with proper humility and fear of Allah brings the Muslim closer to his Lord, and keeps him from doing evil, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Recite (O Muhammad) what has been revealed to you of the Book (the Quran), and perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah). Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahsha (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed).” [al-'Ankabut 29:45] \nThe third pillar of Islam: zakah (poor due, ‘compulsory’ charity) \nJust as Allah has created people with different colours, attitudes and levels of knowledge, so too their deeds and provision vary. He has made some of them rich and some poor, to test the rich as to whether they show gratitude, and to test the poor as to whether they are patient. Because the believers are a brotherhood, and brotherhood is based on compassion, kindness, love and mercy, Allah has enjoined upon the Muslims zakah which is taken from the rich and given to the poor. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allah for them. Verily, your invocations are a source of security for them.” [al-Taubah 9:103] \nWhat is the wisdom of zakah in Islam?\nZakah purifies and cleanses wealth, and purifies the soul from stinginess and miserliness. It strengthens the love between the rich and poor, takes away hatred, makes security prevail and brings happiness to the ummah.  \nWhat is the rate of zakah?\nAllah has made the payment of zakah obligatory upon everyone who owns the nisab (minimum amount) for one year. The rate of zakah on gold, silver, and trade goods is one quarter of ten percent. On agricultural produce and fruits the amount is one-tenth if it is irrigated (without artificial means), and one-half of one-tenth if it is irrigated by artificial means. Concerning an'am animals (i.e., sheep, goats, cattle and camels) the details are explained in the books of fiqh… Whoever pays zakat, Allah expiates his sins thereby, and blesses his wealth, and stores up for him a great reward. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah), and give Zakah, and whatever of good (deeds that Allah loves) you send forth for yourselves before you, you shall find it with Allah. Certainly, Allah is All-Seer of what you do.” [al-Baqarah 2:110] \nWithholding zakah brings disasters and evils upon the ummah. Allah has threatened those who withhold it with a painful torment on the Day of Resurrection. He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O you who believe! Verily, there are many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian) monks who devour the wealth of mankind in falsehood, and hinder (them) from the way of Allah (i.e. Allah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism). And those who hoard up gold and silver (Al-Kanz: the money, the Zakah of which has not been paid) and spend them not in the way of Allah, announce unto them a painful torment.\nOn the Day when that (Al-Kanz: money, gold and silver, the Zakah of which has not been paid) will be heated in the fire of Hell and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, (and it will be said unto them:) ‘This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves. Now taste of what you used to hoard’” [al-Taubah 9:34-35] \nConcealing one’s zakah is better than paying it openly in front of people, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“If you disclose your Sadaqat (almsgiving), it is good; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, that is better for you. (Allah) will expiate you some of your sins. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.” [al-Baqarah 2:271] \nWho is eligible to receive zakah in Islam?\nWhen a Muslim pays his zakah, it is not permissible for him to give it to anyone except those whom Allah mentions in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): \n“As-Sadaqat (here it means Zakah) are only for the Fuqara (poor), and Al-Masakin (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujahidun — those fighting in Allah’s cause), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise.” [al-Taubah 9:60] \nThe fourth pillar of Islam: sawm (fasting) in Ramadaan \nFasting means abstaining from things which break the fast, such as food, drink and intercourse, from the break of true dawn until sunset, with the intention of fasting. \nThe relationship of patience to faith is like that of the head to the body. Allah has enjoined upon this ummah fasting for one month of the year, in order to draw closer to Allah, to avoid that which Allah has forbidden, to get used to being patient, to bring the nafs (self) under control, to compete in generosity and to demonstrate cooperation and mutual compassion. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:183] \nWhat are the virtues of Ramadan?\nThe month of Ramadan is a great month, in which Allaah revealed the Quran. The reward for good deeds, acts of charity and acts of worship are multiplied in this month. In it is Laylat al-Qadr, which is better than a thousand months. The gates of Heaven are opened and the gates of Hell are shut, and the shayateen (devils) are tied up. \nWho must fast in Ramadan?\nAllah has made fasting the month of Ramadan obligatory upon every sane, adult Muslim, male and female alike, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days. Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him.” [al-Baqarah 2:185] \nThere is a great reward with Allaah for fasting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every action of the son of Adam is multiplied, each good deed  receiving a tenfold to seven hundredfold reward. Allah said, ‘Except for fasting, for it is done for Me and I will give a reward for it, for he gives up his desire and food for My sake.’” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Siyam) \nThe fifth pillar of Islam: Hajj (pilgrimage) \nAllah has given the Muslims a Qiblah (direction of prayer) which they face when they pray (salah) and offer supplications (du’a), wherever they may be. This qiblah is the Ancient House (the Ka’bah) in Makkah al-Mukarramah: \n“So turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah). And wherever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.” [al-Baqarah 2:144 – interpretation of the meaning] \nWhy do Muslims go for Hajj?\nBecause the Muslims are scattered all over the world, and Islam calls people to be united and get to know one another, just as it calls them to co-operate in righteousness and piety, to recommend one another to the truth, to call people to Allah and to venerate the rites of Allah – hence Allah has made it obligatory for every sane, adult Muslim who has the means, to visit His Ancient House, to circumambulate it and to perform all the rituals of Hajj as explained by Allah and His Messenger. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allah], then Allah stands not in need of any of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).” [al ‘Imran 3:97]  \nHajj is an occasion on which the unity of the Muslims, their strength and pride, are made manifest. For the Lord is One, the Book is one, the Messenger is one, the ummah is one, their worship is one and their clothing is one. \nWhat are the conditions of Hajj?\nHajj has its own etiquette and conditions which the Muslims must observe, such as restraining their tongues, hearing and sight from all that Allah has forbidden, being sincere in their intentions, using money from good sources (for Hajj), fostering the best attitude, and avoiding everything that could invalidate the Hajj, such as sexual relations, sin or arguing unjustly, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihram), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj. And whatever good you do, (be sure) Allah knows it. And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness). So fear Me, O men of understanding!.” [al-Baqarah 3:197]\nIf the Muslim does Hajj correctly, in the manner prescribed and sincerely for the sake of Allah, it will be an expiation for his sins. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does Hajj for the sake of Allah, and does not have sexual relations or commit sins, will come back like the day his mother bore him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 15210) \nEnd quote from Usool ad-Deen al-Islami by at-Tuwaijri\nAnd Allah knows best",
        "predicted_answer": "The Pillars of Islam are the foundational beliefs and practices that shape a Muslim's faith and actions. They consist of five key components:\n\n1. **Shahada (Faith)**: The declaration of faith, affirming that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger. This testimony is the fundamental creed of Islam.\n\n2. **Salah (Prayer)**: The performance of the five daily prayers at prescribed times throughout the day. These prayers are a direct link between the worshipper and Allah.\n\n3. **Zakat (Almsgiving)**: The giving of a fixed portion of one's wealth to those in need, typically calculated as 2.5% of savings. Zakat serves both as a form of worship and a means of social justice.\n\n4. **Sawm (Fasting)**: The practice of fasting during the month of Ramadan, which involves abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs from dawn until sunset. It is a time for spiritual reflection, increased devotion, and worship.\n\n5. **Hajj (Pilgrimage)**: The pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, which every Muslim who is physically and financially able must undertake at least once in their lifetime. The Hajj occurs during the Islamic month of Dhul-Hijjah.\n\nThese pillars are essential to a Muslim's faith and practice, guiding their relationship with Allah and their community."

        "question": "Do sins have any effect on the family of the sinner?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.No person will be punished for the sins of another. Each person will be brought to account for his own sins. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden”[Faatir 35:18]\n But if the father or mother commits a sin, this may be a cause of making the family members follow their example. \nMajmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 2/610\n But the consequences of the sins committed by the sinner may go beyond him to affect his family, as a punishment for him and a test for his family. Allah tests man with disasters in order to expiate for his sins, and Allah may test people with blessings. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n “We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good” [al-Anbiya’ 21:35]\n Whatever the case, the Muslim must avoid sin so that he will not be subject to the wrath and anger of Allah. And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, sins can indeed have repercussions that extend beyond the individual sinner, potentially affecting their family and community. This idea is supported by various verses in the Quran and Hadith, where we see a strong emphasis on collective responsibility and the effects of one’s actions.\n\n1. **Family Influence**: A parent's actions can significantly influence their children and family environment. For instance, a parent who engages in sinful behavior may create a negative atmosphere that affects the spirituality and moral development of their family members.\n\n2. **Community Impact**: Islamic teachings stress that society is interconnected. Sins committed by individuals can lead to broader societal consequences, including increased corruption, harm, or punishment that may affect families at large.\n\n3. **Dua and Forgiveness**: It’s important to note that, in Islam, seeking forgiveness through sincere repentance (Tawbah) can mitigate the negative effects of sins. One can also pray (make dua) for their family members to be protected from the impacts of one's misdeeds.\n\n4. **Accountability**: Each individual is ultimately accountable for their own actions. The Quran states that no soul bears the burden of another (Quran 6:164). This means that while one's sins might affect others, each person is responsible for their own faith and actions before Allah.\n\nIn conclusion, while sins can have effects on the family and community, the responsibility for those actions remains with the individual, and repentance can lead to alleviation of those consequences. It is always encouraged to pursue righteousness and maintain good conduct for the benefit of oneself and one's family."

        "question": "Why will we be brought to account for things that are already written for us?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allaah \n          has decreed what He has decreed. One of the pillars of faith is to believe \n          in al-qadaa’ wa’l-qadar \n          (the Divine will and decree). Allaah has created people and He knows \n          what they are going to do, because of His vast knowledge. He has given \n          His slaves freedom of will, and has shown us the right path, so whoever \n          does good, it is for his own benefit, and whoever does evil, it will \n          count against him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning); \n“So \n          whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant), shall \n          see it. \nAnd \n          whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant), shall \n          see it.” \n[al-Zalzalah \n          99:7-8] \nAnd \n          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“By \n          Nafs (Adam or a person or a soul), and Him Who perfected him in proportion; \n          \nThen \n          He showed him what is wrong for him and what is right for him. \nIndeed \n          he succeeds who purifies his ownself (i.e. obeys and performs all that \n          Allâh ordered…). \nAnd \n          indeed he fails who corrupts his ownself (i.e. disobeys what Allâh has \n          ordered …).”\n[al-Shams \n          91:7-10] \nSo \n          it is not permissible for him to harm anyone unjustly, whether by killing \n          or in any other way. Whoever does that deserves punishment in this world, \n          and torment in the Hereafter, for going against the laws decreed by \n          Allaah.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, the concept of accountability and divine decree (Qadar) can seem paradoxical, but it is essential to understand the relationship between them.\n\n1. **Divine Decree (Qadar)**: According to Islamic teachings, Allah has knowledge of everything that will happen, and He has written down the destinies of all creation. This includes the actions of individuals.\n\n2. **Human Free Will**: While Allah has knowledge of what will happen, humans are granted free will to make their choices. This means that people are responsible for their actions, even though those actions were already known to Allah and written in the preserved tablet (Lawh al-Mahfuz).\n\n3. **Purpose of Accountability**: The purpose of being brought to account for our actions lies in the nature of justice and mercy. Allah’s justice requires that individuals be held responsible for the choices they make. Being accountable ensures that everyone is treated fairly based on their intentions and actions, and it serves to demonstrate Allah's justice on the Day of Judgment.\n\n4. **Cultivation of Character**: The tests and trials, as well as the accounts individuals will face, help in the development of their character and spirituality. They provide an opportunity for believers to seek forgiveness, strive for improvement, and earn rewards.\n\n5. **Encouragement for Righteousness**: The knowledge that one will be held accountable encourages individuals to lead a life in accordance with Islamic teachings and strive to do good deeds.\n\nIn summary, while everything is written and known by Allah, individuals are still responsible for their choices and actions, as accountability is a fundamental aspect of justice in Islam. This is consistent with the belief that humans possess free will, allowing them to choose between right and wrong."

        "question": "Cursing Life",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a man to curse life if he feels fed up, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, in a hadeeth qudsi (holy narration) that Allah says, “The son of Adam offends Me by inveighing against [the vicissitudes of] time, and I am Time. In My Hand is the alternation of night and day.” It was also narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not inveigh against time, for Allah is Time”, i.e., He is the One Who is controlling time. So when man is afflicted with calamity, he must be patient and seek reward, for Allah has enjoined patience.\n And Allah said to His Prophet ` (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):\n“This is of the news of the Unseen which We reveal unto you (O Muhammad); neither you nor your people knew it before this. So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for the Muttaqoon (the pious).” [11:49]\nLet man know that no matter what happens there is something worse than it  somewhere else in the world. If he understands this, then his problems will become easier to bear.\n And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Cursing life or expressing deep dissatisfaction with one's existence can be a complex issue in Islam. Islam teaches that life is a test and that hardships are part of the human experience. Here are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Value of Life**: In Islam, life is considered a precious gift from Allah (SWT). It is important to approach challenges with patience and gratitude, recognizing that every experience can lead to spiritual growth.\n\n2. **Seeking Help**: If someone feels overwhelmed and tempted to curse life, it is encouraged to seek help through prayer, consultation with knowledgeable individuals, or mental health support. Allah is always there to listen and provide solace.\n\n3. **Patience and Gratitude**: The concepts of patience (Sabr) and gratitude (Shukr) are fundamental in Islam. It is emphasized that, during difficult times, keeping faith and being thankful for the blessings one has is crucial.\n\n4. **Avoiding Negative Speech**: Islam discourages negative speech, including cursing or using harsh language. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught that our words have power and impact both ourselves and those around us.\n\n5. **Remembering Allah’s Mercy**: It's important to remember that Allah’s mercy and support are always accessible. Engaging in prayer (Salah), reciting Quran, and reflecting on Allah’s attributes can help alleviate feelings of despair.\n\nIn conclusion, if someone is feeling compelled to curse life, it is vital to address these feelings constructively and seek support from faith, community, and if necessary, mental health professionals. Life's trials can be faced with resilience and hope."

        "question": "What Are the Merits of Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Why Islam is the true religion\nThis is a reasonable enough question for one who has not entered Islam , but one who believes in and practices this religion already knows the blessings which are his because of this religion. There are many reasons for this, which include the following:\n\nThe Muslim worships One God, Who has no partner, and Who has the most beautiful names and the highest attributes. \n\nThus the Muslim’s focus and aim is concentrated, focused on His Lord and Creator; he puts his trust in Him and asks Him for help, patience and support; he believes that Allah is able to do all things, and has no need of a wife or son. \nAllah created the heavens and earth; He is the One Who gives life and death; He is the Creator and Sustainer from Whom the slave seeks provision. He is the All-Hearing Who responds to the supplication of His slave, and from Whom the slave hopes for a response. He is the All-Merciful and All-Forgiving, to Whom the slave turns in repentance when he has committed a sin or fallen short in his worship of Allah. He is the Omniscient and All-Seeing, Who knows all intentions and what is hidden in people’s hearts.\nThe slave feels ashamed to commit a sin by doing wrong to himself or to others, because his Lord is watching over him and sees all that he does. He knows that Allah is All-Wise, the Seer of the Unseen, so he trusts that what Allah decrees for him is good; he knows that Allah will never be unjust to him, and that everything that Allah decrees for him is good, even if he does not understand the wisdom behind it.\n\nThe effects of Islamic worship on the soul of the Muslim include the following:\n\n\nPrayer keeps the slave in contact with his Lord; if he enters it in a spirit of humility and concentration, he will feel tranquil and secure, because he is seeking a \"powerful support,\" which is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. For this reason, the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: \"Let us find relaxation and joy in prayer.\" If something distressed him, he would hasten to pray. Everyone who finds himself faced with disaster and tries prayer finds strength, patience and consolation, because he is reciting the words of his Lord, which cannot be compared to the effect of the words of a created being. If the words of some psychologists can offer a little comfort, what do you think of the words of the One Who created the psychologist?\n\n\nNow let us look at Zakah (the poor due), which is one of the pillars of Islam . Zakah purifies the soul from stinginess and miserliness, and accustoms people to being generous and helping the poor and needy. It will bring a great reward on the Day of Resurrection, just like other forms of worship. It is not burdensome, like man-made taxes; it is only 25 in every thousand, which the sincere Muslim pays willingly and does not try to evade or wait until someone chases him for it.\n\n\nFasting involves refraining from food and sex for an appointed time. It is a form of worship, and a way in which one can feel the hunger of those who are deprived. It is also a reminder of the blessings of the Creator, and it brings rewards beyond measure.\n\n\nHajj is the Pilgrimage to the sacred House of Allah, which was built by Ibrahim (Abraham, upon whom be peace). By performing Hajj one is obeying the command of Allah and the call to come and meet Muslims from all over the world.\n\n\nIslam commands all kinds of good and forbids all kinds of evil . It encourages good manners and proper treatment of others. \n\nWhat are the good characteristics in Islam?\nIslam enjoins good characteristics such as truthfulness, patience, deliberation, kindness, humility, modesty, keeping promises, dignity, mercy, justice, courage, patience, friendliness, contentment, chastity, good treatment, tolerance, trustworthiness, gratitude for favours, and self-control in times of anger. Islam commands the Muslim to fulfil his duty towards his parents and to uphold family ties, to help the needy, to treat neighbours well, to protect and safeguard the wealth of the orphan, to be gentle with the young and show respect to the old, to be kind to servants and animals, to remove harmful things from the road, to speak kind words, to forgive at the time when one has the opportunity to take revenge, to be sincere towards one’s fellow-Muslims, to meet the needs of the Muslims, to give the debtor time to repay his debt, to prefer others over oneself, to console others, to greet people with a smiling face, to visit the sick, to support the one who is oppressed, to give gifts to friends, to honour his guest, to treat his wife kindly and spend on her and her children, to spread the greeting of peace (salam) and to seek permission before entering another person’s house, lest one see something private that the other person does not want one to see.\nSome non-Muslims may do these things out of politeness or good manners, but they are not seeking reward from Allah or salvation of the Day of Judgement.\nWhat is forbidden in Islam?\nIf we look at what Islam has prohibited, we will find that it is in the interests of both the individual and society as a whole. All these prohibitions serve to safeguard the relationship between the slave and his Lord, and the relationship of the individual with himself and with his fellow-man. \nThe following examples demonstrate this:\n\nIslam forbids the association of anything in worship with Allah and the worship of anything other than Allah, because this spells doom and misery.\n\n\nIslam also forbids visiting or believing soothsayers and fortune-tellers; magic or witchcraft that may cause a rift between two people or bring them together; belief in the influence of the stars on events and people’s lives; cursing time, because Allah is directing its affairs; and superstition, because this is pessimism.\n\n\nIslam forbids cancelling out good deeds by showing off , boasting or reminding others of one’s favours; bowing or prostrating to anything other than Allah; sitting with hypocrites or immoral people for the purposes of enjoying their company or keeping them company; and invoking the curse or wrath of Allah on one another or damning one another to Hell.\n\n\nIslam forbids urinating into stagnant water; defecating on the side of the road or in places where people seek shade or where they draw water; from facing the qiblah (direction of prayer) or turning one’s back towards it when passing water or stool giving the greeting of salam (peace) to one who is answering the call of nature; and putting one’s hand into any vessel before washing it, when one has just woken up.\n\n\nIslam forbids the offering of any nafl (supererogatory) prayers when the sun is rising, when it is at its zenith, and when it is setting, because it rises and sets between the horns of Shaytan (Satan); praying when there is food prepared that a person desires; praying when one urgently needs to pass water, stool or wind, because that will distract a person from concentrating properly on his prayer.\n\n\nIslam forbids the Muslim to raise his voice in prayer, lest it disturb other believers; to continue offering supererogatory prayers at night when one feels drowsy - such a person should sleep then get up; to stay up all night in prayer, especially one night after another; and to stop praying when there is doubt as to the validity of one’s wudu - unless one hears a sound or smells an odour.\n\n\nIslam forbids buying, selling and making \"lost and found\" announcements in the mosque - because it is the place of worship and remembrance of Allah, where worldly affairs have no place.\n\n\nIslam forbids haste in walking when the iqamah (call immediately preceding congregational prayer) is given, and prescribes walking in a calm and dignified manner. \n\n\nIt is also forbidden to boast about the cost of building a mosque;

        "question": "Saying that\r\n    specific people are going to Paradise or Hell",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.According to Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, the\n    basic principle is that the issue of who will go to Paradise and who will go to Hell is\n    the matter of ‘aqeedah based on what is said in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and\n    there is no room for reasoning or ijtihaad in this matter.\nIf the Qur’aan or Sunnah says that a specific person will be in\n    Paradise or Hell, we bear witness to that. At the same time we hope that those who do good\n    will go to Paradise and fear that those who do bad will go to Hell, but Allaah knows best\n    how people will end up.\nThe issue of saying who will go to Paradise or Hell may be divided into\n    two categories:\nGeneral statements, which have to do with people’s qualities, such\n        as saying, “Whoever associates anything with Allaah in an act of major shirk is a\n        kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam, and will be in Hell.”\n\nSimilarly we say that whoever fasts Ramadaan out of faith and in the\n      hope of receiving reward will be forgiven his previous and future sins, and that an\n      acceptable Hajj has no other reward but Paradise. There are many such statements in the\n      Qur’aan and saheeh Sunnah.\nIf a person asks, “Will the one who calls on anything other than\n      Allaah and seeks the help of anyone but Allaah be in Paradise or Hell?” we would say\n      that he is a kaafir who will be in Hell, if he is shown clear evidence that he is wrong\n      but he stills persists and dies believing that.\nIf it were said, Whoever does Hajj then does not commit any obscene or\n      immoral act, and dies after his Hajj, for example, what will his fate be? We would say\n      that he is in Paradise. Or the person whose last words in this life are Laa ilaaha\n      ill-Allaah will be in Paradise, and so on.\nAll of this has to do with people’s qualities and does not apply\n      to any specific, named person.\nSpecific statements referring to people by name, stating that a\n        particular person will be in Paradise or in Hell. This is not permissible except in cases\n        where Allaah or His Messenger \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have informed\n        us of it.\nWhoever Allaah or His Messenger have mentioned by name and stated that\n      they will be in Paradise are definitely among the people of Paradise, such as the ten who\n      were given the good news of Paradise (al-‘asharah al-mubashsharah), foremost among\n      whom are the four Khulafa’, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and\n      ‘Ali, may Allaah be pleased with them.\nThose who the Qur’aan and Sunnah mention by name and state that\n      they will be in Hell are definitely among the people of Hell, such as Abu Lahab and his\n      wife, Abu Taalib, ‘Amr ibn Lahiy, and others.\nWe ask Allaah to make us among the people of Paradise by His Grace and\n      Mercy. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is important to recognize that the ultimate judgment of individuals belongs solely to Allah (SWT) on the Day of Judgment. While certain texts in the Qur'an and Hadith mention specific individuals who have received the glad tidings of Paradise (such as the Prophets, companions of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, and other revered figures), it is generally discouraged for Muslims to declare specific people as destined for Paradise or Hell.\n\nThis caution stems from the understanding that only Allah knows the hearts and intentions of individuals, and the final judgment is based on His mercy, wisdom, and justice. It is better to encourage good deeds and righteous living, as well as to maintain hope in Allah's mercy for all, rather than making definitive statements about someone's eternal fate.\n\nFurthermore, it is a reminder that every person has the capacity for redemption through sincere repentance and good actions, and Allah's mercy encompasses all things. Thus, focusing on individual accountability and striving for personal righteousness is encouraged in Islam."

        "question": "Muslim holidays & symbol",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Muslims have only two Holy days to celebrate. The two\n    Holy days are Eid Alfitir, which follows the holy month of Ramadan, and Eid Aladha, which\n    is in the Hajj (holy pilgrimage) season. Muslims celebrate Eid Aladha by slaughtering a\n    sheep. The slaughtering of sheep is done in following the footsteps of Prophet Abraham\n    when he was ordered by Allah (God) to slaughter his first child, Ishmael. When he told his\n    son about it, his son told him to carry on with the order of Allah, and that he will be\n    obedient and patient. As Abraham was tempting to slaughter Ishmael, Allah gave them a big\n    and fat sheep to slaughter instead. The sacrificing of a sheep has become a ritual for\n    Muslims every year in remembrance of the obedience of Abraham and Ishmael, peace be upon\n    them. Our celebration of this day and the slaughtering of the sheep are in compliance with\n    the teachings of our Prophet Mohammad, praising and peace of Allah be upon him. Only\n    Muslims celebrate these two days, while at the same time, Muslims do not celebrate the\n    Christian holidays.\n    As for the symbol, Muslims worship Allah (God), therefor they reject\n    any kind of idol worshipping. We believe that Christians believe in the cross to be a\n    symbol of their God, or the so claimed Son of God. They seek blessing and protection from\n    this cross. Muslims seek protection and blessing only from Allah, that is why we do not\n    have an Islamic symbol as the Christians cross. Some Muslims have invented the\n    symbol of a crescent to counter the cross, but this is not authentic and it is considered\n    as an innovation in Islam.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, there are two major holidays that are widely celebrated by Muslims around the world:\n\n1. **Eid al-Fitr**: This holiday marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. It is celebrated on the first day of Shawwal, the month following Ramadan in the Islamic lunar calendar. Eid al-Fitr is a time for communal prayers, feasting, giving to charity (Zakat al-Fitr), and spending time with family and friends. It emphasizes gratitude to Allah for the strength and patience shown during Ramadan.\n\n2. **Eid al-Adha**: This holiday is known as the \"Festival of Sacrifice\" and commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son Isma'il (Ishmael) in obedience to God’s command. It is observed on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar, and coincides with the Hajj pilgrimage. Eid al-Adha is marked by the ritual sacrifice of an animal (sheep, goat, cow, or camel), with a portion of the meat distributed to the needy. It also includes prayers, feasting, and gatherings with family and friends.\n\n### Symbols in Islam\n\nMuslims do not have a religious symbol akin to the cross in Christianity or the Star of David in Judaism. However, some common symbols associated with Islam include:\n\n- **Crescent Moon and Star**: Often used on flags and emblems of many Muslim-majority countries, the crescent moon and star represent light and guidance. However, it is essential to note that this symbol is not a religious requirement or a universally accepted emblem in Islam.\n\n- **Calligraphy**: Arabic calligraphy, especially verses from the Quran, is a prevalent form of art in Islamic culture and can be seen in mosques and Islamic architecture.\n\n- **The Kaaba**: Located in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the Kaaba is the most sacred site in Islam. It is the qibla (direction) towards which Muslims pray and the focus of the Hajj pilgrimage.\n\nThese holidays and symbols are integral to Muslim identity and spirituality, reflecting key aspects of faith, community, and tradition."

        "question": "The Muslim belief concerning the destiny of non-Muslim monotheists in the Hereafter",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nYour interest in studying Islam is something great, which we appreciate. Everyone should seek \nthe truth wherever it may be, and follow it even if it differs from the way of their forefathers or \nthe religion of the country or society in which they live, because salvation from the Fire of Hell \non the Day of Judgement is more important than anything else.\nOne of the most important things that the would-be student of Islam should do is to consult \nauthentic Islamic references, in order to understand the reality of this religion. For example, one \nshould consult translations of the meanings of the Qur’an and the ahaadeeth (sayings) of the \nProphet of Islam, Muhammad \n (peace be upon him), ensuring that the translations are \nsound. But reading books written by non-Muslims, or by Muslims who do not really \nunderstand or practice their religion, is not a scholarly approach or a sound method of finding \nout the truth.\nReturning to your question, what do Muslims believe will happen to atheists? Or for that \nmatter, what about monotheists who are not Muslim? Will their fate be Hell in the Hereafter? \nThe answer is that Allaah has clearly created everything, sent His blessings on His creation, and \nsent Messengers and Revealed Books to tell them that whoever believes in and worships Him \nalone, not associating any partner with Him, will enter Paradise, and whoever denies Him, or \nworships something else besides Him, or takes other gods instead of Him, or says that He has \na wife or son, or that the angels are His daughters, or follows a law other than that which He \nrevealed to judge between people in truth, or turns away from His religion, will be doomed in \nthe Hereafter to the eternal punishment of Hell. This is exact justice, and this will be the fate \ndeserved by the one who did not give his Creator His due.\nWorshipping Allaah, obeying His commands and adhering to His prohibitions are basic \nmatters, but they form the essence of the relationship between the Creator and His creation. \nAllah says:\n\"And I (Allaah) created not the jinns and men except they should worship Me (alone).\" \n[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]\nMessengers were sent with one message: to tell their people \"Worship Allaah, for you have no \ngod besides Him.\"\nHence we may understand just how far short the person falls who believes that Allaah is one \nand does not associate anything with Him, but does not worship or obey Him, but rebels \nagainst Him and fails to follow His religion or Law, or the Revelation and Messengers which He \nsent for him and people like him. Does such a person deserve to enter Paradise or Hell?\nThis is the person who says: \"I believe that there is One God Who created the universe, but I \nam going to stop there; I will not pray to Him or fast or perform Hajj or pay zakaat as He \ncommanded. I am not going to carry out any duties towards Him; I will follow my own desires \nand do whatever I want, whether He permitted it or forbade it.\" Can such a person attain \nsalvation on the Day of Judgement?\nAllaah sent Messengers to every nation, that they might worship Him and shun false deities. \nThe last nation is this ummah, and the last Messenger is Muhammad \n (peace be upon \nhim). Allaah sent him for the whole of mankind, the entire world, and thus abrogated the \nprevious laws and made this religion the best and most perfect and complete. Hence it is \nobligatory for everyone to enter this religion, for Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the \nHereafter he will be one of the losers.\" [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85]\nOn this basis, the fate of one who says \"I believe in the idea of One God, but I do not want to \nbe a Muslim, or I do not want to follow the last Revelation or the last Prophet,\" is clear.\nFurthermore, the fate of an atheist, who rejects even the belief in God, is even clearer and more \nevident.\nFinally, I hope that the matter is now clearer to you. I ask Allaah to guide us all to the truth and \nhelp us to follow it, for He is the best Supporter and Helper.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, the belief concerning the destiny of non-Muslims, including monotheists who do not follow Islam, is a nuanced topic that varies among different scholars and interpretations. Generally, the Islamic view on this subject is rooted in the Quran and the Hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad).\n\n1. **Monotheism and Righteousness:** Many scholars hold that those who are sincere in their belief in one God (monotheists) and lived righteously according to their understanding of God may receive mercy from Allah. The concept of 'Fitrah' in Islam suggests that all humans are born with an innate recognition of the oneness of God, and thus, non-Muslims who maintain a sincere belief in this oneness might find favor in the Hereafter.\n\n2. **Accountability and Revelation:** Islam teaches that individuals are accountable based on what has been revealed to them. Therefore, those who have not received the message of Islam might be judged differently than those who have had a clear understanding of it. \n\n3. **Quranic Verses:** There are verses in the Quran that speak to this topic, such as:\n   - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:62) states that \"Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabians—those among them who have believed in Allah and the Last Day and done righteous deeds will have their reward with their Lord.\"\n   \n4. **The Role of the Messenger:** Some scholars argue that the finality of the Prophet Muhammad’s message means that anyone who consciously rejects it after knowing it is subject to a different judgment than those who have not.\n\nIn conclusion, while the general view is that sincere monotheists may be shown mercy and rewarded by Allah, the specifics of each individual's fate in the Hereafter are ultimately known only to Allah. Each person will be judged based on their intentions, actions, and knowledge during their lifetime."

        "question": "What Is ‘Aqeedah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is ‘Aqeedah?\n‘Aqeedah refers to those matters which are believed in, with certainty and conviction, in one’s heart and soul. They are not tainted with any doubt or uncertainty.\nThe Arabic word ‘aqeedah stems from the root ‘aqada, which conveys meanings of certainty, affirmation, confirmation, etc. In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\"Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths (bima ‘aqqadtum al-ayman)…\" [al-Maidah 5:89]\nThe verb paraphrased here as \"deliberate oaths\" is ‘aqqada/ta’qeed, which refers to when one has determination in the heart. It may be said in Arabic, ‘aqada’l-habl (the rope was tied), i.e., it was pulled tight together. \nThe word i’tiqad (belief) is also derived from this root, and has the meaning of tying up and making strong. The phrase a’taqadtu kadhaa (I believe such and such) means: I am convinced of it in my heart; this is a rational conviction.\nIn Islam, ‘aqeedah is the matter of knowledge. The Muslim must believe in his heart and have faith and conviction, with no doubts or misgivings, because Allah has told him about ‘aqeedah in His Book and via His Revelations to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nPrinciples of ‘Aqeedah\nThe principles of ‘aqeedah are those which Allah has commanded us to believe in, as mentioned in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):\n\"The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books and His Messengers. They say, ‘We make no distinction between one and another of His Messengers’ – and they say, ‘We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).’\" [al-Baqarah 2:285]\n- and as defined by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the famous hadeeth which describes how Jibreel came to him and asked him about Islam etc.: \"Iman (faith) is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, the meeting with Him on the Last Day, His Messengers, and the Day of Resurrection.\"\nSo in Islam, ‘aqeedah refers to the matters which are known from the Quran and sound ahadeeth, and which the Muslim must believe in his heart, in acknowledgement of the truth of Allaah and His Messenger.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "‘Aqeedah (Arabic: عقيدة) refers to the foundational beliefs and doctrines in Islam that define the faith of a Muslim. It encompasses the core tenets of belief that one must accept to be considered a true believer. \n\nThe primary components of ‘Aqeedah include:\n\n1. **Belief in the Oneness of Allah (Tawhid)**: The foremost belief in Islam is the oneness and uniqueness of Allah, affirming that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him.\n\n2. **Belief in Angels**: Muslims believe in the existence of angels created by Allah, who perform various duties such as conveying revelations and recording human deeds.\n\n3. **Belief in the Holy Books**: It involves belief in the scriptures revealed by Allah, including the Torah, Psalms, Gospel, and the Quran, which is considered the final and unaltered revelation.\n\n4. **Belief in the Prophets**: Muslims believe in the prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity, starting from Adam to the final prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n5. **Belief in the Day of Judgment**: This includes belief in the resurrection of the dead, judgment by Allah, and the concepts of heaven (Paradise) and hell (Hellfire).\n\n6. **Belief in Divine Preordainment (Qadar)**: Muslims believe in the divine decree and God's control over all aspects of existence, including fate and destiny.\n\nAqeedah serves as the guiding framework for a Muslim's faith and practice, influencing their actions, ethics, and worldview. It is a critical area of study in Islamic theology and is often discussed in terms of orthodox beliefs versus heretical views."

        "question": "Performing aqeeqah for oneself and older children, and borrowing for it",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.wa aliaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh.\n\nal-hamdu lillaah.\n\n\n(a) Jumhoor al-ulemaa' (vast majority of the scholars) agree that the\naqeeqa is a sunnah mustahabbah for those who are capable of doing it and\ncan afford it.  Among its benefits are breaking the influence of the\nshaitaan on the new-born.  It is also permissible for a Muslim to make an\naqeeqah for himself if his parents did not perform it for him.  Similarly,\nhe can do it for his children even if it is after many years if he didn't\ndo it when they were young. \n\nRefer to the book \"Tuhfat ul-Mawdood bi-Ahkaam il-Mawlood\" by Imam Ibn\nul-Qayyim, Chapter 6: \"The Aqeeqah and its Rulings\", Part 19: \"The Ruling\nfor One Whose Parents Did Not Perform an Aqeeqah--Should He Perform one on\nHis Own Behalf?\" for more details.  It is mentioned there that Ismaa'il ibn\nSa'eed al-Shaalanji  asked (Imam) Ahmed regarding a man whose father\ninformed him that he did not perform an aqeeqah on his behalf--should he\nperform it on his own behalf?  He said, \n\n\"That is the father's duty.\" ...\n\nand it was said, \"Should one perform an aqeeqah on his own behalf as an\nadult?\"  ... and I saw that it is preferrable if an aqeeqah was not\nperformed as a child then it should be performed as an adult, and (Imam\nAhmed) said:\n\"If someone does that I would not discourage it or regard it as\nreprehensible.\" \n\n(b) It is not mandatory for a person to take a loan in order to spend on an\naqeeqah.  However, if he does it then it would be considered commendable as\nper Imam Ahmed's opinion.  It was related by Abi il-Harith that he asked\nAbu Abdullah regarding one who doesn't have enough to perform an aqeeqah;\nImam Ahmed said, \n\"If he borrowed for it I hope Allaah would reward and\nprovide for him by virtue that he has observed a sunnah.\" \n\nRefer to \"Tuhfat il-Mawdood,\" same chapter, Part 11: \"Regarding Borrowing\nfor an Aqeeqah and its Rulings and Benefits.\"",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, **Aqiqah** refers to the sacrifice of an animal on the occasion of a child's birth, which is traditionally done on the seventh day after birth. It is a recommended Sunnah (the practice of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) and serves as a means of gratitude to Allah for the blessing of a child.\n\n1. **Performing Aqiqah for Oneself and Older Children**: \n   - It is most commonly performed for newborns, particularly on the seventh day after their birth. However, there is no clear prohibition against performing Aqiqah for oneself or for older children (for example, if one did not have the opportunity to do it at birth). Some scholars allow it, highlighting the intention behind the act.\n   - It is important to consult with knowledgeable scholars or local Islamic authorities for guidance specific to the situation, as opinions may vary on this matter.\n\n2. **Borrowing for Aqiqah**:\n   - If someone wishes to perform Aqiqah but does not have the financial means to do so, borrowing money with the intention of paying it back is permissible in Islam, as long as the borrowing is done within the framework of Islamic principles.\n   - It is advisable to ensure that the obligation to repay the borrowed money is clear, and that one does not overextend financially. Aqiqah is a recommended act, but it should not lead to undue hardship or financial strain.\n\nIn summary, while Aqiqah is primarily intended for newborns, there is some flexibility regarding older children or oneself. As for borrowing, it is permissible if done responsibly. Always seek advice from knowledgeable individuals in your community for personal circumstances."

        "question": "Interweaving the name of Allah and Muhammad",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Among what the Islamic shari’ah asserts is the binding and coupling of the testimony of oneness for Allah and the testimony of the calling and message of prophet Muhammad \n(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  Examples of such linking are in the adhan for salaat and in the iqaamah for it.  Additionally, in a hadith the prophet \n \n(peace be upon him) teaches:\n\n“Islam was built upon five pillars:  to witness that there is no deity except Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah… .”  \n\nIt represents what a mukallaf (one who is legally capable, liable for one’s actions, and obliged to perform required acts, which in Islamic law, shari’ah, starts at puberty) is required to believe.  It must be understood together, and are pronounced together as a testimony of belief.  As for writing it interwoven, nothing is available neither in the Book of Allah nor in the Sunnah of the Prophet \n \n(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  As a result, there is great danger in this.  For it has a resemblance to the false precept in the Christian faith of trinity, and the concept that the father and the son and the holy spirit are one deity.  Further, it could be construed as an emblem representing the false faith of the unity of existence.  In addition, it may be used as support for the extremism in the Prophet \n and worshipping him with Allah.  \n\nTherefore, writing the name of Allah (the Most High) with the name of his prophet Mohammed \n(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this way, i.e. making the letters of their names interwoven and the crossing of the letters of each of their names with the other, must be prevented.  It is even not permissible to write (Allah - Muhammad) on the door of the masjid, nor in other locations, due to the confusion, misrepresentation, and serious concerns described and warned of above.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic art and culture, the interweaving of the names of Allah (God) and Muhammad (the Prophet) is a common practice, especially in calligraphy. This form of artistic expression is often used to convey the deep connection between the two figures in Islam. \n\nThe name of Allah represents the divine and ultimate power in Islam, while Muhammad is regarded as the last messenger who delivered God's final revelation to humanity. By interweaving their names, artists and calligraphers symbolize the unity of God and His messenger, emphasizing that Muslims are to follow the teachings of Allah as conveyed through Muhammad.\n\nThis practice is prevalent in various forms of Islamic art, including architecture, manuscript decoration, and modern artworks. It reflects not only reverence for both names but also serves to inspire devotion and reflection among believers.\n\nIf you have a specific aspect of this topic you would like to know more about, feel free to ask!"
