        "question": "What are the reasons why the hadiths were written down?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe writing down of the hadiths refers, in general terms, to the narrator writing down his reports on paper. This was known from the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThe main reason for that was to document and protect the reports from being lost or forgotten.\nThis reason is so clear that there is no need for further discussion of proof.\nOne example of that is what was narrated by al-Bukhari (113) from Abu Hurayrah, who said: There is no one among the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who narrated more from him than me, except ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr, who wrote down his hadiths and I did not.\nAt the time of the Sahabah and senior Tabi‘in, there were a number of people who wrote down some of their reports, but they did not pay attention to documenting the hadiths in a specific manner, compiling them in books as the Quran was compiled in one mushaf. There are a number of reports which indicate that they were not in favour of compiling the hadiths in a book.\nThere were two reasons for that:\n-1-\nThey wanted to protect the Quran from being abandoned, or to avoid anything being written down at the time when the Sahabah were collecting the Quran in writing, lest the two things become mixed and confused.\n-2-\nAt that time, the hadiths contained only the words and actions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which explained the verses of the Quran. The isnads (chains of narration) were also brief and were hardly mentioned; they were not so lengthy that the Arabs would not be able to memorize them, for they were people who had excellent memories and were keen to maintain that skill by memorizing things. Moreover, the hadiths are not like the Quran, recitation of which is an act of worship; the hadiths are to be acted upon. As that is the case, there was no need for each of the Sahabah to know all the hadiths with their exact wording; rather it was sufficient for each of them to know some of the hadiths, then ask one another [about other hadiths] when necessary.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIn Islamic terms, what matters with regard to the hadiths is their meanings. They are not like the Quran, in which what matters is both the exact wording and the meaning, because it is the word of Allah in both wording and meaning, and is miraculous in both wording and meaning, and it is recited as an act of worship with its wording exactly as it was revealed. So it is no wonder that Allah reduced their burden and made it sufficient, in most cases, for some of the Sahabah to be aware of the hadiths and convey them.\"(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi 12/43).\nSome of them at that time would narrate hadiths and would seek out hadiths when necessary for practical reasons, so that they could act upon them, without going beyond that.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n… It was narrated from ‘Umar that he forbade narrating a lot of hadiths, and he did that for two reasons:\n-1-\n‘Umar’s preference was that narrating hadiths should only be done when needed.\n-2-\nWhat he stated clearly, which was that he preferred people not to be distracted from the Quran by listening to hadiths when there was no need to do so.\nIt was narrated from him that he said: “Narrate few hadiths from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and only narrate that which is needed to be acted upon.”\nThe reference to acting in this quotation is general in meaning, and includes acts of worship, interactions with others and etiquette.\"(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi  12/61).\nDealing with the situation in that manner made it easy for them to memorize what they needed, therefore there was no urgent need to write the hadiths in a book. This is similar to the case of the Quran, which was revealed little by little, which made it easy for them to memorize it without needing to have the entire Quran in one book.\nAl-Khatib al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt has been proven that those who did not like to write down hadiths during the early period of Islam only disliked that so that no other book would be given the same importance as the Book of Allah, and the people would not be distracted from the Quran by anything else. Thus the Muslims were forbidden to acquire and read the previous Scriptures, because it is not possible to know what of their contents is true and what is false. Moreover, the Quran is sufficient and there is no need for the earlier Scriptures, because it supersedes them. And books of knowledge were prohibited during the earliest period, when Islam was very new, because there were so few people with proper knowledge at that time who could distinguish between revelation and other things. Most of the Bedouin had no understanding of religion and did not spend time with the scholars and knowledgeable people, so there was the possibility that they might confuse the books of hadith with the words of Allah in the Quran, and might believe that what was contained in the books of hadith was the words of Allah.\nThe people were instructed to memorize hadiths, because the isnads were short, as it was not long after the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). They were forbidden to rely on books, because that would lead to a decline in memorization to the point that it would be almost non-existent, but if there was no writing down of hadiths, then people’s memories would become strong, for a person’s memory is with him wherever he goes.\"(Taqyid al-‘Ilm  p. 57).\nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThose scholars who disapproved of the writing down of hadiths disapproved for two reasons:\nThe first reason was so that there would be no book that was given the same importance as the Quran.\nThe second reason was so that the one who wrote down hadiths would not rely on what he had written and forego memorizing, in which case there would be fewer people who memorized hadiths.\"(Jami‘ Bayan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi  1/292).\nSecondly:\nLater on, especially in the second century AH, there emerged an urgent need to write down the hadiths in books, because the situation had changed. The hadiths had become widely circulated among people, because when the Tabi‘in realized that the number of Sahabah and senior Tabi‘in was declining due to their dying, they strove to seek out the hadiths that they had narrated, which they collected and kept in written form.\nAl-Bukhari (99) narrated from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz that he wrote to Abu Bakr ibn Hazm, saying: Seek out whatever hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are extant and write them down, for I am afraid that with the death of the scholars, knowledge will disappear.\nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs a matter-of-fact, some of the senior Sahabah thought that conveying of hadiths was only to be done at a time of need, and they thought that if they conveyed hadiths to others when there was no need for that, there was the possibility of error for which they could be called to account, unlike when there was a need, in which case conveying what they knew of hadith was a must, and either Allah would protect them from error or a He would not bring them to account for it. Hence hadiths were narrated from all of them, and it was never narrated from any of them that he knew a hadith, but when there was a need to act according to its guidelines he refused to narrate it.\nSome other Sahabah narrated hadiths even when there was no need for that, because they thought that conveying them before the need arose was something good, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Narrate from me, and there is nothing wrong with it.” And there is other evidence which speaks of conveying knowledge and conveying hadiths.\nEach of the two views has a point, and the scholars were all aiming to do good.\nBut when the number of Sahabah became few, the view of the second group carried more weight.\"(Al-Anwar al-Kashifah, in Athar al-Mu‘allimi 12/61).\nThis is like the case of the Quran at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): there was no urgent need to put it all together in a written book, but as the reciters among the Sahabah who had memorized it began to die one after another, there emerged the need to compile it all in one master copy.\nIt was narrated from ‘Ubayd ibn as-Sabbaq that Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Abu Bakr sent for me when the people of Yamamah had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against Musaylimah). (I went to him) and found 'Umar bin al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said (to me):‘ ‘Umar has come to me and said: Casualties were heavy among the reciters of the Quran (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) at the Battle of Yamamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the reciters on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Quran may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you [Abu Bakr] should issue orders that the Quran be collected.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4986).\nAnd there are many similar reports, because the hadiths had begun to include the fatwas and verdicts of the Sahabah, then the views and fatwas of the Tabi‘in.\n‘Abd ar-Razzaq narrated in al-Musannaf (11/258) from Ma‘mar that Salih ibn Kaysan said: I met Ibn Shihab when we were both seeking knowledge, and we agreed to write down some hadiths and other reports. So we wrote down everything that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then we wrote down what was narrated from his companions. I said: No, it is not part of the Sunnah. But he said: Yes, it is part of the Sunnah. So he wrote it down and I did not; he did well and I missed out.\nThen the isnads (chains of narration) became lengthy and numerous, because the number of narrators increased.\nIn addition to that, many views of innovators began to spread among the people, and views based on personal opinion and fabrications of hadiths and reports also became widespread.\nAll of this prompted the leading scholars of hadith and Sunnah to compile what they had collected of hadiths in specialized books, so as to preserve the Sunnah and spread it among people.\nAl-Khatib al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nScholars only began to write down knowledge and rely on writing down hadiths in books, after having been reluctant to do that, because hadiths and reports had become widespread; isnads had become longer; the names, kunyahs and lineages of narrators had become numerous; and technical terms varied, and people were unable to memorize all of that…\"(Taqyid al-‘Ilm  p. 64).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nYou should understand, may Allah increase me and you in knowledge, that the reports of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were not written down in books at the time of his Companions and the senior Tabi‘in, and they were not sorted into categories, for two reasons:\nThe first reason was because, in the beginning, they were forbidden to do that, as is proven in Sahih Muslim, because of the fear that some of that might become mixed with the Quran.\nThe second reason was because they had the ability to memorise things and their minds were clear, and because most of them did not know how to read and write.\nThen towards the end of the time of the Tabi‘in, the writing down of hadiths and reports began, and similar hadiths and reports were grouped together in different categories, when the scholars scattered throughout different regions, and a lot of innovations appeared on the part of the Kharijis, Rafidis and those who denied the divine decree (Qadaris).\nThe first ones to compile the reports in books were ar-Rabi‘ ibn Subayh and Sa‘id ibn Abi ‘Urubah…\"(Hadi as-Sari p. 6).\nThis has to do with general reasons, but there may have been specific reasons too. The author of each book may have had a specific motive, on the basis of which he chose to put hadiths in certain categories. For example, it is well known that al-Bukhari divided his book al-Jami‘ as-Sahih [Sahih al-Bukhari] into various categories for certain reasons.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAbu ‘Abdillah Muhammad ibn Isma‘il al-Bukhari said: We were with Ishaq ibn Rahawayh and he said: Why do you not write a brief book in which you record the sound hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?\nHe said: I liked that idea, so I began to compile the book of al-Jami‘ as-Sahih [Sahih al-Bukhari] …\"(Hadi as-Sari  7).\nAbu Musa al-Madini narrated in Khasa’is Musnad al-Imam Ahmad (p. 14):\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: I said to my father (may Allah have mercy on him): Why did you not like people to write books, then you did al-Musnad?\nHe said: I wrote this book to be a reference book, so that if people differed concerning the hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), they can refer to it.

        "predicted_answer": "The recording of hadiths, which are the sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), was undertaken for several reasons:\n\n1. **Preservation of Teachings**: One of the primary reasons for writing down hadiths was to preserve the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) for future generations. As the number of companions who directly heard his teachings decreased over time, there was a need to ensure that these valuable lessons were documented.\n\n2. **Clarification of Islamic Law**: Hadiths provide context and elaboration on the Quranic verses, offering a practical application of Islamic principles and laws. Writing them down helped scholars clarify and derive legal rulings and ethical guidelines based on the Prophet's guidance.\n\n3. **Combatting Fabrication**: As time passed, many fabricated hadiths began to circulate. Writing down authentic hadiths helped to distinguish true narrations from false ones, thereby preserving the integrity of Islamic teachings and maintaining the authenticity of the Prophet's message.\n\n4. **Facilitating Scholarship**: By having hadiths compiled and documented, Islamic scholars were able to study, analyze, and teach the hadith literature effectively. This contributed to the development of various sciences related to hadith, such as the criteria for authenticity (Hadith classification) and the methodology of transmission (Isnad).\n\n5. **Encouraging Knowledge Transfer**: Writing down hadiths allowed for easier dissemination of knowledge. Scholars and students could travel and share the compiled works, facilitating a broader understanding of Islamic teachings across different regions.\n\n6. **Foundation for Future Generations**: The collection of hadiths served as a foundational text for Muslim communities, guiding their beliefs and practices, and ensuring that the essence of the religion was upheld.\n\n7. **Response to Societal Changes**: As the Muslim community expanded and encountered new challenges, the recorded hadiths provided guidance on emerging issues and situations that were not directly addressed in the Quran.\n\nIn conclusion, the recording of hadiths was a crucial step in ensuring the preservation, integrity, and transmission of the teachings of Islam across generations."

        "question": "Is memorizing hadith in translation like memorizing it in Arabic?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to memorizing and learning the Prophet’s Sunnah, undoubtedly the basic principle is that all of that – for the one who is able – should be done in Arabic, the language in which the revelation came, and in which the hadiths were narrated in the books of Sunnah. This is better than memorizing the meanings translated into other languages, for two important reasons:\nThe first reason is:\nArabic is one of the symbols of Islam, and it is the language that was chosen by Allah, may He be exalted, to transmit the message of Islam. Whenever the Muslim is able to learn his religion in this language, he should not turn to any other language. This was the view of the righteous early generations.\nAsh-Shafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nEvery Muslim must learn as much of the language of the Arabs as he is able to so that he can testify in Arabic that La ilaha illa Allah wa Muhammad ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger), and he can recite the Book of Allah in Arabic, and recite the words of dhikr that he is enjoined to recite, such as takbir, tasbih and the tashahhud, and so on.\nThe more knowledge he can learn in the language which Allah made the language of the last of His Prophets and in which He revealed the last of His Books, the better it will be for him. End quote from ar-Risalah (p. 48-49).\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAsh-Shafa‘i said: … The language which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose was the language of the Arabs, in which He sent down His holy Book, and He made it the language of the last of His Prophets, Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nHence we say: everyone who is able to learn Arabic should learn it, because it is the foremost language that one should strive to learn, without forbidding anyone to speak a non-Arabic language.\nAsh-Shafa‘i regarded it as disliked for one who knows Arabic to give names in any other language, or to speak it mixed with foreign words. What the leading scholars said concerning this issue was narrated from the Sahabah and Tabi‘in. End quote from Iqtida’ as-Sirat al-Mustaqim (1/521-522).\nThe second reason is:\nTranslated hadiths are translations of the meanings, and there are a number of hadiths in which the words are to be pronounced as they are in Arabic, so the one who memorizes them should pay attention to their pronunciation in Arabic as much as he is able, such as the hadiths which mention adhkar. This is indicated by the hadith of al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib, who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“When you go to your bed, do wudu’ as for prayer, then lie down on your right side and say: \nAllahumma aslamtu wajhi ilayka wa fawwadtu amri ilayka wa alja’tu zahri ilayka raghbatan wa rahbatan ilayka, la malja’a wa laa manjaa minka illa ilayka. Allahumma amantu bi kitabika alladhi anzalta wa nabiyyika alladhi arsalta (O Allah I submit my face to You, and I entrust my affairs to You, and I rely totally on You in hope and in fear of You. Verily there is no refuge nor safe haven from You except with You. O Allah, I believe in Your Book which You have revealed and in Your Prophet whom You have sent).  \nThen if you die during the night, you will have died following the fitrah (sound nature of man). Make these the last words that you speak.” \nHe said: I repeated it back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and when I reached the words. “Allahumma aamantu bi kitaabika alladhi anzalta (O Allah, I believe in Your Book which You have revealed),” I said: “Wa rasulika (And Your Messenger).” He said: “No. Wa nabiyyika alladhi arsalta (and Your Prophet whom You sent).”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari (247) and Muslim (2710).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe most appropriate thing that can be said regarding the reason why the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) corrected the one who said “rasul (messenger)” instead of “nabi (prophet)” is that the wording of adhkar is tawqifi [i.e., they can only be known through divine Revelation and sound texts of hadith, with no room for ijtihad or alteration]. They must be recited as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recited them, because that pronunciation has special effects and benefits, and they should not be altered. Therefore they must be recited with the same pronunciation that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is the view favoured by al-Maziri… End quote from Fath al-Bari (11/112).\nWith regard to other hadiths, in many cases there is a difference of scholarly opinion regarding their interpretation, so a translation will be based on the meaning favoured by the translator, or on what he understood, which may based on a weaker scholarly view, or it may be based on his own understanding which is incorrect, or it may be incorrectly expressed in the language into which it is translated.\nIn some hadiths, the Arabic wording may indicate a number of meanings, some of which are lost in translation, so the one who reads the translation understands only one meaning, and if the translator aimed to encompass all the meanings that are contained in the hadith, the translation would be so long that the one who wants to memorize it would tire of it.\nBut for the one who is not able to learn Arabic or memorize in Arabic, so he memorizes in his own language, he is still doing well. All that he is lacking is the pronunciation in Arabic, but if understands the meaning, this is beneficial knowledge that he has acquired, even if that has to do with adhkar, supplications (du‘a’s), ruqyah and the like. So there is nothing wrong with him offering supplication in translation, and remembering Allah in his language that he is able to speak.\nFor more information, see the answers to questions no. 262254 and 318586 .\nConclusion:\nThe one who is able to learn Arabic should study the Prophet’s Sunnah and memorize it in Arabic, with the pronunciation narrated in the books of Sunnah, because Arabic is a symbol of Islam and is the language in which the revelation came.\nMemorizing in Arabic means memorizing the pronunciation, and in some cases the pronunciation is essential and required, such as adhkar. That will also preserve the full meanings, some of which may be lost in translation.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic scholarship, the memorization of Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) is traditionally done in Arabic, as this is the original language of the texts. Memorizing Hadith in translation may not carry the same weight or benefits as memorizing in Arabic for several reasons:\n\n1. **Linguistic Nuances**: The Arabic language contains specific nuances, meanings, and eloquence that may not be fully captured in translation. The original wording can have particular implications and significance that are essential for proper understanding.\n\n2. **Authenticity and Preservation**: The text of Hadith is preserved in its Arabic form, and that is how these texts are transmitted in scholarly traditions. Memorizing in Arabic maintains the integrity of the Hadith.\n\n3. **Fiqh and Understanding**: Many legal rulings (fiqh) and theological discussions are derived directly from the wording of Hadith in Arabic. Understanding these rulings may require precise comprehension of the original terms.\n\n4. **Community Practice**: The practice in the Muslim community has been to memorize texts in Arabic, and scholars stress the importance of this for the preservation of knowledge.\n\nThat said, memorizing translations can still be beneficial for understanding the content and teachings of Hadith, especially for non-Arabic speakers. It can aid in comprehension and encourage deeper study. However, for the purposes of memorization in the traditional sense, Arabic is preferable.\n\nIn summary, while there are benefits to memorizing translations, it is considered more advantageous and authentic to memorize Hadith in their original Arabic text."

        "question": "Is The Introduction of Sahih Muslim Part of it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nFirstly:\nWhat is known as the \"Introduction to Sahih Muslim\" refers to the pages that Imam Muslim wrote at the beginning of his book \"As-Sahih\" before he started narrating the Hadiths of the book, which (i.e., the introductory pages) amount to about 30 pages in the printed versions.\nHe did not give it a specific name, but began the content of the introduction without a title, where he said (may Allah have mercy on him):\n\"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, all praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds, And the [best] outcome is for the righteous, and may Allah send blessings upon Muhammad, the seal of the prophets, and upon all the prophets and messengers.\nTo proceed: You, may Allah bestow mercy on you by granting you success from your Creator, mentioned that you intended to examine the collection of reports transmitted from the Messenger of Allah(peace and blessings be upon him) concerning the Sunnahs of the religion and its rulings, and what there is of reward and punishment, encouragement and deterrence, and other types of matters with the chains of narration by which they were transmitted, and which the scholars have exchanged among themselves...\" End quote from \"Introduction to Sahih Muslim\" (p. 2).\nHowever, scholars have conventionally referred to these pages as \"The Introduction,\" and some call it \"Khutbat Al-Kitab.\"\nSecondly:\nThe subject of this introduction addresses the following points:\nFirst: Clarifying the reason for the book's composition.\nSecond: Explaining the subject of the book.\nThird: Describing his methodology in the book.\nFourth: Discussing some issues of Hadith sciences that the reader of the book should be aware of.\nThirdly:\nIs the introduction by Imam Muslim considered part of his book \"As-Sahih\"?\nIn terms of its narration and writing, it is not separate from \"As-Sahih\" because it has been narrated, copied, and printed as part of his book, and it has not been transmitted separately from it, so it is like any introduction or pologue of a book.\nBut in terms of its subject matter and content, it is not part of his book \"As-Sahih\"; rather, it is merely its introduction.\nThis is understood from the action of Imam Muslim, where he said after concluding the introduction:\n\"With the help of Allah, we begin, and we seek sufficiency in Him, and our success is only through Allah, Glorious is His Majesty.\" End quote from \"Sahih Muslim\" (1/28).\nThen he began to mention the Hadiths of his book.\nScholars have conventionally distinguished between \"The Introduction\" and \"As-Sahih.\" When they attribute a Hadith mentioned by Imam Muslim in \"The Introduction,\" they do not usually say it was narrated by Muslim in his \"Sahih,\" but rather they say it was narrated in \"The Introduction to As-Sahih,\" as is evident from the practice of Al-Mizzi in his book \"Tuhfat Al-Ashraf,\" and other scholars.\nThis distinction is clearly evident from what Al-Mizzi said in the introduction to his book \"Tuhfat Al-Ashraf bi M`arifat Al-Atraf\":\n\"... To proceed: I have resolved, Allah willing, to compile in this book the common portions of the six books which are the mainstay of the Muslims and upon which most rulings revolve, namely:\nSahih Muhammad ibn Ismail Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim ibn Al-Hajjaj An-Naysaburi, Sunan Abu Dawud As-Sijistani, Jami` Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi, Sunan Abu `Abd Ar-Rahman An-Nasa’i, and Sunan Abu `Abdullah Ibn Majah Al-Qazwini, and what is similar to them, such as: The Introduction to the book of Muslim...\" End quote from \"Tuhfat Al-Ashraf\" (1/3 - 4).\nLikewise, they differentiate between the narrators mentioned in the introduction and those whose Hadiths Imam Muslim narrated in the main body of his book \"As-Sahih.\"\nThe narrator whose Hadiths Imam Muslim only narrates in the introduction is described as being among the men of Muslim in \"The Introduction,\" as Al-Mizzi did in his book \"Tahdhib Al-Kamal,\" where he said in the introduction to his book, defining the symbols of his book:\n\"The symbol for what Muslim narrated in As-Sahih is: (M), and the symbol for what he narrated in the introduction to his book is: (MQ)\" End quote from \"Tahdhib Al-Kamal\" (1/149).\nThose who came after him did something similar in the biographies of the narrators.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\"... As for your saying: Muslim narrated from Sufyan ibn Husayn in his \"Sahih,\" it is not as you mentioned, but rather he narrated from him in the introduction to his book. Muslim did not stipulate in it what he stipulated in the book regarding authenticity, so it has its own status, and the rest of his book has another status, and the people of Hadith have no doubt about this.\" End quote from \"Al-Furusiyya Al-Muhammadiyya\" (1/183).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, the introduction of Sahih Muslim is considered part of the text. Sahih Muslim is a collection of authentic hadith compiled by the scholar Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj. The introduction often includes important information about the methodology used to compile the hadith, the criteria for authenticity, and other relevant details that help readers understand the significance of the collection. However, while the introduction is part of the compilation, the actual ahadith (narrations) represent the core content."

        "question": "Are ahaad hadiths probably sound or definitively sound, and what is the view of at-Tabari and Ibn Taymiyah concerning that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.1. Rejecting ahaad hadiths is rejecting most of what is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) [as-Sunnah an-nabawiyyah]\nIf a hadith is soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), we must accept it and act in accordance with it, without differentiating between ahaad hadiths and mutawaatir hadiths.\nThis is the view of the Sahaabah and Taabi‘een, and of those who followed them in truth. They accept the hadith if its isnaad is sound, and they act in accordance with it, and they do not hesitate to do that.\nThe one who rejects ahaad hadiths rejects most of the Sunnah, because most of the reports are ahaad hadiths. This is contrary to the command of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning): {And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from} [al-Hashr 59:7].\nThis is a Qur’anic injunction to accept and follow what is narrated from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and it cannot be understood as referring only to the mutawaatir reports, which are few in number and limited, and do not cover all beliefs, acts of worship, interactions, and morals and manners.\nThe call to reject ahaad reports is a call to reject most of the Sunnah and to ignore the command mentioned in this verse.\n2. What is meant by hadiths that are definitively proven\nWhat is meant by hadiths that are definitively proven is hadiths that can be definitively proven to have been soundly narrated from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). They are of four types:\n\nMutawaatir hadiths.\nThose which were narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim and were accepted by the ummah.\nThose which the ummah unanimously agreed on and accepted as sound, even though they are not narrated in as-Saheehayn, because of what is well established, that the ummah is protected from error when they reach consensus on something.\nWidely-known reports that are narrated through many different chains of narrators, none of which are subject to any criticism.\n\nFor an explanation of that, please see the answer to question no. 197164 .\nBased on that, the claim that all the ahaad hadiths are not definitively proven is not correct; rather the ahaad hadiths that the ummah has accepted and regarded as sound, or that are widely circulated and narrated through many chains of narrators but have not reached the level of being mutawaatir, are still to be regarded as definitively proven.\n3. Dividing hadiths into mutawaatir and ahaad does not mean that there is doubt about the ahaad hadiths\nIn the answer to question no. 126571, we explained that dividing hadiths into mutawaatir and ahaad does not mean that there is doubt about the ahaad hadiths, and regarding the mutawaatir hadiths as being definitively sound does not mean that we cannot rely on the ahaad hadiths and accept them. We gave an example of that and explained it, so please refer to that question.\n4. Ahl as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed on accepting ahaad hadiths with regard to beliefs\nAhl as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed on accepting ahaad hadiths with regard to beliefs even if the hadith is to be attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the basis of probability. No one disagreed with that except innovators such as the Mu‘tazilah and their ilk.\nImam Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our companions and others differed regarding a report narrated by one narrator of good character: does it mean that it is definitively sound and we should act in accordance with it, or does it mean only that we should act in accordance with it but it is not definitively sound?\nThe view of most of the scholars regarding a report narrated by a sole narrator is that we should act in accordance with it but we cannot say that it is definitively sound [rather it is probably sound]. This is the view of ash-Shaafa‘i and most of the scholars of fiqh and men of reason; according to their view, we cannot be absolutely certain unless there is definitive proof, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that.\nMany scholars of hadith, and some men of reason – including al-Husayn al-Karaabeesi and others – said that we should both be certain of it and act in accordance with it. Ibn Khuwayz Mindaad stated that this view is in accordance with the view of Maalik.\nAbu ‘Umar said: What we say is that we should act in accordance with it but we cannot be completely certain of it, like when you have witnesses, whether two or four. This is the view of most of the scholars of fiqh and hadith; all of them are of the view that ahaad hadiths are to be accepted regarding issues of belief. This is the view of a number of Ahl as-Sunnah.. And Allah is our source of strength.\" (At-Tamheed  1/7).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars of fiqh and hadith in all regions, as far as I know, are unanimously agreed that the report of a single narrator of good character is to be accepted, and it is obligatory to act in accordance with it if it is proven and not abrogated by another report or by scholarly consensus.\nThis is the view of all the fuqaha’ throughout the ages, from the time of the Sahaabah until our own time, except the Khaarijis and some small groups of innovators who do not have any impact on scholarly consensus.\" (At-Tamheed  1/2).\nSo whether it is said that ahaad reports are proven on the basis of probability or are proven definitively, they must be accepted and acted upon with regard to both rulings and beliefs.\n5. The view of Imam at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) regarding ahaad hadiths\nThe view of Imam at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) does not differ from that of Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr, for he thinks that ahaad hadiths are not definitively proven, but we should accept them and act in accordance with them, even with regard to beliefs. He (may Allah have mercy on him) followed this view in his books.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the report is a kind that is as definitive as one who himself witnessed and heard, then the one who heard it should testify that what he is reporting is what happened, like testifying to a fact that he has seen and heard.\nBut if the report is a kind that is not definitive and does not dispel all doubts, but the one who is transmitting it is a person who is honest and of good character, then the one who hears his report must believe him and testify that he is narrating it as he heard it from him. That is similar to what we say about reports narrated by individuals of good character. We have explained this elsewhere, and there is no need to repeat it here.\" (At-Tabseer fi Ma‘aalim ad-Deen  p. 139).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is because the one whom the report reaches via one who heard it from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) can only be one of two things:\n\nEither the one who narrated the report to him is one individual or a group who are like one individual, meaning that they conveyed it in such a way that they did not leave him with no excuse not to follow it.\nOr he received the report from a group in such a way that he was left with no excuse not to follow it.\n\nSo if the one who conveyed that to him was one individual, or a group who are like one individual, in the sense that they would not leave no excuse for the one to whom they conveyed it not to accept it, then in that case:\nIf there is no one among them who is of good character and truthful, he does not have to act in accordance with the report and he does not have to accept their report.\nIf there is one among them who is of good character and truthful, then if that narrator conveyed the report to him, he must act in accordance with it but he does not have to believe that it is definitive.\" (Tahdheeb al-Aathaar  2/768).\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There are some reports narrated by one narrator of good character or a group whose reporting does not lead to believing that their report is definitively sound, and does not leave the one who hears it with no excuse for not accepting it, but the one who hears it must still accept it.\nThere are some reports which are narrated in such a way that makes it obligatory for the one who hears them to believe that they are definitively proven, and leave no excuse for the one who hears them not to accept them. This is the transmission of a report by a group of people who are not prone to forgetfulness and error, and the way in which the report is transmitted shows that it is not possible that they could all have agreed upon a lie.\"(Tahdheeb al-Athaar, Musnad Talhah wa’-Zubayr, p. 439.\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no report that I have narrated or not narrated, with a sound chain of narrators who are trustworthy and of good character, going back to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and of Allah be upon him), but for us it is a true and sound report, and the Muslims are bound to accept it and act in accordance with it.\" (Tahdheeb al-Athaar  2/713).\nThus he (may Allah have mercy on him) regards it as obligatory to act in accordance with and accept as sound ahaad reports, and the ummah should accept them and act in accordance with them without differentiating between whether the report explains rulings or otherwise.\nSee: Usool ad-Deen ‘inda al-Imam at-Tabari by Dr. Ta-Ha Muhammad Naja, p. 61; Manhaj al-Imam Ibn Jareer at-Tabari fi Naqd al-Ahaadeeth, by Dr. Nabeelah Zayd ibn Sa‘d (2/707).\n6. The view of Ibn Taymiyah on acting in accordance with ahaad hadiths\nWith regard to Ibn Taymiyah, he thought that if there is evidence to prove that the ahaad hadith is sound, then we should believe that it is definitively proven, and he quoted ahaad reports as evidence for both rulings and beliefs.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Hence the correct view is that the ahaad report (khabar waahid) could reach the point of being definitively proven, if there is other evidence to raise it to the level of being definitive. Based on that, many of the texts in as-Saheehayn are regarded as being mutawaatir by scholars of hadith, even if others do not realize that they are mutawaatir. Hence most of the texts of as-Saheehayn are the type of reports which the scholars of hadith know definitively that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said those words, sometimes because they are mutawaatir in their view, and sometimes because the ummah accepted them and believed in their soundness.\nThe ahaad report (khabar waahid) that is widely accepted means that the hadith is definitively proven according to the majority of scholars among the companions of Abu Haneefah, Maalik, ash-Shaafa‘i and Ahmad. This is the view of most of the companions of al-Ash‘ari, such as al-Isfaraayeeni and Ibn Foorak. Although if we examine the report in and of itself, we would think that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it on the basis of probability, when there is scholarly consensus on accepting the hadith and believing it to be sound, it becomes like when the scholars of fiqh agree unanimously on a certain ruling, basing that ruling on what is apparent, or analogy, or an ahaad report (khabar waahid). Thus that ruling becomes definitive according to the majority, even though without taking this consensus into account it is not definitive, because the consensus of the ummah is protected from error.\nThe scholars who explain shar‘i rulings never agree unanimously to make permissible something that is prohibited or to make prohibited something that is permissible. The same applies to the scholars of hadith: they never agree unanimously to accept a fabricated hadith or to reject a sound hadith.\nSometimes one of them is aware of other, corroborating evidence to support a particular hadith, which makes him believe that it is definitively sound, and whoever comes to know what he knows about that hadith will reach the same conclusion as he reached.\" (Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa 18/40-41).\nConclusion:\nAll of the Muslim scholars accept ahaad hadiths concerning rulings on what is halaal and haraam. Most of them – and this is the view of Ahl as-Sunnah – also accept ahaad hadiths regarding beliefs. The issue of whether the reports are proven on the basis of probability or are definitive does not affect the obligation to accept them and act in accordance with them.\nRegarding the ruling on one who rejects the Sunnah, please see the answer to question no. 115125 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, hadiths are classified into various categories based on their authenticity, with \"ahad\" (singular) hadiths being those reported by a limited number of narrators, as opposed to \"mutawatir\" (consecutive) hadiths, which have been transmitted by a large number of narrators at every level of the chain.\n\nThe classification of ahad hadiths can lead to different opinions regarding their soundness. Generally, ahad hadiths are considered to be either sound (sahih), weak (da'if), or might fall into categories such as hasan (good). Importantly, sound ahad hadiths are seen as significant and can be used as evidence in Islamic law and teachings.\n\nNow, concerning the views of notable scholars like at-Tabari and Ibn Taymiyah:\n\n1. **At-Tabari**: He accepted ahad hadiths as a valid form of evidence in Islamic jurisprudence. He believed that a sound ahad hadith could provide a basis for legal rulings, provided it met the criteria of authenticity and was transmitted by reliable narrators.\n\n2. **Ibn Taymiyah**: Similarly, Ibn Taymiyah acknowledged the validity of ahad hadiths. He argued that a strong ahad hadith could establish a point of belief or practice, especially if it was sound and corroborated by other evidence. He held that the authenticity and context of the ahad hadith were essential for its acceptance.\n\nIn summary, while ahad hadiths are not considered definitively sound in the same way as mutawatir hadiths, they can be deemed sound (sahih) based on the criteria of the individual hadith and can be utilized in deriving legal and theological conclusions. Both at-Tabari and Ibn Taymiyah accepted the significance of ahad hadiths in Islamic scholarship, provided they met the standards of authenticity."

        "question": "Is there reward for reading the hadiths of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Yes, there is reward for reading books of all types of knowledge, and studying knowledge. Seeking knowledge through the Qur’an and Sunnah brings an immense reward, for knowledge is to be obtained from the Qur’an and from the Sunnah. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are those who learn Quran and teach it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5027). There are many hadiths which speak of reading Qur’an, including the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Read the Qur’an, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection interceding for its companions.” Narrated by Muslim (804).\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Would one of you like to go to Bat-haan – a valley in Madinah – and bring two large she-camels without that involving any sin or severing of family ties?” They said: We would all like that, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “For one of you to go to the mosque and learn two verses from the Book of Allah is better for him than two large she-camels, and three (verses) are better for him than three (she-camels), and four (verses) are better for him than four (she-camels), and so on.” Narrated by Muslim (803), or as he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said. This is indicative of the virtue of learning the Qur’an and reciting the Qur’an.\nAccording to the hadith of Ibn Mas‘ood: “Whoever recites a letter of Qur’an will have one hasanah, and each hasanah brings a ten-fold reward.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2910). The same applies to the Sunnah, if the believer learns it; for reading and studying the hadiths will bring a great reward, because this comes under the heading of seeking knowledge. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever follows a path seeking knowledge thereby, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2646). This indicates that studying issues of knowledge, memorising hadiths and discussing them are among the means of gaining admittance to Paradise and being saved from Hell. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for a person, He grants him understanding of religion.” Agreed upon. Understanding of religon comes through studying the Qur’an and Sunnah. Acquiring knowledge of the Sunnah is one of the signs that Allah wills good for a person, just as acquiring knowledge of the Qur’an is also a sign of that. The evidence concerning that is abundant, praise be to Allah. End quote.\nFataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (1/11).",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, there is reward for reading and learning the hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Engaging with hadith literature allows Muslims to gain a deeper understanding of the teachings of Islam, the character of the Prophet, and the proper implementation of Islamic principles in daily life.\n\nThe Prophet himself encouraged the spreading of his teachings, and those who seek knowledge with the intention of understanding and practicing Islam can expect to receive rewards from Allah. It is important to approach hadiths with sincerity and an intention to learn and apply their teachings. Furthermore, sharing knowledge about hadiths with others can also earn additional rewards.\n\nAs with all acts of worship and learning in Islam, the intention behind the action plays a significant role in the reward one receives."

        "question": "The du‘aa’ (supplication) that the Sahaabah used to recite in Qunoot al-Witr in the second half of Ramadan during the caliphate of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere are a number of hadiths which speak of Qunoot in Witr, the most famous of which is that which was narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (1718), Abu Dawood in his Sunan (1425), at-Tirmidhi in his Sunan (464), an-Nasaa’i in his Sunan (1745) and Ibn Maajah in his Sunan (1178) from al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught me words to say in Qunoot al-Witr:\n“Allaahumma ihdini feeman hadayta wa ‘aafini feeman ‘aafayta wa tawallani feeman tawallayta wa baarik li feema a‘tayta, wa qini sharra ma qadayta, fa innaka taqdi wa la yuqda ‘alayk, innahu laa yadhillu man waalayta, tabaarakta Rabbana wa ta‘aalayta\n(O Allah, guide me among those whom You have guided, pardon me among those whom You have pardoned, turn to me in friendship among those to whom You have turned in friendship, and bless me in what You have bestowed, and save me from the evil of what You have decreed. For verily You decree and none can turn back Your decree; and he is not humiliated whom You have befriended. Blessed are You, O Lord, and Exalted).”\nThis hadith is saheeh; it was classed as saheeh by an-Nawawi in Khulaasat al-Ahkaam (1/455); Ibn Hajar in Muwaafaqat al-Khabari al-Khabara (1/333); Ibn al-Mulaqqin in al-Badr al-Muneer (3/630); and Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood (1281).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the du‘aa’ that the Sahaabah regularly recited in Qunoot al-Witr during the caliphate of Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, it was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh (1100) via ‘Urwah ibn az-Zubayr that ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn ‘Abd al-Qaari – who during the caliphate of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab was in charge of the bayt al-maal (treasury) along with ‘Abdullah ibn al-Arqam – narrated that ‘Umar went out one night in Ramadan, and ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn ‘Abd al-Qaari went out with him. He walked around the mosque, and the people in the mosque were scattered, one man praying by himself, and one man praying with a group following him in prayer. ‘Umar said: by Allah, I think that if we bring them together behind one reciter (imam), that will be better.\nThen ‘Umar decided to go ahead and do that, and he instructed Ubayy ibn Ka‘b to lead them in praying qiyaam in Ramadan.\nThen ‘Umar came out and saw the people praying behind their reciter (imam), and ‘Umar said: What a good innovation this is, but what they sleep and miss is better than what they are doing – referring to prayer at the end of the night, whereas the people were praying qiyaam at the beginning of the night.\nThe people used to pray qiyaam at the beginning of the night, and they used to curse the disbelievers in the middle of the night:\n“Allahumma qaatil al-kafarata alladheena yasuddoona ‘an sabeelika wa yukadhdhiboona rusulaka wa laa yu’minoona bi wa‘dika wa khaalif bayna kalimatihim wa alqi fi quloobihim ar-ru‘ba wa alqi ‘alayhim rijzaka wa ‘adhaabaka, ilaah al-haqq \n(O Allah, destroy the disbelievers who bar people from Your path, disbelieve Your messengers and do not believe in Your promise; create disunity among them, cast fear into their hearts and send Your punishment upon them, O God of truth).”\nThen he would send blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and offer supplication for the Muslims, asking for whatever he could of good, then he would pray for forgiveness for the believers.\nHe (the narrator) said: And when he had finished cursing the disbelievers, sending blessings upon the Prophet, praying for forgiveness for the believing men and women, and asking for their needs, he would say:\n“Allahumma iyyaaka na‘budu wa laka nusalli wa nasjud, wa ilayka nas‘a wa nahfid wa narju rahmataka rabbana, wa nakhaafu ‘adhaabak al-jadd, inna ‘adhaabaka liman ‘aadayta mulhaq\n(O Allah, You alone we worship, and to You alone we pray and prostrate, and for Your sake we strive. We hope for Your mercy, our Lord, and we fear Your stern punishment, for Your punishment is inevitable for those whom You take as enemies).”\nThen he would say takbeer and prostrate.\nIts isnad is saheeh. It was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Qiyaam Ramadaan (p. 31).\nA similar report was also narrated from Mu‘aadh ibn al-Haarith Abu Haleemah al-Ansaari, who is known as Mu‘aadh al-Qaari’. He was one of the Sahaabah who were well versed in the Qur’an, as he was the reciter and imam of the Ansaar. He was killed in the battle of al-Harrah in 63 AH. Ibn Hajar said in al-Isaabah (6/110): He is the one whom ‘Umar appointed to lead Taraaweeh prayer in Ramadan. End quote.\nIt is proven that he used to offer a similar supplication to this when praying qiyaam in Ramadaan. It was narrated from him by Abu Dawood in Masaa’il al-Imam Ahmad (p. 96) via Muhammad ibn Sireen who said: Among the supplications that Mu‘aadh al-Qaari’ used to offer in qiyaam – that is, night prayers in Ramadan – was:\n“Allahumma ‘adhdhib al-kafarat alladheena yasuddoona ‘an sabeelika wa yukadhdhiboona rusulak. Allahumma alqi fi quloobihim ar-ru‘ba wa khaalif bayna kalimihim, wa anzil ‘alayhim rijzaka wa ‘adhaabaka, wa zidhum ru‘ban ‘ala ru‘bihim.

O Allah, create disunity among them, send Your punishment upon them, add fear to their fear.

Enable them to give thanks for Your blessing that you have bestowed upon them, and to be faithful to Your covenant that You have made with them; and support them against Your enemies and their enemies, O God of truth.)”\nIt was narrated from ‘Umar himself that he used to say in the du‘aa’ of Qunoot:\n“Allahumm aghfir lana wa li’l-mu’mineena wa’l-mu’minaati wa’l-muslimeena wa’l-muslimaat, wa allif bayna quloobihim wa aslih dhaata baynihim, wa’nsurhum ‘ala ‘aduwwika wa ‘aduwwihim.

This report was classed as saheeh by al-Bayhaqi following his narration of it, and also by Ibn al-Mulaqqin in al-Badr al-Muneer (4/371).\nIf the worshippers combine all these reports that were narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Qunoot al-Witr, and what was narrated from his companions (may Allah be pleased with them), this is a good thing, and there is nothing in that  which is too long or too difficult for people.\nIf they vary between these supplications, sometimes reciting one and sometimes reciting another, that is also good.  All these options are good, if Allah wills.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 14093 and 81083 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "During the time of Caliph ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, the Sahaabah (companions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) would recite a specific du‘aa’ in Qunoot al-Witr, especially in the latter half of Ramadan. This supplication is commonly known as the \"du‘aa’ of Qunoot.\"\n\nOne of the well-known supplications recited during Qunoot al-Witr is:\n\n**اللَّهُمَّ اهْدِنَا فِيْمَن هَدَيْتَ، وَعَافِنَا فِيْمَن عَافَيْتَ، وَتَوَلَّنَا فِيْمَن تَوَلَّيْتَ، وَبَارِكْ لَنَا فِيْمَا أَعْطَيْتَ، وَقِنَا شَرَّ مَا قَضَيْتَ، إِنَّكَ تَقْضِي وَلا يُقْضَى عَلَيْكَ، إِنَّهُ لا يَذِلُّ مَن والَيْتَ، وَلا يَعِزُّ مَن عادَيْتَ، تَبَارَكَ رَبَّنَا وَتَعَالَيْتَ.**\n\n**Translation:**\n\"O Allah, guide us among those whom You have guided, and grant us health among those whom You have granted health, and take us into Your special care among those whom You have taken into Your special care, and bless us in what You have given us, and protect us from the evil of what You have decreed, for indeed, You decree and none can decree over You. Indeed, he is not humiliated whom You have befriended, and he is not honored whom You have taken as an enemy. Blessed are You, our Lord, and Exalted.\"\n\nThis supplication emphasizes guidance, health, and protection, and was a part of the tradition in the practice of Qunoot by the Sahaabah. It may be worth noting that different scholars and traditions may include variations or additional supplications in Qunoot, but this du‘aa’ is one that is widely recognized in Islamic practice."

        "question": "How could a woman have acquired knowledge of hadith?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Seeking knowledge in Islam is not only a human activity; rather it is an act of worship by means of which the Muslims seek to draw closer to their Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and by means of which they seek reward with Him, may He be glorified, in the highest levels of Paradise, with the Prophets, the strong and true in faith (siddeeqeen), the martyrs and the righteous.\nBecause knowledge is an act of worship, the Muslims were keen to adhere to the laws of Allah when acquiring it and teaching it, knowing that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is watching every thought that crosses their minds and every inclination of their hearts, so that they would not drift away from the path of seeking knowledge only for the sake of Allah. One aspect of that is that the way in which knowledge was sought by Muslim women and young women must have been within the framework of Islamic rulings. At the same time, these rulings and guidelines did not prevent them from acquiring a high level of religious knowledge, as ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The best women are the women of the Ansaar. Shyness did not prevent them from seeking to acquire deep knowledge of religion. Narrated by Muslim (no. 322).\nWe may see – from the books of biographies of women, narrators of hadith and scholars – how the commitment to Islamic guidelines on the part of the female seekers of knowledge has many aspects, as follows:\nFirstly:\nThe prohibition on travelling without a mahram is something on which there is consensus among the scholars, and some of the fuqaha’ and scholars of hadith did not make any exception except travelling for the obligatory Hajj and ‘umrah. So it is not known that any woman travelled long distances and exposed herself to the grave dangers that existed during those times except with a mahram, so that she would not be disobeying Allah in a matter in which she wanted to obey Him, and so that her efforts to seek knowledge would not backfire on her on the Day of Resurrection. See the answer to question no. 82392 .\nSecondly:\nWith regard to mixing with men and men and women looking at each other, our righteous forebears, the fuqaha’ and scholars of hadith, were the furthest removed from that. In her pursuit of knowledge, the female scholar or seeker of knowledge must observe complete hijab, which includes the face and hands, or she must listen and speak from behind a curtain or partition, following the example of the Mothers of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with them). The Taabi‘een learned from the Mothers of the Believers everything that they narrated, hundreds of hadiths, from behind a partition, in response to the command of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts” [al-Ahzaab 33:53].\nThis ruling was not only applicable to the Mothers of the Believers. al-‘Allaamah al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that Allah, may He be exalted, explained the reason for this ruling – which is the obligation of hijab – by saying that it was purer for the hearts of both men and women and offered protection against suspicion is a clear proof that this ruling is intended to be general in application. That is because none of the Muslims would say that anyone other than the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not have any need for their hearts to be more pure, or that the hearts of men are more free of suspicion than the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). End quote from Adwa’ al-Bayaan (6/242).\nWe have stated this previously in many answers on our website, including no. 46921 .\nThirdly:\nSimilarly, you will find in the books of biography many cases in which it is stated that listening was done from behind a curtain or partition, in obedience to the command of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. The scholars of hadith said, in response to those who rejected the report that Muhammad ibn Ishaaq heard from Faatimah the wife of Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah: It may be that he heard from her with a partition between them in the absence of her husband. Adh-Dhahabi said: That is what one would expect of them, which is the way in which many of the Taabi‘een learned from the female Sahaabah. And it may be that he went to listen to her and he saw her and learned from her when he was still a minor. It is also possible that he learned from her when she had grown very old; that is possible because she was more than ten years older than Hishaam.\nEnd quote from Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’ (7/42):\nIn Musnad al-Imam Ahmad (33/401) it says: Some scholars of hadith came and asked for permission to visit Abu’l-Ashhab. He gave them permission to come in, and they said: Narrate to us. He said: Ask me something. They said: We do not have anything [in particular] to ask you about. His daughter said from behind the curtain: Ask him about the hadith of ‘Arfajah ibn As‘ad whose nose was cut off on the day of [the battle of] al-Kilaab. End quote.\nSimilarly, it was narrated from Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) that when the Muwatta’ was read to him, if the student made a mistake in the pronunciation, or added or omitted something, his daughter would knock on the door, and her father would say to the student: Go back and check, for you have made a mistake. And the student would go back and find the mistake. Al-Madkhal by Ibn al-Haaj (1/215).\nIt says in ad-Daw’ al-Laami‘ li Ahl al-Qarn at-Taasi‘ (12/22), in the biography of Haleemah, the daughter of Abu ‘Ali al-Mazmalaani, that she listened from behind the partition to [the book] Thamaaniyaat an-Najeeb when al-Jammaal al-Hanbali was teaching it.\nThus we can be certain that the way in which women sought Islamic knowledge was in accordance with Islamic etiquette. It is also an example of making sacrifices for the sake of acquiring knowledge, and achieving a high level of knowledge, as the books of history record the names of hundreds of women whose memory will live forever in this world and who played a role in Islamic history.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, women can acquire knowledge of hadith through several means, similar to men. Historically, many women played significant roles in the transmission and preservation of hadith. Here are some ways through which a woman could acquire knowledge of hadith:\n\n1. **Direct Study and Learning**: Women can study hadith directly from scholars and teachers who have expertise in this field, just like men. This could take place in formal settings such as madrasahs or universities, or through private lessons.\n\n2. **Attendance of Lectures and Gatherings**: Women could attend gatherings, lectures, or study circles where hadith is taught. This practice was common in early Islamic history, with many women attending classes given by prominent scholars.\n\n3. **Reading Works of Hadith**: Women can also gain knowledge by reading books of hadith, commentaries, and related literature. This form of self-study can be quite effective if the woman is able to access reputable sources.\n\n4. **Learning from Family and Community**: Women have often learned hadith within their families or communities. Many renowned female scholars were taught by their fathers, brothers, or other male relatives who were scholars.\n\n5. **Oral Transmission**: In the early days of Islam, oral transmission was a primary means of learning. Women could memorize hadith from trusted sources, passing them down to others.\n\n6. **Scholarly Contributions**: There have been many notable female hadith scholars throughout Islamic history, such as Aisha bint Abi Bakr, who was an important source of hadith and shared knowledge widely.\n\n7. **Writing and Recording**: Women have also contributed to the collection and documentation of hadith. Some would write down hadith they learned, helping to preserve these teachings for the future.\n\nIn summary, the acquisition of knowledge of hadith is not limited by gender, and women have historically been significant contributors to the field of hadith scholarship."

        "question": "The saheeh Sunnah is wahy (Revelation) from Allah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:  \nIt is essential that it be established in the mind and heart of every Muslim that the Sunnah – which is the words, deeds and approval that are attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – is one of the two parts of divine Revelation that were revealed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The other part of the Revelation (Wahy) is the Holy Quran.  \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.\n4. It is only a Revelation revealed”\n[al-Najm 53:3-4]\nIt was narrated from al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’di Yakrib (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  \n“Verily I have been given the Quran and something similar to it along with it. But soon there will be a time when a man will be reclining on his couch with a full stomach, and he will say, ‘You should adhere to this Quran: what you find that it says is permissible, take it as permissible, and what you find it says is forbidden, take it as forbidden.’ But indeed, whatever the Messenger of Allah forbids is like what Allah forbids.” \nNarrated by al-Tirmidhi (2664). He said: It is hasan ghareeb with this isnaad. It was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (2870). \nThis is what was understood by the righteous salaf (may Allah be pleased with them): \nHassaan ibn ‘Atiyah said in al-Kifaayah by al-Khateeb (12): \nJibreel used to bring the sunnah down to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as he used to bring the Quran down to him. End quote. \nNarrated by al-Daarimi in his Sunan (588) and by al-Khateeb in al-Kifaayah (12). It was attributed by al-Haafiz in al-Fath (13/291) to al-Bayhaqi, and he said: With a saheeh isnaad. \nThe importance of the Sunnah is first of all that it explains the Book of Allah and is a commentary on it, then it adds some rulings to those in the Book of Allah. \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad ) the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Quran)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought”\n[al-Nahl 16:44]. \nIbn ‘Abd al-Barr said in Jaami’ Bayaan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi (2/190): \nThe commentary of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the Quran is of two types: \n1 – Explaining things that are mentioned in general terms in the Holy Quran, such as the five daily prayers, their times, prostration, bowing and all other rulings. \n2 – Adding rulings to the rulings of the Quran, such as the prohibition on being married to a woman and to her paternal or maternal aunt at the same time. End quote. \nSecondly: \nAs the Sunnah is the second of the two parts of Revelation, it is inevitable that Allah will protect it, so as to preserve the religion from distortion and additions or subtractions. \nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Ihkaam (1/95): \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”\n[al-Hijr 15:9] \n“Say (O Muhammad ): “I warn you only by the Revelation (from Allah and not by the opinion of the religious scholars and others). But the deaf (who follow the religious scholars and others blindly) will not hear the call, (even) when they are warned [i.e. one should follow only the Quran and the Sunnah (legal ways, orders, acts of worship, and the statements of Prophet Muhammad , as the Companions of the Prophet did)]”\n[al-Anbiya’ 21:45]\nAllah tells us that the words of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are all Wahy (revelation), and Wahy is undoubtedly Dhikr, and Dhikr is preserved according to the text of the Quran. Thus it is correct to say that his words (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are all preserved by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and He has promised that none of them will be lost to us, because that which Allah preserves can certainly not be lost at all; it has all been transmitted to us and Allah has established proof and left us with no excuse. End quote.  \nThirdly: \nOnce it is established that the Sunnah is part of the divine revelation, it is essential to note that there is only one difference between it and the Quran, which is that the Qur'aan is the word of Allah, may He be exalted, which was revealed verbatim to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whereas the Sunnah may not be the words of Allah, rather it is only His Revelation, so it need not necessarily come to us verbatim, but the meaning of it comes to us. \nOnce we understand this difference, we see that the point in transmission of the Sunnah is to convey the meanings, not the exact same words that were uttered by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Islam tells us that Allah only preserves the words of the Quran in full, and He preserves the general meanings of the Sunnah, and that which explains the Book of Allah, not the exact words and phrases. \nHowever, the scholars of this ummah throughout the early centuries strove to preserve the sharee’ah and the Sunnah. They have transmitted to us the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as he said them, and they distinguished between the reports that were right and wrong, true and false. \nWhat the questioner sees of multiple reports of a single hadeeth does not mean that there is any shortcoming in the preservation and transmission of the Sunnah. Rather the reports vary for numerous reasons, and once they are understood the answer will become clear. \nFourthly: \nReasons for multiple reports: \n1-Multiple incidents\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Ihkaam (1/134): \nThe existence of different versions does not represent a fault in the hadeeth if the meaning is the same, because it is proven that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) uttered a hadeeth he would repeat it three times, so each person would narrate it according to what he heard. This difference in the reports does not mean that the hadeeth is weak, if the meaning is the same. End quote. \n2-Reporting the meaning\nThis is the most common reason for there being multiple versions of a single hadeeth. What matters in transmission of a hadeeth is that the meaning be conveyed. As for the wording, it is not the matter of worship as is the case with the Quran. \nFor example, the hadeeth “Actions are but by intentions” is also narrated as “Action is by intention” and “Actions are but by intention” and “actions are by intention.” The reason for these multiple versions is that the meaning was narrated. The source of the hadeeth is one, namely Yahya ibn Sa’eed from Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem from ‘Alqamah from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). It may be noted that the meaning that is understood from these sentences is the same, so what does it matter if there are multiple reports? \nIn order to be more certain that the narrator had transmitted the correct meaning of the hadeeth, the scholars would not accept a report of similar meaning unless it came from a scholar of the Arabic language, then they would compare his report with that of another trustworthy narrator; then they would be able to spot the mistake in narration if there was any mistake. There are many such examples but this is not the place to discuss them in detail. \n3 – Narrator’s shortening of the hadeeth \ni.e., the narrator memorized the hadeeth in its entirety, but he quoted only part of it in one place, and narrated it in full elsewhere. \nFor example: Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated the story of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forgetting two rak’ahs of Zuhr prayer. The entire story was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, and it is one story. This indicates that the difference in reports is due to some narrators shortening it. See Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 714, 715, 1229. \n4 – Mistakes \nOne of the narrators may have made a mistake, so he narrated the hadeeth in a way that it was not narrated by others. It is possible to spot the mistake by comparing the reports with one another. This is what was done by the scholars in the books of Sunnah and takhreej. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Jawaab al-Saheeh (3/39): \nBut Allah has preserved for this ummah that which He revealed. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”\n[al-Hijr 15:9]\nSo there is no error in the interpretation of the Quran or in the transmission of hadeeth or interpretation thereof. Allah guaranteed that there would always be in this ummah those who would explain it and highlight evidence against the errors of those who err and the lies of those who lie. This ummah will not agree on misguidance, and there will remain among them a group who will adhere to the truth until the Hour begins. For they are the last of the nations and there is no Prophet after their Prophet and no Book after their Book. When the nations before them changed, Allah sent a Prophet to show them the way with commands and prohibitions, but there will be no Prophet after Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Allah has guaranteed to preserve the revelation that He has sent down. End quote. \nThe Sunnah, as we explained at the beginning, is revelation (wahy) from Allah, which explains to the people that which was revealed to them in the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and it teaches them the rulings that they need to practise their religion. Even if the details or the basic principles are mentioned in the Book of Allah, we say: in this sense the Sunnah is one of the attributes of Prophethood and one of the missions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The people still regard the Sunnah in this manner, whether it is mentioned in books or in oral reports which may differ in some wording or in different contexts. None of that gives cause to doubt its status or worry that it has not been preserved properly or to dispute its validity as evidence or to say that the people have no need of it, despite the many difference among people about theoretical and practical issues.  \nThe great scholar Shaykh ‘Abd al-Ghani ‘Abd al-Khaaliq (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWe do not find in the books of al-Ghazaali or al-Aamidi or al-Bazdawi, or any of the scholars of usool who follow their method of writing, any suggestion or hint of any dispute with regard to this matter. They are the ones who examined all the books and madhhabs of the earlier scholars and studied the disputes, even the odd views, and they took great care to refute them. \nThen he quoted from the author and commentator of al-Musallam: The Quran, Sunnah, scholarly consensus and analogy are he valid foundations of Islam, as is discussed in the field of ‘ilm al-kalaam. But the scholars of usool focused on the validity of scholarly consensus and analogy, because there were too many foolish people who tried to undermine their validity, such as the khawaarij and Raafidis (may Allah humiliate t hem). As for the validity of the Quran and Sunnah, the ummah is unanimously agreed on that, which is why there was no need to discuss their validity. End quote. \nSee: Hujjiyyat al-Sunnah (248-249). \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the term \"Sunnah\" refers to the teachings, actions, and practices of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Sunnah is considered a critical source of guidance for Muslims, alongside the Quran. \n\nThe \"Saheeh Sunnah\" specifically refers to those Hadith (narrations about the Prophet's sayings and actions) that have been verified to be authentic and reliable. While the Quran is the direct word of Allah (wahy), the Sunnah is viewed as authoritative guidance for Muslims that complements the Quran. \n\nThe Sunnah is based on the Prophet's example, which is seen as divinely inspired in the context of his role as the Messenger of Allah. Therefore, while the Sunnah itself is not considered direct revelation in the same way as the Quran, it is derived from the Prophet's guidance, which is believed to have been inspired by Allah. \n\nSo, to summarize: the Saheeh Sunnah is not direct wahy like the Quran, but it is considered to be a divinely guided source of Islamic law and practice."

        "question": "Ruling on teaching children through colouring in texts of hadiths",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is required of the Muslim is to venerate the religion of Allah (may He be exalted) and its symbols.\nAllah (may He be exalted) says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“That [is so]. And whoever honors the symbols of Allah - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts”\n[al-Hajj 22:32].\nPart of that is venerating and respecting the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Sunnah.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhoever believes in the oneness of Allah’s divinity and the message of His slave and Messenger, then does not follow this belief with what it requires of respect and honour, which is something that resides in the heart and is reflected in one’s behaviour and attitude – rather after he claims to believe, he shows disrespect, disregard and scorn in word and deed – then his having this belief is the same as his not having it. That will lead to the corruption and invalidation of that belief, and it will lead to the loss of what it could contain of benefits and a positive impact on his character and behaviour, because belief purifies and rectifies the heart, so when it does not purify and rectify the heart, that is only because it has not taken root in the heart.\nEnd quote from as-Saarim al-Maslool (3/700).\nWhat appears to be the case is that explaining hadiths to the children, then printing them and asking the children to memorize them and colour them in, is not contrary to respecting the Prophet’s Sunnah. The aim is to have the children memorize this hadith and to make that easy for them with some permissible, fun activity that they like, namely colouring and drawing, and similar educational methods that help to achieve the noble aim that is prescribed.\nBased on that, there does not seem to us to be anything wrong with the method mentioned in the question.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Teaching children through activities such as coloring in texts of hadiths can be a useful educational tool, provided that certain considerations are taken into account. \n\n1. **Respect for Sacred Texts**: Hadiths are sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and are considered sacred in Islam. Care should be taken to respect the texts. Coloring in them directly might not be appropriate, so using separate materials that reference the hadiths without altering the original texts could be a better option.\n\n2. **Educational Value**: If the activity serves an educational purpose—helping children learn and understand the teachings of Islam—then it can be deemed beneficial. Creativity in education can help children engage with religious teachings in a fun and memorable way.\n\n3. **Promoting Understanding**: Ensure that the activity promotes understanding of the meaning and context of the hadiths rather than just focusing on the act of coloring itself. Discussion surrounding the hadiths and their implications can enhance learning.\n\n4. **Encouraging Respect and Reverence**: It’s vital to instill a sense of respect and reverence for religious texts in children, teaching them the importance of the Prophet's teachings.\n\nIn summary, utilizing coloring activities to teach children about hadiths can be acceptable if done with respect and care, ensuring that the focus remains on educating them about the teachings rather than altering the texts themselves. Using appropriate materials and methods will help foster a positive learning experience in line with Islamic teachings. Always consult with knowledgeable scholars in your community if in doubt or to get tailored advice."

        "question": "The science of hadith is based on reason and shar‘i guidelines",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The science of hadith is basically and in principle founded on rational guidelines, with a methodology based on an accumulation of experience attained by the hadith scholars on the basis of many years’ experience of narrating reports and checking their authenticity and soundness. They attained the basis of this knowledge through lengthy involvement in checking reports, seeking them out, conveying them, examining them and determining whether there were any faults in them, thus gradually developing the general guidelines and framework of the science of hadith. Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi said: Distinguishing the soundness of hadith is a kind of knowledge that Allah, may He be exalted, creates in people’s hearts after they have spent a great deal of time in this field and have attained lengthy involvement therein.\nAl-Jaami‘ (2/255).\nBut at the same time, these general guidelines – in their general philosophy, but not in their minor details – are derived from some shar‘i principles that are mentioned in the texts of the Quran and Sunnah. There are general shar‘i texts that outline to the scholars of hadith the basic principles of the science of history and reports. As for the details, they were left to be developed through the accumulation of practice and experience, as referred to above.\nSome of these general shar‘i principles are as follows:\n1. The stern prohibition on lying about hadiths (narration from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Lying about me is not like lying about anyone else. Whoever tells a lie about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1295) and Muslim (4 – in the Introduction to his Saheeh).\n2. Not accepting the report of an evildoer. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! If a Fasiq (liar — evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done” [al-Hujuraat 49:6].\n3. Stipulation that the narrator should be of good character, by analogy with the requirement for a witness to be of good character. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And take as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims). And establish the testimony for Allah” [at-Talaaq 65:2].\n4. Constant verification and checking. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those one will be questioned (by Allah)” [al-Isra’ 17:36].\n5. Warning against odd and weird reports. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “At the end of time there will be liars and charlatans who will bring ahaadeeth that neither you nor your forefathers ever heard. Beware of them and stay away from them, and do not let them mislead you or confuse you.” Narrated by Muslim in the Introduction to his Saheeh (7).\n6. Refraining from knowingly narrating a report that is a lie, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever narrates a hadith from me knowing that it is false is one of the liars.” Narrated by Muslim in the Introduction to his Saheeh.\n7. Precise memorisation is the basis of trustworthiness. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allah bless a man who hears a hadith from us and memorizes it so that he can convey it to others, for perhaps he is conveying it to one who will understand it better than him, and perhaps the one who conveys knowledge does not understand it himself.” Narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (3660).\n8. Warning against putting oneself under suspicion by narrating a lot of weird reports and not being selective in what one narrates. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient lying for a man to speak of everything that he hears.” Narrated by Muslim in the Introduction to his Saheeh.\n9. Seeking evidence and proof. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), ‘Produce your proof if you are truthful’” [al-Baqarah 2:111].\n10.Seeking certain knowledge, far removed from speculation and illusion. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But they have no knowledge thereof. They follow but conjecture, and verily, conjecture is no substitute for the truth” [an-Najm 53:28].\nSome of these texts were quoted as evidence by Imam Muslim (may Allah have mercy on him) in the Introduction to his Saheeh (p. 7), where he said:\nYou should know, may Allah guide you, that it is obligatory for everyone who can distinguish between sound and unsound reports, and between trustworthy and dubious narrators, not to narrate any report unless he is sure of the soundness and honesty of their narrators, and to avoid those which are narrated by dubious narrators and those who stubbornly follow bid ah (innovation).\nThe evidence for what we are saying and that it should not be any other way is the words of Allah, may He be blessed and exalted:\n“O you who believe! If a Faasiq (liar — evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done”\n[al-Hujuraat 49:6]\n“such as you agree for witnesses”\n[al-Baqarah 2:282]\n“And take as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims)”\n[al-Talaaq 65:2].\nThe verses that we have quoted prove that the report of a faasiq (liar or evil person) is to be rejected and not accepted, and that the testimony of one who is not just is to be rejected.\nEven though a report is not the same as testimony in some ways, they are fundamentally the same because the report of a faasiq is not acceptable according to the scholars, just as his testimony is rejected by all of them. The Sunnah indicates that munkar reports are to be rejected just as the Quran indicates that the report of a faasiq is to be rejected. End quote.\nDr. Humaam Sa‘eed says:\nThus it becomes clear to us that the methodology of the hadith scholars is a Quranic methodology that is derived from the Quran and Sunnah, and that it is a critical methodology that deals with historical reports; in other words, it does not accept a reported text without examining it critically, and it is not sufficient for this text to be narrated from a scholar or a person of respectable standing in order for it to be accepted. Rather it is essential that the attribution of the report to the one who said it should be proven, and it should be examined thoroughly and carefully to make sure that it is in harmony with the proven principles and general guidelines.\nThis critical methodology that deals with historical reports was absent in the case of the Torah and Gospel, and it was absent in the case of all historical narratives before Islam. Then Islam came to give the world this sound methodology that is based on research, thorough examination and sound thinking. Charles Guinevere contrasted this methodology of critically examining historical events with the Christian methodology that is based on faith, which accepted reports from earlier generations without any discussion or critical examination.\nMany researchers overlooked this methodological connection between the Holy Quran and the sciences of hadith, to the extent that many people thought that the methodology of the hadith scholars was the result of a kind of unsurpassed brilliance, and that it developed because of need alone. But the truth that cannot be doubted is that the methodology of the hadith scholars is a Quranic methodology, and it is one of the manifestations of the miraculous nature of this religion. Just as Allah protected His holy Book from any changes or alterations, He also preserved the Sunnah as a whole and protected it from vanishing and being forgotten. End quote from al-Fikr al-Manhaji ‘inda al-Muhadditheen (p. 24).\nAll of the above – as will be clear to the reader – represents general methodological principles that were established by the Holy Quran and instilled by our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in the souls of his Companions, so as to set out for them a general framework for the theory of the knowledge that they were seeking to acquire, on which they would found knowledge that was based on reason and on religious texts. So these principles led to a very precise and thorough examination (of the reports) and a critical sense that was well balanced and guided. The reason for that was fear of going against these principles and divine commands. Were it not for that, the Muslims would have indulged in illusions and speculation, and we would have seen myths, fables and contradictions that would have been the common language in the knowledge produced by the Muslims. But the religious deterrent contained in the ten guidelines mentioned above played a major role in the methodology of checking and examining that the hadith scholars developed.\nAs for precise details about hadith science, which is “learning the rules and regulations on the basis of which scholars study the isnaad (chain of narrators) and matn (text of a hadith), and determine whether it is to be accepted or rejected” – such as their discussion about whether a narrator had a precise memory or not, whether the report is written in a precise manner, the methodology of dealing with reports narrated by those who engaged in tadlees [tadlees is when a narrator narrates a hadith that he did not hear directly from his shaykh, without mentioning the name of the third party from whom he heard it], giving precedence to a report that is narrated by one who is more authentic over one who is trustworthy, knowing how to classify the narrators from a particular shaykh, comparing between different reports and collecting hadith with similar texts but different isnaads, exercising deliberation when examining narrators, seeking corroborative reports, regarding a report as strong if there are many versions of it and many isnaads, and other guidelines and regulations that help scholars to determine whether a report is to be accepted or rejected – all of that, as you can see, is the product of detailed rational thinking that translates these general principles into practical methodological rules and regulations by means of which the hadith scholars came to a conclusion in judging whether a hadith was saheeh (sound) or da‘eef (weak).\nAl-‘Allaamah al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nBut have they paid attention to reason when accepting a hadith and regarding it as sound?\nI say: Yes, they did pay attention to that at four points: when they heard the hadith, when they narrated it, when they passed judgement on the narrators, and when they passed judgement on the hadiths.\nWhen the well-versed scholars in this field heard a report that could not be sound, or was very unlikely to be sound, they did not write it down or memorise it, and if they did memorise it, they did not narrate it to others.\nIf there is any interest that could be served by mentioning it, they would mention it and follow that by criticism of the report and of the narrator who was at fault. Imam ash-Shaafa‘i said in ar-Risaalah (p. 399): What could be indicative of whether a narrator is telling the truth or lying is when a narrator narrates a report that cannot be true, or that is contrary to another report that is more authentic, or has more evidence to prove it sound.\nAl-Khateeb said in al-Kifaayah fi ‘Ilm ar-Riwaayah (p. 429): Chapter on the obligation to eliminate odd reports and those that cannot possibly be sound.\nThere are among narrators a group who are very lenient with regard to what they hear and narrate, but the imams (leading scholars) are lying in wait for the narrators, so you hardly find any hadith that is clearly false, but you will find in its isnaad one or two narrators, or a group of narrators, whom the imams criticised. The imams very often criticise a narrator and regard him as flawed for narrating one munkar (odd) hadith, let alone two or more.\nThey describe the report that cannot possibly be sound, or is unlikely to be sound, as munkar (odd) or baatil (false). We find this a great deal in the biographies of weak narrators, or in books that speak of flawed and fabricated reports.\nThe scholars who examined the hadiths would not regard a narrator as credible until they examine his hadiths and check them one by one.\nWith regard to examining the soundness of hadiths, the scholars are very careful and cautious. Yes indeed, not everyone from whom it was narrated that he regarded a hadith as sound and credible was necessarily a man of deep knowledge, but the one who has knowledge and experience can distinguish between one thing and another.\nThe leading scholars who examined the hadiths realised that among them are some hadiths that may be difficult for some scholars of kalaam and their ilk to accept, but they found them to be in accordance with reason that is credible according to the religious texts, and that they fulfilled all the other conditions of soundness. Moreover, they found in the Quran many verses that are in harmony with it or that speak of the same idea. This is also difficult for the scholars of kalaam to accept, but the hadith scholars know that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) believed in and followed the Quran, so it is very possible that he would say things that carry similar meanings to what is in the Quran.\nEnd quote from al-Anwaar al-Kaashifah (p. 6-7).\nDr. Khaldoon al-Ahdab said:\nThe development of usool al-hadith was on a rational basis. Were that not the case, it could never have had this huge impact in shaping the Muslim mind.\nThis rational development of usool al-hadith began from the methodological and rational principle that is stated in the Holy Quran and Sunnah with regard to examining the narrator and what he narrated, on which the science of usool al-hadith is based.\nThe development of this branch of knowledge may be represented in the fact that the hadith scholars paid attention to reason when examining a hadith to see how sound it is, in four stages, as the great scholar and critic ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Mu‘allimi al-Yamaani said.\nEnd quote from Athar ‘Ilm Usool al-Hadith fi Tashkeel al-‘Aql al-Muslim, (p. 19).\nDr. ‘Abdullah Dayfullah ar-Ruhayli said:\n The academic guidelines on verifying reports, according to us Muslims – as in the case of the methodology of the hadith scholars – is not based on belief in the unseen, such that this mystical approach could be one of the guidelines for ascertaining whether a report is sound or not; rather they are rational guidelines that take into account reason, proven historical facts, comparison of reports, or other guidelines that the hadith scholars developed regarding the evidence or proof of the soundness of a report.\nThese guidelines, as we have described them, are rational and based on common sense, such that all people – or almost all people – will be able to understand and accept them, regardless of their religion or affiliation. A report with an interrupted chain of narrators, for example, is something that all people of sound mind would doubt and would not accept it because of that. That is because there is no continuous chain of narrators going all the way back to the source of the report, and if that is not available, then how can it be imagined that the report is sound?\nHuman minds can differentiate between a report being certain on the one hand, and it being likely or a mere possibility on the other hand. Therefore there is no room for the question which says, on what academic methodology is the approach of the hadith scholars in verifying a report based? Is it a scientifically-based methodology, or is it a mystical, faith-based methodology? That is because belief in the unseen plays no role in examining and verifying the report, then accepting it or rejecting it. However, this aspect of the hadith scholars’ methodology has to do with verifying reports and is not based on personal opinion or belief in the unseen.\nEnd quote from Hiwaar hawla Manhaj al-Muhadditheen fi Naqd ar-Riwaayaat Sanadan wa Matnan (p. 12-13).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The science of hadith, known as \"Ilm al-Hadith,\" is indeed based on both reason and shar‘i (Islamic legal) guidelines. This discipline involves the study of the sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). \n\n1. **Reason (Aql)**: Scholars use logical reasoning to evaluate the authenticity of hadith. This includes assessing the chain of narration (isnad) and the text (matn) for consistency and coherence. Reason is employed to understand the context and implications of the hadith as well.\n\n2. **Shar‘i Guidelines**: There are specific Islamic legal criteria to determine the authenticity of hadith. These include:\n\n   - **Chain of Narrators**: The reliability and integrity of the individuals in the chain must be scrutinized. Scholars classify narrators into categories such as trustworthy (thiqah), weak (da'if), or unknown (majhul).\n   \n   - **Textual Analysis**: The content of the hadith must not contradict established Islamic teachings or the Qur'an.\n\n   - **Continuity of Transmission**: The hadith must have a well-documented chain of transmission, without any breaks.\n\nScholars in the field of hadith have developed a rigorous framework to ensure that the teachings attributed to the Prophet are authentically preserved and understood. Thus, this science is a blend of both rational analysis and adherence to the principles established by Islamic tradition."

        "question": "Ruling on one who rejects a saheeh hadith",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThe Prophet’s Sunnah is the second source of Islamic sharee‘ah. The revelation came down to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with the Sunnah as it came down to him with the Qur’an. The proof of that is the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.\nIt is but a revelation revealed”\n[an-Najm 53:3-4]. \nAllah, may He be exalted, has enjoined upon the believers complete submission to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his hadith and rulings, to the extent that He, may He be glorified, swore by His divine self that whoever hears the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then rejects them and does not accept them, has nothing to do with faith at all. He, may He be glorified and exalted, said (interpretation of the meaning):\n“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:65]. \nHence there was consensus among the scholars that whoever denies that the Sunnah constitutes shar‘i evidence in general terms, or rejects a hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him – knowing that it is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – is a disbeliever, who has not attained even the lowest level of Islam and submission to Allah and His Messenger. \nImam Is-haaq ibn Raahawayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhoever hears a report from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he accepts as being sound, then rejects it, not by way of dissimulation (when he has no choice because of a threat), is a disbeliever. End quote \nAs-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nYou should understand, may Allah have mercy on you, that whoever denies that the hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) constitutes shar‘i evidence – whether he denies a report that speaks of something that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said or did, if that hadith fulfils the conditions stipulated in usool al-hadith – has committed an act of disbelief that puts him beyond the bounds of Islam, and he will be gathered (on the Day of Resurrection) with the Jews and Christians, or with whomever Allah wills of the disbelieving groups. End quote. \nMiftaah al-Jannah fi’l-Ihtijaaj bi’s-Sunnah (p 14) \nAl-‘Allaamah Ibn al-Wazeer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRejecting the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when one is aware that it is his hadith constitutes blatant disbelief. End quote. \nAl-‘Awaasim wa’l-Qawaasim (2/274) \nIt says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah: \nThe one who denies that we should follow the Sunnah is a disbeliever, because he is expressing disbelief in Allah and His Messenger, and rejecting the consensus of the Muslims. End quote. \nFataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (vol. 2, 3/194) \nSee also the answers to questions no. 604, 13206 and 77243 \nSecondly: \nAs for the one who rejects a hadith and does not accept it, denying that it is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he is not like those who come under the first category. We understand that many followers of the new “enlightenment” trend – who have taken it upon themselves to judge the Prophet’s Sunnah on the basis of their views and affiliation – in fact, have not come up with anything new. Rather they are a continuation of the innovators who came before them, whose specious arguments the scholars quoted and took it upon themselves to refute them. \nTo these people and others like them we say: \nAcademic methodology dictates that we should examine several important matters before rejecting a hadith or denying that it is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). These conditions are as follows: \nThe first condition: \nWe should see whether there is a complete contradiction between what is mentioned in the hadith and what is mentioned in a Qur’anic text that is clear and unambiguous in meaning and not abrogated. We should emphasise here the condition of complete contradiction – and not just an apparent contradiction that may come to the mind of one who hastens to jump to conclusions when examining hadith. Perhaps those who are involved in denying the hadiths will agree with us on this condition, because most of the apparent contradictions that occur to many people are not contradictions in reality; rather they are mere speculation in the mind of the objector and it is possible, with deliberation and by examining the shades of meaning of different words, to answer the one who thinks that there is a contradiction, and demonstrate how the hadith is in harmony with the fundamentals and sublime aims of sharee‘ah. Whoever studies the book of al-‘Allaamah Ibn Qutaybah ad-Deenoori entitled Mukhtalif al-Hadith will realise how reckless many of them were in their denial of hadiths on the basis of the claim that they are not in accordance with the Qur’an, or that they contradict sound reasoning, but when Ibn Qutaybah mentions the correct explanation of these hadiths given by the scholars, it becomes clear that there is a sound interpretation for them that is in harmony with Islamic teachings, and that the notion that these hadiths contradict the Quran is based on corrupt understanding. \nWe ask these people and their ilk, who have the audacity to reject the Sunnah and cast aspersions on the hadiths of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) without any academic methodology or acceptable critical guidelines, and without properly understanding the fundamentals of hadith science that they are talking about, the following: \nDo you think that it is possible for a hadith to completely contradict the Holy Qur’an to the extent that the examiner may think that this hadith is not the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), at the time when we see all the scholars of Islam, from the time of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) up until the present day, in agreement on accepting this hadith and commenting on it, interpreting it, quoting it as evidence and acting upon it? \nDoesn’t rational thinking – on which they claim to base their argument – dictate that they should respect the consensus of specialists on the matter that is at the heart of their specialty? \nCan anyone have the audacity to say that physicists, chemists, mathematicians, educationalists or economists, for example, have made a mistake if they agree on a matter – especially when the one who is objecting to them is not one of the specialists in that field; rather all that can be said is that he has read some articles about it or a few books along the lines of Science For Dummies or The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Science [i.e., books that offer a basic introduction to a field]? \nThe second condition: \nThere should be a weakness in one of the links of the isnaad that could have led to the mistake mentioned in the text. \nSimilarly, we think that this condition is in harmony with sound methodology and is a valid condition. No one should disagree on this point who understands anything about the principles of academic criticism. Denying that a text is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) should mean that there is a weak link in the chain of narration that led us to mistakenly believe that this hadith is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), when in fact it is not. \nImam ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) – who is prominent in terms of knowledge and faith, and was the first one to write on the topic of usool al-fiqh – said: \nIf a hadith is narrated by trustworthy narrators from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then that is sufficient to regard it as a sound hadith. \nIkhtilaaf al-Hadith, in al-Umm (10/107). \nAnd he said: \nThere is no other way to determine whether a hadith is sound or otherwise except by knowing how honest and trustworthy the narrators are, with the exception of very few hadiths. \nAr-Risaalah (para. 1099) \nAnd he also said: \nMuslims of good character are those who are good and sound in and of themselves… As for what they say and do, it is to be regarded as sound and acceptable, unless we find something in their actions that indicate otherwise. So we should be cautious with them in cases where their actions differ from what is expected of them. \nAr-Risaalah (para. 1029-1030); see also al-Umm (8/518-51 9) \nAfter narrating some of the academic principles concerning this matter, which is something that he discussed a great deal in his various books, Imam ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) says that what he stated – some of which we have quoted here – is not the view of only a few scholars, or his own personal view; rather these are the principles on which there was consensus among the scholars who came before him. He says: \nAt the beginning of this book of mine, I quoted, in support of what I discuss of principles and guidelines, from a number of earlier scholars who had knowledge of the Qur’an and Sunnah, different scholarly opinions, analogy and rational thinking, and none of them differed with another. They said: This is the view of the scholars among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, the Taabi‘een, and the generation who followed them, and it is our view. Whoever diverges from this path is, in our view, diverging from the path of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the path of the scholars who came after them, until the present day, and he is one of the people of ignorance. And all of them said: we cannot see anything but the consensus of the scholars in all regions, unanimously agreeing to regard as ignorant the one who departs from this path. And they – or most of them – went even further and expressed more stringent views with regard to the one who departs from this path, but there is no need to quote them here. \nIkhtilaaf al-Hadith, al-Umm (10/21). See also: ar-Risaalah (para. 1236-1249). \nThe first thing that the one who rejected a hadith that is attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) must do is research and find out the identity of the narrator who was mistaken in his transmission of this hadith. If the one who denies the hadith cannot find an acceptable reason in the isnaad for rejecting the hadith, then this indicates that he is mistaken in his methodology. It also indicates that it is essential to have another look and try to understand the hadith and the Qur’an and the aims and goals of sharee‘ah. \nSo how about if the hadith was narrated with the soundest isnaads on the face of the earth? How about if the hadith was narrated via many chains of transmission – as is the case with most of the hadiths that are rejected by the proponents of “enlightenment” – and from a number of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them)?  \nThe third condition: \nOne should express his reservations about a hadith as a personal view based on his own reasoning, which may be right or wrong, and he should avoid stating his view as certainty, as if it is the correct view. He should also avoid making accusations against others who differ with him or casting aspersions on the intelligence of Muslim scholars. This applies in cases where there is a valid reason to hold such a view, and provided that one is qualified to speak about such matters and is proficient in the skills needed to understand and research them. A hadith may appear to be da‘eef (weak) to one scholar for a particular reason, but he should not speak in accusatory tones of those who accepted the hadith. \nWhoever does not comply with these three conditions and persists in denying and rejecting the hadiths is exposing himself to grave danger, because it is not permissible for a Muslim to reach a conclusion that is not based on proper methodology and without following any guidelines, and criticise other scholars (who disagree with him), otherwise he may fall into sin and error. \nImam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever rejects the hadith of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is on the brink of doom. End quote. \nAl-Hasan ibn ‘Ali al-Barbahaari said: \nIf you hear a man casting aspersions upon a hadith or denying a hadith, or giving precedence to something else over a hadith, then suspect his commitment to Islam, for he is undoubtedly following whims and desires and innovation. \nIf you hear a man, when you quote a hadith, showing no interest in it on the basis that he only wants to hear quotations from the Qur’an, you should not doubt that he is a man who is following the path of the heretics, so get up and leave him, and bid him farewell. End quote.\nSharh as-Sunnah (113-119)\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhatever the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) narrates from his Lord, it is obligatory to believe in it, whether we understand its meaning or not, because he is the most truthful one [namely the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)]. Whatever it says in the Qur’an and Sunnah, every believer must believe in it, even if he does not understand its meaning. End quote.\nMajmoo‘ al-Fataawa (3/41)\nSee also the answers to questions no. 245, 9067 and 20153\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, the acceptance of authentic (saheeh) hadith is considered vital for understanding and practicing the religion correctly. A hadith is classified as saheeh if it meets specific standards of authenticity in terms of its chain of narrators (isnad) and the content (matn).\n\n1. **Rejecting Saheeh Hadith**: Rejecting a proven saheeh hadith without valid reason or evidence may indicate a serious issue in the understanding of the religion. Such rejection is often viewed with concern among scholars, as it can lead to misguidance.\n\n2. **The Importance of Saheeh Hadith**: Saheeh hadith play a crucial role in explaining the Quran and providing guidance in various aspects of life, including legal rulings, moral conduct, and spirituality. By accepting these hadith, Muslims maintain a connection to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n3. **Conditions for Rejection**: If someone rejects a saheeh hadith, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind their rejection. They must provide credible evidence or reasoning based on further knowledge, scholarly interpretations, or context. \n\n4. **Scholarly Consensus**: Scholars emphasize the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding the context of hadith. Disputes may arise over certain narrations, but a systematic approach based on the principles of hadith science must be followed.\n\nIn conclusion, while individuals are encouraged to engage critically with the texts and have their questions and doubts addressed, outright rejection of a saheeh hadith without scholarly backing or understanding can lead to confusion and deviation from the authentic teachings of Islam. It's always advisable for individuals to consult knowledgeable scholars to clarify such matters."

But Zayd \n    ibn ‘Ali did not meet ‘Utbah.\n\n    End quote from Majma‘ az-Zawaa’id \n    (10/93) \n\n    There is corroborating evidence for this \n    hadeeth in the marfoo‘ hadeeth of Ibn Mas‘ood: “If the mount of one of you \n    disappears in the wilderness, let him call out: ‘O slaves of Allah, bring it \n    back to me,’ for Allah has (angels) present on earth who will bring it back \n    to you.” \n\n    This was narrated by at-Tabaraani in \n    al-Mu‘jam al-Kabeer (10/217); Abu Ya‘la in his Musnad (9/177). It \n    is also da‘eef; it was classed as such by al-Haythami in Majma‘ \n    az-Zawaa’id (10/132), al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Sharh al-Adhkaar \n    (5/150); al-Haafiz as-Sakhkhaawi in al-Ibtihaaj bi Adhkaar al-Musaafir \n    wa’l-Haaj (p. 39). \n\n    Shaykh al-Albaani discussed this hadeeth \n    in detail in as-Silsilah ad-Da‘eefah, where he (may Allah have mercy \n    on him) said: \n\n    In addition to the fact that this hadeeth \n    is da‘eef (weak), there is nothing in the text to suggest that it is \n    permissible to seek the help of the dead, such as the awliya’ (“saints”; \n    close friends of Allah) and the righteous, because it clearly indicates that \n    what is meant by the slaves of Allah here is some creation other than human \n    beings. \n\n    This is based on the fact that in the \n    first hadeeth he says: “for Allah has (angels) present on earth who will \n    bring it back to you,” and in this hadeeth he says: “Allah has slaves whom \n    we do not see.” \n\n    This description can only apply to the \n    angels or the jinn, because they are the ones who we do not usually see. … \n    So it is not permissible to include with them Muslims among the jinn or \n    humans whom they call “men of the unseen,” such as the awliya’ and the \n    righteous, whether they are alive or dead. Seeking help from them and \n    seeking their aid is blatant shirk, because they cannot hear the \n    supplication, and even if they could hear it, they would not be able to \n    respond and fulfil the request. \n\n    This is clearly stated in many verses, \n    including the passage in which Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “And those, whom you invoke or call \n    upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the thin membrane over the date \n    stone).\n\n    If you invoke (or call upon) them, they \n    hear not your call, and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant \n    it (your request) to you.

Whether a specific hadith is sahih can depend on various factors, including the chain of narration and the integrity of the narrators.\n\nIf there is a specific hadith or context you are referring to, it would be useful to examine it closely, including consulting reliable sources or scholars who specialize in hadith studies.

If one of you gets lost in the wilderness, let him call out, ‘Help me, O slaves of Allah.’” \nAl-Bazzaar said:\nWe do not know of these words being narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in this wording except this version with this isnaad.\nEnd quote from Musnad al-Bazzaar (11/181) \nThere are two problems with this hadeeth: \n1.It is based on the narration of Usaamah ibn Zayd al-Laythi\nHe is one of the narrators concerning whom the scholars of al-jarh wa at-ta‘deel (evaluation of hadeeth narrators) differed. Some of them regarded him as thiqah (trustworthy), and others regarded him as da‘eef (weak). Whatever the case, there is some doubt about his memory and precision. \nImam Ahmad said: If you examine the hadeeth he narrated, you will find some oddness in it.\nEnd quote from al-Kaamil fi Du‘afa’ ar-Rijaal (2/76) \nAl-Haafiz adh-Dhahabi said concerning him:\nHe is sadooq (honest) but sometimes gets confused. The view of Yahya al-Qattaan differed concerning him. Ahmad said: He is nothing. An-Nasaa’i said: He is not qawiy (strong). Ibn ‘Adiyy said: There is nothing wrong with him. \nEnd quote from al-Mughni fi ad-Du‘afa’ (1/66) \nSimilarly, al-Haafiz said concerning him in at-Taqreeb: He is (honest) but sometimes gets confused.\nEnd quote from Taqreeb at-Tahdheeb (p. 98) \n2.Those who narrated it from Usaamah ibn Zayd differed about how  he narrated this hadeeth. Some of them narrated it from him in a marfoo ‘ report, as the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and some narrated it in a mawqoof report as the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him).\nThe only one who narrated it as a marfoo‘ report was Haatim ibn Ismaa‘eel. His report was narrated by al-Bazzaar in his Musnad (4922). \nFour narrators differed from him. They are: \n1.‘Abdullah ibn Farookh. His report was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan (1/325)\n2.Rawh ibn ‘Ubaadah. His report was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan (10/140)\n3.Ja‘far ibn ‘Awn. His report was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan (10/140)\n4.Abu Khaalid al-Ahmar. His report was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (6/91)\nAll of them narrated from Usaamah ibn Zayd al-Laythi, and regarded it as the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas. \nUndoubtedly the mawqoof report (with an isnaad going back to the Sahaabi – Ibn Abbaas – and not the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – is more likely to be sound, because the number of its narrators is greater and they are more precise, so they are less likely to have made mistakes and get confused. \nImam ash-Shaafa‘i said: If there are several narrators (whose reports concur), it is more likely to be transmitted correctly than if there is only one narrator.\nEnd quote from Ikhtilaaf al-Hadeeth , p. 177 \nAl-Haafiz Shams ad-Deen adh-Dhahabi said: If a hadeeth is narrated by a trustworthy narrator with an isnaad, and he narrated it as a mawqoof or mursal report, but a number of his trustworthy peers differed from him, then what counts is that on which those trustworthy narrators are agreed, because a single narrator may make mistakes. In this case there is a clear mistake with no way to explain it, and what matters is what the majority agree on.\nal-Mooqazah p. 52 \nWhat is more likely to be the case with this hadeeth – if we determine that it is acceptable – is that it is the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas, and not the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). \nAl-Bayhaqi said: This is mawqoof (and its isnaad ends with) Ibn ‘Abbaas, and it has been applied by some righteous people, and they found it to be true from experience.\nEnd quote from al-Adaab, p. 269 \nAmong those who acted upon this hadeeth was Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. \n‘Abdullah the son of Imam Ahmad said: I heard my father say: I heard my father say: I did Hajj five times, twice riding and three times walking, or twice walking and three times riding. I lost my way during one Hajj and I was walking, so I began to call out: O slaves of Allah, show me the way. I kept doing that until I found the road.\nEnd quote from Masaa’il al-Imam Ahmad Riwaayat Ibnihi ‘Abdullah (p. 245). See also: Tareekh Dimashq by Ibn ‘Asaakir (5/298). \nSecondly: \nOne of the important matters to which attention must be paid is that the guideline on the kind of seeking help that constitutes shirk is “asking of anyone other than Allah for that which no one can do except Allah.” \nAs for seeking help from other created beings in matters that they are able to do, that has nothing to do with shirk at all. \nThe report mentioned states that there is a type of angels, who are alive, in the sense of a life that is natural and appropriate for them. Allah has put them on earth to help those who are lost and guide them to the correct route, so whoever asks them for help is asking for help from a created being regarding something that he is able to do, and Allah has created him for this role. \nThere is a great difference between this and asking a created being who is dead or absent to heal his sick loved one, or to bless him with a child, or to make childbirth easy for his wife, or to have mercy on him and forgive him, and other things that no one can do except Allah. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:\nIstighaathah means seeking ghawth (help) which is removal of hardship. A created being may be asked for help with regard to matters that he is able to help with, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“but if they seek your help in religion, it is your duty to help them”\n[al-Anfaal 8:72]\n“The man of his (own) party asked him for help against his foe”\n[al-Qasas 28:15]\n“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety)”\n[al-Maa’idah 5:2]. \nBut with regard to that which no one can do except Allah, it should only be sought from Allah. End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (1/103). \nAnd he said:\nAs for that which no one can do except Allah, may He be exalted, it is not permissible to seek it from anyone except Allah, may He be glorified; it should not be sought from the angels or the Prophets or anyone else, and it is not permissible to say to anyone other than Allah “Forgive me” or “Give us rain” or “Grant us victory over the disbelieving people” or “Guide our hearts” and so on. … As for that which humans are able to do, that does not come under this heading.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (1/329) \nAnd he said:\nThe Sunnah is that the living person may be asked to offer du‘aa’ (supplication), just as he may be asked for anything else that he is able to do. As for created beings who are absent or dead, they are not to be asked for anything.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (1/344) \nAnd he said:\nThings that no one is able to do except Allah are not to be sought from anyone else, such as sending down rain, causing crops to grow, relief of distress, guidance away from the wrong paths, and forgiveness of sins. No one in creation is able to do these things; no one is able to do them except Allah.\nEnd quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (1/370) \nWe have quoted a great deal from Shaykh al-Islam about this point because there is a great deal of confusion about it among those who follow whims and desires and innovations (bid‘ah), who seek to confuse others also. \nShaykh Saalih Aal ash-Shaykh said: The hadeeth does not support the claim of the followers of falsehood, that one may ask of the dead and others. Rather it clearly states that those who are addressed by the one who has lost his way are the angels, who can hear what he says to them and are able to respond by their Lord’s leave, because they are alive and have been given the ability to help the one who is lost find his way. They are the ones who are addressed as slaves of Allah; they are alive and can hear, and can respond by doing what their Lord enables them to do, which is to help the one who is lost in the wilderness find his way. Whoever quotes these reports as meaning that one may call upon a specific person by name is telling lies against the Messenger of Allah, and he has not paid attention to and contemplated the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and that is characteristic of those who follow whims and desires. \nOnce this is clear, we may say that this report contains words that may be said and one may be lenient concerning it, despite the fact that it is da‘eef, because it is in accordance with the basic teachings of Islam and is not contrary to the texts of the Qur’an and Prophetic hadeeths. Moreover, it is specific to a situation as mentioned in the report, because this is one of the matters concerning which it is not permissible to make analogy, as beliefs are based on tawqeef [i.e., they can only be known through divine Revelation and sound texts of hadeeth, with no room for ijtihad].  This is what we understand. (p. 56) \nTo sum up: \nWith regard to that which no one can do except Allah, and that which is unique to His Lordship, such as giving life, causing death, and granting provision… All of that is not to be sought from anyone except Him, may He be glorified. Whoever seeks help from anyone other than Allah with regard to such matters has committed shirk (association of others with Allah). \nWith regard to that which created beings are able to do, there is nothing wrong with asking for it from those who are able to do it, or seeking their help with regard to it, subject to two conditions: that the one whose help is sought is alive and present, and that he is able to do that thing. \nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 132642\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you mentioned is often invoked in discussions about seeking help from others, and it's essential to contextualize it within Islamic teachings. The narration refers to invoking the support of the righteous—or those who are alive and present, like fellow Muslims—when in distress or need. However, seeking help in this manner should be understood within the framework of Islamic monotheism (Tawheed).\n\nIn Islam, it is important to distinguish between asking for assistance in a situation and invoking Allah's help directly. While it is permissible to seek help from others who are alive and capable, this should not cross the line into supplicating them as one would to Allah or attributing to them any divine qualities.\n\nThe hadith highlights the community's role in supporting each other. When someone calls for help from \"the slaves of Allah,\" it emphasizes the reliance on fellow believers who can help in dire situations. Nonetheless, believers are ultimately encouraged to place their trust in Allah alone, seeking His help as the primary source of assistance.\n\nIn summary, while it is permissible to call upon others for assistance in practical matters, the core belief in Islam must remain that ultimate assistance and support come from Allah alone. Hence, invoking others should be understood in this light and should not contradict the concept of Tawheed."

        "question": "He is asking about original copies of Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Saheeh Muslim!",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    One of the most important things that the \n    educated Muslim, or the Muslim who is acquainted with the classical legacy, \n    should understand is that stirring up doubts is easy and is something that \n    anyone could do, to stir up doubts about anything, even about basic givens \n    and common-sense issues on which people base their rational thinking. The \n    matter may even go so far that some of those who got carried away with \n    doubts and specious arguments ended up denying their own existence, and \n    doubted everything around them, which led to them being admitted to mental \n    health clinics, because they drifted so far from common sense and sound \n    human nature. \n\n    This is how we deal with many so-called \n    specious arguments which are, in reality, nothing but illusions uttered by \n    some people who are causing us trouble at this time. This always compels us \n    to start from the very beginning in establishing principles of sound \n    rational thinking in various fields of knowledge and education. \n\n    What is mentioned in the question is one \n    such example. If what the questioner meant by “original copies” is \n    manuscripts that the author wrote in his own hand, then according what \n    rational thinking or logic can it be said that it is essential that the \n    original manuscripts be extant in order to accept that a particular book is \n    correctly attributed to its author?! How many books are there in the world, \n    since people learned how to write, that could meet this irrational \n    condition?! \n\n    In order to understand how irrational \n    those who stipulate that condition are, all you have to do is imagine that \n    one of them entered a venerable library or well-known publishing house or \n    international bookstore and said to the person in charge, I will not accept \n    the attribution of any books you have in this huge store unless you give me \n    the original manuscript, written by the author himself, so that I will be \n    certain that these books are soundly attributed to their authors! Doing this \n    would be ignoring all the customs and academic and legal requirements which \n    guarantee to us nowadays that the book is sound and that it will not be \n    claimed by anyone other than the author, such as requirements to register \n    books in the National Library, to get permission to publish, making books \n    well-known to critics and providing well-established evidence to that \n    effect, and other similar academic ways of proving such matters. \n\n    We know for certain that some of those who \n    specialise in producing specious arguments know deep down in their hearts \n    how foolish and silly are the things they suggest and say, but at the same \n    time they persist in saying it because they know that merely stating his \n    specious with regard to anything that exists will inevitably have some \n    influence on people’s hearts and minds. Hence whatever results he gets will \n    suffice him, even if he only manages to confuse a few people. What matters \n    to him is that he shuffles the cards and causes confusion with regard to \n    sound ways of thinking. \n\n    However, Saheeh al-Bukhaari was \n    heard by ninety thousand men from Imam al-Bukhaari himself (may Allah have \n    mercy on him), as was stated by one of his most famous students, namely \n    Muhammad ibn Yoosuf al-Farbari (d. 320 AH). See: Tareekh Baghdaad \n    (2/9); Tareekh al-Islam (7/375). Al-Farbari’s narration of Saheeh \n    al-Bukhaari was famous because he lived for a long time and was precise \n    in copying it out. He heard it from al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on \n    him) over three years, then a number of trustworthy narrators learned it \n    from him, and from them this book became well-known. \n\n    Al-Mustamli (d. 376 AH) – one of those who \n    narrated it from Muhammad ibn Yoosuf al-Farbari – said: I copied the book of \n    al-Bukhaari from its original text that was with Ibn Yoosuf, and I saw that \n    he had not completed it yet; there were many blank pages there, including \n    some isnaads after which he had not written any hadeeths, and some hadeeths \n    for which he had not written any isnaads. So we tried to complete that.\n\n    End quote. Narrated by al-Baaji in at-Ta‘deel \n    wa’t-Tajreeh (1/310) \n\n    The Saheeh was narrated from al-Farbari \n    by a number of trustworthy narrators, among the most famous of whom were the \n    following: \n\n    Al-Mustamli (d. 376 AH), whose name was \n    Ibraaheem ibn Ahmad\n\n    Al-Hamawi Khateeb Sarkhas (d. 381 AH), \n    whose name was ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad\n\n    Abu’l-Haytham al-Kashmeehani (d. 389 AH), \n    whose name was Muhammad ibn Makki\n\n    Abu ‘Ali ash-Shabwi, whose name was \n    Muhammad ibn ‘Umar\n\n    Ibn as-Sakan al-Bazzaaz (d. 353 AH), whose \n    name was Sa‘eed ibn ‘Uthmaan\n\n    Abu Zayd al-Mirwazi (d. 371 AH), whose \n    name was Muhammad ibn Ahmad\n\n    Abu Ahmad al-Jarjaani (d. 373 AH), whose \n    name was Muhammad ibn Muhammad \n\n    Among the trustworthy students of al-Bukhaari \n    who heard his Saheeh directly from him and transmitted it to the \n    people with its isnaads in written form was the imam, hafiz, faqeeh and \n    qaadi, Abu Ishaaq Ibraaheem ibn Ma‘qil ibn al-Hajjaaj an-Nasafi (d. 295). \n    The copy of an- Nasafi was transmitted by Imam al-Khattaabi (may Allah have \n    mercy on him), as he said in his commentary A‘laam al-Hadeeth \n    (1/105): We heard most of this book from the narration of Ibraaheem ibn \n    Ma‘qil an- Nasafi. Khalaf ibn Muhammad al-Khayyaam told us: Ibraaheem ibn \n    Ma‘qil told us, from him. \n\n    This is the most famous way that the \n    scholars of hadith had: they would read their books to their students, or \n    their students would read their books to them. Then those books would become \n    well-known through the students and narrators, not through the original \n    manuscript of the author, which was one copy that he kept for himself. There \n    were no printing presses or publishing houses at that time; instead of \n    printing presses there was the narration of students with strong isnaads. \n\n    What would any researcher find more \n    authentic than the transmission of trustworthy narrators narrating from the \n    manuscripts that were read to (and checked with) the author himself and \n    approved by him, as they said concerning the copy of as-Saghaanni: He copied \n    it from the manuscript that was read to the author (may Allah have mercy on \n    him)”?\n\n    See: Fayd al-Baari by al-Kashmiri. \n\n    If you want to ask about how old the \n    manuscripts that are extant today are, the Orientalist Manjana said in \n    Cambridge in 1936 CE that the oldest manuscript he had come across up to \n    that point was written in 370 AH, according to the narration of al-Mirwazi \n    from al-Farbari. See Tareekh at-Turaath by Fu’aad Sizkeen (1/228). \n\n    One of the most famous manuscripts of the \n    book that has come down to us in modern times is the copy of al-Haafiz Abu \n    ‘Ali as-Sadafi (d. 514 AH), which he copied from the manuscript written by \n    Muhammad ibn ‘Ali ibn Mahmoud, which was read to Abu Dharr (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) and has his writing on it too. It was kept by al-‘Allaamah at-Taahir \n    ibn ‘Ashoor, who borrowed it from the library of Tobruk in Libya. \n\n    There is also the copy of the imam and \n    hafiz Sharaf ad-Deen ‘Ali ibn Ahmad al-Yoonayni, who is known as al-Ba‘li \n    al-Hanbali (d. 701 AH). He checked it against the original copy that was \n    read to al-Haafiz Abu Dharr al-Harawi, and the original copy that was read \n    to al-Aseeli, and the original copy al-Haafiz Ibn ‘Asaakir, and the original \n    copy that was read to Abu’l-Waqt in the presence of the grammarian and \n    linguist Ibn Maalik, the author of al-Alfiyyah (d. 672 AH). \n\n    And so on… if we were to keep listing the \n    copies of as-Saheeh that are extant in the manuscript libraries of \n    the world, and how close they were to the time when as-Saheeh was \n    written, and the large numbers of those who copied and checked them, and how \n    trustworthy they were, and how they checked their copies against the \n    authoritative main copies, that would take a great deal of time. It is \n    sufficient for you to go to one of the libraries where manuscripts are kept \n    and ask about Saheeh al-Bukhaari; you will find hundreds of copies \n    with sound chains of transmission going back to Imam al-Bukhaari himself. \n    Al-Fihris ash-Shaamil lists 2327 locations in various libraries in which \n    there are manuscripts of this book.\n\n    See: al-Fihris ash-Shaamil li’t-Turaath \n    al-‘Arabi al-Islami al-Makhtoot, al-Hadeeth an-Nabawi wa ‘Uloomuhu \n    (1/493-565). \n\n    With regard to Saheeh Muslim, it is \n    no less well-known and widespread than the Saheeh of Imam al-Bukhaari, \n    as Brockelmann said: Saheeh Muslim almost matches Saheeh al-Bukhaari \n    in the number of manuscripts and their presence in most libraries, as he \n    stated in The History of Arabic Literature (3/180) \n\n    It has many chains of transmission which \n    confirm that the book is soundly attributed to its author. The number of \n    such chains of transmission is almost unlimited, to such an extent that a \n    number of scholars wrote books just to discuss the chains of transmission of\n    Saheeh Muslim; there are eight such books, one of the last of which \n    was the book by al-Kattaani (d. 1327 AH) entitled Juz’ Asaaneed \n    Saheeh Muslim. \n\n    Shaykh Mashhoor Hasan Salmaan said: \n\n    A group of people learned this book from \n    Muslim, one of the most famous of whom was Ibraaheem ibn Muhammad ibn \n    Sufyaan. He heard it from its author no less than three times, and he \n    checked it against the copy of his shaykh, Muslim. Muslim’s copy was very \n    precious and dear to him; he carried it with him to ar-Rayy and placed it \n    before Abu Zur‘ah ar-Raazi and Ibn Waarah looked at it. A number of scholars \n    learned it from Sufyaan; among them was al-Jaloodi. His copy was in \n    circulation among the students and some of them made a copy of it… Many of \n    these copies were very precise and were read to some prominent scholars and \n    checked against other manuscripts. Therefore the scholars used it as a \n    reference for research and discussion; they used to refer to it when dealing \n    with issues and problems. There are many manuscript copies of as-Saheeh \n    in libraries throughout the world, and hardly any library is without it. \n    These copies vary in the dates at which they were copied and they vary in \n    condition. \n\n    In the library of al-Qarawiyyeen in Fez up \n    till now there is a very precious copy of it; this is the copy of Ibn Khayr \n    al-Ishbeeli, which he checked many times (against other manuscripts); he \n    heard it read to him and he read it to other shaykhs, to such an extent that \n    it is regarded as the greatest extant manuscript of Saheeh Muslim \n    in North Africa. Written on it in the handwriting of Ibn Khayr is a note \n    stating that he checked it against three other original manuscripts of the \n    copy of al-Haafiz Abu ‘Ali al-Jiyaani. \n\n    End quote from al-Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj \n    wa Manhajuhu fi’s-Saheeh (1/375-376) \n\n    As for the claim that “some of the \n    commentators on al-Bukhaari discussed the meaning of some hadeeths that are \n    not in al-Bukhaari”, we have not found a single example of that. Differences \n    in the reports in Saheeh al-Bukhaari only occur in a few, very minor \n    cases having to do with the isnaads or some phrases in the texts, or the \n    chapter headings. But to suggest that there are some independent hadeeths \n    under some headings that were mentioned in some manuscripts but not others, \n    we could not find any example of that. \n\n    Even if we assume that they exist, it is \n    not something to object to or find strange. If the narrators who narrated \n    from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) differed \n    sometimes, whereby some of the Sahaabah narrated the hadeeth with a \n    particular wording, and others narrated it with a different wording, or some \n    of the Sahaabah narrated a hadeeth and others did not remember it, in dozens \n    of examples, that does not undermine the principle of the Prophetic Sunnah, \n    and it does not shed doubt on the trustworthiness of the Sahaabah who \n    narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). So it \n    is more appropriate that the fact that there are slight differences between \n    the narrators of al-Jaami‘ as-Saheeh should not undermine the basic \n    authenticity of the book or its trustworthiness or its hadeeths and \n    reports. \n\n    We do not doubt that a lack of experience \n    in dealing with the classical Islamic legacy – and indeed a lack of \n    knowledge about the nature of history and manuscripts altogether – is the \n    reason for such misleading ideas or extreme ignorance and lack of \n    understanding on the part of the one who says that. \n\n    Otherwise, anyone who has any knowledge of \n    these branches of knowledge will be certain that minor differences in \n    reports or manuscripts in classical books is something natural in the light \n    of the fact that people in the past relied on copying by hand, and because \n    means of communication were very simple, and copyists were sometimes \n    imprecise in adhering to the original text; indeed they were sometimes \n    unaware of alterations that the author himself had introduced to his book \n    that would lead to some differences in the copies, as happened in the case \n    of Sunan at-Tirmidhi, Sunan Abi Dawood, al-Muwatta’ by \n    Imam Maalik, and the Musnad of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Indeed that \n    also happened in the case of the poetry of the Jaahiliyyah before that, and \n    in the books of Plato, Aristotle, and the entire legacy of Greek philosophy, \n    and in the case of both the Torah and the Gospel. \n\n    We hope that by giving these brief \n    highlights, readers will be alerted to the nature of these specious \n    arguments that are made and will realise that a little rational thinking, \n    with a little experience, will be sufficient to ward off all these specious \n    arguments. \n\n    See: Riwaayaat wa Nusakh al-Jaami‘ as-Saheeh \n    li’l-Imam Abu ‘Abdullah Muhammad ibn Ismaa‘eel al-Bukhaari: Diraasah wa \n    Tahleel, by Dr. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Kareem ibn ‘Ubayd, which was of \n    great use to us in preparing the answer given above. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",

The original manuscript written by Imam al-Bukhari does not exist in its entirety today. However, numerous early copies and manuscripts have been found, and scholars reference these historical texts to study the hadith within this compilation. The most authentic versions are those that were meticulously transmitted by scholars through generations.\n\n2. **Sahih Muslim**: Similar to al-Bukhari, the original copy of Sahih Muslim does not exist today. However, early manuscripts and copies have been preserved and are used for scholarly purposes. The authenticity of the hadiths in Sahih Muslim is also held in high esteem within the Muslim community.\n\nBoth collections serve as foundational texts for hadith literature, and their contents are considered highly credible by the majority of Sunni Muslims.

If a person omits it deliberately, then he has committed a grave sin and he must make it up according to many scholars; others favoured the view that he cannot make it up, but he is required to repent, pray for forgiveness, regret it, and do a lot of righteous deeds. \nIs there any special prayer on the last Friday of Ramadan?\nThe report that speaks of a prayer that may be offered by one who omitted a prayer deliberately until the time for it ended, so that it may be an expiation for his deeds, is a lie and is falsely attributed to Islamic teaching. There follow some comments of the scholars concerning that: \n1. Ash-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“The hadith “Whoever prays the five obligatory prayers of the night and day on the last Friday of Ramadan, that will make up for what he missed of prayers during that year” is undoubtedly mawdu‘ (fabricated). I could not find it in any of the books in which the authors compiled fabricated hadiths, but it is well-known among a group of people who claim to have knowledge in the city of San‘a nowadays, and many of them do that! I do not know who fabricated it and told it to them; may Allah curse the liars.” (Al-Ahadith al-Mawdu‘ah, p. 54) \n2. The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said: \n“Prayer is an act of worship and the basic principle concerning it is tawqif i.e., stopping at what has been narrated in Shari‘ah (and not introducing anything new); the issue of making up the prayers and details of how to do that is something to be learned from texts and it is not valid to refer to anything in this regard except the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the consensus based on both of them or one of them. \nThere is no proof from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or from his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), or from the leaders of guidance (may Allah have mercy on them) that they offered this prayer or instructed or encouraged others to do so. \nIf it was something established, then his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would have known about it and would have transmitted it to us, and the leaders of guidance after them would have guided us to it. But there is no proof to that effect from any of them in word or in deed. \nThat indicates that what is mentioned in the question about the “prayer to make up for the prayers of a lifetime (salat al-qada al-‘umri)” is a bid‘ah that has been introduced into Islam for which Allah has not prescribed. It is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.” (Agreed upon). Rather what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to do is to make up the prayers that one misses because of falling asleep or forgetting until the time for them ends, and he explained to us that we should offer those prayers as they are usually offered when we wake up or remember, not on the last Friday of Ramadan.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Daimah, 8/167, 168) Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud \n3. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \nThere is a group of people who have a custom in Ramadan, which is to offer the five obligatory prayers after a prayer on the last Friday (of Ramadan), and they say that this is to make up for any obligatory prayers that a person did not offer or that he forgot in Ramadan. What is the ruling on this prayer? \nHe replied: \n“The ruling concerning this prayer is that it is an innovation (bid‘ah) and it has no basis in Islamic teachings; it will only take a person further away from his Lord, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance will be in the Fire.” No matter how much the followers of an innovation like it and regard it as good in their own minds, it is something bad before Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance will be in the Fire.” These five daily prayers that a person makes up on the last Friday of Ramadan have no basis in Islamic teaching. Moreover, we say: has this person missed only five prayers? Perhaps he missed a number of days, not a number of prayers? \nWhat matters is that so long as a person is aware that he has missed prayers, he must make them up when he realises that, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it, let him offer it when he remembers it” (Agreed upon). But if a person does these five prayers to be on the safe side – as they claim – that is something reprehensible and is not permitted.” (Majmu‘ Fatawa ash-Shaykh al-‘Uthaymin, 12/227, 228) \n4. Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) was asked: \nI read a hadith from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in which he said: “Whoever misses a prayer during his life and cannot remember what it was, let him get up on the last Friday of Ramadan and pray four rak‘ahs with one tashahhud, reciting in each rak‘ah the Opening of the Book (i.e., al-Fatihah) and Surat al-Qadr fifteen times, and Surat al-Kawthar the same number of times, and let him say in his intention: I intend to pray four rak‘ahs as expiation for what I have missed of prayers.” How sound is this hadith? \nHe replied: \n“There is no basis for this in the Sunnah of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). What is proven from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is that he said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, let him offer it when he remembers it. There is no expiation for that except this” (agreed upon). With regard to the prayers that you missed previously, if you missed them because of sleep – for example – or because you were unconscious, or for some excuse that you thought made it permissible for you to delay them, then what you must do is make them up and offer them in order. If you missed them deliberately, then the more correct of the two scholarly views is that you must repent to Allah, because the one who misses prayer deliberately is in a grave position, even if he does not deny that they are obligatory. The correct view is that he has become a disbeliever by doing that. So you must repent to Allah if you missed them deliberately, and you must persist in offering prayers regularly in the future, and may Allah accept your repentance. \nBut if you missed them because of sleep or unconsciousness, or something else that prevented you from offering them on time, then you have no choice but to make them up. As for offering this prayer that you mentioned at the end of Ramadan in this manner, there is no basis for that in the Islamic religion, and it will not make up for the prayers that you missed.”\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concept of prayer and its obligations is taken very seriously. The last Friday of Ramadan is significant for many Muslims, but there is no specific, established ruling in the Hadith or the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that states that the prayer on this day serves as an expiation for missed obligatory prayers.\n\nObligatory prayers (Salah) are fundamental acts of worship, and if someone misses them, they are encouraged to make them up as soon as possible. The general understanding is that one should seek repentance (Tawbah) for the missed prayers and perform them to the best of their ability. Engaging in extra prayers, such as those performed during Ramadan or special Friday prayers, is highly encouraged and meritorious, but they do not serve as a replacement for obligatory prayers that have been missed.\n\nAs always, if there are concerns or specific situations, it's advisable to consult a knowledgeable scholar or an imam for personalized advice."

        "question": "Will a person be brought to account for whatever crosses his mind of good or evil?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhaari (6491) and Muslim (131) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, relating from his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted: “Allah decreed good deeds and bad deeds, then He explained that. Whoever thinks of doing a good deed then does not do it, Allah will write it down as one complete good deed. If he thinks of doing a good deed and then does it, Allah [may He be glorified and exalted] will write it down between ten and seven hundred fold, or many more. If he thinks of doing a bad deed then he does not do it, Allah will write it down as one complete good deed, and if he thinks of it then does it, Allah will write it down as one bad deed.” \nAl-Bukhaari (5269) and Muslim (127) also narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will forgive my ummah for whatever crosses their minds so long as they do not act upon it or speak of it.” \nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThese texts refer to four matters: the recording of good deeds and bad deeds, and thinking of good deeds and bad deeds. This is four matters.  \nThen he said: \n… The third matter: thinking of good deeds. It is recorded as one complete good deed even if he does not do it, as it says in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas and elsewhere. … In the hadeeth of Khuraym ibn Faatik it says: “… If a person thinks of doing a good deed but then does not do it and Allah knows that he thought of it and was keen to do it, He records for him one good deed…” [Narrated by Ahmad, 18556. al-Arna’oot said: Its isnaad is hasan. It was mentioned by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah]. This indicates that what is meant by “thinking of” here is the determination and resolve that are usually present when one is keen to do an action, not merely a passing thought that is not accompanied by any resolve or determination. \nAbu’d-Darda’ said: If a person goes to his bed, intending to pray during the night (qiyaam), then sleep overtakes him until morning comes, what he intended to do will be recorded for him. \nIt was narrated that Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyab said: If a person thinks of praying, fasting, going for Hajj or ‘Umrah, or going for jihad, then he is prevented from doing that, Allah will grant him the reward of what he wanted to do. \nAbu ‘Imraan al-Jawni said: It is said to the angel: Record such and such for So and so. He says: O Lord, he did not do it. He says: He intended it. \nZayd ibn Aslam said: A man used to go around among the scholars, saying: Who will tell me of a deed that I may keep doing for Allah, for I do not like any hour of the day or night to come to me except I am striving for the sake of Allah, may He be exalted. It was said to him: You have found what you are looking for. Do good as much as you are able to, then when you become tired or you stop doing it, think about doing it, for the one who thinks about doing a good deed is like the one who does it. \nIf the intention is accompanied by words or effort, the reward is ensured and the one who intended it is like the one who does it, as Abu Kabshah narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“[People] in this world are of four types: a person to whom Allah grants wealth and knowledge, so he fears his Lord with regard to it, upholds his ties of kinship with it, and acknowledges the rights of Allah concerning it – he is of the highest status. (The second is) a person to whom Allah grants knowledge but He does not grant him wealth, so he is sincere in his intention and says: If I had wealth, I would do the same as So and so does. He will be rewarded according to his intention and their reward will be the same. (The third type) is a person to whom Allah grants wealth, but He does not grant him knowledge, so he squanders his wealth without knowledge; he does not fear his Lord concerning it, he does not uphold his ties of kinship with it and he does not acknowledge the rights of Allah concerning it – he is of the worst status. (And the fourth type is) a person to whom Allah does not grant either wealth or knowledge, so he says: If I had wealth, I would do the same as So and so does. He will be requited according to his intention and their burden of sin will be the same.”\nNarrated by Imam Ahmad, at-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani because of corroborating evidence. \nThe phrase “Their reward will be the same” is understood as meaning that they are equal with regard to the basic reward for actions, but not with regard to the multiplication of that reward. Multiplication of reward is only for the one who actually does a deed, not the one who intends it but does not do it. If they were equal in all regards, a tenfold reward would be recorded for the one who thought of a good deed but did not do it, and this is contrary to all the texts. That is indicated by the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward” [an-Nisa’ 4:95]. Ibn ‘Abbaas and others said: Those who sit (at home), above whom those who strive hard and fight are preferred in grades are those who have excuses, and those who sit (at home), above whom those who strive hard and fight are preferred by a huge reward, are those who do not have excuses. \nThen he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe fourth matter is thinking of evil deeds without doing them. In the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas it says that this will be recorded as one complete good deed. Similarly in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, Anas and others it says that it will be recorded as a hasanah (good deed). In the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah it says “for he gave it up for My sake” (Muslim, 129). This indicates that what is meant is that if a person was able to do what he thought of of sin, but gave it up for the sake of Allah, may He be exalted, one good deed will undoubtedly be recorded for him for that, because his refraining from committing that sin for that reason is a righteous deed. \nBut if he thinks of committing a sin, then does not do it for fear of other people, or in order to show off to them, then it was said that he will be punished for refraining from it with that intention, because giving precedence to fear of people over fear of Allah is haraam, just as aiming to show off to people is also haraam. If refraining from the sin is accompanied by such intentions, then he will be punished for refraining. \nAl-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad said: They used to say: Refraining from doing something for the sake of people is showing off and doing it for their sake is shirk. \nBut if he tries to do it by all available means then is prevented from doing it because it is not decreed that he should do it, in that case a number of scholars stated that he will be punished for it, because of the hadeeth, “… so long as he does not speak of it or act upon it.” So if a person strives to commit a sin, then is unable to do it, he has acted upon it. Similarly, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When two Muslims confront one another with their swords, the slayer and the slain will both be in Hell.” I said – or it was said – O Messenger of Allah, (we understand about) the slayer, but what about the slain? He said: “He wanted to kill his companion.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 31: Muslim, 2888). The words “so long as he does not speak of it or act upon it” indicate that if the one who thinks of a sin speaks of what he was thinking of, then he will be punished for thinking of it in that case, because he has committed a sin with his physical faculties, which is speaking with his tongue. That is also indicated by the hadeeth of Abu Kabshah quoted above, who said: (The fourth type of person) says: “If I had wealth, I would do with it what So and so does”, referring to the one who disobeyed Allah with his wealth. He said: “Their burden of sin will be the same.” \nThen he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nBut if he changes his intention and gives up his resolve for no reason, will he be punished for what he thought of of sin, or not? \nThere are two scenarios: \nThe first is if his thinking of sin was a passing thought that he did not dwell on and it did not take root in his heart; rather he disliked it and was put off by it. This will be forgiven; it is like the awful thoughts or whispers that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was asked about, and he said: “That is clear faith.” [Narrated by Muslim, 132] \nWhen the verse (interpretation of the meaning) “…whether you disclose what is in your ownselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills…” [al-Baqarah 2:284] was revealed, that was distressing for the Muslims and they thought that it included these passing thoughts. Then the following verse was revealed, in which it says (interpretation of the meaning): “Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear” [al-Baqarah 2:286]. (Narrated by Muslim, 126). This proved that with regard to that which they had no strength to bear, they would not be punished or brought to account for it, and it became clear that what was meant in the first verse was things that they resolved and intended to do. \nThe second scenario is things that one has resolved and intends to do, that occurred to one’s mind and become established, and one dwells on them. These are of two types: \n(i)Acts of the heart (that have to do with belief), such as doubting or disbelieving in the Oneness of Allah, or Prophethood, or the Prophet’s mission, and other kinds of disbelief and hypocrisy. These are all things for which a person will be punished and by means of which he becomes a disbeliever and a hypocrite.\nWe may add to these all sins that have to do with the heart, such as loving that which Allah hates, hating that which Allah loves, arrogance, self admiration, etc. \n(ii)The second type has to do with that which is not actions of the heart; rather they are physical actions, such as zina, stealing, drinking alcohol, murder, slander and so on. If a person persists in wanting to do such things and resolving to do them, but he shows no outward indication of that, then there are two well-known scholarly views as to whether he will be held accountable for that.\nThe first view is that he will be held accountable for it. Ibn al-Mubaarak said: I asked Sufyaan ath-Thawri: Will a person be held accountable for thinking (of committing a sin)? He said: If he has resolved to do it, he will be held accountable. This view was regarded as more correct by many of the fuqaha’, scholars of hadeeth and scholars of kalaam among our companions and others. They quoted as evidence for that verses such as the following (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And know that Allah knows what is in your minds, so fear Him”\n[al-Baqarah 2:235]\n“but He will call you to account for that which your hearts have earned”\n[al-Baqarah 2:225]. \n(They also quoted as evidence) hadeeths such as that in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Sin is that which wavers in your heart and you do not want the people to find out about it” (narrated by Muslim, 2553). They interpreted the hadeeth “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will forgive my ummah for whatever crosses their minds so long as they do not act upon it or speak of it” as referring to passing thoughts and they said: Whatever a person dwells on and it takes root in his heart is included in what he earns and does, so it is not included in this hadeeth. \nThe second view is that he will not be held accountable for mere intentions in all cases. This view is attributed to ash-Shaafa‘i and is also the view of Ibn Haamid among our companions, based on general meanings. Al-‘Awfi narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas something which is indicative of the same view…\nEnd quote from Jaami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam, commentary on hadeeth no 37 (2/343-353). \nTo sum up: \nIf a person thinks of doing a good deed, and it takes root in his heart and he resolves to do that, what he intended to do will be recorded for him, even if he does not do it, although the reward for the one who does do it is better and greater. \nIf a person thinks of doing a bad deed, then refrains from it for the sake of Allah, one complete good deed will be recorded for him. \nIf a person thinks of doing a bad deed, then refrains from it for the sake of people, or he tries to do it but is prevented from doing so, one bad deed will be recorded against him. \nIf a person thinks of doing it, then he changes his intention after having intended it, if it was only a passing thought he will not be held accountable for it, but if it was one of the deeds of the heart that had nothing to do with physical actions (i.e., it has to do with belief), then he will be held accountable for it. If it was a physical action and he persisted in thinking of it and resolved to do it, then the majority of scholars are of the view that he will be held accountable for it. \nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after quoting al-Baaqillaani’s opinion that the individual will be held accountable in this case: \nAl-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The majority of the early generation and the scholars, including the fuqaha’ and the muhadditheen, are of the same view as al-Qaadi Abu Bakr, because of the hadeeths which indicate that people will be held accountable for actions of the heart (i.e., that have to do with beliefs). \nBut they said: This resolve will be recorded as one bad deed, and it is not the bad deed that the individual thought of, because he did not do it and he refrained from it for a reason other than fear of Allah. But persisting and resolving in and of itself is a sin, so it will be recorded as a sin, and if he does it, it will be recorded as a second sin. But if he refrains from it for fear of Allah, may He be exalted, it will be recorded as a good deed, as it says in the hadeeth, “for he gave it up for My sake”, thus his giving it up out of fear of Allah, may He be exalted, his striving to overcome his nafs that is inclined towards evil, and his going against his whims and desires is in fact a good deed. The type of thinking of an action that is not to be recorded against the individual is the passing thought that does not take root in the heart and is not accompanied by intention or resolve.\nEnd quote from Sharh Muslim, 2/151 \nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) favoured the view that (when a person commits a sin), it will only be recorded as one sin, without any multiplication, so the punishment is for the sin, and thinking of it is not added to it, because if thinking of it were added to the sin, the individual would be punished twice for committing one sin. We cannot say that this may also be applicable to good deeds and that one does a good deed after thinking of it, he should be rewarded for the good deed but not for thinking of it. We say that this is not correct, because if a person does a good deed, a tenfold reward will be recorded for him, and it may be that some of that is as a reward for thinking of doing the good deed. And Allah knows best. End quote. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, a person is not held accountable for thoughts that cross their mind but are not acted upon or sincerely intended. According to various hadiths, it is understood that Allah is Merciful and knows the inner thoughts and struggles of individuals. \n\nFor instance, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Allah has forgiven my Ummah for what occurs in their hearts as long as they do not speak or act upon it\" (for example, seen in Sahih Bukhari). \n\nThis indicates that mere thoughts, whether good or evil, do not result in accountability unless they lead to actions or are intended with sincere intention. Good thoughts that are not followed by action can still be rewarded by Allah, as expressed in other teachings, indicating the recognition of the intention behind those thoughts.\n\nTherefore, while we should strive to cultivate good thoughts and intentions, accountability is emphasized in the actions that follow those thoughts."

        "question": "Is the fasting of Ramadaan only taken up by zakaat al-fitr?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.A hadeeth concerning this was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) but it is da’eef (weak). \nIn al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, al-Suyooti attributed it to Ibn Shaheen in his Targheeb: It was narrated from al-Diya’ from Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The month of Ramadaan is suspended between heaven and earth and is not taken up to Allaah except by zakaat al-fitr.” \nIt was classed as da’eef by al-Suyooti. Al-Mannaawi explained the reason for that in Fayd al-Qadeer, where he said: It was narrated by Ibn al-Jawzi in al-Waahiyaat and he said: it is not saheeh; its isnaad includes Muhammad ibn ‘Ubayd al-Basri who is majhool (unknown). \nIt was also classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah (43). He said: Even if the hadeeth were saheeh, the apparent meaning is that acceptance of the Ramadaan fast is dependent upon payment of sadaqat al-fitr, and if a person does not pay it, his fast will not be accepted, but I do not know of any scholar who says that … and the hadeeth is not saheeh. End quote. \nAs the hadeeth is not saheeh, no one can say that the fast of Ramadaan is only accepted with zakaat al-fitr, because no one can know that except the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). \nIt is proven in Sunan Abi Dawood that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined zakaat al-fitr as a purification for the fasting person from idle speech and obscene talk, and to feed the poor.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood. \nThis hadeeth explains the wisdom behind zakaat al-fitr, which is to make up for any shortfall that occurred during fasting. It does not say that fasting will not be accepted without zakaat al-fitr. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Fasting during Ramadan (Sawm) and Zakat al-Fitr are two distinct acts of worship in Islam. \n\n1. **Fasting of Ramadan (Sawm)**: This is an obligatory act for adult Muslims from dawn until sunset during the month of Ramadan. Fasting involves abstaining from food, drink, smoking, and marital relations during daylight hours, and it is a time for spiritual reflection, prayer, and community.\n\n2. **Zakat al-Fitr**: This is a form of charity that is obligatory for Muslims to give at the end of Ramadan, before the Eid al-Fitr prayer. It is a small amount of food (or its monetary equivalent) that is given to the needy and is intended to purify those who fast from any indecent act or speech and to help the poor partake in the joy of Eid.\n\nIn summary, fasting during Ramadan is a separate obligation from Zakat al-Fitr, which is a charitable act performed at the end of the fasting month. Muslims are required to observe both: the fasts throughout Ramadan and to pay Zakat al-Fitr before Eid al-Fitr."

        "question": "How can I start to seek knowledge of hadeeth?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We may sum up our advice concerning the methodology of seeking knowledge of hadeeth as follows: \nFirstly: \nPaying a great deal of attention to memorising the texts of the Prophet’s Sunnah, because this is the aim and purpose for which the scholars established all the sciences of hadeeth. So it is not permissible for the seeker of knowledge to be distracted from the aim by the means. \nMemorising the texts of the Prophet’s Sunnah begins with memorising the hadeeths on which there is agreement between the two Saheehs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim), then by memorising those which were narrated only by al-Bukhaari, then by memorising those that were narrated only by Muslim. This will lead to accomplishing the first and most important stage in forming the hadeeth mentality in the one who is seeking knowledge of hadeeth. \nAfter that, he moves on to memorising hadeeths that are extra to those of the two Saheehs, which are to be found in the six books and the well-known Musnads. He may seek help in doing so by means of many books in which these extra reports (zawaa’id) are compiled and classified. \nThe best ways of memorising include repeating the text to be memorised for a few days after the day on which he memorises it. This method was recommended by az-Zarnooshi (may Allah have mercy on him) when he said: \nThe seeker of knowledge should recite the text repeatedly because he will not be able to memorise properly until he does that. He should repeat what he memorised on the previous day five times, and repeat what he memorised the day before that four times, and repeat what he memorised on the day before that three times, and what he memorised on the day before that two times, and what he memorised before that one time. This will help him to memorise and repeat. End quote. \nTa‘leem at-Ta‘allum, p. 60 \nIf the student is not able to memorise completely, then he should do no less than reading these hadeeths often, so that he will be able to call them to mind and have a full comprehension of them.\nThis topic has been discussed in detail previously in the answer to question no. 113469 \nSecondly: \nIt is essential for the seeker of hadeeth knowledge to memorise different types of isnaads and whatever he can memorise of the names and biographies of narrators. The isnaads of the Prophet’s Sunnah can be divided – in terms of how well known they are – into three categories: \n1.\nWell known isnaads, through any of which hundreds of hadeeths were narrated and they are regarded as one of the main channels through which the Prophet’s Sunnah came to us. Indeed there is no book among the six books that did not rely on them and narrate from many of them. Examples include: \nThe isnaad of al-A‘mash from Dhakwaan Abu Saalih al-Sammaan, from Abu Hurayrah \nThe isnaad of az-Zuhri from Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan from Abu Hurayrah. \nThe isnaad of Hammaad ibn Salamah, from Thaabit ibn Aslam, from Anas. \nThe isnaad of ‘Ubaydullah ibn ‘Umar al-‘Umari, from Naafi‘, from Ibn ‘Umar. \nIt is possible to find out about these chains of narration, through which hundreds of reports were narrated, from the book Tuhfat al-Ashraaf by Imam al-Mazzi. \nThe student may also seek help in memorising the narrators of these isnaads from the book Tabaqaat al-Mukthireena min Riwaayat al-Hadeeth by Shaykh ‘Aadil az-Zarqi, with a introduction by ‘Abdullah as-Sa‘d (published by Dar Tuwayq). \nIf the seeker of hadeeth knowledge pays attention to these isnaads and memorises them, then start to connect these isnaads to the texts that he has previously memorised from the books of Sunnah, he will thus have instilled in his mind hundreds of hadeeths with their isnaads. In this way he will have started a new stage of acquiring deep knowledge of this noble science. \n2.\nThe second category is isnaads that are less well-known, through which dozens of reports were narrated, but they include some well-known issues such as interruptions in the chain of narration, ambiguity, omission of the name of the Sahaabi (mursal report) and so on. The student may study some of these isnaads in the book Tuhfat al-Tahseel by al-‘Alaa’i. \nIf the seeker of knowledge pays attention to these isnaads too, and learns the problems associated with these types of isnaads, then he will achieved a great deal in this branch of knowledge. \n3.\nThe third category is the isnaads of mawdoo‘ (fabricated) and da‘eef (weak) isnaads, through which many hadeeths were also narrated, and which the seeker of knowledge must pay attention to, because it is not appropriate for the specialist to be unaware of reports that are well known among the scholars of hadeeth to be weak, faulty or fabricated. To achieve this, it is essential to persist in reading the books Meezan al-I‘tidaal by Imam adh-Dhahabi, al-Kaamil fi Du‘afa’ ar-Rijaal by Ibn ‘Adiyy, and al-Mawdoo‘aat by Ibn al-Jawzi. \nThirdly: \nWhen the seeker of knowledge of the Prophet’s Sunnah has memorised a great deal of Sunnah texts, after that he may start to examine these texts more closely, finding out about ambiguous or difficult texts (ghareeb al-hadeeth) and the different ways in which they are interpreted. Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Knowledge is understanding and cognizance, not memorizing and narrating a great deal.\nEnd quote from al-Jaami‘ li Akhlaaq ar-Raawi, p. 174 \nBut the seeker of knowledge must be aware of the necessity of limiting himself – at the beginning of his pursuit of knowledge – to the abridged commentaries that will explain the difficult texts, and not engage in lengthy study of fiqhi and other issues, which may be too difficult and too time-consuming for the student. He would do well to read an abridged commentary such as al-Mufhim lima Ashkila min Talkhees Saheeh Muslim by Imam al-Qurtubi, al-Minhaaj Sharh Saheeh Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj by Imam an-Nawawi. He can sum up the meaning of the hadeeth and explanations of its vocabulary from these books in notes written in his own copy from which he is memorising the hadeeth, so that when he reviews what he has memorised of the Prophet’s Sunnah, he will also be able to read this summarised explanation of the hadeeth, thus attaining two benefits at the same time. \nWith regard to studying fiqhi issues that are derived from the hadeeths, that is another matter altogether which he should not seek to learn from the commentaries on hadeeth; rather he should learn that from the books of fiqh which organise fiqhi issues into basic essentials and minor issues, according to one of the four madhhabs. \nFourthly: \nWith regard to sciences of hadeeth terminology (mustalah al-hadeeth), we advise the seeker of knowledge to obtain a copy of the book Tahreer ‘Uloom al-Hadeeth by Shaykh ‘Abdullah al-Juday‘ and read it, study it and memorise its contents, because it is a pioneering book in its field which is distinguished by its highlighting the principles of the hadeeth sciences through examination of the different ways of hadeeth critics and through examination of all the principles that are mentioned in the books of biography. This is in addition to other books of mustalah al-hadeeth. \nIf the book is too difficult for the student or he is a beginner, he should limit himself to Nuzhat an-Nazr Sharh Tuhfat al-Fikr by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar, or write a summary of the book of Shaykh ‘Abdullah al-Juday‘ and study his summary, so that when he understands it properly, he may move on to study of other books to increase his knowledge, the most important of which are an-Nukat ‘ala Ibn as-Salaah by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar and Fath al-Mugheeth by al-Haafiz as-Sakhaawi. \nFifthly: \nIt is essential to give sufficient time to reading two other types of books too: \n1.\nBooks on ‘ilal wa takhreej, which represent the practical application of hadeeth sciences, from which the student may examine many examples of the rulings on and evaluation of hadeeths and isnaads; this will open up to him more areas of research and study. \n2.\nContemporary studies by specialists in the area of hadeeth, such as the books of al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) and specialist academic essays. We are living in a time – praise be to Allah – when there is a revival of interest in hadeeth sciences the like of which you can hardly find in later periods of the history of Islamic knowledge. Many of these studies include academic debates and important research on essential topics, which the seeker of hadeeth knowledge should not ignore or fail to pay attention to. By reading these contemporary studies he will find that he will increase in knowledge and understanding, and new ideas will come to his mind that require further research and examination, and perhaps he will play a part in achieving that.\n Over and above all that, he has to remind himself to fear Allah, may He be exalted, for this is the purpose of all knowledge, and the one who is distracted by the pursuit of knowledge from acting has gone astray and is doomed. Rather the effect of acquiring knowledge has to be seen in the humility of the student and his good manners and attitude towards people. \nIt was narrated that al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nA man would seek knowledge, and soon that would be seen in his humility, his conduct, and the way he spoke and acted. End quote. \nAz-Zuhd by ‘Abdullah ibn al-Mubaarak, no. 79 \nIbn al-Salaah (may Allah have mercy on him) says: \nIf a person wants to start seeking knowledge of hadeeth or to learn any of the hadeeth sciences, let him first ensure that his intention is correct and sincere and purify his heart of any worldly aims, and let him beware of the trial of love of leadership. End quote. \n‘Uloom al-Hadeeth, p. 213 \nAnd Allah knows best.",

        "question": "“Seek help in having your needs met by being discreet.”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tabarani in his three Mu’jams, by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab al-Eeman, by Abu Na’eem in al-Hilyah; by Ibn ‘Adiyy in al-Kamil, and by al-‘Aqeeli in al-Du’afa. The hadeeth says: “Seek help in having your needs met by being discreet, for everyone who is blessed with something is envied.” This was narrated from the hadeeth of Mu’adh ibn Jabal, ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, Ibn ‘Abbas, Abu Hurayrah and Abu Bardah (may Allah be pleased with them). \nIbn Abi Hatim said that this hadeeth was munkar (rejected). Ibn al-Jawzi ruled that it is mawdoo’ (fabricated). \nIt was classed as da’eef (weak) by al-‘Iraqi, al-Suyooti in al-Jami’ al-Sagheer, and al-‘Ajlooni in Kashf al-Khifa’. \nAl-Haythami said in Majma’ al-Zawaid (8/195): It was narrated that Mu’adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Seek help in having your needs met by being discreet, for everyone who is blessed with something is envied.” This was narrated by al-Tabarani in his three (Mu’jams), but its isnad (chain of narrators) includes Sa’eed ibn Salam al-‘Attar. Al-‘Ajali said there is nothing wrong with him, but Ahmad and others described him as a liar. The rest of its men are thiqat (trustworthy) except that Khalid ibn Mi’dan did not hear it from Mu’adh. \n‘Ilal Ibn Abi Hatim, 2/255; Fayd al-Qadeer by al-Manawi, 1/630; Kashf al-Khifa by al-‘Ajlooni, 1/135 \nThis hadeeth was classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 3/436, hadeeth no. 1453; and in Saheeh al-Jami’, no. 943. \nHe narrated what the scholars said about the faults of this hadeeth, but he classed it as saheeh via the marfoo’ narration of Sahl ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Jarjani from Muhammad ibn Mutarrif from Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir from ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). \nHe said: The hadeeth with this isnad is jayyid (good) in my view. Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 3/439 \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase \"Seek help in having your needs met by being discreet\" emphasizes the importance of maintaining privacy and modesty when seeking assistance or expressing needs in the Islamic context. In Islam, it is encouraged to be humble and discreet in one's requests and to avoid broadcasting personal matters to others.\n\nThere are several teachings in Islam that support this notion:\n\n1. **Privacy in Needs**: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) encouraged individuals to seek help while maintaining their dignity and self-respect. He said, \"When one of you seeks help, let him not seek it with excessive requests\" (Sunan Ibn Majah).\n\n2. **Avoiding Public Display of Needs**: Being discreet reflects a sense of humility. It is better to ask for help in a private manner to maintain one's honor and avoid drawing unnecessary attention to one's struggles.\n\n3. **Trust in Allah**: In seeking help, it’s important to have tawakkul (trust) in Allah’s provision. The Qur’an encourages believers to rely on Allah when facing difficulties, as stated in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:45): \"And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive.\"\n\nIn conclusion, being discreet while seeking help aligns with Islamic teachings of maintaining dignity, modesty, and reliance on Allah."

        "question": "A questioner is commenting on the previous answer about fasting and the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas about moon sighting with one witness",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The hadeeth that the questioner is referring to is: \n\n    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with \n    him) said: A Bedouin came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him) and said, I have seen the new moon tonight. He said, “Do you bear \n    witness that there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the \n    Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)?” He said, \n    Yes. He said, “Get up, O Bilaal, and announce to the people that they should \n    fast tomorrow.” \n\n    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (691), Abu Dawood (2340), al-Nasaa’i \n    (2112) and Ibn Maajah (1652). The hadeeth is da’eef (weak) and not saheeh. \n    It was classed as weak by al-Nasaa’i, al-Albaani and others. \n\n    As the hadeeth is weak, there is no contradiction between it \n    and what we have mentioned about it being essential that the one who sights \n    the moon should be of good character. \n\n    Even if we assume that the hadeeth is saheeh, it may be \n    interpreted in several ways, such as: \n\n    1.\n\n    That the issue with regard to accepting the testimony of the \n    one who has seen the new moon and the issue of determining whether he is \n    trustworthy and of good character is up to the judge to decide. If he is \n    confident, because of his experience with people, that this person who has \n    seen the moon is trustworthy in his testimony, he may accept this testimony \n    from him, even if no one knows him and is able to confirm that he is of good \n    character and trustworthy. \n\n    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    So we see from the hadeeth that he instructed Bilaal to \n    announce to the people that they would fast the next day. So the Messenger \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was content with the testimony of \n    this man, whom he did not know, on the basis that he bore witness that there \n    is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, i.e. he \n    knew that he was a Muslim, but he did not check on him any further and he \n    did not try to find out how intelligent and smart he was, as was the case in \n    the first hadeeth in which the witness was ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar ibn \n    al-Khattaab. Yet despite that he accepted his testimony. This hadeeth makes \n    things easier for people, and what this means is that the judge should be \n    content with the witness as he appears to be, without needing to find people \n    who know this man and can testify that he is of good character, as was the \n    habit of judges since time immemorial. Rather it is sufficient to know that \n    he is a Muslim. This man was a Bedouin of whom the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) had no prior knowledge and he was content that \n    he uttered the Shahaadatayn before him. So he was a Muslim with the same \n    rights and duties as any other, and based on his testimony and the fact that \n    he was a Muslim he said: O Bilaal, announced to the people that they should \n    fast tomorrow. \n\n    Al-Ta’laaq ‘ala Kitaab Buloogh al-Maraam, \n    (audio tape), hadeeth 5, Kitaab al-Siyaam. \n\n    2.\n\n    That this hadeeth is evidence for the principle that a Muslim \n    is to be regarded as being of good character unless proven otherwise. \n    Al-San’aani (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning what we learn from \n    the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas: \n\n    It indicates that the basic principle with regard to the \n    Muslims is that they are of good character, because the Prophet (blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him) did not ask the Bedouin for anything except \n    the Shahaadah. \n\n    Subul al-Salaam by al-San’aani, \n    2/153 \n\n    3.\n\n    That this ruling only applies to the Sahaabah, which is the \n    case because they are all to be regarded as being of good character. There \n    is no doubt that that Bedouin is to be included as one of the Sahaabah (may \n    Allah be pleased with them), and thus he is to be regarded as a man of good \n    character, one of those who do not need to be examined to prove that they \n    are of good character. \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said: \n\n    All of the Sahaabah are trustworthy and of good character, \n    and the narration of any of them is to be accepted even if he is not known \n    by name. Hence they said: Not knowing the name of the Sahaabi does not \n    affect the validity of the hadeeth. \n\n    The evidence for what we have said about the Sahaabah is that \n    Allah and His Messenger praised them in a number of texts, and the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would accept the testimony of any \n    of them once he knew that he was Muslim, and he would not enquire any \n    further about him. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased \n    with him) said: A Bedouin came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \n    be upon him) and said: I have seen the new moon, meaning Ramadan. \n\n    End quote from Mustalah al-Hadeeth, from his website. \n\n    There is something else that supports what we have stated \n    above, which is the fact that this testimony came at the time of Revelation, \n    and the testimony of the Bedouin could not have been accepted if it was a \n    false testimony concerning one of the acts of worship of the Muslims. \n\n    But as the hadeeth is da’eef (weak) there is no need to \n    discuss its meaning. Praise be to Allah the Lord of the Worlds. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the issue of moon sighting and whether one witness can be sufficient for the declaration of Ramadan or Shawwal is derived from various hadiths. The hadith of Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) is often cited where he mentioned that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) accepted the testimony of a single witness regarding the sighting of the moon. \n\nThe relevant hadith states that Ibn 'Abbaas reported that the Messenger of Allah saw the moon of Ramadan and said: “Fast when you see it (the moon) and break your fast when you see it. But if it is obscured from you, then calculate (Shu'ru) for it.” It is also reported that Ibn 'Abbaas mentioned he had heard the testimony of a man who sighted the moon, and he supported it.\n\nDifferent scholars and schools of thought have different views on this matter:\n\n1. **Majority Opinion**: Most scholars maintain that for Ramadan and Eid, at least two witnesses are required to confirm the sighting of the moon. This is to ensure that the declaration is based on reliable testimony and to prevent potential confusion regarding the start of fasting or the timing of Eid.\n\n2. **Minority Opinion**: Some scholars, particularly from the Hanafi school, accept the testimony of one just witness. They argue that the practice of Ibn 'Abbaas supports this view, given that he accepted the testimony of one person in this matter.\n\nIt’s also important to note that local customs and the practice of the community, as well as considerations for the validity and reliability of the witness, can play a role in the decision-making process regarding moon sighting.\n\nIn conclusion, while the narration of Ibn 'Abbaas allows for the possibility of accepting one witness, the prevailing view among scholars is to require two witnesses for confirming the sighting of the moon for the commencement of Ramadan and Eid."

        "question": "Can ahaad hadiths be accepted with regard to ‘aqeedah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Our response to the one who thinks that ‘aqeedah cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad hadiths because they are based on probability or speculation and ‘aqeedah cannot be based on speculations is: This opinion is not correct, because it is based on something that is not correct. That is for a number of reasons: \n1.The idea that ahaad hadiths are based on probability or speculation does not apply in all cases; there are some ahaad hadiths that are based on certainty if there is corroborated evidence to confirm them, such as if the ummah accepted them. An example is the hadith of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him), “Actions are but by intentions…” It is an ahaad hadith, but despite that we know that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it. This is what was confirmed by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, al-Haafiz ibn Hajar and others.\n2.The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to send individuals with basic teachings of ‘aqeedah - testimony that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah - and the fact that he sent them is binding proof. For example, he sent Mu‘aadh to Yemen, and the fact that he sent him is regarded as binding proof for the people of Yemen that they were obliged to accept him.\n3.If we say that matters of ‘aqeedah cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad reports, then it is possible to say that practical rulings cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad reports, because practical rulings are accompanied by the belief that Allah enjoined this and forbade that. If this opinion is accepted, then many of the rulings of sharee‘ah would be rendered invalid. If this idea is rejected then the idea that ‘aqeedah cannot be proven on the basis of ahaad reports should also be rejected, because there is no difference between the two, as we have explained.\nTo sum up: If an ahaad report is supported by corroborating evidence which indicates that this is true, then it becomes part of knowledge and rulings of practice and belief may be established. There is nothing to indicate that there should be any differentiation between the two. Any person who suggests that any of the imams differentiated between them has to prove that with a sound chain of narration from that imam, then he has to explain his evidence.\n4.Allah, may He be exalted, has enjoined referring to the people of knowledge for the one who is unaware of what is one of the most important issues of ‘aqeedah, which is Prophethood. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And We sent not (as Our Messengers) before you (O Muhammad) any but men, whom We sent Revelation, (to preach and invite mankind to believe in the Oneness of Allaah). So ask (you, O pagans of Makkah) of those who know the Scripture [learned men of the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], if you know not.\n44. With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers)” [al-Nahl 16:43, 44]\nThis includes asking one or many. End quote. \nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him)",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence and theology, the classification of hadiths plays an important role in the acceptance and application of religious teachings. Ahaad hadiths are those reports that are transmitted by a single source or a group of sources that are not sufficiently numerous to provide certainty. \n\nThe general consensus among scholars is that while ahaad hadiths can be accepted in matters of jurisprudence (fiqh), their acceptance in matters of 'aqeedah (creed or belief) is treated with greater caution. Many scholars maintain that 'aqeedah should be based on mutawatir hadiths (those reported by many sources that achieve a level of certainty) or Qur'anic texts that are clear and explicit.\n\nHowever, some scholars do accept certain ahaad hadiths in the context of 'aqeedah if they are not contrary to the established beliefs and can be found to have a strong chain of narration and authenticity. Ultimately, the acceptance of an ahaad hadith in matters of 'aqeedah can vary depending on the interpretation and the school of thought within Islam.\n\nIn summary, while it's generally preferred to rely on stronger, more reliable sources for 'aqeedah, there is some allowance for the acceptance of authentic ahaad hadiths, depending on the scholarly view."

        "question": "Should He Forsake His Family Who Reject the Sunnah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    Every Muslim has to believe in all the hadeeths of the \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – if they are saheeh \n    (authentic) – and not reject any of them, because his hadeeths and his \n    Sunnah (teachings) are revelation (wahy) from Allah. Whoever rejects the \n    hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) \n    has rejected revelation from Allah. \n\n    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “By the star when it goes down (or vanishes).\n\n    Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has \n    erred.\n\n    Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.\n\n    It is only a Revelation revealed.\n\n    He has been taught (this Quran) by one mighty in power \n    (Gabriel).\n\n    One free from any defect in body and mind then he (Gabriel in \n    his real shape as created by Allah) rose and became stable.” [53:1-6] \n\n    Allah has commanded the people to obey His Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him). He has enjoined this in many verses of the \n    Quran, of which we will quote some. Allah says (interpretation of the \n    meaning): \n\n    “Say (O Muhammad): “Obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad).” \n    But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.” [3:32] \n\n    “He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed \n    Allah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a \n    watcher over them.” [4:80] \n\n    “O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger \n    (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you \n    differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, \n    if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more \n    suitable for final determination.” [4:59] \n\n    “And perform As‑Salah (Iqamat‑as-Salah), and give Zakah and \n    obey the Messenger (Muhammad) that you may receive mercy (from Allah).”\n     [24:56] \n\n    And there are many similar verses. \n\n    The one who rejects the Sunnah is a kafir and an apostate. \n\n    Al-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his essay \n    Miftah al-Jannah fi Ihtijaj bi’l-Sunnah: \n\n    Note that whoever denies that the hadeeth of the Prophet \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whether it describes his words \n    or deeds, so long as it meets the conditions outlined by the scholars, may \n    be quoted as evidence, is a kafir and has gone beyond the pale of Islam; he \n    will be gathered with the Jews and the Christians or whomever Allah wills \n    among the kafir sects [i.e., on the Day of Resurrection]. \n\n    Those who want to restrict themselves to the Quran only are \n    called al-Quraniyyoon. This view of theirs is an old view which the \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against in more \n    than one hadeeth, as we shall see below. Among the soundest evidence that \n    this view is false is the fact that those who say this do not really follow \n    what they say. \n\n    How do these people pray? How many times do they pray each \n    day and night? What are the conditions and details of zakah? What is the \n    nisab (threshold of wealth) for paying zakah? What is the amount that must \n    be paid? How do they do Hajj and ‘Umrah? How many times do they \n    circumambulate the Ka’bah? How many times do they go back and forth between \n    al-Safa and al-Marwah? \n\n    There are many other issues for which the details are not \n    narrated in the Quran, rather they are mentioned in the Quran in general \n    terms, and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) \n    explained them in detail in his Sunnah. \n\n    Would these people refrain from acting upon these rulings \n    because they are not narrated in the Quran? \n\n    If their answer is yes, then they have passed judgement \n    against themselves that they are kafirs, because they have denied a basic \n    principle of Islam that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing and on \n    which there is unanimous consensus among the Muslims.  \n\n    If they reply that they do not refrain from following these \n    rulings, then they have demonstrated that their view is false. \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said – after quoting the verses \n    that enjoin following the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) –  \n\n    These texts enjoin following the Messenger (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him) even if we do not find what he said \n    specifically referred to in the texts of the Quran. These verses also enjoin \n    following the Quran even if we do not find what is said in the Quran \n    specifically mentioned in the hadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings \n    of Allah be upon him). \n\n    So we must follow the Quran and we must follow the Messenger \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Following the one implies \n    following the other, for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) conveyed the Book, and the Book commands us to follow the Messenger \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Book and the Messenger \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) do not contradict one another at \n    all, just as the Book does not contradict itself. Allah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning): \n\n    “Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely, have \n    found therein many a contradiction.” [4:82] \n\n    And there are many hadeeths from the Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him) which state that it is obligatory to follow \n    the Quran and that it is obligatory to follow his Sunnah, for example, the \n    hadeeth in which he said: “I do not want to find any one of you reclining on \n    his pillow, and when he hears of something that I have commanded or \n    forbidden, he says, ‘Between us and you there stands this Quran, whatever we \n    find is permissible in it we will take as permissible, and whatever we find \n    is forbidden in it we will take as forbidden.’ For I have been given the \n    Book and something like it with it; it is like the Quran or more.” This \n    hadeeth is narrated in the books of Sunan and Musnad from the Prophet (peace \n    and blessings of Allah be upon him) with a number of isnads (chains of \n    narration) from Abu Tha’labah, Abu Rafi’, Abu Hurayrah and others. \n\n    In Saheeh Muslim is it narrated from Jabir that the Prophet \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in his Farewell Sermon: “I \n    am leaving behind among you something which, if you adhere to it, you will \n    not go astray after that. It is the Book of Allah.” The version narrated by \n    al-Hakim says “The Book of Allah and my Sunnah.” (Classed as \n    saheeh/authentic by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jami’, 2937). \n\n    In al-Saheeh it is narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Awfa that \n    it was said to him: Did the Messenger of Allah leave a will? He said, No. It \n    was said, How then is it prescribed for people to make wills when the \n    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make a will? He \n    said, He made a will in which he enjoined (adherence to) the Book of Allah. \n\n    (Narrated by Muslim, 1634) \n\n    The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah explains the Quran, as \n    it explains the number of prayers, how much should be recited in them, which \n    should be recited out loud and which quietly. It also explains the amounts \n    of zakah to be paid and the threshold at which zakah becomes due; the \n    rituals of Hajj and ‘Umrah; how many times one should circumambulate the \n    Ka’bah, go between al-Safa and al-Marwah and stone the Jamarat (pillars), \n    etc. \n\n    When any Sunnah is proven to be saheeh, the Muslims are \n    agreed that it is obligatory to follow it. There may be something in the \n    Sunnah which a person thinks appears to go against the apparent meaning of \n    the Quran and add to it, such as the Sunnah which explains the threshold of \n    stealing at which the hadd (Islamic legal) punishment becomes due, and the \n    Sunnah which stipulates that the married adulterer is to be stoned. This \n    Sunnah must also be followed, according to the view of the \n    Sahabah/Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and those who followed \n    them in truth, and all the groups of Muslims. \n\n    Adapted from Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 19/84-86 \n\n    That which was brought by the Messenger (peace and blessings \n    of Allah be upon him) is true just as the Quran is true.\n\n     Secondly: \n\n    You should not forsake your family; rather you should treat \n    them kindly and strive to call them to follow and accept the Sunnah. \n\n    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. \n    Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Quran) and fair \n    preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord \n    knows best who has gone astray from His path, and He is the Best Aware of \n    those who are guided.” [16:125] \n\n    “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his \n    parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and \n    hardship, and his weaning is in two years; give thanks to Me and to your \n    parents. Unto Me is the final destination.\n\n    But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in \n    worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them \n    not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him \n    who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your \n    return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.” [31:14-15] \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, maintaining family ties is highly emphasized, and there are numerous teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that highlight the importance of compassion and unity within the family. However, when it comes to differing beliefs and practices, such as rejecting the Sunnah, the approach can be nuanced.\n\n1. **Maintain Relationships**: Islam encourages believers to strive to maintain positive and respectful relationships with family members, even if they hold different views. This is not only crucial for the sake of harmony but also to fulfill the Islamic duty of kindness towards one’s parents and relatives.\n\n2. **Encourage with Wisdom**: If a family member rejects the Sunnah, it is commendable to engage with them lovingly and respectfully, attempting to explain the importance and benefits of the Sunnah in a constructive manner.\n\n3. **Setting Boundaries**: While it is important to maintain family relationships, there may be instances where one needs to set boundaries, especially if the family member's actions negatively influence one's own practice of Islam. This does not mean completely forsaking them; rather, it could involve limiting certain interactions while still showing care and concern.\n\n4. **Prayer and Patience**: One should turn to prayer and seek guidance and patience from Allah. Leaving the matter in His hands and trusting in His wisdom is vital.\n\nIn conclusion, one should not forsake their family but rather engage with them while promoting good values and practices. If necessary, seek to create a balance that protects one’s faith while demonstrating love and respect for family members."

        "question": "Hadith About the Virtue of the Basmalah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This report was mentioned by al-Qurtubi in al-Jami’ li Ahkam al-Quran (1/92) and Ibn Katheer in his Tafseer (exegesis) (1/18), narrated from Wakee’ from al-A’mash from Abu Wail from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him); it is the words of Ibn Mas’ood, not of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nThis isnad (chain of narration) is saheeh (authentic) from Wakee’ to Ibn Mas’ood. \nAlthough al-A’mash is mudallis, what he narrated from those with whom he spent a great deal of time and narrated a great deal from them, such as Ibraheem al-Nakha’i and Abu Wail, may be accepted. \nAl-Dhahabi said in his biography of al-A’mash in Mizan al-I’tidal (2/224): \nHe is mudallis (i.e., gives false impressions concerning the narration of the hadith, using ambiguous words to give the impression that he heard it directly from his Shaykh when that is not the case), and sometimes he narrates in this manner from a weak narrator without realising it. When he says haddathana [he told us], there is no problem with that, but when he says ‘an [narrating from], there is the possibility of tadlees except in the case of narration from the shuyookh from whom he narrated a great deal, such as Ibraheem, Abu Wail [in the printed version it says “Ibn Abi Wail” but this is an error; the word “Ibn” is a mistake] and Abu Salih al-Samman. His narration from these shaykhs is to be understood as meaning that he heard directly from them and there is no interruption in the chain. End quote.\nBut there remains the issue of the narrators who come after Wakee’. Al-Qurtubi and Ibn Katheer do not mention the isnad in its entirety, and perhaps it is because of this that al-‘Allamah Ahmad Shakir omitted it from his abridgement of Ibn Katheer’s Tafseer which is entitled ‘Umdat al-Tafseer, in the introduction to which (1/11) he stated that he omitted every weak or problematic hadith. \nBut al-Suyooti attributed it in al-Durr al-Manthoor (1/26) to Wakee’, and Imam Wakee’ ibn al-Jarrah wrote a well-known Tafseer.  \nSee: al-Majma’ al-Muassis by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (p. 113) \nIf this is proven, then the isnad is saheeh, and the report from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) is saheeh. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase \"Bismillah\" (بسم الله) which translates to \"In the name of Allah\" has great significance in Islam, and there are several Hadiths that mention its virtues.\n\nOne of the well-known Hadiths regarding the virtue of the Basmalah is narrated in Sahih Muslim. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:\n\n\"When a man enters his house and remembers Allah when he enters and when he eats, Shaytan (the devil) says, 'You have no place to stay and no dinner.' But if he enters and does not remember Allah, Shaytan says, 'You have found a place to stay.' And if he does not remember Allah when he eats, Shaytan says, 'You have found a place to stay and a dinner.'\" (Sahih Muslim)\n\nThis Hadith illustrates the importance of reciting \"Bismillah\" before entering a house or starting a meal, highlighting its role in seeking protection from Shaytan and inviting blessings into the home and the food.\n\nAdditionally, there are other Hadiths emphasizing that the Basmalah should be said before doing any action, such as eating, starting a task, or beginning a prayer, as it invokes Allah's name and seeks His blessings in that endeavor.\n\nIn summary, saying \"Bismillah\" is not only a practice of invoking Allah's name, but also serves to remind believers of His presence and blessings in their everyday activities."

        "question": "Commentary on the hadith: “A house in which there are no dates, its people will go hungry”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadith is saheeh. It was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. It is to be interpreted, according to the scholars, as referring to people whose food includes dates, such as the people of Madeenah at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others whose staple food is dates.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength.\n(Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn Baz 25/280)",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you mentioned, which translates to \"A house in which there are no dates, its people will go hungry,\" emphasizes the importance of dates as a staple food in the culture and lifestyle of Muslims, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula. Dates have significant nutritional value and have historically been a primary source of sustenance for many.\n\nThis hadith can be interpreted in several ways:\n\n1. **Physical Sustenance**: On a literal level, the hadith underscores the importance of having basic food items to ensure that one's family is well-fed. Dates, being rich in nutrients, symbolize the necessity of providing for oneself and one's household.\n\n2. **Spiritual and Moral Nourishment**: Beyond the physical aspect, scholars often interpret this hadith to reflect the broader concept of sustenance, including spiritual nourishment. Just as a home needs food for physical health, it also needs spiritual well-being, which can come through acts of worship, knowledge, and moral guidance.\n\n3. **Symbol of Abundance**: Dates are often viewed as a symbol of abundance and prosperity in Islamic tradition. The absence of dates in a household may indicate a lack of blessings or prosperity, thus reminding believers to be grateful for what they have and to strive for abundance in both material and spiritual aspects of life.\n\n4. **Encouragement of Charity and Community**: This hadith may also hint at the importance of providing for those in need within the community. It reminds the faithful of their responsibility to ensure that not just their own families, but also their neighbors and those less fortunate, have access to basic necessities.\n\nIn conclusion, the hadith serves as a reminder of the importance of physical and spiritual sustenance, nourishing both the body and the soul, and encourages a sense of responsibility towards one's family and community."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.I do not know of any basis for it. What is prescribed for the believer is to respect his brother if he apologizes to him and accept his excuse if possible, and to think positively of him whenever possible, in hopes that hearts will be free from resentment and that people will be brought together and will cooperate in doing good. It was narrated from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: “Do not think badly of a word uttered by your brother, when you can find a good interpretation for it.” end quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you're referring to, which encourages Muslims to seek excuses for their brothers and sisters, is often cited in discussions about maintaining good character and relationships within the community. The narration mentions that one should seek seventy excuses for a fellow Muslim when they see a fault or a shortcoming.\n\nThe hadith is reported in various forms, and it is attributed to different companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), with variations in wording. One of the scholars who discussed its authenticity is Imam Ahmad, who mentioned it in his Musnad, and it has been classified by some scholars as being weak (da'if).\n\nDespite the varying opinions on its authenticity, the message of the hadith aligns with the Islamic values of compassion, forgiveness, and empathy. Many scholars emphasize that the spirit of the message is significant, encouraging Muslims to be lenient and to foster unity, rather than to seek out faults in one another.\n\nIn summary, while the authenticity of the specific hadith may be questioned, the principle it conveys is an important aspect of Islamic ethics. Muslims are encouraged to exhibit understanding and to strive to find excuses for others, promoting harmony and brotherhood within the community."

The term \"daad\" refers specifically to the Arabic letter \"د\" (daad), which has a unique sound not found in many other languages. \n\nThe significance of this hadith lies in the importance of language in conveying messages and teachings, particularly in the context of the Qur'an and the Prophet's sayings (Hadith).

And because he  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Were it not that it would be too \n    difficult for my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwaak at \n    every prayer.” Saheeh – agreed upon.

This serves to highlight not only the spiritual rewards associated with prayer but also emphasizes the importance of following the Sunnah and maintaining cleanliness before worship.\n\nWhile this hadith is often cited in discussions about the importance of using siwaak, it is recommended to refer to the specific sources (such as the books of hadith) and scholars for a thorough understanding of its chain of narration (isnad) and the context in which it was transmitted.\n\nIn general, maintaining hygiene and following the Sunnah of the Prophet in daily practices, including the use of siwaak, is encouraged in Islam."

        "question": "Wearing an Iron Ring for Men",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Buraydah from his father (may Allah be pleased with them both) that a man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he was wearing a ring of gold. He said: “Why do I detect the stench of idols on you?” So he threw it away. Then he came and he was wearing a ring of iron, and he said: “Why do I see you wearing the jewellery of the people of Hell?” So he threw it away. He said: O Messenger of Allah, of what should I wear (a ring)? He said: “Wear (a ring) of silver, but no more than a mithqal (a measure of weight).” Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasai. Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a ghareeb (strange) hadeeh. It was narrated from Iyas ibn al-Harith ibn al-Mu’ayqeeb that his grandfather said: The ring of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was made of iron overlaid with silver. He said: I kept it sometimes, and Mu’ayqeeb was in charge of the ring of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Narrated by Abu Dawood and al-Nasai.\nIn al-Saheehayn it is narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the one who proposed marriage to the woman who had offered herself in marriage to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Look for something (to give as a dowry), even if it is a ring of iron.” This indicates that it is permissible to wear a ring of iron, as is indicated by the hadeeth of Mu’ayqeeb. As for the hadeeth of Buraydah quoted above, there is some weakness in its isnad (chain of narration). Thus it is clear that the more correct view is that it is not makrooh (disliked) to wear a ring of iron. But wearing a ring of silver is better, because the ring of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was made of silver, as is proven in al-Saheehayn. \nAnd Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. End quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, the issue of men wearing rings, particularly iron rings, has been discussed by scholars. Generally, there is no prohibition against men wearing rings, but certain materials are preferred. \n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have worn a silver ring, and hence silver is often recommended for men. Iron rings are typically considered permissible as well, but they are not as commonly recommended due to various cultural and historical factors.\n\nSome scholars refer to a hadith where the Prophet prohibited men from wearing gold and silk, but there is no specific prohibition regarding iron. Men can wear iron if they choose to, but it is often advised to consider cultural and personal preferences along with the recommendations found in Islamic teachings.\n\nAs always, it is best to consult with a qualified scholar or local imam for personalized advice in line with your circumstances."

        "question": "The status of a faqeeh is superior to that of a hadeeth narrator, but both are good",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The faqeeh is the mujtahid who derives shar’i rulings, \n    explains the principles of sharee’ah and teaches people the rulings of their \n    religion. The focus of his specialty is the aims and goals of sharee’ah, the \n    clear verses of the Qur’aan and achieving sound understanding of what Allaah \n    wants from His slaves. \n\n    This is something that can be done by only a few individuals, \n    because it requires extensive study of the texts, lengthy study and \n    examination of the words of the scholars, and intelligence in studying real \n    life situations and applying the rulings of sharee’ah to them. \n\n    As for the narrator of hadeeth, he transmits what he hears of \n    the Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \n    and he delivers what he receives with honesty and sincerity. His main \n    concern is to convey the hadeeth as he heard it by any possible means, but \n    he does not concern himself with explaining the meaning of the hadeeth or \n    deriving shar’i rulings from it, or knowledge of what abrogates and what is \n    abrogated, or what is general and what is specific. Rather his role is \n    limited to simply transmitting and narrating. \n\n    This task requires precision and care in transmission, but it \n    does not require knowledge of fiqh or the basic principles (usool) of fiqh. \n\n    Imam al-A’mash (may Allaah have mercy on him) described the \n    work of both the faqeeh and the narrator of hadeeth in detail. He said: \n\n    “O fuqaha’, you are the doctors and we are the pharmacists.” \n    End quote. \n\n    Naseehah Ahl al-hadeeth li’l-Khateeb al-Baghdadi \n    (1/45). \n\n    It is no secret that the roles of the doctor and pharmacist \n    are complementary; they cannot do without one another. Both of them are good \n    and their influence is important. Islam also confirms that both the faqeeh \n    and the hadeeth narrator are good and will be rewarded by Allaah, but the \n    faqeeh (the doctor) is of a higher standing, as he pays attention to \n    understanding and deriving rulings. \n\n    Some scholars derived this meaning from the words of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “May Allaah bless \n    a man who hears a hadeeth from us and memorizes it so that he can convey it \n    to others, for perhaps he is conveying it to one who will understand it \n    better than him, and perhaps the one who conveys knowledge does not \n    understand it himself.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (3660). \n\n    Al-Ramahramzi (d. 360 AH) said: The Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) differentiated between the one who narrates \n    the Sunnah and the one who understands it, and he indicated that the one who \n    understands it is superior, by saying “for perhaps he is conveying it to one \n    who will understand it better than him, and perhaps the one who conveys \n    knowledge does not understand it himself.” By affirming the virtue of one, \n    the virtue of the other is automatically affirmed. For example: Maalik ibn \n    Anas and ‘Ubayd-Allaah al-‘Umari, or between al-Shaafa’i and ‘Abd al-Rahmaan \n    ibn Mahdi, or between Abu Thawr and Ibn Abi Shaybah. Fair-mindedness leads \n    you to determine that both are people of knowledge and virtue; this is the \n    attitude of fair-minded people that is reached by those who have knowledge \n    of the truth. End quote. \n\n    Al-Muhaddith al-Faadil \n    (1/169-170). \n\n    As for the one who combines both qualities, who understands \n    the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    and memorizes what he brought of knowledge, and understands the meanings, \n    and benefits himself and others thereby, these are the best of all types of \n    people. \n\n    It was narrated from Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be \n    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) said: “The likeness of the guidance and knowledge with which \n    Allaah has sent me is that of rain falling upon the earth. Some of it is \n    good ground which receives the water and brings forth a great deal of \n    herbage and grass. Some of it is hard but it retains the water, and Allaah \n    benefits people by it, and they drink it and give it to their animals to \n    drink and use it for irrigation and grazing. And another part of it is \n    barren, it does not retain the water or produce herbage. That is the \n    likeness of one who gains an understanding of the religion of Allaah, and \n    Allaah benefits him by that with which Allaah has sent me, and he learns and \n    teaches others; and the likeness of a man who pays no attention to that, and \n    does not accept the guidance of Allaah with which I have been sent.” \n\n    Imam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    As for the meaning of the hadeeth, it is likening the \n    guidance that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    brought to rain. It says that land is of three types, and the same is true \n    of people. \n\n    The first type of land benefits from the rain and comes back \n    to life after having been dead, and it brings forth herbage from which \n    people, animals and plants benefit. This is like the first type of people \n    whom guidance and knowledge reach: such a person memorizes it and his heart \n    is brought back to life; he acts upon it and teaches others, so he benefits \n    from it and benefits others. \n\n    The second type of land does not benefit from the rain \n    itself, but it does something good with it, namely holding the water for \n    others, so people and animals benefit from it. This is like the second type \n    of people; they have good memories but they do not have deep understanding \n    or deep insight by means of which they could derive meanings and rulings, \n    and they do not strive hard in worship. They memorize it and preserve it \n    until there comes along one who needs it and thirsts for the knowledge that \n    they have, a scholar who is able to benefit from it. So he takes it and \n    benefits others by means of that which they conveyed to him. \n\n    The third type of land is the barren land that does not \n    produce any herbage and the like, and does not benefit itself from the \n    water, and does not retain it so that others may benefit from it. This is \n    like the third type of people; they do not have good memories or \n    understanding or insight. If they hear knowledge they do not benefit from it \n    or preserve it so that others may benefit. End quote. \n\n    Sharh Muslim (15/47-48). \n\n    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  \n\n    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    likened the knowledge and guidance that he brought to rain, because of what \n    each of them bring of life, benefit, nourishment, medicine and all things \n    that are in people’s interests. This is true of both knowledge and rain. \n\n    And he likened people’s hearts to the different types of land \n    on which rain may fall, because the land is the place that retains the rain, \n    and all kinds of beneficial plants grow, just as the heart understands \n    knowledge and bears fruit and manifests blessings and benefits. \n\n    Then he divided people into three categories, according to \n    their readiness to memorize and understand its meanings and derive rulings \n    from it. \n\n    1-People with good memories and \n    good understanding, who understand and comprehend the meanings, and derive \n    different rulings, wisdom and benefits from it. They are like the land that \n    absorbs the water, which is the likeness of the memory, and brings forth a \n    great deal of herbage and grain, which is the likeness of understanding, \n    knowledge and derivation of rulings. This is the likeness of the one who is \n    both a haafiz and a faqeeh, the people who both narrate and understand the \n    hadeeth.\n\n    2-People who are able to memorize \n    and classify reports, but they are not able to understand the meanings or \n    derive different types of rulings and benefits from them. They are like \n    those who read and memorize the Qur’aan, paying attention to the letters and \n    pronunciation, but they are not able to develop a proper understanding of \n    Allaah, as ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said: “Except an understanding that Allaah \n    grants to His slave concerning His Book.” People vary greatly in their \n    understanding of the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Perhaps one person may \n    understand one or two rulings from the text, whereas another may understand \n    one hundred or two hundred. They are like the land that retains the water \n    for people so that they may benefit from it, drinking it or giving it to \n    others to drink or irrigating crops with it.\n\n    These two types are blessed, although the former are of \n    higher status. This is the bounty of Allaah which He gives as He wills, and \n    Allaah is the Owner of great bounty. \n\n    3-Those who have no share of it, \n    who neither memorize it nor understand it, who neither memorize nor \n    comprehend it. Rather they are like the land that is barren and dry, which \n    neither produces herbage nor retains the water.\n\n    They are the ones who are doomed. The first two categories \n    share the qualities of learning and teaching, each according to what it has \n    accepted as sound and what has reached it. One may know and memorize the \n    phrases of the Qur’aan, whilst another knows its meanings, rulings and \n    sciences, but the third category does not know or teach. They are the ones \n    who neither benefited from the guidance of Allaah or accepted it. They are \n    worse off than cattle, and they are the fuel of Hell. \n\n    This hadeeth also points to the honourable status and lofty \n    position of knowledge and teaching, and the wretchedness of those who have \n    no share of it; it mentions different categories of the sons of Adam with \n    regard to it – who is doomed and who is blessed; and it further divides the \n    blessed into those who are the foremost (in faith) and those who are among \n    “those on the Right Hand” (cf. al-Waaqi’ah 56:8). \n\n    This indicates that the people’s need for knowledge is like \n    their need for rain, or even greater. If they lose knowledge then they are \n    akin to the land that is lacking rain.  \n\n    Imam Ahmad said: People need knowledge more than they need \n    food and drink, because they need food and drink once or twice a day, but \n    they need knowledge with every breath they take. End quote. \n\n    Miftaah Daar al-Sa’aadah \n    (1/65-66). \n\n    So how do you stand with regard to all this? What type of \n    land are you? Are you the type that will benefit itself and others, so that \n    you memorize and understand, act upon it and teach it to others? Or are you \n    one who will preserve it for others so that they may benefit, and the one \n    who points others towards a good deed will be like the one who does it (in \n    terms of reward)? \n\n    We pray that Allaah will protect you. We think that you are \n    far above being like the barren land which never holds any water or produces \n    any vegetation, never memorizing or understanding, but appointing yourself \n    as judge to decide between the two groups! \n\n    Look at your aims and goals; strive hard and set high goals \n    for yourself. Make yourself memorize and understand, and if you are not able \n    to do some of it, then at least be one who points others towards good deeds, \n    and does that which is enjoined upon him. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic scholarship, the status of a faqeeh (a jurist or scholar of Islamic law) is often regarded as superior to that of a hadith narrator (the one who transmits the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). This is because a faqeeh not only possesses knowledge of hadith but also understands the principles of jurisprudence, can derive rulings, and apply Islamic teachings to various aspects of life.\n\nBoth figures are highly respected within the Islamic tradition, as they each play significant roles in the preservation and application of Islamic teachings. Hadith narrators are crucial in ensuring that the sayings of the Prophet are accurately transmitted, while faqeeh contribute to the understanding and practical implementation of these teachings in the context of law and ethics.\n\nThus, while both have important roles, the faqeeh's ability to interpret and apply Islamic law often places them in a superior status within the Islamic scholarly hierarchy."

        "question": "How to understand the hadeeth when the prophet instructed the one who prayed badly to repeat his prayer and not ordering Mu’awiyah to repeat it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah \n    ibn al-Hakam was narrated by Muslim (537) from Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam who \n    said: Whilst I was praying with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), a man among the people sneezed and I said:\n    Yarhamuk Allaah (may Allah have mercy on you). The people \n    glared at me and I said: May my mother be bereft of me! Why are you staring \n    at me? They started striking their hands on their thighs, and when I \n    realized that they were telling me to be quiet, (I felt angry) but I kept \n    quiet. When the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) had prayed – may my father and mother be sacrificed for him; by \n    Allaah I have never seen a better teacher or better teachings before or \n    since; he did not rebuke me, hit me or revile me – he said: “This prayer is \n    not the right place for any of the people’s speech, rather it is tasbeeh, \n    takbeer and recitation of Qur’aan.” \nThe hadeeth about the man \n    who prayed badly was narrated by al-Bukhaari (757) and Muslim (397) from Abu \n    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered the mosque and a man \n    came in and prayed, then he came and greeted the Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) returned the greeting and said: \n    “Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.” The man went back and prayed as \n    he had prayed before, then he came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) and greeted him, and the Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Wa ‘alayk al-salaam.” \n    Then he said: “Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.” When he had done \n    that three times, the man said: By the One Who sent you with the truth, I \n    cannot do more than that. Teach me. He said: “When you go to pray, say \n    takbeer, then recite whatever you can of the Qur’aan. Then bow until you are \n    at ease in bowing, then rise until you are standing up straight. Then \n    prostrate until you are at ease in prostration, then sit up until you are at \n    ease in sitting. Then do that throughout the entire prayer.” \nBoth ahaadeeth indicate \n    that the one who is ignorant is excused, but in the hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah he \n    is not commanded to repeat the prayer, whereas in the hadeeth of the one who \n    prayed badly, he is not commanded to repeat the prayers he had offered \n    before, rather he was commanded to repeat the current prayer only. \nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said, commenting on the hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah: As for the \n    words of the ignorant one, it was because he was new in Islam, so they are \n    like the words of one who forgets, so they did not invalidate his prayer if \n    they were few, because of this hadeeth of Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam, which we \n    are discussing here, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) did not command him to repeat the prayer. But he taught him \n    that it is haraam to talk during prayers for future reference. End quote. \nWith regard to commanding \n    the one who prayed badly to repeat his prayer when he did not command \n    Mu’aawiyah to do so, that is because there is a difference between doing \n    that which is forbidden and not doing that which is enjoined. Omitting what \n    is enjoined is not excused because of ignorance or forgetfulness when it is \n    possible to make it up, which is unlike doing what is forbidden. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said, in a discussion of things that are forbidden \n    whilst in ihraam: The correct view is that all of them may be excused. If a \n    person is excused due to ignorance, forgetting or being forced to do \n    something , there are no consequences to his actions whatsoever, whether it \n    has to do with having intercourse, hunting, clipping the nails, wearing \n    tailored garments or anything else. We have mentioned above evidence from \n    the Qur’aan, Sunnah and rational thought.  \nThe same applies to all \n    other actions that are forbidden during acts of worship; the ruling does not \n    apply, if they happen in cases of ignorance forgetfulness or compulsion, \n    because of the general meaning of the texts and because the penalty, fidyah \n    or kafaarah (expiation) is only prescribed in order to compensate for going \n    against the rules or to expiate sins, but the ignorant, forgetful person or \n    one who is forced did not deliberately go against the rules, and if he had \n    remembered, been aware or had the choice he would not have done it. \nIf a person drinks by \n    mistake in Ramadaan (because he forgets he is fasting), he does not have to \n    make it up. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah \n    be pleased with him): “Whoever forgets when he is fasting and eats or \n    drinks, let him complete his fast, for it is Allaah Who has fed him and \n    given him to drink.” The one who does not deliberately go against the rule \n    is not sinning and does not have to offer any fidyah. \nSimilarly, when ‘Adiyy ibn \n    Haatim wanted to fast, he took a black thread and a white thread, because of \n    the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and eat \n    and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct \n    from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) \n    till the nightfall” [al-Baqarah 2:187]. They used to take the rulings \n    directly from the Qur'aan. But the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) said to him: “Your pillow must be very wide, if the \n    black and white threads are beneath your pillow.” But he did not command him \n    to repeat the fast because he was ignorant of the ruling. \nSimilarly, Asma’ bint Abi \n    Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with her) said that they broke the fast on a \n    cloudy day at the time of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him), and he did not command them to make it up – because \n    they were unaware of the fact that the sun had not yet set. \nThe same applies to prayer. \n    The evidence is that Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) started to pray with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) and a man sneezed, so he said, “Yarhamuk-Allaah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on you)” whilst he was praying. The people glared at him – i.e., \n    they looked at him disapprovingly – and he (may Allaah be pleased with him) \n    said, “May my mother be bereft of me!”, i.e., he added more words to what he \n    had said. So they started to slap their thighs with their hands to make him \n    be quiet, and he fell silent. When he had said the salaam, the Messenger \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called him. Mu’aawiyah \n    said: May my father and mother be sacrificed for him; by Allaah I have never \n    seen a better teacher or better teachings before or since; he did not rebuke \n    me, hit me or revile me – he said: “This prayer is not the right place for \n    any of the people’s speech, rather it is tasbeeh, takbeer and recitation of \n    Qur’aan.” And he did not tell him to repeat it because he was unaware of the \n    ruling. \nThe texts point to this \n    principle, which is not blaming people for forgetting, not knowing, or being \n    forced to do something. This is what is implied by the words of Allaah \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n“your Lord has written \n    (prescribed) Mercy for Himself, so that if any of you does evil in \n    ignorance, and thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds (by obeying \n    Allaah), then surely, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”\n[al-An’aam 6:54], \nAnd the words of Allaah in \n    the hadeeth qudsi: “My mercy prevails over My wrath.” \nOmitting to do that which \n    is enjoined, however, is not excused on the basis of forgetting, ignorance \n    or being forced, when it is possible to make it up, because the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses \n    a prayer or forgets it, let him pray it when he remembers it.” So it is not \n    waved in the case of forgetting. And because the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not waive the current prayer on the \n    grounds of ignorance, as we see in the hadeeth of the one who prayed badly; \n    he commanded him to repeat it even though he was ignorant, because he was \n    omitting to do something enjoined.  \nMoreover, it is possible to \n    make up things that are enjoined, but forbidden things are over and done \n    with. But if a person is doing something that is forbidden, he should stop \n    doing it as soon as he realizes. If someone says that Allaah’s words \n    (interpretation of the meaning): “Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or \n    fall into error” [al-Baqarah 2:286] are general in meaning and include \n    both omitting things that are enjoined and doing things that are forbidden, \n    the response is that that is indeed the case; the one who does not do \n    something that is enjoined out of ignorance or because he forgets will not \n    be punished for not doing it, but not doing it means that he is obliged to \n    discharge his duty once the excuse is no longer applicable. End quote from\n    al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (7/200). \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the context of the hadith you referenced, where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) instructed a man who prayed badly to repeat his prayer, but did not instruct Mu’awiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) to do the same, we can derive several important points related to understanding the nuances of Islamic teachings and jurisprudence.\n\n1. **Personal Responsibility**: The instruction given to the individual who prayed poorly emphasizes personal responsibility in one’s worship. The man was told that what he performed was not satisfactory, and he was encouraged to learn and correct his prayer. This highlights the importance of understanding the proper method of prayer.\n\n2. **Knowledge and Circumstances**: Different conditions apply to different individuals. The Prophet's decision not to instruct Mu’awiyah to repeat his prayer may indicate that Mu’awiyah was more knowledgeable about the prayer and its proper conduct, or simply that the situation was understood differently by the Prophet (peace be upon him). \n\n3. **Case-by-Case Evaluation**: Islamic jurisprudence often involves analyzing each case individually. The Prophet’s (peace be upon him) responses varied based on the circumstances and the individuals involved. Each person’s level of education, understanding, and intention play significant roles.\n\n4. **Learning and Teaching**: The Prophet’s interaction with the man praying badly also serves as an educational moment. It indicates the importance of seeking knowledge and correction in worship practices, encouraging others to learn the proper way to perform acts of worship.\n\n5. **Gradual Guidance**: The methodology of teaching and transmitting knowledge in Islam often emphasizes gradual learning. This incident exemplifies how learning can take place over time, with emphasis on helping individuals improve their acts of worship.\n\nIn summary, this hadith illustrates the importance of personal accountability in worship, the need for correct understanding and practice, and the consideration of individual circumstances by the Prophet (peace be upon him). It serves as a reminder for all Muslims to continuously seek knowledge and improve their worship."

        "question": "Meaning of the lack in reason and religious commitment in women",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have not seen any lacking in reason and religious commitment but (at the same time) more able to rob the wisdom of the wise, except one of you [women].” They said: How are we lacking in religious commitment and reason, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Is not the testimony of a woman like half the testimony of a man?” They said: Yes. He said: “That is how she is lacking in reason. And when she menstruates, does she not refrain from praying and fasting?” They said: Yes. He said: “That is how she is lacking in religious commitment.” So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that her lacking in reason refers to her weak memory, and that her testimony must be supported by the testimony of another woman, in order to confirm the testimony, because she may forget, and add something to or take something away from her testimony, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her” [al-Baqarah 2:282]. \nWith regard to her lacking in religious commitment, that is because when she is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth, she does not pray or fast, and she does not make up the missed prayers, so this is lacking in religious commitment. But this lacking is not something for which she is called to account or blamed, rather it is something that happens by the will of Allah; for He is the One Who has prescribed that out of kindness towards her and so as to make things easier for her, because if she were to fast during menses and nifaas, that would harm her. By His mercy Allah has prescribed that she should not fast at the time of menses and nifaas, and she should make it up after that. \nWith regard to prayer, at the time of menses she is unable to purify herself, so by His mercy Allah has prescribed that she should not pray, and the same applies to nifaas, and He has not prescribed that she should make it up, because making it up would be very difficult, as prayers are offered five times a day, and menses may last for several days, seven or eight or more, and nifaas may last as long as forty days. So by His mercy and kindness towards her, Allah has waived the duty of offering and making up prayers.  \nThis does not mean that her reason is lacking entirely, or that her religious commitment is lacking entirely, rather the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that the lack in her reasoning has to do with what may happen of her testimony not being accurate, and the lack in her religious commitment has to do with what may happen of her missing prayers and fasts at the time of menses and nifaas.  But that does not imply that she is less than a man in everything, or that a man is better than her in everything. \nYes, the male gender is superior to the female gender in general, for many reasons, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means” [al-Nisa’ 4:34]. \nBut a woman may sometimes surpass a man in many things. How often has a woman surpassed men in her reason, religious commitment and memory. What is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with regard to the female gender being inferior to the male gender in reason and religious commitment is from this point of view, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained.  \nA woman may do a great deal of righteous deeds and thus surpass many men in her righteous deeds, fear of Allah and status in the Hereafter. She may have a great deal of interest in some matters and thus able to give proper testimony, better than that of  some men in some issues in which she has an interest. She may strive in memorization and understanding these issues, thus becoming a reference point with regard to Islamic history and many other things. This is clear to anyone who studies the state of women at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and after that. \nThus it is clear that this lack does not mean that women cannot be relied on in narration (of hadith etc) or in giving testimony, if it is supported by another woman. It also does not mean that she does not fear Allah or that she cannot be among the best of Allah’s slave and the best of the female slaves of Allah, if she adheres strictly to Islam. Although fasting is waived for her at the time of menses and nifaas, she has to make it up, and even prayer is waived in her case, but she does not have to make it up. This does not imply that she is lacking in all things when it comes to fearing Allah, obeying His commands and becoming well-versed in matters that are of interest to her. It is a lack that is specific to reason and religious commitment, in the way that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained. So the believer should not accuse her of being lacking in all things, or of being weak in religious commitment in all aspects, rather it is a specific type of lacking that has to do with her religious commitment and reason, which has to do with accuracy of testimony and so on. So she should be treated fairly and the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) should be interpreted in the best possible manner. And Allah knows best. \nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him)",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic discourse, the concept of \"lack of reason\" or \"lack of religious commitment\" in women is a sensitive issue and often misunderstood. It's important to approach this topic with a nuanced understanding.\n\n1. **Context of the Hadith**: Some hadiths mention that women are \"lacking in reason\" or \"lacking in religion.\" These statements are often discussed in the context of a specific incident reported in the life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) regarding the testimony of women and the observance of certain religious obligations, particularly during menstruation. Scholars interpret these hadiths in various ways, often emphasizing the context in which they were revealed.\n\n2. **Interpretation by Scholars**: Many scholars clarify that these statements do not imply a general inferiority of women in terms of intellect or spirituality. Instead, they often explain that the notion of \"lack of reason\" relates to specific legal or ritual contexts, such as the reliability of testimony, while \"lack of religious commitment\" may refer to temporary exemptions from certain religious practices, such as prayer and fasting during menstruation.\n\n3. **Equality in Islam**: The broader teachings of Islam emphasize the equality of all human beings, regardless of gender. The Quran acknowledges the worth and dignity of women, emphasizing their spiritual capacities and moral responsibilities.\n\n4. **Societal Perceptions**: It is also essential to consider societal interpretations and cultural practices that may have historically influenced how women's roles and capacities have been perceived within some Muslim communities. Many contemporary scholars advocate for a reevaluation of these interpretations in light of modern understandings.\n\nConclusively, any interpretation that suggests an inherent intellectual or spiritual deficiency in women is generally rejected by scholars who focus on the equitable and respectful treatment of women in Islam. Each person, regardless of gender, is responsible for their faith and actions."

        "question": "Authenticity of the Hadeeth “The sleep of the fasting person is worship”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth is not saheeh, and it is not proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nAl-Bayhaqi narrated in Shu’ab al-Eeman (3/1437) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Awfa (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The sleep of the fasting person is worship, his silence is tasbeeh (glorification), his du’a (supplication) is answered and his good deeds will be multiplied.” Its isnad (chain of narration) was classed as weak by al-Bayhaqi who said: Ma’roof ibn Hassan (one of the men in the isnad) is da’eef (weak) and Sulayman ibn ‘Amr al-Nakha’i is weaker than him. Al-‘Iraqi said in Takhreej Ihya’ ‘Uloom al-Deen (1/310): Sulayman al-Nakha’i is one of the liars. It was classed as da’eef by al-Manawi in Fayd al-Qadeer (9293) and it was mentioned by al-Albani in Silsilat al-Ahadeeth al-Da’eefah (4696) who said: It is da’eef. \nWhat the Muslims should do in general – and this applies even more so to khateebs and da’iyahs (callers to Islam) – is to verify reports before attributing a hadeeth to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is not permissible to attribute to him anything that he did not say. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Telling a lie about me is not like telling a lie about anyone else. Whoever tells a lie about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1391) and by Muslim in the introduction to his Saheeh (4). \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The saying \"The sleep of the fasting person is worship\" (نوم الصائم عباد) is not found in the most authentic collections of Hadith, such as Sahih al-Bukhari or Sahih Muslim. However, it is reported in various other books of Hadith with differing levels of authenticity.\n\nOne of the sources of this saying is from Imam Ahmad, and there are various reports attributed to different companions and scholars, but they have not reached the level of being considered authentic (Sahih) in the classical sense.\n\nNonetheless, many scholars interpret this saying to mean that sleep during fasting can be regarded as an act of worship because the intention (niyyah) behind fasting is to seek closeness to Allah. Thus, even acts that may seem mundane, like sleeping, can be turned into acts of worship if done with the right intention.\n\nIn summary, while the exact wording may lack strong authentication, the sentiment expressed has been acknowledged in Islamic tradition. It is advisable to focus on attaining sincerity in one’s worship during fasting and to remember that any act done for the sake of Allah can hold value.\n\nFor more detailed scholarly opinions, it is best to consult a knowledgeable scholar or refer to authoritative Islamic texts."

        "question": "A Weak Narration About the Virtues of Ramadaan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth of Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh. He said: Chapter on the virtues of the month of Ramadhan if the report is saheeh. Then he said: ‘Ali ibn Hijr al-Sa’di told us, Yoosuf ibn Ziyad told us, Humam ibn Yahya told us, from ‘Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad’an, from Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyab, from Salman (may Allah be pleased with them) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed us on the last day of Sha’ban and said: “O people, there has come to you a great month, a blessed month, a month in which there is a night that is better than a thousand months. Allah has made fasting it obligatory and spending its nights in prayer a voluntary act. Whoever draws close (to Allah) during it by doing a good deed will be like one who did an obligatory deed in any other month, and the one who does an obligatory deed in it will be like one who did seventy obligatory deeds in any other month. It is the month of patience, and the reward of patience is Paradise. It is the month of helping others. It is a month in which the believer’s provision is increased. Whoever gives a fasting person food with which to break his fast will have his sins forgiven and he will be ransomed from the Fire, and he will have a reward like his without it detracting from his reward in the slightest.” They said: Not all of us can find something to give to the fasting person with which to break his fast. He said: “Allah will give this reward to the one who gives a fasting person a date or a drink of water or a sip of milk. It is a month the beginning of which is mercy, the middle of which is forgiveness and the end of which is ransom from the Fire. The one who reduces the burden for his slave will be forgiven by Allah, and He will ransom him from the Fire. So do a lot of four good deeds during it, two with which you will please your Lord and two which you cannot do without. As for the two good deeds with which you will please your Lord, they are bearing witness that there is no god except Allah, and seeking His forgiveness. As for those which you cannot do without, they are asking Allah for Paradise and seeking refuge with Him from Hell. Whoever feeds a fasting person until he is full, Allah will give him to drink from my Cistern, a drink after which he will not thirst again until he enters Paradise.” \nIts isnad (chain of narration) includes ‘Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad’an, who is da’eef (weak) because of his bad memory. Its isnad also includes Yoosuf ibn Ziyad al-Basri, whose hadeeth is munkar (rejected). It also includes Humam ibn Yahya ibn Dinar al-‘Awadi, concerning whom Ibn Hajar said in al-Taqreeb: He is trustworthy but he may make mistakes. \nBased on this, the hadeeth with this isnad is not false, but it is weak. However, many of the virtues of Ramadhan are proven in the saheeh ahadeeth (authentic narrations). \nStanding Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas \nFatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta (10/84-85).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In discussing the virtues of Ramadan, it is essential to rely on authentic Hadiths and teachings of the Qur'an. While there are many narrations that highlight the significance and virtues of this blessed month, some reports may be considered weak (da'if) due to issues in their chain of transmission.\n\nOne commonly referenced, albeit weak, narration about the virtues of Ramadan can be articulated as follows:\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said, \"When Ramadan begins, the gates of Heaven are opened, the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained.\" While this narration is often cited, scholars have differing opinions on its authenticity. It is important to note that despite the classification of certain narrations, the essence of the meanings conveyed—such as the special spiritual opportunity that Ramadan provides for believers—are well established in stronger texts.\n\nAs always, when discussing Islamic teachings, it's critical to emphasize the importance of relying on trusted sources and scholars to ensure that the information shared is accurate and beneficial. For understanding the virtues of Ramadan, one may refer to authentic hadith collections like Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, as well as the Qur'an, which provides clear guidance on the significance of this month.\n\nIf you have a specific narration in mind or would like to inquire further about the virtues of Ramadan, feel free to ask!"

        "question": "Authenticity of “Religion is How You Deal With Others”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is not a hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and there is no basis for it in the books of the Sunnah prophetic teachings). \nIt was mentioned by al-Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in the introduction to the fifth volume of Silsilat al-Ahadeeth al-Da’eefah, p.11. He said concerning it: There is no basis for this, not even among the fabricated ahadeeth! End quote. \nAl-Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about it and he said: \nThis is not a hadeeth, rather it is a saying of the people. End quote. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The saying \"Religion is how you deal with others\" is often attributed to various thinkers and is not a direct quote from the Quran or Hadith. However, it encapsulates an important concept in Islam regarding the significance of interpersonal relations and ethical conduct towards others.\n\nIslam emphasizes the importance of good character, justice, kindness, and compassion in dealings with others. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) highlighted this in many of his teachings. For instance, he said: \"The best among you are those who have the best manners and character\" (Sahih Bukhari).\n\nThe Quran also teaches principles of justice, compassion, and fair dealings. For example, Allah says in Surah An-Nisa (4:135):\n\n\"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses in the name of Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives.\"\n\nThis underscores that a significant part of one's faith and practice in Islam revolves around how one interacts with others, embodying values like honesty, respect, and empathy.\n\nIn summary, while the phrase itself may not have a specific Islamic source, the underlying principle is very much aligned with Islamic ethics and teachings. It reflects a core idea in Islam that one's relationship with others is a critical aspect of one's faith."

        "question": "Meaning of “Narrated by the Two Shaykhs”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is meant by “the two Shaykhs” is al-Imam al-Bukhari and al-Imam Muslim (may Allah have mercy on them). \nAl-Bukhari is Muhammad ibn Isma’eel al-Bukhari (d. 256 AH). He wrote a book, Saheeh al-Bukhari, in which he compiled a number of saheeh ahadeeth (authentic prophetic traditions) from our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nMuslim is Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj al-Nisaboori (d. 261 AH). He is the author of Saheeh Muslim. These two books – Saheeh al-Bukaari and Saheeh Muslim – are the soundest books of ahadeeth from our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). \nIf it is said of a hadeeth (prophetic narration) that it was “narrated by the two Shaykhs”, what is meant is that it was narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim in their Saheehs. The same applies if it says “agreed upon,” i.e., al-Bukhari and Muslim both agreed on its narration. \nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in the introduction to Sharh Muslim (1/14): The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) are agreed that the soundest of books after the Holy Quran are al-Saheehayn, i.e., the two Saheehs of al-Bukhari and Muslim, and the ummah (global Muslim community) accepted that from them.

These two scholars are highly regarded in the Islamic tradition for their comprehensive collections of authentic hadith, which form the foundation of Sunni Islamic teachings.\n\nWhen a hadith is said to be \"narrated by the Two Shaykhs,\" it indicates that the narration is found in both Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, signifying that it is considered to be highly authentic (sahih) and reliable among scholars and practitioners of Islam.

        "question": "The story of how Salmaan al-Faarisi (may Allaah be pleased with him) came to Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The hadeeth which the questioner is referring to is a lengthy \n    hadeeth about the story of how the great Sahaabi Salmaan al-Faarisi (may \n    Allaah be pleased with him) came to Islam.  He was a Magian (Zoroastrian), \n    then he became a Christian, then he became a Muslim. That was after he had \n    met a number of Christian monks, the last of whom was a righteous man who \n    had knowledge of the last Prophet. The monk advised Salmaan to go to Arabia, \n    where the last Prophet would appear, and he described the place to him, and \n    it was the City of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) i.e., Madeenah. But there is nothing in this hadeeth to suggest that \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that this \n    monk was the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), rather ‘Eesa \n    (peace be upon him) is in heaven; Allaah took him up and he will remain \n    there until the appointed time, then Allaah will send him back down and he \n    will support Islam at the end of time. \n\n    The story of how Salmaan came to Islam is a great story, full \n    of lessons and exhortations. We will let the questioner read the hadeeth in \n    full, so that he might benefit from it: \n\n    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas said: Salmaan \n    al-Faarisi told me his story from his own lips. He said: \n\n    I was a Persian man, one of the people of Isbahaan, from a \n    village thereof called Jayy. My father was the chieftain of his village, and \n    I was the dearest of Allaah’s creation to him. He loved me so much that he \n    kept me in his house near the fire, as girls are kept in. I strove hard in \n    the Magian religion until I became the keeper of the fire, which I tended \n    and did not let go out for a moment. My father had a huge garden, and he was \n    busy one day with some construction work, so he said: “O my son, I am too \n    busy with this building today, go and check my garden,” and he told me some \n    of the things he wanted done. I went out, heading towards his garden, and I \n    passed by one of the Christian churches, where I could hear their voices as \n    they were praying. I did not know anything about the people because my \n    father had kept me in his house. When I passed by and heard their voices, I \n    entered upon them to see what they were doing. When I saw them, I was \n    impressed with their prayer and I was attracted to their way. I said: By \n    Allaah, this is better than the religion that we follow. By Allaah, I did \n    not leave them until the sun set, and I forgot about my father’s garden and \n    did not go there. I said to them: Where did this religion originate? They \n    said: In Syria. Then I went back to my father, who had sent people out to \n    look for me, and I had distracted him from all his work. When I came to him, \n    he said: O my son, where were you? Did I not ask you to do what I asked? I \n    said: O my father, I passed by some people who were praying in a church of \n    theirs, and I was impressed with what I saw of their religion. By Allaah, I \n    stayed with them until the sun set. He said: O my son, there is nothing good \n    in that religion. Your religion and the religion of your forefathers is \n    better than that. I said: No, by Allaah, it is better than our religion. He \n    was afraid for me, and he put fetters on my legs and kept me in his house. I \n    sent word to the Christians saying: If any Christian merchants come to you \n    from Syria, tell me about them. He said: Some Christian merchants came to \n    them from Syria, and they told me about them. I said to them: When they have \n    completed their business and want to go back to their own country, tell me \n    about that. So when they wanted to go back to their own country, they told \n    me about that, and I threw off the irons from my legs and went out with \n    them, until I came to Syria. When I reached Syria, I said: Who is the best \n    person in this religion? They said: The bishop in the church.  So I went to \n    him and said: I like this religion, and I would like to stay with you and \n    serve you in your church and learn from you and pray with you. He said: Come \n    in. So I went in with him, but he was a bad man. He would command them and \n    exhort them to give charity, but he kept a great deal of it for himself and \n    did not give it to the poor; he had amassed seven chests of gold and silver. \n    I hated him deeply when I saw what he was doing, then he died and the \n    Christians gathered to bury him. I said to them: This was a bad man; he \n    commanded you and exhorted you to give charity, but when you brought it to \n    him he kept it for himself and did not give any of it to the poor. They \n    said: How do you know that? Show us where his treasure is. So I showed them \n    where it was and they brought out seven chests filled with gold and silver. \n    When they saw that they said: By Allaah, we will never bury him; then they \n    crucified him and pelted him with stones.  Then they brought another man and \n    appointed him in his place. Salmaan said: I have never seen a man who does \n    not offer the five daily prayers who was better than him; he shunned this \n    world and sought the Hereafter and no one strive harder than him night and \n    day. I loved him as I had never loved anyone before, and I stayed with him \n    for a while. Then when he was about to die, I said: O So and so, I was with \n    you and I loved you as I had never loved anyone before, and now the decree \n    of Allaah has come to you as you see; to whom do you advise me to go? What \n    do you command me to do? He said: O my son, by Allaah, I do not know of \n    anyone today who follows what I followed. The people are doomed; they have \n    changed and abandoned most of what they used to follow, except for a man in \n    Mosul. He is So and so, and he follows what I used to follow, so go and join \n    him. When he died and was buried, I went to the man in Mosul. I said to him: \n    O So and so, So and so advised me when he died to come to you, and he told \n    me that you follow the same as he followed. He said to me: Stay with me. So \n    I stayed with him, and I found him to be a good man who followed the same as \n    his companion had followed. But soon he died. When he was dying I said to \n    him: O So and so, So and so advised me to come to you and told me to join \n    you, but now there has come to you from Allaah what you see. To whom do you \n    advise me to go? What do you command me to do? He said: O my son, by Allaah \n    I do not know of anyone who follows what we used to follow except a man in \n    Nasayyibeen. He is So and so; go to him. When he died and was buried, I went \n    to the man in Nasayyibeen. I came to him and told him my story and what my \n    companion had told me to do. He said: Stay with me. So I stayed with him and \n    I found him to be a follower of the same way as his two companions, and I \n    stayed with a good man. By Allaah, soon death came upon him, and when he was \n    dying I said to him: O So and so, So and so advised me to go to So and so; \n    then So and so advised me to come to you. To whom do you advise me to go and \n    what do you command me to do? He said: O my son, by Allaah we do not know of \n    anyone left who follows our way and to whom I can tell you to go, except a \n    man in ‘Ammooriyyah. He follows something like what we follow. If you wish, \n    go to him, for he follows our way. When he died and was buried, I went to \n    the man in ‘Ammooriyyah and told him my story. He said: Stay with me. So I \n    stayed with a man who was following the same way as his companions. I earned \n    wealth until I had cows and sheep, then the decree of Allaah came to him. \n    When he was dying I said to him: O So and so, I was with So and so, and So \n    and so told me to go to So and so; then So and so told me to go to So and \n    so; then So and so told me to come to you. To whom do you advise me to go \n    and what do you command me to do? He said: O my son, by Allaah, I do not \n    know of anyone who follows our way to whom I can advise you to go. But there \n    has come the time of a Prophet, who will be sent with the religion of \n    Ibraaheem. He will appear in the land of the Arabs and will migrate to a \n    land between two harrahs (lave fields; land with black rocks), between which \n    there are palm trees. He will have characteristics that will not be hidden. \n    He will eat of what is given as a gift but he will not eat of what is given \n    as charity. Between his shoulder blades is the Seal of Prophethood. If you \n    can go to that land then do so. Then he died and was buried, and I stayed in \n    ‘Ammooriyyah as long as Allaah willed I should stay, then some merchants of \n    Kalb passed by me and I said to them: Will you take me to the land of the \n    Arabs and I will give you these cows and sheep of mine? They said: Yes. So I \n    gave them the cows and sheep, and they took me there, but when they brought \n    me to Waadi al-Qura they wronged me and sold me as a slave to a Jewish man. \n    When I was with him I saw the palm trees, and I hoped that this was the land \n    that my companion had described to me, but I was not sure. Whilst I was with \n    him, a cousin of his from Banu Qurayzah came to him from Madeenah, and he \n    sold me to him, and he took me to Madeenah. By Allaah, as soon as I saw it, \n    I recognized it from the description given to me by my companion.  I stayed \n    there, and Allaah sent His Messenger, who stayed in Makkah as long as he \n    stayed, and I did not hear anything about him because I was so busy with the \n    work of a slave. Then he migrated to Madeenah, and by Allaah, I was at the \n    top of a palm tree belonging to my master, doing some work on it, and my \n    master was sitting there. Then a cousin of his came and stood beside him, \n    and said: May Allaah kill Banu Qaylah! By Allaah, right now they are \n    gathering in Quba’ to welcome a man who has come from Makkah today, and they \n    say that he is a Prophet. When I heard that, I began to shiver so much that \n    I thought I would fall on top of my master. I came down from the tree and \n    started saying to that cousin of his: What are you saying, what are you \n    saying? My master got angry and he struck me with his fist and said: What \n    has it got to do with you? Go back to your work! I said: Nothing; I just \n    wanted to make sure of what he was saying. I had something that I had \n    collected, and when evening came, I went to the Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was in Quba’, and I \n    entered upon him and said to him: I have heard that you are a righteous man \n    and that you have companions who are strangers and are in need. This is \n    something that I have to give in charity, and I see that you are more in \n    need of it than anyone else. I brought it near to him and the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to his \n    companions: “Eat,” but he refrained from eating.  I said to myself: This is \n    one. Then I went away and collected some more. The Messenger of Allaah  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) moved to Madeenah, then I came \n    to him and said: I see that you do not eat (food given in) charity; this is \n    a gift with which I wish to honour you. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate some of it and told his companions \n    to eat too. I said to myself: This is two. Then I came to the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was in \n    Baqee’ al-Gharqad, where he had attended the funeral of one of his \n    companions and he was wearing two shawls and was sitting among his \n    companions. I greeted him with salaam then I moved behind him, trying to \n    look at his back to see the Seal that my companion had described to me. When \n    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw \n    me going behind him, he realized that I was trying to find confirmation of \n    something that had been described to me, so he let his rida’ drop from his \n    back, and I saw the Seal and recognized it. Then I embraced him, kissing \n    (the Seal) and weeping, and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “Turn around.” So I turned \n    around and I told him my story as I have told it to you, O Ibn ‘Abbaas. The \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted \n    his companions to hear that. Then Salmaan was kept busy with the work of a \n    slave, until he had missed attending Badr and Uhud with the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said: Then the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to \n    me: “Draw up a contract of manumission, O Salmaan.” So I draw up a contract \n    of manumission with my master in return for three hundred palm trees which I \n    would plant for him, and forty uqiyahs. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to his companions: “Help your \n    brother.” So they helped me with the palm trees, one man gave thirty small \n    trees and another gave twenty, and another gave fifteen, and another gave \n    ten, i.e., each man gave according to what he had, until they had collected \n    three hundred small trees for me. Then the Messenger of Allaah  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “Go, O Salmaan, and dig the \n    holes where they are to be planted. When you have finished, come to me and I \n    will plant them with my own hand.” So I dug the holes for them, and my \n    companions helped me, then when I had finished, I came to him and told him. \n    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) \n    came out with me and we started to bring the trees close and the Messenger \n    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) planted them with \n    his own hand. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Salmaan, not one \n    single tree among them died. So I had paid off the trees but there still \n    remained the money. A piece of gold the size of an egg was brought to the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from \n    one of his campaigns. He said: “What happened to the Persian who had a \n    contract of manumission?” I was summoned to him and he said: “Take this and \n    pay off what you owe, O Salmaan.” I said: How could this pay off everything \n    I owe, O Messenger of Allaah? He said: “Take it, and Allaah will help you to \n    pay off what you owe.” So I took it and weighed it for them, and by the One \n    in Whose hand is the soul of Salmaan, it was forty uqiyahs, so I paid them \n    their dues and I was set free. I was present with the Messenger of Allaah \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at al-Khandaq, and after \n    that I did not miss any major event with him. \n\n    Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (5/441).

        "predicted_answer": "Salmaan al-Faarisi (may Allaah be pleased with him) has a remarkable story of search and conversion to Islam that highlights his quest for truth and guidance. \n\nHe was originally from Persia and came from a Zoroastrian family. From a young age, Salmaan felt a sense of dissatisfaction with the religious practices of his community. His thirst for spiritual truth drove him to explore different faiths. While in his homeland, he encountered Christians and was impressed by their beliefs. This led him to join them, and he remained with them for many years, learning more about Christianity.\n\nDuring his time with the Christians, he heard of a prophet who was soon to emerge in Arabia, who would bring a new message of monotheism. Motivated by this news and hoping to find this prophet, he traveled to Arabia. Salmaan faced a difficult journey, which included being captured and sold into slavery. He eventually found a master in Yathrib (later known as Medina), where he continued to seek knowledge and truth.\n\nWhen the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) began to preach in Medina, Salmaan heard about him. His heart was filled with hope that this might be the prophet he had been seeking. He attended the Prophet’s gatherings and was deeply moved by his message of Islam. Salmaan recognized the truth of the message of Tawheed (the oneness of Allah) and knew that he had finally found the guidance he had been searching for all along.\n\nAfter meeting the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), Salmaan embraced Islam and was welcomed into the community of believers. His conversion story is notable not only for his persistence in seeking the truth but also for his integral role in the early Muslim community. Salmaan al-Faarisi is known for his wisdom, his perspectives on various matters including the Battle of the Trench, and his contributions to Islamic teachings and practices.\n\nThe legacy of Salmaan al-Faarisi is a testament to the power of faith and the importance of seeking knowledge and truth, regardless of one’s background."

        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you mentioned is often referenced in discussions about naming conventions in Islam. The narration states that the best names are those that indicate servitude to Allah (e.g., Abdullah, Abd al-Rahman) or those derived from the name Muhammad.\n\nWhile some scholars have discussed the authenticity of this hadith, it is generally considered to be sahih (authentic) by various scholars. The importance of names in Islam is emphasized, where names that signify servitude to Allah are preferred. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that not all hadiths are universally accepted as authentic, and there can be differing opinions among scholars regarding their authenticity.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws, where it says: “Announce the marriage and conceal the engagement.” This is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth which was classed as such by al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (2494), and in Da’eef al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, 922. \nBut the first part of it is saheeh with the word “proclaim.”  \nAhmad narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Proclaim marriages.” This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1993. \nProclaiming marriages, in the sense of announcing them and publicizing them, is obligatory according to the majority of scholars, indeed it is one of the conditions of a marriage being valid, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage except with a wali (guardian) and two witnesses of good character.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi from ‘Imraan and ‘Aa’ishah; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7557. \nSome scholars regarded it as mustahabb to conceal the engagement for fear of hasad (destructive envy) which could lead to trouble between the man and the family of his fiancée, as stated in Haashiyat al-‘Adawi ‘ala Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel, 3/167. \nThis is supported by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Seek help in meeting your needs by keeping quiet, for everyone who is blessed is envied.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 943. \nThis does not apply only to engagement, rather a person should not show openly the blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon him to one who will envy him for that. \nWith regard to holding engagement parties, this is something that many people do, and there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allaah. But it should be noted that we must adhere to the limits set by sharee’ah in these parties, so there should be no free mixing of men and women, or use of musical instruments apart from the daff, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) allowed use of the daff in wedding parties. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you referenced, \"Conceal the engagement and proclaim the marriage,\" relates to the cultural practices surrounding marriage in Islam. The message behind this hadith emphasizes the importance of transparency and public announcement regarding the marital union itself, while encouraging discretion during the engagement period.\n\nThe engagement (khitbah) is often a private matter involving the families of the bride and groom, while the marriage (nikah) should be publicly announced. The idea is to ensure that the marriage is known in the community, which helps to discourage any doubts or suspicions about the relationship and promotes a healthy social environment.\n\nThis hadith underscores the significance of public recognition in legitimizing the marital relationship, thereby fostering community awareness and support. As with all hadiths, scholars may discuss their authenticity and implications, so it's important to refer to reputable sources and scholars for a comprehensive understanding.\n\nIf you have further questions or need clarification on specific aspects, feel free to ask!"

These hardships are part of the test of life and are ultimately meant to bring a believer closer to Allah and enhance their moral and spiritual character.\n\nIt is important to recognize that hardships are not necessarily a punishment, but can be seen as opportunities for growth, reflection, and strengthening one's faith. The believer is encouraged to maintain patience (sabr) and to have trust (tawakkul) in Allah during these times.\n\nFor a more precise interpretation or to discuss any specific applications or related teachings, it would be beneficial to refer to well-known scholars or authentic sources in Islamic literature."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tirmidhi: ‘Abbaas al-Doori \n    al-Baghdaadi told us, Yahya ibn Abi Bukayr told us, Shareek told us, \n    narrating from ‘Aasim who is Ibn Bahdalah, from Abu Saalih from Abu Hurayrah \n    from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: \n    “The Fire was stoked for a thousand years until it turned red, then it was \n    stoked for a thousand years until it turned white, then it was stoked for a \n    thousand years until it turned black, and it is intensely black.” \n\n    And he said: Suwayd told us, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak told \n    us, from Shareek, from ‘Aasim, from Abu Saalih or another man, from Abu \n    Hurayrah, a similar report, but he did not attribute it to the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Abu ‘Eesa al-Tirmidhi said: the \n    hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah concerning this is more likely to be mawqoof (i.e., \n    to have an interruption in the chain of narration); I do not know of anyone \n    who attributed it to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) apart from Yahya ibn Abi Bukayr (who narrated it) from Shareek. \n\n    Al-Albaani said: This Yahya is thiqah (trustworthy) and is \n    accepted in al-Saheehayn, so it is not possible to criticize him, \n    especially since Shareek, who is the son of ‘Abd-Allaah al-Nakha’i al-Qaadi, \n    who has a bad memory, appears in the isnaad and this is the weak point of \n    hadeeth. This is supported by his confusion; sometimes he attributes it to \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and sometimes \n    he does not, and sometimes he is definite in his isnaad and says, “from Abu \n    Saalih”, and sometimes he is uncertain and says, “from Abu Saalih or another \n    man.” These are signs that he is imprecise and does not have a good memory. \n    So no wonder the scholars who had knowledge of men’s biographies classed him \n    as da’eef (weak).

He was met by Jibreel who asked him: “O Ibraaheem, do you \n    have any need?” Ibraaheem said, “Of you, no.” Jibreel said: “Then ask your \n    Lord.” Ibraaheem said: “His knowledge of my situation is sufficient \n    asking.” \n\n    Al-Baghawi mentioned this in his tafseer (commentary) on \n    Soorat al-Anbiya’, and indicated that it is da’eef (weak).  (5/327).  \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa \n    (1/183): \n\n    The report which says that when Ibraaheem was thrown into the \n    fire Jibreel said to him, “Ask (of your Lord)” and he said, “His knowledge \n    of my situation is sufficient asking” has no sound isnaad, and it is false. \n    Rather what is proven in al-Saheeh from Ibn 'Abbaas is that he said, \n    “Hasbi Allaah wa ni’m al-wakeel (Allaah is sufficient for me and He \n    is the best dispoer of affairs).”  \nWith regard to Ibraaheem \n    asking of his Lord, this is mentioned in the Qur’aan in more than one place, \n    so how could he have said, “His knowledge of my situation is sufficient \n    asking” ?? \n\n    Ibn Taymiyah also said (8/358):   \n\n    With regard to his saying “His knowledge of my situation is \n    sufficient asking”, this is false and goes against what Allaah tells us \n    about Ibraaheem and other Prophets and how they prayed to Allaah and asked \n    of Him. It also goes against what Allaah has commanded His slaves to ask Him \n    for, which is the good things of this world and the Hereafter, such as when \n    they said (interpretation of the meaning): \n\"Our \n    Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that \n    which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!\"\n[al-Baqarah 2:201]\nAnd making du’aa’ to \n    Allaah and asking of Him and putting one's trust in Him are all acts of \n    worship that are prescribed in Islam. \n\n    This hadeeth was also mentioned by al-Albaani in \n    al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (21). He said: It is one of the Israa’eeliyyaat \n    (reports from Jewish sources) and has no basis in any report that can be \n    attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). \n    Some of the Sufis adopted this meaning when they said, “Your asking of Him \n    is an accusation of Him.” \n\n    Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  \n\n    This is serious misguidance. Would the Prophets accuse their \n    Lord by asking Him for various things? Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) said:  \n“O our Lord! I have made some of my \n    offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the \n    Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As‑Salaat \n    (Iqaamat‑as‑Salat). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, \n    and (O Allaah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.\n\n    O our Lord! Certainly, You know what we conceal and what \n    we reveal. Nothing on the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allaah…”\n\n    [Ibraaheem 14:37-38 – interpretation of the meaning]\n\n    Many du’aa’ of the Prophets are mentioned in the Qur’aan and \n    Sunnah.  \n\n    The one who says such a thing seems to be unaware of the fact \n    that du’aa’, which means beseeching and turning to Allaah, is a great act of \n    worship, regardless of what need one is asking to be met. Hence the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Du’aa’ is worship.” \n    Then he recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My \n    Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your \n    (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and \n    do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter \n    Hell in humiliation!”\n [Ghaafir 40:60]\n    \n    That is because in du’aa’ the slave demonstrates his complete \n    submission to his Lord and his need for Him and his dependence upon Him. \n    Whoever turns away from du’aa’ turns away from worship of Allaah. No wonder \n    there are so many ahaadeeth which enjoin and encourage du’aa’, and the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does \n    not make du’aa’ to Allaah, He will be angry with him.” \n\n    This was narrated by al-Haakim, who classed it as saheeh, and \n    al-Dhahabi agreed with him. It is a hasan hadeeth.  \n\n    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) said: “Ask Allaah for everything, even a lace for your shoes, because \n    if Allaah does not make it easy for you to obtain it, you will not be bale \n    to obtain it.” Narrated by Ibn al-Sunni (no. 349) with a hasan isnaad, and \n    it has corroborating reports in the hadeeth of Anas which was narrated by \n    al-Tirmidhi (4/292 and others). \nIn conclusion, this \n    report which is attributed to Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) could not have \n    been uttered by any Muslim who understands the importance of du’aa’ in \n    Islam, so how can it have been said by the one who called us Muslims? \n\n    Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah, 1/29.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase “His knowledge of my situation is sufficient asking” suggests the idea that God (Allah) is fully aware of one’s circumstances and needs, and therefore, there is no need to ask for help verbally. In Islam, this reflects a belief in God's omniscience and His understanding of all things.\n\nIn many Islamic teachings, it is believed that God knows the intentions and difficulties of His servants. This sentiment aligns with the concept of putting one’s trust in Allah (tawakkul), believing that He knows what is best for us, even when we do not articulate our needs. \n\nWhile it is encouraged to make supplications (dua) and seek help from Allah, one can find comfort in the notion that God is aware of our struggles without needing to express them verbally. However, making dua is also an act of worship and a means of drawing closer to Allah.\n\nIf you have a more specific context in mind regarding this phrase or wish to explore its implications further, feel free to provide more details!"

The Muslim should be cautious and should not attribute anything \n    to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) except that \n    which he knows is proven to be soundly narrated from him. \nThis hadeeth – “Allaah loves those who are stubborn in \n    making du’aa’” – is not saheeh and cannot be attributed to the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\nIt was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Du’aa’ \n    (2/795), by al-‘Aqeeli in al-Du’afa’ al-Kabeer (4/452), by Ibn ‘Adiyy \n    in al-Kaamil, 7/2621).\nAl-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhees: It was \n    narrated only by Yoosuf ibn al-Safar from al-Awzaa’i, and he is matrook \n    (rejected). Al-Albaani said in al-Irwa’ (3/143); It is mawdoo’ \n    (fabricated).\nAnd he stated in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah \n    (2/96-637) that it is baatil (false).\nThis is with regard to whether this wording can be \n    attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\nWith regard to the meaning:\nWhat is meant by being persistent in du’aa’ is repeating \n    it. It is proven that this was what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) did. Muslim (1794) narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah \n    be pleased with him) said: When the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) made du’aa’ he would repeat it three times, and when he \n    asked he would ask three times.\nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\nThis shows that it is mustahabb to repeat du’aa’s three \n    times. The phrase “and when he asked” refers to du’aa’ as well, but the idea \n    is repeated in different words by way of emphasis.\nAl-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Chapter \n    on repeating du’aa’s.” Then he mentioned the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may \n    Allaah be pleased with her), that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) made du’aa’ to Allaah and repeated the du’aa’, when the \n    Jew Labeed ibn al-A’sam put a spell on him. ‘Aa’ishah said: Until one day, \n    or one night, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) made du’aa’, then he made du’aa’, then he made du’aa’… Narrated by \n    al-Bukhaari, 6391; Muslim, 2189.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in \n    al-Daa’ wa’l-Dawa’ (p. 25): One of the most beneficial of remedies is \n    persisting in du’aa’.\nIn Kitaab al-Zuhd by Imam Ahmad (305) it is \n    narrated from Qataadah: Mawraq said: I can find no other likeness for the \n    believer except that of a man who is at sea, clinging onto a piece of wood, \n    and saying, “O Lord, O Lord,” that Allaah might save him.\nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you referenced highlights the importance of persistence in making supplication (du’aa) to Allah. While the exact wording may vary, the essence of the message is that Allah appreciates and loves His servants who continuously call upon Him, showing sincerity and reliance on Him.\n\nOne hadith that conveys a similar meaning is narrated by Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him), where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: “Allah does not get tired of giving until you get tired of asking” (Sahih Muslim). This encourages believers to keep making du’aa and to do so with hope and faith in Allah's mercy.\n\nPersistence in supplication reflects a believer's recognition of their need for Allah and their trust in His wisdom and timing. It is encouraged to be steadfast in prayer, for Allah listens and responds in ways that may be beyond our immediate understanding.\n\nRemember that the beauty of du’aa lies not just in the answer, but also in the act of turning to Allah with sincerity and dedication."

        "question": "Soundness of the Hadeeth “Whoever persists in saying the first takbeer at the beginning of Fajr prayer for forty days…”?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    In Shu’ab \n    al-Eeman by al-Bayhaqi there is a marfoo’ hadeeth (report) narrated from \n    Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) according to which the \n    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Fajr \n    and ‘Isha in congregation and does not miss one rak’ah, he will be recorded \n    as being free from two things: free from the Fire and free from \n    hypocrisy.” (Shu’ab al-Eeman, 3/62). \n\n    It says in \n    al-‘Ilal al-Mutanahiyah: This hadeeth is not saheeh (authentic) and its \n    narrators are not known apart from Bakr ibn Ahmad narrating from Ya’qoob ibn \n    Tahiyyah, both of whose condition is unknown. (1/432).  \n\n    But a \n    different version was narrated in Sunan al-Tirmithi, where it says: “Whoever \n    prays to Allah for forty days in congregation, catching up with the first \n    takbeer, he will be recorded as being free from two things: free from the \n    Fire and free from hypocrisy.” (al-Tirmithi no. 241; classed as da’eef by \n    al-Tirmithi but as hasan/sound by al-Albani). \n\n    This \n    hadeeth was also classed as da’eef by a number of earlier scholars, who \n    stated that it is mursal (chain does not reach the Companions), but it was \n    classed as hasan by some of the later scholars. See Talkhees al-Habeer, \n    2/27. \n\n    The \n    hadeeth is not limited to Fajr prayer only, rather the reward mentioned in \n    the hadeeth is connected to being present for the opening takbeer of all the \n    five daily prayers. \n\n    \n    Undoubtedly being keen to catch up with the opening takbeer for this period \n    of time is an indication of the strength of a person’s religious \n    commitment. \n\n    So long as \n    the hadeeth can be interpreted in a sound manner, there is the hope that the \n    one who is keen to do what is mentioned therein will attain this great \n    virtue. The least that he will attain by means of this keenness is training \n    himself to regularly observe this important rite of Islam. \n\n    We ask \n    Allah to write for us and for you freedom from hypocrisy and from the Fire, \n    for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Responsive.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you are referring to is believed to encourage the act of consistently saying the first takbeer (the opening declaration of faith) for forty days in Fajr prayer. However, the authenticity of this hadith has been debated by scholars.\n\nMany scholars classify this hadith as weak (daif) due to issues in its chain of narration (isnad) or the reliability of the narrators involved.

        "question": "Weak Narration Concerning the prohibition of Helping to Kill a Muslim",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly:  \n\n    This hadeeth was \n    narrated by Ibn Majah (2620) and al-‘Aqeeli in al-Du’afa (457) and \n    al-Bayhaqi in al-Sunan (8/22). It is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth which is not \n    soundly narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him). Imam Ahmad said: This hadeeth is not saheeh. \n\n    Indeed, Abu Hatim \n    ruled it to be mawdoo’ (fabricated), and al-Thahabi agreed with him. Ibn \n    al-Jawzi narrated it in al-Mawdoo’at (2/104). Ibn Hibban said: This is a \n    mawdoo’ (fabricated) hadeeth which has no basis. \n\n    Ibn Hajar and \n    al-Munthiri said: (This is) a very weak hadeeth. Al-Zayla’i said: it is a \n    weak (da’eef) hadeeth. \n\n    Al-Albani \n    mentioned it in Da’eef Sunan Ibn Majah and said: (it is) very weak. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    Even though this \n    hadeeth is weak, there is no doubt that helping to kill a Muslim unlawfully \n    is a major sin. \n\n    Al-‘Izz ibn ‘Abd \n    al-Salam (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Qawa’id: \n\n    If you want to \n    know the difference between a minor sin and a major sin, then compare the \n    consequences of the sin with the consequences of a major sin as stated in \n    the texts. If it is less than the least consequences of a major sin, then it \n    is a minor sin. If it is equal to or greater than the least consequences of \n    a major sin, then it is also a major sin. Whoever insults the Lord, may He \n    be glorified, or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), \n    or mocks the Messengers, or disbelieves in one of them, or throws filth at \n    the Ka’bah, or throws the Mus-haf (copy of the Quran)  into the garbage – \n    these are major sins, even though the sharee’ah does not state clearly that \n    they are major sins. Similarly, if a person holds down a chaste woman for \n    another to commit zina (adultery) with her, or holds down a Muslim for him \n    to kill him, the evil consequences of these acts are undoubtedly greater \n    than the consequences of consuming the wealth of an orphan, even though that \n    is also a major sin. Similarly if a person guides the kuffar (non-Muslims) \n    to the weak points of the Muslims, even though he knows that they will \n    destroy the Muslims as a result of his help and will take their women and \n    children captive, and plunder their wealth, then this is more serious than \n    his running away from the battle field with no excuse, even though that is a \n    major sin. Similarly if he tells a lie about a person for which he knows \n    that person will be killed, then it is a major sin, but telling a lie which \n    will result in a date being taken away from him, is not a major sin.”  \n\n    Helping a kafir to \n    kill a Muslim may constitute kufr (disbelief) in some cases. The scholars \n    mentioned things that nullify a person’s Islam, one of which is supporting \n    the mushrikeen (polytheists) and helping them against the Muslims. See \n    question no. \n    \n    33691. \n\n    Thirdly: \n\n    It is not \n    permissible for anyone to take the matter of attributing hadeeth to the \n    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) lightly. He (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever tells lies about me, it is \n    not like telling lies about anyone else. Whoever tells lies about me \n    deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1291; \n    Muslim, 4. \n\n    And he (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever narrates a hadeeth from me \n    which is known to be false, he is one of the liars.” Narrated by Muslim in \n    the introduction to his Saheeh. \n\n    And al-Nawawi \n    said: \n\n    [This hadeeth has \n    been narrated in two versions, one of which says al-kathibayn (the two liars \n    – dual form) and the more well-known version which says al-kathibeen (the \n    liars – plural).] Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: The version which we have says \n    al-kathibeen (plural) and Abu Na’eem al-Asbahani narrated it in his book \n    al-Mustakhraj ‘ala Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Samurah, where it says \n    al-kathibayn, in the dual form. Some of the imams said that the word yura \n    [translated above as “known to be” as yara [meaning “knowing (himself).” Or \n    it could mean “thinking [that it is false].” In this case the hadeeth means \n    that the person becomes a sinner only when he himself knows or thinks that \n    what he is narrating from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) is a lie. But if he did not know or think that it was a lie, then there \n    is no sin on him if he narrated it, even if others think that it is false, \n    or know that to be the case.  But what we may conclude from this hadeeth is \n    that lying is strongly condemned, and that whoever thinks that what he is \n    narrating is most likely false, but still narrates it, is a liar. How can he \n    not be a liar when he is narrating something that did not happen? \n\n    If a person does \n    not have sufficient knowledge to be able to distinguish between a saheeh \n    (authentic) hadeeth and a da’eef (weak) one, then he should ask the scholars \n    who are specialized in this field, and refer to the comments of the imams \n    and scholars that are compiled in books, in accordance with the words of \n    Allah (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “So ask of those who know the Scripture, if you know not.” [16:43].",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the sanctity of a Muslim's life is of paramount importance. The prohibition against harming or killing a Muslim is underscored by numerous authentic narrations from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). \n\nOne of the fundamental principles is derived from the Quran, where Allah says: \n\n**\"And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right...\"** (Quran 17:33).\n\nIn addition to Quranic injunctions, there are several Hadiths that emphasize the grave sin of killing a Muslim. For instance, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:\n\n**\"Whoever helps in the killing of a Muslim, even with a word, will face the consequences (of this action) in Hellfire.\"** (This is found in collections such as Sunan Abu Dawood and others, although the authenticity can vary).\n\nWhile some narrations may be considered weak, the consensus among scholars is that any form of assistance in harming or killing a Muslim, whether through action, words, or support, is condemned. The overwhelming majority of scholars agree on the prohibition of aiding or abetting in such a grave sin.\n\nIf you come across a specific weak narration that seems to suggest otherwise, it's crucial to understand that weak narrations do not carry weight in matters of Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) unless they are supported by stronger evidence or consensus.\n\nTherefore, it’s imperative to adhere to the established principles of Islamic teachings that prioritize peace, safeguarding life, and upholding justice. It's always best to refer to qualified scholars or sources for personal guidance in such matters."

The Hadeeth you are referring to, “There is no Mahdi except ‘Eesa,” is indeed a subject of debate among scholars.\n\nWhile the idea of the Mahdi is widely accepted in Sunni and Shia traditions, the specific Hadeeth in question may not have a sound chain of narrators (isnad) and thus could be classified as weak (da‘if) or not authentically traced back to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). \n\nMost scholars who address this topic emphasize that the Mahdi will come before the Day of Judgment, and although 'Eesa (Jesus) will return, he is distinct from the Mahdi.

        "question": "Islam Began as Something Strange",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This hadeeth was narrated by Muslim (145) from Abu Hurayrah \n    (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam began as something strange and \n    will revert to being strange as it began, so give glad tidings to the \n    strangers.”\n\n    Al-Sindi said in Hashiyat Ibn Majah:\n\n    “Strange” refers to the small number of its adherents. The \n    basic meaning of ghareeb (a stranger) is being far from one's homeland. “And \n    will revert to being strange” refers to the small number of those who will \n    adhere to its teachings even though its followers are many. “So give glad \n    tidings to the strangers” means those who follow its commands. “Tooba (glad \n    tidings)” has been interpreted as meaning Paradise or a great tree in \n    Paradise. This shows that supporting Islam and following its commands may \n    require leaving one's homeland and being patient in bearing the difficulties \n    of being a stranger, as was the case in the beginning.\n\n    In Sharh Saheeh Muslim, Al-Nawawi quoted al-Qadi ‘Iyad as \n    saying concerning the meaning of this hadeeth:\n\n    “Islam began among a few individuals, then it spread and \n    prevailed, then it will reduce in numbers until there are only a few left, \n    as it was in the beginning.”\n\n    It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 2/170:\n\n    The meaning of this hadeeth is that Islam began as something \n    strange, when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) called people to Islam, but no one responded except a few here and \n    there. At that time it was something strange because its people were like \n    strangers amongst others and they were few in number and weak, in contrast \n    to the great numbers and strength of their enemies who persecuted the \n    Muslims. Then some of them migrated to Abyssinia, fleeing for the sake of \n    their religion from tribulation and to save themselves from persecution and \n    oppression, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) migrated at Allah’s command to Madeenah, after suffering intense \n    persecution and in the hope that Allah would give him people to support him \n    in his call and support Islam. Allah fulfilled his hopes, granted victory to \n    his troops and supported His slave. \n\n    The Islamic state was established and Islam spread, with the \n    help of Allah, throughout the land; Allah made the word of kufr (disbelief) \n    lowest and the word of Allah is (always) uppermost, for Allah is Almighty, \n    All-Wise, and honour, power and glory belong to Allah, and to His Messenger \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and to the believers [cf \n    al-Munafiqoon 63:8]. This continued for a long time, then division and \n    dissent spread among the Muslims and weakness and failure increased \n    gradually, until Islam once again became something strange as it was in the \n    beginning. But this is not because of their small numbers, because at that \n    time they will be many, rather it is because they do not adhere to their \n    religion or cling to the Book of their Lord and the teachings of the \n    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), apart from \n    those whom Allah wills. So they become distracted and turn to competing in \n    worldly matters, like those who came before them, and they fight amongst \n    themselves for leadership. So the enemies of Islam found a way in and they \n    colonized their lands, humiliated their people and treated them badly. This \n    is the way in which Islam returned to being strange as it was in the \n    beginning.\n\n    A number of scholars – including Shaykh Muhammad Rasheed Rida \n    – thought that this hadeeth gives glad tidings of a second victory of Islam \n    after it becomes something strange again. They base this on the metaphor \n    used by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said, \n    “… will revert to being strange as it began.” So just as following the \n    initial strangeness and alienation the Muslims were victorious and Islam \n    spread, this will happen again after the second period of strangeness and \n    alienation.\n\n    This view is more likely to be correct, and is supported by \n    what is proven in the ahadeeth (reports) about the Mahdi and the descent of \n    ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) at the end of time, when Islam will spread and the \n    Muslims will be victorious, and kufr and the kafirs (non-Muslims) will be \n    defeated.\n\n    And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings \n    and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase \"Islam began as something strange\" comes from a saying (hadith) of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) which highlights the initial reception of Islam in society. The full hadith states: \"Islam began as something strange, and it will revert to being strange as it began, so glad tidings to the strangers.\" (Sahih Muslim)\n\nThis saying can be interpreted in several ways:\n\n1. **Initial Rejection**: When the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) began preaching the message of Islam, it was met with resistance and skepticism from many in Meccan society, particularly those in power who felt threatened by his teachings. This can be seen as a reflection of how new ideas or movements are often viewed with suspicion.\n\n2. **Proposed Transformation**: The phrase emphasizes that, as Islam spread and established itself, true adherence to its principles might again become rare and misunderstood in a world that could stray from its core values.\n\n3. **Glory in Strangeness**: The latter part of the hadith offers consolation and hope to those who uphold Islamic values, suggesting that those who remain steadfast in their belief will be rewarded, even if they feel out of place in society.\n\nOverall, this saying serves to remind Muslims of the importance of remaining true to their faith, especially during times when it may seem unpopular or difficult. It encourages believers to find strength and confidence in their identity as Muslims, even when their beliefs might be viewed as \"strange\" by the wider society."

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, various hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) are recorded, and some are considered authentic (sahih), while others may be deemed weak (da'if) or fabricated (mawdu'). When discussing a specific fabricated hadith about advice given to 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, it's important to approach the subject with care, as the integrity of the narratives surrounding the Prophet and his companions is crucial in Islamic teachings.\n\nOne well-known incident involves 'Ali being advised by the Prophet Muhammad regarding various issues, including justice, leadership, and the importance of knowledge. However, scholars have emphasized the need to verify the authenticity of specific narrations attributed to them. \n\nFor instance, there are numerous fabricated hadiths that may present moral or ethical advice purportedly given to 'Ali that lack a chain of trustworthy narrators (isnad) or contradict established principles of Islam. Such fabrications can arise for various reasons, including political motivations or sectarian divisions.\n\nIf you are seeking a particular hadith or looking to understand a specific piece of advice attributed to 'Ali that is known to be fabricated, it would be helpful to know more details about it. In general, scholars often advise checking reputable hadith collections and the works of hadith critics (muhaddithin) to discern the authenticity of narrations.\n\nFor any serious study or application, consulting knowledgeable scholars or ulama who specialize in hadith science is highly recommended."

        "question": "Soundness of the Narration About Fifteen Punishments for One Who Neglects Prayer",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe hadeeth, “Whoever neglects prayer, Allah will send fifteen punishments upon him, six in this world, three when he is dying, three in the grave and three when he emerges from the grave…” is a fabricated (mawdoo’) hadeeth which is falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nConcerning this hadeeth, Sh. Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in the magazine al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah (22/329): With regard to the hadeeth which the author of this pamphlet attributes to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the punishment of the one who does not pray, and which says that fifteen punishments will be sent upon him, etc., this is one of the fabricated ahadeeth (reports) that are falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as was stated by the scholars (may Allah have mercy on him) such as al-Hafiz al-Dhahabi in Lisan al-Meezan, and al-Hafiz ibn Hajar and others. \nSimilarly the Standing Committee issued a fatwa, no. 8689, declaring this hadeeth to be false, as it says in Fatawa al-Lajnah, 4/468. Among the things mentioned in this fatwa which it is worth quoting here are: \nWhat has been narrated from Allah and from His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the punishment of the one who does not pray is sufficient. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, as‑salah (the formal prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.”\n[al-Nisa 4:103] \nAnd Allah says of the people of Hell (interpretation of the meaning): \n“‘What has caused you to enter Hell?’\nThey will say: ‘We were not of those who used to offer the salah (prayers).’”\n[al-Muddaththir 74:42-43]\nAnd He mentioned among their attributes the fact that they did not pray.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives up prayer is a kafir (disbeliever).” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasai, 431; Ibn Majah, 1079. Classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2113. And there are other verses and ahadeeth (narrations) which speak of giving up the prayer, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described it as kufr (disbelief).\nSee also question no.  2182.\nAl-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth is mawdoo’ (fabricated) and falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is not permissible to propagate it unless it is accompanied by a statement that it is fabricated, so that the people will have a clear understanding about it.\nFatawa al-Shaykh published by the Daw’ah center in ‘Anayzah, 1/6\nWe ask Allah to make you steadfast in your keenness to call your brothers and advise them, but you have to make it clear to everyone who is keen to do good for the people and to warn them against evil that it must be done in accordance with that which is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and that there is sufficient material in the saheeh reports that we have no need for the da’eef (weak) material.\nWe ask Allah to grant you success and to guide those whom you call and all the Muslims to follow the straight path.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The narration regarding the fifteen punishments for one who neglects prayer is a subject of debate among scholars. Generally, many scholars express skepticism about the authenticity and soundness of such narrations. \n\nIn Islam, the prayer (Salah) is one of the five pillars, and neglecting it is viewed very seriously. While it is well-acknowledged in the Hadith literature that there are severe consequences for neglecting prayer, the specific narration detailing fifteen punishments is not widely accepted in authoritative Hadith collections like Sahih Bukhari or Sahih Muslim.\n\nIt is essential for Muslims to refer to reliable sources for their understanding and to focus on the well-established teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah regarding prayer. Engaging in regular prayer is emphasized, and warnings about neglecting it are meant to encourage adherence rather than to instill fear through unverified narrations.\n\nFor a precise scholarly position, it is advisable to consult knowledgeable scholars or references from authentic Islamic texts."

        "predicted_answer": "The phrase “I ask You by the glory from Your Throne” can be related to various supplications (duas) mentioned in Islamic tradition. It reflects a deep sense of reverence and a method of invoking Allah's attributes while making a request in prayer or supplication.\n\nHowever, it is important to clarify that while the sentiment of using Allah's attributes is found in many authentic hadiths and practices, the specific wording of this phrase may not be found in the most widely accepted collections of hadith literature. Nonetheless, many scholars encourage believers to call upon Allah using His names and attributes as a means of seeking closeness and expressing one’s needs.\n\nIf you're looking for a specific hadith or context related to this phrase, it would be good to reference classical Islamic texts or seek knowledge from qualified scholars to gain better insight into its usage and authenticity.

But it is mawdoo’ (fabricated), and the men of its isnad (chain of narrators) are either majhool (unknown) or matrook (rejected). \nPrayer at night is mustahabb (recommended) on all days, and is not restricted to what is mentioned in this fabricated hadith.  \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (in charity in Allah’s Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them.\nNo person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.”\n[32:16-17] \n“Verily, the Muttaqoon (the pious) will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs (in the Paradise),\nTaking joy in the things which their Lord has given them.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is essential to differentiate between authentic Hadith and fabricated or weak ones. Qiyam al-Layl, or night prayers, hold significant virtue, particularly during the last third of the night. However, regarding specific nights, including Saturday night, it is crucial to consult the sources that classify Hadith by their authenticity.\n\nMany scholars emphasize the importance of relying on authentic Hadith collections like Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim or other approved sources. If there are specific narrations that claim particular virtues for praying Qiyam al-Layl on Saturday night, it is crucial to evaluate their chains of transmission (isnad) and their content (matn).\n\nGenerally, while engaging in optional prayers such as Qiyam al-Layl (Tahajjud) is encouraged, one should be cautious about attributing specific virtues to certain nights based on weak or fabricated Hadith. It is always best to engage in such prayers without ascribing particular merits unless supported by authentic texts.\n\nIf you have a specific Hadith in mind or would like to know about a particular narration, please provide more details, and I can assist you further.

He also mentioned it in Da’eef al-Targheeb (755) and said, it is munkar (a kind of weak hadeeth). \nAl-Albani said in his book Hujjat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (p.185) that it is an innovation (bid’ah) to visit Madeenah and tell the visitors to Madeenah to stay there for a week so that they will be able to offer forty prayers in the Prophet’s Mosque so that they will be free from hypocrisy and saved from the Fire. \nAl-Shaykh Ibn Baz said: \nWith regard to the widespread idea that the visitor should stay for eight days so that he can offer forty prayers in the Mosque is wrong. Although it says in some hadeeths, “Whoever offers forty prayers therein Allah will decree that he is safe from the Fire and free from hypocrisy,” this hadeeth is da’eef according to the scholars and cannot be taken as proof or relied upon. There is no set limit for visiting the Prophet’s Mosque. If a person visits for an hour or two, or a day or two, or for more than that, there is nothing wrong with that. \nFatawa Ibn Baz, 17/406 \nInstead of this hadeeth we should look at the hasan (sound) hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmithi (241) concerning the virtue of always being present for the opening takbeer (saying Allahu Akbar) of prayer in congregation. It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever prays for forty days with the congregation, always being present for the first takbeer, it will be written that he will be safe from two things: he will be safe from the Fire and safe from hypocrisy.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmithi, 200. \nThe virtue mentioned in this hadeeth is general and applies to any mosque where prayers are offered in congregation, in any land; it does not apply only to al-Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah] or al-Masjid al-Nabawi [in Madeenah] in particular. \nBased on this, whoever consistently prays forty days in congregation in which he is present for the first takbeer, it will be recorded that he will be safe from two things: safe from the Fire and safe from hypocrisy, whether the mosque is in Madeenah, Makkah or anywhere else. \nAnd Allah knows best.",

He said:  \nAl-San’ani said: (it is) mawdoo’ (fabricated). \nAl-Albani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (282): (it is) mawdoo’. \nAnother example is the hadeeth narrated by al-Hakim according to which Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \n“Allah revealed to ‘Eesa (Jesus, peace be upon him): ‘O ‘Eesa, believe in Muhammad, and tell whoever you meet of your ummah (followers) to believe in him. For were it not for Muhammad, I would not have created Adam, and were it not for Muhammad, I would not have created Paradise and Hell. I created the Throne over the water and it would not settle until I wrote on it, La ilaha ill-Allah Muhammad Rasool Allah (There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah).” \nAl-Hakim said: its isnad (chain of narration) is saheeh! But al-Thahabi commented on this and said: I believe it is fabricated and falsely attributed to Sa’eed. \nMeaning, Sa’eed ibn Abu ‘Aroobah (one of the narrators of this hadeeth). This hadeeth was narrated from him by ‘Amr ibn Aws al-Ansari, who is the one who is accused of fabricating it. Al-Thahabi mentioned him in al-Meezan where he said: “He produced a munkar (rejected) report,” then he quoted this hadeeth, and said, “I believe that it is mawdoo’ (fabricated).” Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar agreed with him, as it says in al-Lisan. \nAl-Albani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (280): There is no basis for it. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \nIs the hadeeth which some people quote – “Were it not for you, Allah would not have created the Throne or the Kursiy (lit.

What is the meaning of the hadeeth, “Were it not for you the universe would not have been created,” and does this hadeeth have any basis? \nThey replied: \nThe heavens and the earth were not created for the sake of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather they were created for the purpose which Allah mentions (interpretation of the meaning): \n“It is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge.” [65:12] \nAs for the hadeeth mentioned, it is falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and has no sound basis. \nFatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 1/312 \nShaykh Ibn Baz was asked about this hadeeth and he said: \nThe answer is that this was transmitted from the words of some of the common people who have no understanding. Some people say that the world was created for the sake of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and were it not for Muhammad the world would not have been created and mankind would not have been created. This is false and has no basis, and these are corrupt words. Allah created the world so that He would be known and worshipped. He created the world and He created mankind so that His names and attributes, His power and knowledge, would be known and so that He alone would be worshipped with no partner or associate, and so that He would be obeyed – not for the sake of Muhammad or for the sake of Nooh or Moosa or ‘Eesa or any other Prophet (peace be upon them all).

This saying is often interpreted in a theological context to emphasize the special status of the Prophet Muhammad in Islam. \n\nHowever, it's important to clarify that this saying is not found in the most authentic collections of Hadith (sayings of the Prophet). Its exact wording and context may vary, and interpretations can differ among scholars.\n\nIn Islamic belief, Allah (God) is the sole creator of the universe, and while the prophets are significant figures in conveying Allah's message, they are not the reason for creation in an essential sense.

        "question": "A Fabricated Hadeeth",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    The stories which this preacher told are all false and are \n    lies against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that \n    have no basis. He did not mourn after the death of Khadeejah (may Allah be \n    pleased with her), or slaughter a camel, or invite the people to mourn, as \n    some people do nowadays. He used to make a lot of du’a (supplication) for \n    Khadeejah (may Allah be pleased with her), and sometimes he would slaughter \n    a sheep and distribute the meat among her friends as a gift and act of \n    kindness, and he would pray for her and be kind to her by means of this \n    du’a.\n\n    Similarly, what he said about the tree is also false and has \n    no basis, and what he said about the Jew is all lies, like the lies made up \n    by the evil fabricators. The same applies to what he narrated about ‘Uthman \n    (may Allah be pleased with him) and that man. Moreover Qatadah was not a \n    Sahabi (Companion of the Prophet), rather he was a Tabi’i (Successor). \n\n    The point is that these four reports are all false and are \n    not sound at all, But it was narrated in other, saheeh hadeeths (authentic \n    narrations) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) \n    called some trees and they came to him– and that was one of the signs of \n    Prophethood. This story was proven in Saheeh Muslim, where it says that on \n    one of his journeys he wanted to relieve himself, so he called two trees and \n    they came together, and he sat between them to relieve himself, then each \n    tree went back to its place. This was a sign from Allah that was evidence of \n    His almighty power, and that he says to a thing “Be!” and it is. This was \n    also a sign of the truth of the Messenger of Allah and that he was indeed \n    the Messenger of Allah. This is something other than the story that this \n    liar told. We must beware of these liars, and the preacher must fear Allah \n    when he preaches to people; he should remind them of things that will \n    benefit them in their spiritual and worldly affairs of verses of the Quran \n    and saheeh hadeeths from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him). That is sufficient. It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that the \n    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever \n    narrates a hadeeth from me knowing that it is false, he is one of the \n    liars.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). And he (peace and blessings of \n    Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever narrated from me something that I did not \n    say, let him take his place in Hell.” (Saheeh, agreed upon). And there are \n    many similar hadeeths.",
        "predicted_answer": "A fabricated hadith (Arabic: حديث موضوع) refers to a saying or action attributed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that is falsely ascribed to him. Such hadiths are not authentic and have no reliable chain of narration or are contradicted by established facts. Scholars of hadith have developed stringent criteria to evaluate the authenticity of narrations, including examining the integrity and reliability of the narrators, the continuity of the chain (isnad), and the text (matn) itself.\n\nFabricated hadiths can arise from various reasons, including:\n\n1. **Political Motivations**: Individuals may fabricate hadiths to support their political agendas or justify certain actions.\n2. **Religious Extremism**: Some may create or spread false teachings to promote specific sects or ideologies.\n3. **Cultural Practices**: Certain sayings may have originated from cultural practices and are later attributed to the Prophet.\n\nTo avoid reliance on fabricated hadiths, it is essential for Muslims to study and follow the authentic sources of hadith, recognized by scholars as sahih (authentic) or hasan (good). Well-known collections such as Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim are considered among the most authentic sources.\n\nIf a hadith's authenticity is in doubt, one can consult Islamic scholars or refer to hadith databases that categorize and authenticate these narrations."

        "question": "Saying Allahumma ajirni min an-nar 7 Times",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Hadith about saying “Allahumma ajirni mi nan-nar” \nThis hadith (prophetic narration) was narrated by al-Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad, 17362, and by Abu Dawud, 5079. The hadith is as follows: \nProphet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you pray Fajr, then say before speaking to any of the people, ‘Allahumma ajirni min an-nar (O Allah, protect me from the Fire)’ seven times. Then if you die on that day, Allah will grant you protection from the Fire. And when you pray Maghrib, then say before speaking to any of the people, ‘Allahumma inni as-aluka al-jannah, Allahumma ajirni min an-nar (O Allah, I ask You for Paradise, O Allah, protect me from the Fire)’ seven times. Then if you die that night, Allah will grant you protection from the Fire.” \nAuthenticity of the hadith on saying “Allahumma ajirni min an-nar”\nTwo things may be noted about the hadith. \n1. It does not say that this du’a (supplication) is to be said after ‘Isha (night prayer), as mentioned in the question.\n2. The hadith is not sahih (authentic) in its narration from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). See al-Silsilah al-Da’ifah by al-Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him), 1624. \nBased on this, it is not mustahabb (desirable) to recite this du’a after Fajr and Maghrib prayers. \n3. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever asks Allah for Paradise three times, Paradise will say, ‘O Allah, admit him to Paradise.’ Whoever seeks protection from the Fire three times, Hell will say, ‘O Allah, protect him from the Fire.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2572; Ibn Majah, 4340. This is a sahih hadith; it was classed as sahih by al-Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih al-Jami’, 6275) \nBut there is nothing to state that this should be recited in conjunction with any particular prayer, or at any particular time. \nIt is mustahabb for the believer to ask Allah for Paradise a great deal, and to seek protection from Hell a great deal, without saying such words in conjunction with any particular prayer, or at any particular time.\nFor more, please see these answers: 217496 , 105396 , and 148174 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the phrase \"Allahumma ajirni min an-nar\" translates to \"O Allah, protect me from the Fire (of Hell).\" It is a supplication (dua) that expresses a believer's plea for protection from the punishment of Hellfire.\n\nReciting this supplication seven times is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran or Hadith as a prescribed practice. However, the act of making dua and repeating supplications multiple times is common in Islamic practice. It reflects sincerity and a deep desire for Allah's mercy and protection.\n\nIf you wish to recite this supplication seven times as a personal practice, you may do so as an expression of your faith. Always remember that your intention and sincerity are what counts in making dua. It is encouraged to make supplications frequently and in various manners, seeking Allah's mercy and forgiveness.\n\nAs always, it is advisable to consult with knowledgeable scholars or local religious authorities on specific practices for clarity and guidance."

        "predicted_answer": "The reliability of hadiths (plural of hadith) is a crucial aspect of Islamic scholarship, as hadiths comprise the recorded sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The authenticity of hadiths is assessed using a rigorous methodology, which includes several criteria:\n\n1. **Isnad (Chain of Transmission)**: This refers to the chain of narrators who transmitted the hadith. Scholars examine each narrator's reliability, memory, and character. A strong chain typically consists of trustworthy and precise narrators.\n\n2. **Matn (Content of the Hadith)**: The content of the hadith itself is analyzed for consistency with the Qur'an and established Islamic teachings. Hadiths that contradict established Islamic beliefs are typically considered weak or fabricated.\n\n3. **Classification of Hadiths**: Hadiths are categorized into several classifications based on their authenticity:\n   - **Sahih (Authentic)**: These hadiths have a reliable chain of narration and a sound text.\n   - **Hasan (Good)**: These are slightly less reliable than sahih but are still considered acceptable.\n   - **Da'if (Weak)**: These hadiths may have issues in the chain or content and are not reliable for establishing legal rulings or beliefs.\n   - **Mawdu' (Fabricated)**: These hadiths are knowingly invented and are considered completely unreliable.\n\n4. **Scholarly Consensus**: Prominent scholars of hadith, such as Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim, and others, devoted their lives to compiling and verifying hadith. Their collections generally include only those that meet strict authenticity criteria, with Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim being the most respected among Muslims.\n\n5. **Contextual Considerations**: The context in which a hadith was narrated can also affect its interpretation and application in Islamic law.\n\nOverall, while many hadiths are considered reliable and form a significant part of Islamic teachings, the critical evaluation of their authenticity is essential in understanding and applying them correctly. Scholars continuously engage in hadith studies to ensure the preservation of authentic teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)."

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  \n    \n\n    “Your companion \n    (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred. \n\n    Nor does he speak \n    of (his own) desire. \n\n    It is only a \n    Revelation revealed.” \n\n    [al-Najm 53:2-4] \n    \n\n    Allah sent His \n    Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to call \n    mankind to worship Allah alone, and to disbelieve in any (god) apart from \n    Him, and (He sent him) to bring the glad tidings of Paradise and warnings of \n    Hell:  \n\n    “O Prophet \n    (Muhammad)! Verily, We have sent you as witness, and a bearer of glad \n    tidings, and a warner, \n\n    And as one who \n    invites to Allah [Islamic Monotheism, i.e. to worship none but Allah \n    (Alone)] by His leave, and as a lamp spreading light (through your \n    instructions from the Quran and the Sunnah/the legal ways of the Prophet).\n    \n\n    [al-Ahzab 33:45-46 \n    – interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    The Messenger \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was anxious over this ummah; he \n    did not know of anything good but he told them of it, and he did not know of \n    anything evil but he warned them against it:  \n\n    “Verily, there has \n    come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him \n    that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He (Muhammad) is anxious \n    over you; for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful.”\n    \n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:128 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Every Prophet was \n    sent only to his own people, but Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace \n    and blessings of Allah be upon him) to all of mankind:  \n\n    “And We have sent \n    you (O Muhammad) not but as a mercy for the ‘Alameen (mankind, jinn and all \n    that exists).” \n\n    [al-Anbiya 21:101 \n    – interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Because the \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) conveyed the revelation \n    that was sent down to him from His Lord, it is obligatory to obey him. \n    Indeed, obedience to him is obedience to Allah:  \n\n    “He who obeys the \n    Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed Allah.” \n\n    [al-Nisa 4:80 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Obedience to Allah \n    and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the way to \n    salvation and victory, and to happiness in this world and in the Hereafter: \n    \n\n    “And whosoever \n    obeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed achieved a great achievement \n    (i.e. he will be saved from the Hellfire and will be admitted to Paradise).”\n    \n\n    [al-Ahzab 33:71 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Hence it is \n    obligatory for all people to obey Allah and His Messenger (peace and \n    blessings of Allah be upon him), because therein lies their success and \n    salvation:  \n\n    “And obey Allah \n    and the Messenger (Muhammad) that you may obtain mercy.” \n\n    [Al ‘Imran 3:132 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Whoever disobeys \n    Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only \n    harms himself, he does not harm Allah in the slightest:  \n\n    “And whosoever \n    disobeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He \n    will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a \n    disgraceful torment.” \n\n    [al-Nisa 4:14 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Once Allah and His \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have decided a matter, \n    no one has the right to choose concerning it or to object to it; rather it \n    is obligatory to obey and to believe in the truth:  \n\n    “It is not for a \n    believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter \n    that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys \n    Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error. \n    \n\n    [al-Ahzab 33:36 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    A person's faith \n    is not complete until he loves Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings \n    of Allah be upon him), and love implies obedience. Whoever wants Allah to \n    love him and forgive his sins must follow the Messenger (peace and blessings \n    of Allah be upon him):  \n\n    “Say (O Muhammad \n    to mankind): ‘If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept \n    Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you \n    and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’”\n    \n\n    [Al ‘Imran 3:31 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    Love of the \n    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not simply the \n    matter of words to be repeated, rather it is the matter of belief and \n    conduct, i.e., obedience to what he commands, belief in what he tells us, \n    avoidance of what he forbids, and avoidance of worshipping Allah in any way \n    except that which he prescribed.  \n\n    When Allah had \n    perfected this religion and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be \n    upon him) had conveyed the message of his Lord, Allah took him to be with \n    Him. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left this \n    ummah (his followers) with clear proof in which there is no ambiguity. No \n    one deviates from it but he is doomed:  \n\n    “This day, those \n    who disbelieved have given up all hope of your religion; so fear them not, \n    but fear Me. This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My \n    favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” \n    \n\n    [al-Maidah 5:3 – \n    interpretation of the meaning]  \n\n    By the grace of \n    Allah, the Sahabah/Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) preserved the \n    ahaadeeth (prophetic teachings) of the Messenger (peace and blessings of \n    Allah be upon them), then the righteous salaf (pious predecessors) who came \n    after them compiled them in books which are known as the Sihah \n    (Saheehs/authentic collections), Sunan and Musnads. The most sound of them \n    are Saheeh al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim, the four Sunans, the Musnad of al-Imam \n    Ahmad and the Muwatta of al-Imam Malik, etc.  \n\n    Allah has \n    perfected this religion. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him) did not know of anything good but he taught it to his ummah, and he did \n    not know of anything evil but he warned them against it. So whoever \n    introduces anything into the religion,  of bid’ah (innovation) or myths, \n    such as praying to the dead or circumambulating (tawaf) their tombs, or \n    praying to the jinn and awliya (“saints”), and other things that have not \n    been prescribed by Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be \n    upon him), all of this is to be rejected and not accepted, as the Prophet \n    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates \n    something in this matter of ours (Islam) that is not a part of it will have \n    it rejected.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1718) .",
        "predicted_answer": "Of course! A hadith is a record of the words, actions, or habits of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Hadith literature is a crucial source of guidance for Muslims, alongside the Quran. They provide context and elaboration on Islamic teachings, laws, and moral conduct.\n\nIf you have a specific question about a particular hadith or topic related to hadith, please feel free to ask!"

        "question": "Meaning of the Hadeeth, “Faith retreats to Madeenah”",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    In this \n    hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Faith \n    retreats to Madeenah like a snake returns to its hole.” The word “retreats \n    to” means to return and settle in Madeenah, just as a snake, when it goes \n    out from its hole, returns to it. Here the Prophet (peace and blessings of \n    Allah be upon him) was saying that this religion will retreat to Madeenah \n    after all other countries become corrupt, just as a snake comes out of its \n    hole and wanders about the land, then it goes back to its hole.  \n    \n\n    This \n    hadeeth also indicates that just as Islam spread from Madeenah, it will \n    return to it. Islam with its strength and authority spread from Madeenah, \n    although its roots stemmed from Makkah. Makkah was the place where the first \n    Revelation came down, but the Muslims did not have a state and power, and \n    engage in jihad (battle), until after they migrated to Madeenah. Hence Islam \n    with its power and authority, spread from Madeenah and will retreat to it at \n    the end of time.  \n\n    Some of \n    the scholars said: this hadeeth refers to something that has already \n    happened, i.e., the people came in delegations to Madeenah and went back \n    there again to learn about sharee’ah (Islamic law) and the teachings of \n    Islam from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon \n    him). But the first meaning is the apparent meaning of the hadeeth and is \n    more correct.",
        "predicted_answer": "The hadith you are referring to is often cited in discussions of faith (iman) and is narrated in different wordings across various collections. The general meaning is that just as faith may diminish or decline in the hearts of believers, it will return (or retreat) to the city of Madinah, which is regarded as a center of faith and spirituality in Islam. \n\nMadinah holds significant historical and spiritual importance, as it was the city of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the early Muslim community. The notion conveyed in this hadith is that Madinah is a place of refuge for true believers, where faith is preserved and strengthened. \n\nIn a broader sense, this hadith emphasizes the enduring nature of faith, suggesting that even in times of trials and challenges, the essence of ايمان (iman or faith) remains alive and can be revitalized especially in places or communities deeply connected to the teachings of Islam.\n\nIt also serves as a reminder for Muslims to strive to maintain and nurture their faith, seeking out environments and communities where they can better practice their religion and grow spiritually."
