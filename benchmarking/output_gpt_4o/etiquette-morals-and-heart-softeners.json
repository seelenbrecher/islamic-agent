        "question": "Should the supplication for hearing thunder be repeated if the thunder is continuous?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is no proven report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he used to say this dhikr when hearing thunder. Rather it was narrated with a sound isnad from ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) that if he heard thunder, he would stop speaking and say: “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi wa’l-mala’ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him.” Then he would say: This [thunder] is a stern warning to the people of the earth.\nNarrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (723) and Malik in al-Muwatta’ (3641). Its isnad was classed as sahih by an-Nawawi in al-Adhkar (235) and al-Albani in Sahih al-Adab al-Mufrad (556).\nIt was also narrated from others among the Sahabah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: We were with ‘Umar on a journey and suddenly there was thunder, lightning and hail. Ka‘b said to us: Whoever says three times when he hears thunder “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi wa’l-mala’ikatu min kheefatihi (Glory be to the One Whom the thunder glorifies and praises, and the angels [also glorify Him] out of fear and awe of Him” will be protected from that thunder. We said it and we were protected.\"(Al-Adhkar by an-Nawawi  p. 181).\nIbn ‘Allan said: al-Hafiz said: This isnad is hasan and mawquf [meaning that it stops at the Sahabi]. Even though it was narrated from Ka‘b, Ibn ‘Abbas and ‘Umar approved of it, which indicates that it has a basis.  \nEnd quote from al-Futuhat ar-Rabbaniyyah ‘ala al-Adhkar an-Nawawiyyah (4/286).\nHence it is recommended (mustahabb) to say this dhikr when hearing thunder.\nIt was narrated in a marfu‘ report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that when he heard the sound of thunder and lightning, he would say: “Allahumma la taqtulna bi ghadabika wa la tuhlikna bi ‘adhabika, wa ‘afina qabla dhalika (O Allah, do not kill us with Your wrath and do not destroy us with Your punishment and protect us before that).”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (3450), who said: This is a gharib hadith; we only know it through this isnad. It was classed as da‘if (weak) by an-Nawawi in al-Adhkar (p. 181) and by al-Albani in Da‘if at-Tirmidhi (3694).\nEven though this hadith is da‘if, as at-Tirmidhi himself said, when it comes to the hadiths that encourage virtuous deeds in general, and supplications (du‘a’s) in particular, the matter is flexible, and the scholars usually took a lenient approach towards their isnads.\nIn al-Mustadrak it was narrated that ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Mahdi said: If we narrated a report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speaks about what is halal and haram, or about rulings, we are strict in examining its isnad and its narrators. But if we narrate hadiths that speak of the virtue of various deeds, reward and punishment, permissible matters and supplications, we are lenient in examining their isnads.\nAl-Mustadrak ‘ala as-Sahihayn (1/666).\nAl-Qadi Abu Ya‘la (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from Imam Ahmad that he said: When we narrate [reports] from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speak of halal and haram, we are very stringent in examining the isnads. But when we narrate reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that speak of the virtue of various deeds and reports that do not affirm or abrogate a ruling, we are lenient in examining the isnads.\"(Tabaqat al-Hanabilah 1/425).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We have previously noted that the scholars are agreed that one may act on a da‘if hadith that speaks of righteous deeds, but not matters of halal and haram.\"(Al-Majmu‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab  3/248).\nAl-Hattab said: Even though this is da‘if, the scholars are agreed that it is permissible to act in accordance with a da‘if hadith that speaks of the virtue of a particular deed.\"(Mawahib al-Jalil  1/17).\nIbn Hajar al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is permissible to act in accordance with a da‘if hadith that speaks of the virtue of a deed, because if it turns out to be sahih, then the one who accepted it will have acted as is required, and if it does not turn out to be sahih, there will be no negative consequences for having acted upon it, such as making something haram halal and vice versa, and there will be no transgression against the rights of others.\"(Al-Fath al-Mubin bi Sharh al-Arba‘in  p. 109).\nThe claim that there is unanimous scholarly agreement on this issue is not accurate, as we have stated previously that the scholars differed in the conditions that they stipulated for acting in accordance with a da‘if hadith (question no. 44877 ).\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When it comes to hadiths in which there is some weakness, it is either due to a narrator whose memory was poor, or a narrator who has committed some mischief, or other, similar reasons for which it was said that his hadith is da‘if. A da‘if hadith may be quoted by scholars in the context of encouraging people to do righteous deeds that are established and well-known in Islamic teachings, such as the da‘if hadiths that speak of giving charity, because charity is something that is well-known in Islamic teachings, there are verses of the Quran which highlight the importance of charity, and there are sahih hadiths which speak about it. So if there are some da‘if hadiths which speak about the virtue of charity, the scholars quote them. The same applies if there are da‘if hadiths which speak about the virtue of supererogatory (nafil) prayers, or about the virtue of tasbih (saying Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah)) and tahlil (saying La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah)), and of dhikr. All these matters are established and well-known in Islamic teachings, so the scholars may be lenient regarding da‘if hadiths that speak of them, because the original deeds of which the da‘if hadiths speak are rooted in the Quran and Sunnah, and because acts of worship that are mentioned in da‘if hadiths are already well known from the Quran and Sunnah.\"(shaykh’s website).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the issue of repeating the dhikr mentioned in the question – “Subhan alladhi yusabbih ur-ra‘du bi hamdihi ...” –\nIt is clear from the action of Ka‘b and the approval of ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them all) that he used to say it three times.\nAnd it is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that it is recommended to repeat supplications three times. When he offered supplication, he would say it three times, and when he asked of Allah, he would ask three times.\nBased on that, if this dhikr is repeated three times, that is good.\nIf he repeats it every time he hears thunder, what appears to be the case is that there is nothing wrong with that, as it is proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would sometimes repeat a supplication more than three times. It was narrated that Jarir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) blessed the horses of (the tribe of) Ahmas and their men five times. Al-Bukhari (4099).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that he used to repeat supplications an odd number of times, and he sometimes repeated them more than three times. This is an exception to the general meaning of the words of Anas, “When he offered supplication, he would repeat it three times.” That is to be understood as referring to what he usually did, and when he said it more than three times, there must have been a reason which dictated that he should say it more than three times. This is clear in the case of the tribe of Ahmas, because of their efforts in standing up to disbelief and supporting Islam, especially with regard to their own people to whom they belonged.\"(Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar  8/73-74).\nSo if there is a reason for repeating it, such as if the reason for saying the dhikr is repeated, then there is nothing wrong with repeating it.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, it is recommended to make the supplication when hearing thunder. The specific supplication is: \"Allahumma la tu'akhidhna bima fa'al as-sufahaa'u minna\" (O Allah, do not punish us for the actions of the foolish among us). \n\nIf the thunder is continuous, it is not explicitly stated in the hadith whether the supplication should be repeated or not. However, it is generally encouraged to remember Allah frequently and make supplications whenever one has the opportunity. So, if one chooses to repeat the supplication as a way to engage in remembrance and invoke Allah's mercy during continuous thunder, it would be considered permissible and a good practice. \n\nUltimately, supplicating to Allah, whether repeatedly or not, is an act of devotion and one that is encouraged in different situations."

        "question": "Is it permissible to have the dua of entering toilet on the door of the bathroom",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to display Adhkar for the purpose of remembrance, but they should be placed in a suitable location, to preserve their dignity and prevent disrespect. For example, the Dhikr for entering the washroom should not be placed on the bathroom door, but rather on the side of the door from the outside, to the right or left of the person entering.\nSheikh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\n\"Is it correct to place verses or reminders Adhkar from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) on the walls in rooms for the purpose of remembering Allah the Almighty and for contemplation? Please guide us, may Allah reward you with good.\"\nHe replied: \"The correct view is that there is no harm; if it is for the purpose of remembrance, placing verses on the wall, or hadiths for remembrance, there is nothing wrong with that, if it is for the purpose of remembrance and benefit, like hadiths about greeting (salam), supplication (du`a), hadiths about forbidding what Allah has forbidden, or encouraging obedience to Allah, or verses; there is no harm in that in a gathering or in an office,\" End quote from the website of Shaykh Ibn Baz.\nAnd Sheikh Ibn `Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) says: \"As for - writing hadiths - in the house: there is nothing wrong with writing a hadith that has a benefit, like the expiation of the gathering: (Subhanaka Allahumma Rabbana wa bihamdika, ash-hadu an la ilaha illa ant, astaghfiruka wa atubu ilayk) this contains a reminder,\" Eng quote from \"Liqa' Al-Bab Al-Maftuh\" (197 / 13).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is generally encouraged to say the dua (supplication) for entering the toilet, which is: \"Bismillah, Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min al-khubthi wal-khaba'ith\" (In the name of Allah, O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the evil and the evil ones). \n\nAs for writing this dua on the door of the bathroom, opinions may vary among scholars. Some scholars may consider it permissible as a reminder to recite the dua before entering, while others may feel it is disrespectful to place religious texts in places deemed impure, such as bathrooms.\n\nTo ensure adherence to etiquette and respect for religious texts, it is often advised to recite the dua from memory rather than writing it on the door. Consulting a knowledgeable scholar or a local imam for guidance specific to your community or context can provide clarity and a better understanding of the situational appropriateness."

        "question": "Ruling on giving gifts or charity to the servant",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with giving a gift to the servant, of giving her charity if she needs it.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to give charity to the servant from zakah, noting that we give her a regular salary too?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with a person giving his zakah to his servant, whether the servant is a man or a woman, if he or she has a family in his home country who are in need, and the salary that he receives is not sufficient for them. But if the salary is sufficient, meaning that it is sufficient for the family, then it is not permissible to give them zakah, because Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect [zakah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allah . And Allah is Knowing and Wise} [at-Tawbah 9:60]. And because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Mu‘adh ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen: “Teach them that Allah has enjoined upon them charity from their wealth, to be taken from their rich ones and given to their poor ones.” End quote.\nFatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb.\nIf this is permissible in the case of zakah on one’s wealth, then it is more appropriate that it should be permissible in the case of voluntary charity.\nBut we should point out that it is not permissible for the one who is giving zakah to benefit from giving it to his servant, such as if he gives it to her instead of increasing her salary or instead of giving her some bonus that he had promised her, or to ask her to do more than was agreed upon, and the like.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 67926 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, giving gifts and charity (sadaqah) is generally encouraged, as it promotes goodwill, strengthens community ties, and supports those in need. \n\n1. **Giving Gifts to Servants**: It is permissible to give gifts to servants or employees. This act can be a form of appreciation for their work, and it reflects kindness and generosity. It is also seen as a means of fostering good relationships and mutual respect between the employer and the servant.\n\n2. **Giving Charity (Sadaqah)**: If a servant is in need, it is commendable to give them charity. This is especially relevant if they are struggling financially or in distress. Charity is highly rewarded in Islam, and supporting those in need aligns with the Islamic principles of compassion and caring for others.\n\n3. **Considerations**: While giving gifts or charity, one should ensure that the act is done sincerely and for the sake of Allah. Additionally, it is important to consider the context and the cultural norms surrounding gift-giving to ensure that the gesture is appropriate and respectful.\n\nIn summary, giving gifts and charity to servants is not only permissible but can also be a virtuous act when done with the right intention."

        "question": "What is the ruling on likening someone to the Companions?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The status of the Companions\nIt is a well-established fact that the Companions enjoy a great and lofty status , for Allah praised them and described them as having good qualities and sublime characteristics, as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and those who followed them with good conduct - Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment} [at-Tawbah 9:100]\n{So those who emigrated or were evicted from their homes or were harmed in My cause or fought or were killed - I will surely remove from them their misdeeds, and I will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow as reward from Allah , and Allah has with Him the best reward} [Al ‘Imran 3:195]\n{For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from Allah and [His] approval and supporting Allah and His Messenger, [there is also a share]. Those are the truthful\nAnd [also for] those who were settled in al-Madinah and [adopted] the faith before them. They love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what the emigrants were given but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful} [al-Hashr 59:8-9]\n{Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that Allah may enrage by them the disbelievers. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward} [al-Fath 48:29].\nIbn Mas‘ud said: Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, looked into the hearts of His slaves and chose Muhammad, then He sent him with His message, for He chose him on the basis of His knowledge. Then He looked into the hearts of people after him, and chose for him his companions, who He made the supporters of His religion and the helpers of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nNarrated by at-Tayalisi in his Musnad (1/199) and by Ahmad in his Musnad (3600).\nFor more information, please see question no. 159184 .\nRuling on emulating the Companions\nEmulating the Companions is a great good deed and an immense blessing. Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whoever among you wants to take someone as an example, let him take the Companions of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as an example, for they were the purest in heart of this ummah, the deepest in knowledge, the most down to earth, the most guided and the best in attitude. They were people whom Allah, may He be exalted, chose to accompany His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so acknowledge their virtue and follow in their footsteps, for they followed right guidance.\"(Jami‘ Bayan al-‘Ilm  2/947).\nAl-Hasan said: The companions of Muhammad were the purest in heart of this ummah, the deepest in knowledge, and the most down to earth. They were people whom Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose to accompany His Prophet and establish His religion. So imitate their attitude and conduct, for – by the Lord of the Ka‘bah – they followed right guidance.\"(Ash-Shari‘ah by al-Ajurri  4/1685).\nLikening someone to the Companions\nThere is nothing wrong with likening someone to one of the Companions in any of his characteristics, actions of physical appearance. There does not seem to be any reason to disallow that, because he will resemble him in some ways and not others. So if you liken someone [to one of the Companions] by saying that he is courageous like Khalid, or knowledgeable like Mu‘adh, or strong like So-and-so among the Companions, or he has a beautiful voice like Abu Musa, that is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it.\nIn fact, if someone is likened to one who is greater and nobler, namely the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), there is nothing wrong with that, if what is meant is likening him to one of the characteristics, actions or manners of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that is not something that is a unique characteristic of Prophethood.\nMany of the Companions made comparisons of this nature.\nIt was narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: No one resembled the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) more than al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali. Narrated by al-Bukhari (3752).\nAnd he said regarding al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali: He was the one who most resembled the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Narrated by al-Bukhari (3748).\nIbn al-Jawzi said: Among the Tabi‘in there was a man called Kabis ibn Rabi‘ah as-Sami, who resembled [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)]. Mu‘awiyah sent for him, then he kissed him on the forehead and allocated some land to him. When Anas ibn Malik saw him, he would weep. End quote from Kashf al-Mushkil min Hadith as-Sahihayn (1/42).\nSimilarly, they might also liken people to him in terms of conduct and attitude.\nHudhayfah ibn al-Yaman said: The one who most closely resembled the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in dignity, physical appearance and conduct was Ibn Umm ‘Abd. Narrated by al-Bukhari (6079); he was ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him).\nIt was narrated that ‘A’ishah the Mother of the Believers said: I never saw anyone who more closely resembled the Messenger of Allah in bearing, dignity and conduct, and the way in which she stood and sat, than Fatimah the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (lettings and peace of Allah be upon him). Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3762), who said: This is a hasan sahih hadith. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nThe words translated above as dignity, bearing and conduct are close in meaning; they refer to outward appearance, conduct, being at ease with oneself, and so on. See: ‘Awn al-Ma‘bud (14/87).\nIt is as if she was referring to what could be seen of a person’s humbleness and humility towards Allah, and what he may possess of dignity, calm, a good attitude and gentle speech.\"(Mirqat al-Mafatih Sharh Mishkat al-Masabih  7/2969).\nSee also the answer to question no. 179497 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the status of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is very high, as they are believed to have lived alongside him and supported his mission. Generally, likening someone to the Companions is viewed with caution.\n\nThe ruling on this matter can vary depending on the context. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Reverence for the Companions**: The Companions are esteemed figures in Islam, and comparing someone to them should be done with great care. It is important to ensure that any comparison made is respectful and acknowledges the unique status of the Companions.\n\n2. **Context Matters**: If the comparison is made to highlight someone's good qualities or virtuous character, it should be done appropriately. However, it is essential to avoid exaggeration or making claims that could overstate someone's status or piety in relation to the Companions.\n\n3. **Caution Against Misinterpretation**: It is important to be cautious that such comparisons do not undermine the special status that the Companions hold in the eyes of Muslims. Any such comparison should not suggest equivalence in virtue, knowledge, or faith, as the Companions were directly chosen by the Prophet and lived in a unique historical context.\n\n4. **Avoiding Extremism**: Similarly, one should avoid using such comparisons in a way that leads to extreme opinions or sectarianism. Respect for the Companions should unite rather than divide the community.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is permissible to draw positive comparisons to the Companions with proper discretion and respect, one must exercise great care to ensure that these comparisons are made appropriately and do not lead to misunderstandings. It is always advisable to seek knowledge from qualified scholars in nuanced matters such as these."

        "question": "Supplication after reciting Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt was narrated by an-Nasaa’i in as-Sunan al-Kubra (11067) and in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah (308), and by at-Taaraani in ad-Du‘aa’ (1912) that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never sat in any gathering, or recited Quran, or offered any prayer, but he concluded that with certain words. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I see that you never sit in a gathering, or recite Quran, or offer any prayer, but you conclude it with these words. He said: “Yes. Whoever spoke good words, that will be like a seal on what he did of good and whoever spoke ill, it will be an expiation for him: “Subhaanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika, laa ilaaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk (Glory and praise be to you, O Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You).”\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (3164).\nIn this hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained that the dhikr of expiation for a gathering should be said at the end of any gathering in which a man sits, whether it was a gathering of dhikr or a gathering in which there was some ill or idle talk, for if it was a gathering of dhikr, it will be a seal on it for him.\nAs-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant is that it will be an affirmation of what he did of good, and will raise his deed to such a level that Allah will accept it, and it will like a guarantee that it will not be rejected, and if it was otherwise, then it will be an expiation for him. See: Mir‘aat al-Mafaateeh (8/204).\nBased on that, it is mustahabb for the Muslim to end any gathering with these words, no matter what kind of gathering it was. If it was a gathering to read Quran or to offer a prayer, or he sat with his friends, or with his family members, or to reconcile between people, or any other gathering, then he wants to leave, he should recite this dhikr just before he gets up to leave, then he should get up.\nSecondly:\nThere is no proven supplication specifically for completing the Quran, neither this supplication nor any other. From what has been explained above, it is clear that this dhikr and du‘aa’ is not specifically for completing the Quran or anything else; rather it is general and may be recited in any gathering.\nHowever, the scholars have stated that it is mustahabb to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. An-Nawawi said: It is strongly encouraged (mustahabb)  to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. At-Tibyaan fi Aadaab Hamlat al-Quran (159).\nIbn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (2/126): It is mustahabb to gather one’s family and others when completing the Quran to listen to the supplication.\nAhmad said: When Anas completed the Quran, he would gather his family and his children.\nThat was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood and others.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 65581 and 37683 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, making supplication (dua) after reciting the Quran is a common practice, as it is believed to bring you closer to Allah and to seek His mercy and guidance. However, there are no specific supplications mandated or universally prescribed that must be said after completing the recitation of the Quran. \n\nMany Muslims choose to make personal supplications, asking Allah for their needs, forgiveness, guidance, and blessings. It is also common to recite certain phrases or duas that are well-known and widely accepted in the tradition. \n\nOne commonly recited supplication is:\n\n**\"Allahumma inni as'aluka khayra ma fi shan-i-l-Quran wa a'udhu bika min sharri ma fi shan-i-l-Quran.\"**\n\nTranslation: \"O Allah, I ask You for the good that is in this Quran, and I seek refuge with You from the evil that is in this Quran.\"\n\nAdditionally, after completing the Quran, there are specific duas that some scholars recommend, including invoking peace and blessings upon the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nIt's also a time to reflect on what has been recited and to ask Allah for understanding and the ability to implement the teachings of the Quran in one’s life.\n\nIn summary, while there may not be specific obligatory supplications to recite after reading the Quran, making dua and reflecting on the recitation is encouraged and holds great merit."

        "question": "How can we reconcile between the idea of competing in doing good and loving good for others?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nPart of the practice of the Muslim that Allah, may He be exalted, and His Messenger taught him is the importance of brotherhood among the believers, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): “The believers are but brothers” [al-Hujuraat 49:10].\nThere is no contradiction between the verse (interpretation of the meaning) “So for this let the competitors compete” [al-Mutaffifeen 83:26] and what is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that he said: “No one of you truly believes until he loves for his brother – or for his neighbour – what he loves for himself.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (13) and Muslim (45).\nThe scholars have several views with regard to dispelling this apparent contradiction:\n1- That the hadith has to do with matters of this world and the verse has to do with matters of the hereafter. See: Saheeh Muslim bi Sharh al-Abi wa’s-Sanoosi (1/244).\n2- It was said that what is meant by that is loving good in general terms, but not in a specific or detailed way such as a person may seek for himself. Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If it is said: How can this be imagined when everyone wants to be ahead of others with regard to what he chooses for himself, and he loves to surpass others in virtues, and ‘Umar competed with Abu Bakr? The answer is: that what is meant is to wish for good for them in general terms and wish that evil be warded off from them in general terms. The individual should love that for his brother as he loves it for himself. As for excelling in some specific virtue and attaining a high level of some specific characteristic, there is nothing wrong with the individual wanting to surpass others in that regard.\nEnd quote from Kashf al-Mushkil min Hadith as-Saheehayn (3/222). See also: al-Qabas Sharh al-Muwatta’ by Ibn al-‘Arabi (929) and al-Masaalik Sharh al-Muwatta’ (6/406-417).\n3- This is a command to compete in doing more acts of worship, which will prompt others to join him and compete in doing good and righteous deeds. However, the hadith is general in meaning and includes matters of both this world and the hereafter. Hence the believer does not dislike others to join him in that; rather he loves for all people to join him in that competition and urges them to do so. This is a sign that he is very sincere towards people of faith.\nIbn Rajab said in Jaami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam (1/327-335):\nThe point is that this is one of the characteristics of faith that one is obliged to have: the individual should love for his believing brother what he loves for himself, and hate for him what he hates for himself. If he fails to attain that, then his faith is undermined.\nAll of this can only be achieved if one’s heart is sound and free of rancour, insincerity and envy, for envy makes the envier hate to see anyone excel him in any good characteristic, or even equal him in it, because he wants to stand out among the people in his virtues, and be distinct from them. But faith requires the opposite of that, which is that all believers should share in what Allah has granted him of good, without that detracting from what he has.\nIn general, the believer should love for the believers what he loves for himself, and hate for them what he hates for himself. If he sees any shortcoming in his brother in terms of religious commitment, he should strive to advise him.\nNevertheless, the believer should feel sad if he misses out on any religious virtue. Therefore he is instructed, with regard to issues of religious commitment, to look at those who are above him and to strive to compete in increasing in that as much as he can, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):  “So for this let the competitors compete” [al-Mutaffifeen 83:26]. He should not resent it if anyone shares his virtues with him; rather he should like all people to compete in that, and should urge them to do so. This is a sign that he has attained perfect sincerity towards his brothers.\nAl-Fudayl said: If you love for people to be like you, then you are not being sincere towards your brother. So how about if you want them to be inferior to you in that regard?\nThis indicates that being sincere towards all believers means that you like them to be better than you. This is a high level and lofty degree of sincerity, but that is not obligatory. Rather what is enjoined in Islamic teachings is that you should love for them to be like you, yet if someone surpasses you in some religious virtue, you should strive to catch up with him and feel sad for falling short or falling behind those who have surpassed you – not out of envy for what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has given them by His grace , but because you are competing with them, and because you wish to attain what they have attained, without any ill-feeling towards them, and because you feel sad because of your falling behind and failing to attain the same level as those who have surpassed you.\nThe believer should always think of himself as falling short and not attaining high ranks. He will benefit from that in two important ways: striving to attain those virtues and increase in that, and regarding himself with dissatisfaction. That will result in him loving for the believers to be better than him, because he does not want them to be just like him. He will also be discontent with himself as he is, and will strive to better himself. Muhammad ibn Waasi‘ said to his son: As for your father, may Allah not increase his ilk among the Muslims.\nIf someone is not content with himself as he is, how can he wish for the Muslims to be like him, if he is sincere towards them? Rather he should love for the Muslims to be better than him, and he should love for himself to be better than he is.\nEnd quote.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concepts of competing in doing good (التسابق في الخيرات) and loving good for others (حب الخير للآخرين) can indeed be harmoniously reconciled. Here are several points to consider:\n\n1. **Intention (Niyyah)**: Both competing in good deeds and loving for others what we love for ourselves revolve around the intention behind our actions. When we strive to do good, it should stem from a sincere intention to please Allah (SWT) and benefit others. This intention can drive us to compete in righteousness while still fostering a love for the wellbeing of others.\n\n2. **Encouragement of Mutual Growth**: Competing in goodness does not mean diminishing others; rather, it should encourage a community of mutual growth. When one person excels in a good deed, it can serve as an inspiration for others to also engage in good, thereby enhancing a collective atmosphere of positivity and virtue. In this way, the competition can lead to a greater love for good, as community members uplift one another.\n\n3. **Prophetic Example**: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) embodied both principles. He encouraged his followers to do good and to strive for excellence in their faith while simultaneously preaching the importance of compassion and care for others. His life is an example of how one can excel in righteous deeds while maintaining a heart that wishes goodness for all.\n\n4. **Recognition of Shared Goals**: Competing in doing good can reflect a shared goal of seeking Allah’s pleasure and serving humanity. When we strive to do good, we elevate our actions and create a ripple effect of positive influence. Additionally, loving for others what we love for ourselves naturally leads to the encouragement of each other in good deeds.\n\n5. **Balanced Approach**: It is important to maintain a balance: while we should strive to compete in goodness, we must also ensure that our competition does not lead to envy or negativity. Loving for others what we love for ourselves promotes a healthy attitude where competition is friendly and constructive, aiming for the betterment of all rather than a desire to surpass others at their expense.\n\nIn summary, both concepts can coexist beautifully; by nurturing good intentions, encouraging mutual growth, following the Prophetic example, recognizing shared goals, and maintaining a balanced approach, we can strive toward competing in good deeds while sincerely loving goodness for others."

        "question": "How can he make seeking Allah’s pleasure – and not seeking people’s pleasure – his main concern?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The greatest goal a believer can pursue is seeking the pleasure of the Lord of the Worlds.\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence; but approval from Allah is greater. It is that which is the great attainment” [at-Tawbah 9:72].\nIt was narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (6549) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (2829) that Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to the people of Paradise: ‘O people of Paradise!’ They will say: ‘Here we are at Your service, our Lord.’ He will say: ‘Are you pleased?’ They will say: ‘How could we not be pleased, O Lord, when You have given us that which You have not given to anyone else among Your creation?’ He will say: ‘Shall I not give you something even better than that?’ They will say: ‘O Lord, what can be better than that?’ He will say: ‘I bestow My pleasure upon you and I will never be angry with you after that.’”\nThe main goal of the believer’s life is that he seeks the pleasure of Allah alone, with no partner or associate, even if that displeases people. The sign of the hypocrites is that they are keen to please people, even if that angers the Lord of the Worlds.\nAllah says regarding the hypocrites (interpretation of the meaning): “They swear by Allah to you [Muslims] to satisfy you. But Allah and His Messenger are more worthy for them to satisfy, if they should be believers” [at-Tawbah 9:62].\nThings that will help a person to seek the pleasure of Allah alone include the following:\nFirstly: Learning about his Lord, so that he will be certain that all things are in His hand, and He alone is the One Who controls all things; He alone is the One Who brings low and raises high; He alone is the One Who grants honour and humiliates; no one can withhold what He gives and no one can give what He withholds; all people have no power to benefit or harm him or themselves, or to cause death, give life or anything else.\nOnce a person believes in that with certainty, his heart will be attached to his Lord, because he believes that people cannot benefit him except by his Lord’s leave, and they cannot harm him except by his Lord’s leave alone.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Know that if the nation were to come together to benefit you with something, they would not benefit you except with something that Allah has already decreed for you, and if they were to come together to harm you with something, they would not harm you except with something that Allah has already decreed for you.”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi in his Sunan (2516); classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (5/497).\nSecondly: being certain that people’s loving him and being pleased with him only happens with the permission of his Lord, so if he pleases his Lord, He will instill love for him in the hearts of His believing slaves.\nAt-Tirmidhi narrated in his Sunan (3267) that al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah, if I praise someone then he is praiseworthy, and if I criticize someone then he is blameworthy. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “That is only for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.”\nThis hadith was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi (2605).\nAllah alone is the One Who, if He praises someone, then he is praiseworthy, and if He is angry with someone and criticizes him, then he is blameworthy. As for people, they have no power in that regard except by Allah’s leave.\nIn the hadith it says that it is Allah Who instills love or hate of someone in people’s hearts.\nIt was narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (3209) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (2637) that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah loves a person, He calls Jibreel and says: ‘I love So and so, so love him.’ So Jibreel loves him, then he calls out to the people of heaven, ‘Allah loves So and so, so love him.’ So the people of heaven love him and he finds acceptance on earth. If Allah hates  someone, He calls Jibreel and says: ‘I hate So and so, so hate him.’ So Jibreel hates him, then he calls out to the people of heaven: ‘Allah hates So and so, so hate him.’ So they hate him and he is hated on earth.”\nThirdly: being certain that focusing on pleasing people and not the Lord of the Worlds is a sign of failure, and the one who does that will end up blameworthy, with no one to praise him; Allah will abandon him and he will have no one to support him. But if he seeks to please Allah alone, Allah will suffice him and he will have no need of people.\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Do not make [as equal] with Allah another deity and [thereby] become censured and forsaken” [al-Isra’ 17:22].\nIbn Hibbaan narrated in his Saheeh (277) from ‘Aa’ishah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever pleases Allah by angering the people, Allah will suffice him, but whoever angers Allah by pleasing the people, Allah will leave him to the people.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (2311).\nLook at Ka‘b ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) and how his focus was on speaking the truth and pleasing Allah alone, because he believed that Allah would suffice him if he spoke the truth, and that if his main concern was to avoid angering the people by telling lies, then Allah would soon cause people to be angry with him.\nKa‘b (may Allah be pleased with him) said, in the story of his repentance, that he said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): Indeed, by Allah, if I sat before anyone in this world other than you, I would have saved myself from his anger with an excuse, for I have been given the ability to argue persuasively, but by Allah, I know that if I were to tell you a lie today that you accepted, soon Allah would make you angry with me, but if I tell you the truth today that may make you upset with me, then I hope that Allah will pardon me. No, by Allah, I had no excuse. By Allah, I was never stronger or more well off than when I stayed behind and did not accompany you [on the campaign to Tabook]. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “As for this one, he has spoken the truth. Get up and leave until Allah decides concerning you.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (4418) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (2769).\nFourthly: knowing that there is no way to please people, for man is basically unfair and ignorant, and pleasing people is a target that cannot be achieved, for people are not even pleased with their Lord, so how can you think that they will be pleased with you?!\nAl-Bayhaqi narrated in az-Zuhd al-Kabeer (180) with a saheeh isnaad from al-Hasan al-Basri that it was said to him: People come to your gathering to pick on any error you may make, so that they can make it a reason to gossip about you. He said: Do not worry about it, for I thought of the pleasure of being close to Allah and I hope for that; I thought of Paradise and I hope for that; I thought of al-hoor al-‘een and I hope for that; I thought of being safe from people, and I found no way to achieve that. When I saw that people are not pleased with their Creator, I realized that they will never be pleased with a created being like themselves.\nAsh-Shaafi‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said to Yoonus ibn ‘Abd al-A‘la: O Abu Moosa, if you were to strive your utmost to please all the people, there is no way to do that. As that is the case, then make your deeds and your intention sincerely for Allah (may He be glorified and exalted) alone.\nNarrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan (6518).\nSo let each person’s main concern be to seek the pleasure of his Lord alone, for if He is pleased, that is sufficient for you.\nLet your slogan in life and your main concern before the Lord of the worlds be as the poet said:\nI hope that my relationship with You is sweeter and life is bitter; I hope that You are pleased and that people are angry.\nI hope that what is between You and me is in order, and that what is between me and people is in ruins.\nIf You love me then everything else is insignificant, and everyone on earth is as dust.\nWith regard to books, we do not know of any book that has been written specifically about this topic, but we advise the questioner and all Muslims to learn more about Allah, for the more a person comes to know about his Lord, the more his concern will be on seeking the pleasure of his Lord alone, and he will not worry about the displeasure of people.\nOne excellent book on this topic is an-Nahj al-Asma fi Sharh Asma’ Allah al-Husna, by Dr. Muhammad al-Humood an-Najdi.\nWe also advise you to read widely in the books of Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali and Ibn al-Qayyim, for their words on this topic are among the most beneficial.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "To prioritize seeking Allah’s pleasure over that of people, one can follow several key principles:\n\n1. **Intention (Niyyah)**: Ensure that all actions are performed with the sincere intention of seeking Allah’s pleasure. Regularly renew your intentions by reminding yourself why you are doing what you do—whether it’s worship, acts of kindness, or daily activities.\n\n2. **Knowledge**: Seek knowledge about Allah’s commands and the teachings of Islam. This understanding will help you distinguish between what pleases Allah and what pleases people. Reading the Quran and Hadith, as well as studying Islamic scholarship, will provide guidance.\n\n3. **Authenticity**: Be true to yourself and your beliefs. Emphasize sincerity in your actions. Avoid being swayed by societal pressures or the opinions of others. \n\n4. **Community**: Surround yourself with righteous companions and a supportive community that shares your values. They can encourage you to prioritize Allah’s pleasure and remind you of the importance of your faith.\n\n5. **Focus on Accountability**: Remember that you will ultimately be accountable to Allah, not to people. Reflect on the Day of Judgment and the importance of divine approval over worldly approval.\n\n6. **Gratitude and Humility**: Cultivate a sense of gratitude for Allah’s blessings and a humble approach to your actions. Recognizing that everything is from Allah can help shift the focus away from seeking validation from others.\n\n7. **Avoiding Hypocrisy**: Be wary of showing off or seeking attention for your good deeds. The concept of *riya* (showing off) is detrimental to sincere worship. Strive to do good for Allah alone, not for the praise of people.\n\n8. **Regular Reflection**: Engage in self-reflection and consider your motives. Assess whether your actions align with seeking Allah’s pleasure and make adjustments as necessary.\n\nBy incorporating these principles into daily life, one can gradually shift their focus towards seeking Allah’s pleasure, making it their primary concern in all actions and decisions."

        "question": "Between habit and worship",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nHabit is a neutral concept, so it is a good thing if a person gets used to doing good and to being steadfast when doing it, without finding it burdensome. It was narrated in the hadith: “Doing good is a habit [that one may acquire easily] and evil is stubbornness [and man persists in it only out of stubbornness].” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (221) and by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh (310).\nIt was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that she said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had a reed mat with which he used to make a booth at night and pray in it, and the people started to follow his prayer, and he used to spread (that mat) out during the day. One night they gathered and he said: “O people, you should only do deeds that you are able for, for Allah does not grow weary but you do. The most beloved of deeds to Allah is that which is done persistently, even if it is little.” And if the family of Muhammad started to do something, they would persist in it. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5861) and Muslim (782).\nAs Abu’t-Tayyib said: Each person will gain of his life that which becomes a habit for him.\nIt is well-known that one of the greatest means of a person becoming steadfast in his journey towards Allah is having acts of worship to which he commits himself, remains steadfast in doing them, and becomes accustomed to doing them, and he does not neglect them, become heedless concerning them or feel too lazy to do them. This was always the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); in other words, he would do them constantly and persistently. And if his family did something, they would persist in it.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to habit in the sense that a person does not have presence of mind when doing an act of worship, so he does it automatically, with no spirit or focus, that is something very dangerous, and he should be concerned about that.\nThe reward for worship is connected to presence of mind and humility whilst doing it, as Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Certainly will the believers have succeeded:\nThey who are during their prayer humbly submissive”\n[al-Mu’minoon 23:1-2].\nIt is very important that the heart should be focused when doing an act of worship, and not be distracted from it.\nShaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nI have read some advice in a book which says: do not make worship a habit. How can a Muslim make worship of Allah truly for Allah, and not a mere habit? May Allah reward you with good.\nHe replied:\nWhat is meant is: do not do the prayer as a habit; pray as an act of worship so that you may draw closer to Allah thereby, and not because it is a habit that you have got used to. If you pray Duha, then pray it for the purpose of drawing closer to Allah, not because it is a habit. By the same token, if you pray tahajjud at night, pray it because it is an act of worship and obedience, not because it is merely a habit or because your father or mother used to do it.\nThirdly:\nAmong the things that may help one to attain focus of mind when doing acts of worship are the following:\n1. Variation in acts of worship. The individual should do a variety of acts of worship, including prayer, reading Qur’an, dhikr, giving charity, honouring his parents, upholding ties of kinship, visiting the sick and attending funerals. By the mercy and grace of Allah, acts of worship are many and varied.\n2. Persistence in keeping the intention in mind when doing the acts of worship.\nIbn al-Qayyim said in ‘Umdat as-Saabireen (60-65):\n… Being persistent whilst doing the good deed, so the person should persist in warding off any shortcomings or negligence in the action. He should persist in keeping his intention in mind and continue to be focused when standing before his Lord, and not be absent-minded when carrying out His command. What matters is not only doing what is enjoined; rather what matters above all is not forgetting the One Who enjoined it when doing what He enjoined. Rather he should persist in remembering Him whilst carrying out His command.\nThis is the worship of the true and sincere slaves of Allah. It requires patience and perseverance in order to be able to do acts of worship in the proper manner, by performing the act with all of its essential, obligatory and Sunnah parts. It also requires persevering in remembering the One Whom he is worshipping when doing that act of worship, and not letting himself be distracted from that by his worship. So his presence of mind with Allah should not distract him from carrying out the physical actions of the act of worship properly, and focusing on doing the physical actions in the proper manner should not distract him from presence of mind when standing before Allah, may He be glorified. End quote.\n3. Striving hard in du‘aa’ (supplication).\nThis is one of the greatest means that help one to keep in mind the fact that Allah is with him and is helping His slave.\n4. Not giving up acts of worship.\nThat is one of the means by which the Shaytaan discourages a person from doing acts of worship, on the grounds that he is not able to focus. So let the believer be aware of that, and let him continue to do the acts of worship.\n5. Preparing oneself for a particular act of worship and getting ready for it, and keeping away from anything that may distract him from it.\nIt was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray when food has been served and do not pray when resisting the urge to relieved oneself.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (89).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, there is a clear distinction between habit and worship (ibadah). \n\n**Worship (Ibadah)** refers to acts that are performed with the intention of pleasing Allah and fulfilling His commands. These acts, which include prayers (Salah), fasting (Sawm), giving charity (Zakat), and pilgrimage (Hajj), are prescribed by Islamic teachings and have specific rules and guidelines. Worship is often characterized by the intention (niyyah) behind the action; it is an expression of devotion and submission to Allah.\n\n**Habit**, on the other hand, refers to routines or actions that are performed regularly but may not necessarily carry a conscious intention to please Allah. Habits can be good or bad, and they do not possess the specific religious significance that acts of worship do. For instance, eating breakfast is a habit that, while important for nourishment, does not hold the same spiritual weight unless it is done with the intention of health and gratitude towards Allah.\n\nIn summary, the main difference lies in the intention and the religious significance attributed to the action. Worship is an act of devotion intended to fulfill divine obligations and draw one closer to Allah, while a habit is a regular routine that may not carry the same spiritual intent or significance. Muslims are encouraged to infuse their daily habits with a sense of worship by performing them with the intention of pleasing Allah whenever possible."

        "question": "He is heedless about sins, on the grounds that the Sahaabah also committed sins",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Such talk stems from the deceit of the Shaytaan, by means of which he makes sins seem insignificant to people, so that they will get carried away in sin and not repent from it.\nThis notion is false on several counts:\n-1- The perfect example for the Muslim is the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often” [al-Ahzaab 33:21].\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis verse is an important principle, which is following the example of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his words, deeds and character. Hence Allah commanded the people to follow the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the day of al-Ahzaab, in terms of his patience, steadfastness, perseverance, striving in jihad and awaiting help and support from his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and may Allah send blessings and peace upon him constantly until the Day of Judgement.\nEnd quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer (6/391).\nBy the same token, we must adhere to what he brought of commands and prohibitions.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from. And fear Allah ; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty” [al-Hashr 59:7].\nWhoever goes against his prohibitions has failed to achieve the level of piety (taqwa) that is required of him, and he has exposed himself to the punishment of Allah, may He be exalted.\n-2- The Muslim is enjoined to follow the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) in their good deeds, and not otherwise.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and those who followed them with good conduct - Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment” [at-Tawbah 9:100].\nMuhammad ibn Ka‘b al-Qurazi said:\n“and those who followed them with good conduct” – this is an condition that is required of those who follow them, which is that they should follow them in their good deeds and not their bad deeds. End quote.\nSee: ad-Durr al-Manthoor (4/272) and Tafseer al-Baghawi (4/88).\nSo the Muslim should strive to follow the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) in their good deeds, so that he may be included among the people mentioned in the verse quoted above. As for any errors that they (may Allah be pleased with them) made, we are not enjoined to follow them in that.\nAmong the good deeds of theirs in which the Muslim should follow their example is the fact that if they made any mistakes, they would hasten to repent, and their repentance was so great and sincere that Allah erased their sins thereby. The hadiths that speak of that are very well known, such as the repentance of Maa‘iz and of the Ghaamidi woman (may Allah be pleased with them).\nSo the Muslim should strive to obey Allah, may He be exalted, and to keep away from disobeying Him. Then if he slips up, he must hasten to repent sincerely and not try to excuse himself by referring to the mistakes made by some of the Sahaabah, because they would repent and they would not persist in sin.\n-3- Even though some of the Sahaabah committed some major sins, that did not happen very often; in fact it was rare. In most cases, they (may Allah be pleased with them) adhered to the command of Allah and strove hard to attain His pleasure. So why would this person referred to in the question ignore what was usually the case with the actions of the Sahaabah, and try to use that which rarely happened as an excuse?\nMoreover, if he is sincere, then let him do what they did: they used to hasten to repent, and they did not persist in sin, as noted above.\nThen let him follow the example of the one who surrendered her life for the sake of Allah, and [admitted the sin of adultery] so that the hadd punishment would be carried out on her.\nThen let him follow their example with regard to worship, attitude, effort, striving, acts of charity, fasting and voluntary prayers at night.\nIn his attitude and actions, let this poor man strive to emulate the attitude and actions of the Sahaabah.\nThen let him see, in that case, whether the Shaytaan will try to entice him with such notions!\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is important to understand the context of sins and the behavior of the Sahaabah (companions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). While it is true that the Sahaabah were human and, like all humans, made mistakes and committed sins, they are also role models for Muslims due to their efforts in seeking forgiveness and striving for righteousness.\n\nBeing heedless about sins is not an acceptable attitude in Islam. The acts of the Sahaabah should not be viewed as a justification for committing sins without remorse. Instead, their lives exemplify the importance of seeking repentance (Tawbah) and striving to improve oneself. The Qur'an and Hadith emphasize the significance of being aware of one’s actions, repenting for sins, and continuously seeking Allah’s forgiveness.\n\nThe attitude should be one of humility and mindfulness, recognizing one's faults and striving to avoid sin while following the example of the Sahaabah in seeking forgiveness and purification. It is crucial to balance understanding humanity's weaknesses with the responsibility that comes with belief and striving in faith."

        "question": "Holding fast to Allah and His religion",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The ‘holding fast” that is mentioned in the Qur’an is of two types: holding fast to Allah, and holding fast to the rope of Allah.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:103]\n“and hold fast to Allah. He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper”\n[al-Hajj 22:78].\nImam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nI‘tisaam (holding fast) means adhering to that which will protect you and will ward off from you that which you dread and fear. ‘Ismah means protection and i‘tisaam means seeking protection. Hence fortresses are called ‘awaasim (sing. ‘aasimah) because they give protection and safety.\nWell-being and happiness in this world and the hereafter are based on holding fast to Allah and holding fast to His rope. There is no salvation except for the one who adheres to these two means of protection.\nWith regard to holding fast to His rope, it protects one from going astray.\nHolding fast to Him protects one from doom and destruction, for the one who is journeying towards Allah is like one who is travelling on a path towards his intended destination. Hence he needs guidance on the road and he needs to be safe whilst travelling; he cannot reach his intended destination except after attaining these two things.\nThe guide will protect him from losing his way, and will guide him to the right path; and equipment, physical strength and weapons will help him to be safe from bandits and any other troubles he may encounter on the road.\nSo holding fast to the rope of Allah will lead him on the path of guidance and help him to follow the guide.\nHolding fast to Allah will give him the strength, equipment, weapons and anything else that he will need [to protect himself] on his journey.\nHence the salaf [early generations] used a variety of phrases to explain what is meant by holding fast to the rope of Allah, even though these phrases all refer to the same idea.\nIbn ‘Abbaas said: Adhere to the religion of Allah.\nIbn Mas‘ood said: It is the jamaa‘ah (main body of the Muslims). And he said: You should adhere to the jamaa‘ah, for it is the rope of Allah that He has enjoined us to hold fast to. What you may find of things you dislike when you are with the jamaa‘ah is better than what you may find of things you like when you are scattered.\nMujaahid and ‘Ataa’ said: It means adhering to the covenant of Allah. Qataadah, as-Saddi and many of the scholars of tafseer said: It means adhering to the Qur’an.\nThen he said: As for holding fast to Him, it means putting one’s trust in Him, seeking strength with Him, seeking protection with Him, and asking Him to protect the individual, give him strength and ward off harm from him. For the result of holding fast to Him is that He will ward off harm from His slave, for Allah defends those who believe. So He will ward off from his believing slave, if he holds fast to Him, any cause that could lead to problems, and He will protect him from that. So He will protect him from doubts and desires, and from the schemes of his enemies both apparent and hidden, and from the evil of his own self. He will ward off from him the consequences of that which may lead to problems and troubles after the causes thereof are all present, commensurate with the strength with which he holds fast to Him, so that the causes of troubles and problems will be removed in his case, and thus Allah will protect him from what could result from that and the causes thereof. He may ward off from him something that He had decreed by means of another decree, and something that He willed by means of something else that He wills, thus protecting him from it.

        "predicted_answer": "Holding fast to Allah and His religion is a fundamental concept in Islam, often expressed through the Arabic term \"al-'uqda\" or \"al-tamassuk,\" which means to cling tightly or adhere firmly to the teachings, guidance, and commandments of Allah as outlined in the Qur'an and the Sunnah (practices of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him).\n\nThe Qur'an emphasizes the importance of holding fast to the faith in several verses, such as:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Imran (3:103)**: \"And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah, and do not become divided.\" This verse encourages unity among believers and adherence to the collective guidance of Islam.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:256)**: \"There is no compulsion in religion.

        "question": "How can he acquire social intelligence?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Improving one’s level of social intelligence requires intellectual effort and acquisition of knowledge, as well as practical, behavioural effort.\nWith regard to intellectual effort and acquiring knowledge, it is attained by learning the noble characteristics that have to do with dealing with people in general terms, and learning the ideal ways of dealing with transgression and hypocrisy, and bad characteristics in particular.\nWith regard to practical, behavioural effort, it is attained by persisting and steadfastly interacting with people on the basis of noble characteristics; developing self-restraint when dealing with transgressors, hypocrites and ill-mannered people; and repelling with that which is better and bearing with patience the evil of wrongdoers.\nThe best and noblest path that one may follow in terms of both knowledge and behaviour in this regard is the teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on how to deal with people of all types, ages, religions, races, classes and statuses.\nA useful book that we advise you to read in this regard is the book Kayfa ‘Aamaluhum by Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid, which clearly explains the teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) regarding how to interact with people of different types.\nhttps://www.almunajjid.com/9468\nSee also the answer to question no. 71184, which speaks concisely about the character of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAnd Allah is the source of help.",
        "predicted_answer": "Acquiring social intelligence is important in various aspects of life, including personal relationships and community interactions. In the context of Islamic teachings, here are some ways to develop social intelligence:\n\n1. **Understanding the Importance of Good Character**: Islam emphasizes the importance of good character (akhlaq). Engage in self-reflection to recognize your strengths and weaknesses in your interactions with others. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is a model of exemplary behavior, and studying his life can offer guidance.\n\n2. **Active Listening**: Pay attention to what others are saying. Practicing active listening helps in understanding different perspectives, which is a key aspect of social intelligence. In conversations, seek to understand before responding.\n\n3. **Empathy**: Cultivate empathy by putting yourself in the shoes of others. Islam encourages compassion and understanding towards others. Reflecting on the struggles and emotions of others can enhance your ability to connect with them.\n\n4. **Effective Communication**: Work on your communication skills by being clear and respectful in your speech. The Quran encourages kind and wise speech (Quran 2:83). Practice articulating your thoughts while being mindful of how others may perceive them.\n\n5. **Building Relationships**: Actively engage in your community. Attend mosque events, participate in community service, and develop friendships. Strong relationships foster social intelligence through shared experiences and diversity of thought.\n\n6. **Learning from Experiences**: Reflect on social interactions, whether successful or challenging. Analyze what went well and what didn’t, and learn from each experience. This reflective practice is essential for personal growth.\n\n7. **Studying Emotional Cues**: Pay attention to non-verbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions. Being observant of these signals can enhance your understanding of how others are feeling.\n\n8. **Seeking Knowledge**: Engage with Islamic teachings and scholarly works that address social behavior, ethics, and interactions. This will provide you with a solid foundation for understanding human relationships.\n\n9. **Praying for Guidance**: Seek Allah’s help through prayer (dua) to develop these qualities. Sincerity in seeking improvement can lead to personal transformation.\n\nBy integrating these practices, one can develop social intelligence that aligns with Islamic values, ultimately fostering a more harmonious existence within the community and enhancing personal relationships."

        "question": "How can we make ourselves feel when reading Qur’an that Allah is addressing us thereby?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Making yourself feel that Allah is addressing you in the Qur’an is attained by listening attentively to the Qur’an, reflecting properly upon it, and acting in accordance with it, as the Muslim believes that Allah is addressing His slaves in the Qur’an, issuing commands and prohibitions to them; sometimes He addresses a particular group in some contexts, and sometimes He addresses humanity as a whole.\nWhen He addresses the believers, then the Muslim should reflect on that and say: We hear and we obey. Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When you hear Allah saying “O you who believe”, then pay attention, for it is something good that He is enjoining or something bad that He is forbidding.\nTafseer Ibn Katheer (1/374).\nWhen Allah addresses humanity as a whole, then you should think that Allah is addressing you in particular, so if it is a command then do it, and if it is a prohibition then refrain from it, and if it is an exhortation then act upon it.\nThe individual should reflect upon what Allah says throughout the entire Qur’an, but that reflection varies according to the context of what is being recited of the text. If obedience is mentioned, then he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to obey. If disobedience is mentioned, then he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the prohibition on disobedience. If people of faith (believers) are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to take them as friends and allies and love them. If the people of disbelief and hypocrisy are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to hate them and regard them as enemies.\nIf the Shaytaan is mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to regard him as an enemy, go against him and not to follow him, and to strive to obey Allah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy –\nAnd that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path”\n[Yaa-Seen 36:60-61].\nIf truthfulness and those who speak the truth are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to strive to be one of them.\nIf allies and liars are mentioned, he should bear in mind that Allah is addressing him with the command to strive to not be one of them.\nImam Abu Bakr al-Aajurri (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n… Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, urges people to reflect upon the Qur’an, as He, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon [their] hearts?”\n[Muhammad 47:24].\nAnd Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it had been from [any] other than Allah , they would have found within it much contradiction”\n[an-Nisaa’ 4:82].\nMuhammad ibn al-Husayn [al-Aajurri] said: Do you not see, may Allah have mercy on you, how your most generous Lord urges His creation to reflect upon His words? Whoever reflects upon His words will come to know the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and will come to know the greatness of His might and power, and will come to know the greatness of His grace and bounty towards the believers, and will come to know his duty to worship Him, so he will commit himself to do what is obligatory, and will beware of whatever his most generous Lord has warned him against, and will be eager to do what He has urged him to do.\nWhoever has this attitude when reciting Qur’an, and when listening to someone else reciting it, the Qur’an will be healing for him, and he will become independent of means even if he does not have wealth; he will feel honoured and proud even if he does not have a large family around him; and he will feel at ease in situations where others feel worried. His main concern, when starting to read or recite a soorah, will be “when will recitation of Qur’an have an impact on me?”, not “when will I finish the soorah?” Rather his concern will be: when will I understand and pay heed to what Allah is saying to me? When will I rectify myself, when will I learn the lesson? Because recitation of Qur’an is an act of worship, and an act of worship cannot be done properly when there is heedlessness and a lack of attention. May Allah help and guide us all.\nEnd quote from Akhlaaq Hamalat al-Qur’an (3)\nThis is how the attitude of the one who recites Qur’an should be.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "To feel that Allah is addressing you personally while reading the Qur'an, you can adopt the following approaches:\n\n1. **Intention (Niyyah):** Before you begin reading, set a sincere intention that you are reading the Qur'an to seek guidance and to connect with Allah. Remind yourself that the Qur'an is a divine communication meant for all believers.\n\n2. **Reflection (Tadabbur):** Engage in deep reflection while reading. Consider the meanings of the verses and how they relate to your life. Allow the words to resonate with your personal experiences, circumstances, and feelings.\n\n3. **Use of Pronouns:** Pay attention to the pronouns used in the verses. For instance, when Allah addresses \"O you who believe,\" think of yourself as part of that call. This can create a sense of personal connection.\n\n4. **Contextual Understanding:** Learn the historical and situational context of the verses. Understanding the circumstances in which certain verses were revealed can help you relate them to your own life.\n\n5. **Consistency in Reading:** Regular and consistent recitation helps build familiarity and a deeper emotional connection with the text. Set aside a specific time for reading each day to cultivate a routine.\n\n6. **Seeking Knowledge:** Increase your understanding of the Qur'an through studying Tafsir (interpretation). Knowing the deeper meanings and teachings can enhance your awareness that these words are for you.\n\n7. **Supplication (Dua):** Make a supplication to Allah, asking Him to open your heart and mind to receive His message through the Qur'an. Ask for the ability to understand and feel His presence while you read.\n\n8. **Silence and Calmness:** Find a quiet place free from distractions to read. A peaceful environment allows you to focus and feel the significance of the words.\n\n9. **Emotional Connection:** Allow yourself to feel the emotional weight of the verses, especially those discussing mercy, repentance, and guidance. This emotional engagement can enhance your sense of personal address.\n\nBy incorporating these practices into your reading, you can cultivate a deeper connection with the Qur'an and feel that Allah is addressing you directly."

        "question": "Ruling on recording university lectures without the permission of the lecturer",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim who pays attention to matters of trust and hates betrayal to record the words of a speaker without his permission or without his knowledge, no matter what the type of speech, whether it is religious or worldly, such as fatwas, scientific discussions, financial matters, and so on.\nIt is proven in the hadith of Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillah al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If one man speaks to another and looks around (to make sure no one is listening), then that is a trust (amaanah).” Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood and at-Tirmidhi.\nWhat is meant by his looking around is that it is clear from the actions of the speaker that he is being cautious, by looking around, right and left, to make sure that no one can hear what he is saying. Thus what your companion says to you is a trust for the listener, that he has entrusted him with. If he tells someone else about it, then he has gone against the command of Allah, as he has disclosed the trust to people who are not entitled to receive it, and thus he becomes a wrongdoer. What he should do is conceal it, because when the person who told it to him looked around, that was like a gesture telling him not to tell anyone else. They said: This is a very concise expression, yet full of meaning, because the word translated here as looked around is very concise, and is encouraging us to observe good etiquette when mixing with people, to treat people well, to conceal secrets and maintain friendships, and it is a warning against spreading malicious gossip that could lead to resentment, as is quite clear.\nAr-Raaghib said: Confidential talk is that which is meant to be kept private, which may be understood directly, such as if you say to someone else: Keep what I tell you to yourself; or it may be indirect or circumstantial, such as if the speaker takes the opportunity of being alone with you, or he lowers his voice, or tries to conceal it from others in the gathering. This is what is meant in this hadith. End quote.\nIf you record his words without his permission or his knowledge, then this is a kind of treachery and a breach of trust.\nIf you then spread these words to other people, this exacerbates the treachery and violation of the trust.\nConclusion: Recording someone’s words – on a phone or otherwise – without the knowledge or permission of the speaker is evildoing and a betrayal, and undermines one’s good character and dignity.\nEnd quote from Adab al-Haatif by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (may Allah have mercy on him), p. 28\nI put this question to our shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Barraak (may Allah preserve him), and he replied:\nThey have no right to record without his consent or knowledge.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the ruling on recording university lectures without the permission of the lecturer can be approached from several perspectives, primarily considering issues of trust, privacy, and consent.\n\n1. **Trust and Consent**: According to Islamic principles, it is important to uphold trust (amanah) in all interactions. Recording a lecture without the permission of the lecturer may violate the trust that exists between the teacher and the students. It is generally considered courteous and respectful to seek permission before recording.\n\n2. **Privacy**: If the lecturer has not given permission, recording them without consent can infringe on their privacy rights. Islam emphasizes the importance of respecting others' privacy and personal rights.\n\n3. **Educational Benefit**: If the intention behind recording is solely for personal educational benefit, one should consider whether the potential benefits outweigh any ethical concerns. However, even in such cases, obtaining permission is advisable and often necessary.\n\n4. **Institutional Policies**: It's also important to consider the regulations set by the educational institution regarding recording lectures. Many institutions have specific rules that must be adhered to, which may require obtaining consent from the lecturer.\n\nIn conclusion, it is recommended to seek permission from the lecturer before recording any lectures to ensure that the action aligns with Islamic ethical standards and respects the rights of all parties involved."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    In such cases, if a person dies \n    in such circumstances, it has nothing to do with being praiseworthy or \n    blameworthy in and of itself, and there is no Islamic ruling connected to \n    that. Islamic rulings only have to do with the deeds of those who are \n    accountable. If a person dies in a particular place, or at a particular \n    time, or in a particular posture, that is not part of his deeds and it is \n    not within his control, so there is no ruling that is connected to it. \n\n    With regard to the death of one \n    who is fasting, this is the matter concerning which there are reports which \n    point to its virtue, not because death in this situation was within his \n    control, but because he died whilst doing a righteous deed and his life \n    ended with that. It is the righteous deed that is within his control and is \n    connected to the ruling of Allah. If a person dies doing such a deed, that \n    is a blessing granted by Allah, may He be exalted, to His slave, and it is \n    encouraged to constantly do such deeds, in the hope that one might die doing \n    such a thing. \n\n    It was narrated that Hudhayfah \n    (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of \n    Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts one day, seeking the Countenance of \n    Allah, and his life ends with that, will enter Paradise.”\n\n    Narrated by Ahmad (no. 22235). \n    Shaykh al-Arna’oot said: It is saheeh because of corroborating evidence. \n\n    It was also narrated by al-Bazzaar \n    in his Musnad (1/436) as follows: “If a person’s life ends with a day \n    of fasting, he will enter Paradise.” Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani. \n\n    Al-Mannaawi (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said: The words “If a person’s life ends with a day of \n    fasting” mean: if a person’s life concludes with a day of fasting, in the \n    sense that he dies when he is fasting or after breaking his fast. \n\n    The words “will enter Paradise” \n    mean: with those who enter it first, or without prior punishment.\n\n    End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer \n    Sharh al-Jaami‘ as-Sagheer (6/160) \n\n    Muslim narrated in his Saheeh \n    (5126) that Jaabir said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace \n    of Allah be upon him) say: “Each person will be resurrected in the condition \n    in which he died.” \n\n    Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said: If a person dies in a particular condition, then his \n    life ends with that, and in that condition he will be resurrected.\n\n    End quote from Kashf al-Mushkil \n    min Hadeeth as-Saheehayn (1/751) \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic theology, the interpretation of a person's death and its implications for their fate in the hereafter can vary. It is generally understood that the circumstances of a person's death do not solely determine their standing in the eyes of Allah. \n\nIn some Islamic teachings, dying in a state of cleanliness or while performing a daily task may be viewed positively. For instance, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has mentioned that dying while engaged in worship or beneficial actions is praiseworthy. \n\nHowever, it is also recognized that the ultimate judgment belongs to Allah alone. Only He knows the intentions and state of the heart of each individual. Therefore, while some may perceive dying in the bathroom as indicative of a bad end, it is essential to remember that we should avoid rash judgments about the fate of the deceased.\n\nIt is crucial for the living to focus on performing good deeds and seeking forgiveness for themselves and for those who have passed away, rather than speculating about the conditions of someone's death. Ultimately, as Muslims, we should place our trust in Allah's mercy and justice."

        "question": "Annulling engagement because of a dream",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to rulings and his understanding of life and circumstances, and his evaluation of the experiences he goes through, the Muslim bases all of that on the reasoning, wisdom and measures that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has enjoined us to pay attention to and follow. This is what Islam teaches us; it instructs us to examine, contemplate and weigh up reason and experience, then to make our decisions after that regarding people and actions. \nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Thus Allah makes clear His Ayat (Laws) to you, in order that you may understand”\n[al-Baqarah 2:242]. \nThere is nothing in our religion to suggest that we should rely on dreams and visions, either with regard to worldly matters or religious rulings. Knowledge that is obtained via dreams is subjective, is not reliable and there is no certainty about it. rather it is subject to doubt, and it is not possible that Islam would instruct people to refer for knowledge to sources that are imaginary and cannot meet the least academic standards. \nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Dreams are of three types: a good dream which is glad tidings from Allah, a dream from the Shaytaan which causes distress, and a dream that comes from what a man is thinking of to himself…”\n Narrated by Muslim (2263). \nthe Shaytaan plays a role in what people see in their dreams, just as a person's own self does, and it is difficult for one to be certain of the source of his dream at all times. So how can a Muslim feel comfortable with a dream that he has seen and base his decisions on it, when he knows that the Shaytaan may have played the greatest role in producing it? \nThat also applies to the case of marriage. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has set out for us the characteristics on which we should base our decision of accepting or rejecting a suitor, as he said:\n“If there comes to you one with whose character and religious commitment you are pleased, then marry (your female relative under your guardianship) to him, for if you do not do so, there will be tribulation and great mischief on earth.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, even if there are some reservations concerning him?? He said: “If there comes to you one with whose character and religious commitment you are pleased, then marry (your female relative under your guardianship) to him,” three times  Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1085); he said: It is hasan ghareeb. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. \nSo he defined character and religious commitment as the standards on which people should base their decisions when rejecting or accepting a suitor. Hence the questioner should not pay attention to anything else or respond to whatever she sees in her dreams of things in which the Shaytaan may have played a part, seeking to divide spouses and cause division and conflict. \nShaykh Ibn 'Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked the following question in Liqa' al-Baab al-Maftooh (no. 5/question no. 17):\nA man proposed marriage to a woman, and in a dream she saw him clean-shaven. Should she agree to marry him or not? In real life he appears to be good, and he does not shave his beard; he is religiously-committed, but Allah knows best about him.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\nIf a woman sees a man who has proposed to her as clean-shaven in a dream, when in reality he does not shave his beard, what she sees in her dream does not matter, and that should not prevent her from marrying him, so long as he is upright in his religious commitment and character. End quote.\nMoreover, we should point out that istikhaarah has nothing to do with seeing dreams – as many people think – because the purpose of istikhaarah is to ask Allah, may He be exalted, to make easier the better of two options, and turning to Him, may He be glorified, for guidance to the best of affairs. Istikhaarah is a du'aa' (supplication) and when Allah answers it, He makes easy the thing that the person has chosen, after thinking and reflecting. The du'aa' has nothing whatsoever to do with dreams.\nOur advice to the sister is to think again, and not try to ruin her marital ties just because of a dream. Rather she should let religion and reason govern the issue of her engagement, then take an appropriate stance after that.\nSee also the answer to question no. 25793 and 34726.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, dreams can hold significance and may be interpreted in various ways, but they should not serve as the sole basis for making significant life decisions, such as annulling an engagement. \n\nIf someone experiences a troubling dream about their engagement, it is advisable to reflect on the dream and consider its implications thoughtfully. Seeking counsel from trusted family members or knowledgeable individuals can provide perspective. However, it is important to base decisions on clear evidence, mutual understanding, and consultation rather than solely on a dream.\n\nEngagement is a serious commitment, and any decision to annul it should be made with careful consideration of the feelings and rights of both parties involved. Clear communication between the individuals involved is essential. If there are legitimate concerns that arise from the dream, they should be addressed directly with the engaged partner rather than simply ending the engagement based on the dream alone.\n\nUltimately, Islam encourages rational thinking and seeking guidance from Allah through prayer (Salah) and supplication (Dua) when faced with important decisions."

        "question": "She committed an immoral action with a young man, then he left her; should she wait for him to marry her?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThis relationship that developed between the young man and the young woman, which usually starts with a look and infatuation, and often ends with immoral actions, is a haraam and sinful relationship which can only lead to evil, corruption and temptation. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)), and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him)” [al-Isra’ 17:32]. \nShaykh as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe prohibition on coming near it is more eloquent than simply prohibiting this action, because that includes the prohibition on all the things that lead to it and promote it. The one who plays with fire will soon get burnt, especially with regard to this matter which many people have a strong desire for.\nEnd quote from Tafseer as-Sa‘di, p. 457 \nFor a young man to get to know a girl who is not his mahram, and for them to fall in love with one another, and what that leads to of meetings and conversations and strong emotions and so on  – all of these are among the most easily accessible doorways to mischief and fitnah. Anyone who has ears to hear or eyes to see will know that for certain. \nThe issue here is not a case of magic that was done by his sister, or anything else; rather the issue is that this relationship was built on a false foundation from the outset. The first step to putting things right, and the most essential obligatory duty for both of them in this case is to repent to Allah; both the young man and the young woman should repent from that illicit relationship, then they should turn over a new page with Allah. One of the conditions of repentance for the sinner is that he should regret the sin that has passed, give it up, and resolve not to go back to it again. All of these steps mean that each of them is required to cut off ties with the other, because this is an invalid relationship that was based on haraam. \nSecondly: \nThere is no room here for praying istikhaarah, because salaat al-istikhaarah is only prescribed concerning permissible matters that a person may be confused about and not know which is better for him. With regard to obligatory or mustahabb (encouraged) matters, there is no istikhaarah for them at all, because it is enjoined to do them according to Islam. By the same token, there is no istikhaarah for haraam and makrooh (disliked) matters either, because it is forbidden to do them according to Islam. \nSee the answer to question no. 11981 \nOnce it is understood that there is no room for istikhaarah in this case, according to Islam, and that what is required from both parties is to repent sincerely to Allah and put an end to the bad relationship between them, any wise person will realise that holding onto far-fetched notions and relying on a human being who has gone away is foolish and is contrary to what is in one’s best interests in both religious and worldly terms. Hence it is said: Whoever referred you to someone who is absent has not been fair to you. This young man turned away from marrying that girl, even though he lived close to her in the same city, so how can she wait for him after he has left her and gone far away? \nIf both of them repent, and cut off ties between them, then after that he wants to marry her, there is nothing wrong with that, but that is on condition that you do not wait for him; rather you should erase that dark page from your life, and start a new page, in the hopes that Allah will accept your repentance, help you to carry on with your life, conceal your past mistake, and give you some one better than him. \nFor more information, please see the answer to question no. 117567 and 148528 \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is important to approach situations involving relationships and personal conduct with care and consideration for moral and ethical guidelines. If a woman has committed an immoral action, it is crucial for her to seek sincere repentance (tawbah) and to turn back to Allah for forgiveness. The process of repentance involves feeling remorse for the action, stopping the sinful behavior, and making a firm intention not to commit the sin again.\n\nRegarding the question of whether she should wait for the young man to marry her, several factors should be considered:\n\n1. **Repentance**: She should focus on her relationship with Allah and her repentance. This is paramount in Islam.\n\n2. **Mutual Consent**: Marriage in Islam is based on mutual consent. If the young man is interested in marrying her and they can establish a relationship based on Islamic principles, then it may be acceptable.\n\n3. **Respect and Honor**: Both parties should respect themselves and each other. If the young man has left her, it might indicate that he is not interested in a marriage with her, and it could be unwise for her to wait indefinitely.\n\n4. **Future Intentions**: She should reflect on her future and consider what is best for her well-being in line with Islamic values. \n\n5. **Seeking Guidance**: Consulting with knowledgeable and trusted individuals, such as family members, scholars, or community leaders, can provide additional perspective and support.\n\nUltimately, while she might hope for reconciliation, she should also be open to the possibility of moving on and building a future that aligns with her values and beliefs. It's essential to prioritize her spiritual growth and well-being in this situation."

        "question": "Khalwah if Another Woman is Present",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) are unanimously \n    agreed that it is haram (impermissible) to be alone with a non-mahram (a \n    woman whom one is allowed to marry according to Islamic law) woman \n    (khalwah), because of the saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration): “No man \n    should be alone with a woman unless there is a mahram (male relative whom \n    she could never marry) with her.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5233; Muslim, \n    1341. \n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a non-mahram \n    man is alone with a non-mahram woman, with no third person present, this is \n    haraam according to scholarly consensus.\n\n    End quote from Sharh Saheeh Muslim, 9/109 \n\n    As-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth \n    indicates that it is haram to be alone with a non-mahram woman, and there is \n    consensus on this point.\n\n    End quote from Subul as-Salam. 1/608 \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    There is nothing wrong with a woman allowing a non-mahram man \n    to enter her husband’s house when he is absent, as long as two conditions \n    are met:\n\n    1.     Her husband should have given her permission to do so.\n\n    2.     There should be no khalwah (i.e., she should not be \n    alone with him); rather there should be a mahram with her such as her father \n    or brother, or anyone for whom it is permanently forbidden to marry her. \n\n    If she does not have a mahram with her, but there is another \n    woman with her, khalwah may be avoided thereby, but it is not permissible \n    for a woman to put herself in such a situation unless the woman is \n    trustworthy and the man who is with them in that place is also trustworthy \n    and there is no fear that he could overpower the two women. \n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a non-mahram \n    man is alone with a non-mahram woman, without a third person being present \n    with them, this is haram according to scholarly consensus; this is different \n    from if a man is with a number of non-mahram women, in which case the \n    correct view is that it is permissible.\n\n    End quote from Sharh Saheeh Muslim, 9/109 \n\n    As-San‘ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It says in the \n    hadeeth that “the third one present with them is the Shaytan”. Can someone \n    other than the mahram take his place in that regard, so that there will be \n    someone with them in order that khalwah will be avoided? It seems to be the \n    case that he may take his place, because the reason for the prohibition is \n    the fear that the Shaytan may cause temptation between them. \n\n    End quote from Subul as-Salam, 1/608 \n\n    Based on this, there is nothing wrong with the man allowing a \n    non-mahram to enter his house, on condition that he is not alone with his \n    wife and that he is trustworthy. However, the basic principle, and the best \n    precaution to safeguard religious commitment, is that he should not allow \n    this unless there is a mahram present. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, \"khalwah\" refers to a situation in which a man and a woman are alone together in a private place where others cannot access them. The concept of khalwah is significant in Islamic law because it raises concerns about modesty and the potential for inappropriate behavior.\n\nRegarding the presence of another woman, the rulings can vary depending on the circumstances:\n\n1. **If the presence of another woman is in a manner that maintains proper boundaries**: If the situation is such that the presence of another woman prevents the possibility of inappropriate behavior and maintains a level of decorum, it may be viewed as less problematic. However, it is essential to ensure that the relationships are respectful and adhere to Islamic principles.\n\n2. **If the situation does not establish a safe environment**: If the presence of another woman does not assure that the atmosphere is appropriate and respectful, or if it leads to the possibility of suspicion or inappropriate behavior, then it would still be considered risky and should be avoided.\n\nIn general, it is advisable to practice caution and to avoid being in any situation that could lead to temptation or moral compromise. It’s best to consult local scholars or trusted sources for guidance in specific cases or circumstances, as different schools of thought may have nuanced views on the matter."

        "question": "Family Disputes",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly severing the ties of kinship is a major sin. The many texts of the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) that enjoin upholding ties of kinship highlight the great importance of this matter in our religion. One of the greatest aims of sharee‘ah (Islamic law) is to bring people together and maintain the ties of brotherhood and kinship among them. \nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Those who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e. they are good to their relatives and do not sever the bond of kinship), fear their Lord, and dread the terrible reckoning (i.e. abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which Allah has forbidden and perform all kinds of good deeds which Allah has ordained).”\n[ar-Ra‘d 13:21].\nAmong the reports of the Prophet’s (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Sunnah which give a stern warning against severing the ties of kinship is the following: \nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n“Allah created the universe, and when He had finished, kinship (al-rahim) stood up and said, ‘This is the standing up of one who seeks Your protection from being cut off.’ Allah said, ‘Yes, would it please you if I were to take care of those who take care of you and cut off those who cut you off?’ It said, ‘Of course.’ Allah said, ‘Then your prayer is granted.’” \nThen the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Recite, if you wish: ‘Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship? Such are they whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight. Do they not then think deeply in the Quran, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?’ [Muhammad 47:22-24].” \nNarrated by al-Bukhari, 5987; Muslim, 2554 \nIf people were to ponder what causes the severing of family ties amongst them, they would find the cause is disputes about some materialistic issues which will not avail for anything before Allah on the Day of Resurrection; or it may be because of what the Shaytan stirs up amongst them, leading to enmity and resentment amongst them because of insignificant reasons that are not worth paying any attention to in the first place. \nThis happens despite the fact that Islam enjoins upholding the ties of kinship even if there are considerable reasons for cutting ties, and it encourages the believers to overlook mistakes and to adopt a forgiving and tolerant attitude, not to seek out mistakes and nurture resentment, grudges and envy. \nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said: O Messenger of Allah, I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off. I treat them well, but they abuse me. I am patient and kind towards them, but they insult me. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you are as you say, then it is as if you are putting hot ashes in their mouths. Allah will continue to support you as long as you continue to do that.”\nNarrated by Muslim, 2558 \nAn-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim (16/115):\nIgnorance here refers to bad speech. What this hadith means is that it will be like feeding them hot ashes. This is a metaphor for the pain they will feel, like the pain of one who eats hot ashes. There will be no sin on this doer of good, rather they will be sinning greatly for cutting him off and causing him harm. \nAnd it was said that what is meant is that by treating them kindly you will make them feel ashamed of themselves because of how kindly you treat them and how badly they have treated you. And Allah knows best. End quote. \nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n“The upholder of kinship ties is not the one who is kind to them if they are kind to him, rather the upholder of kinship ties is the one who, if his relatives cut him off, he upholds the ties of kinship with them.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhari, 5991. \nThis is the conduct and attitude enjoined by Islam. No one should hesitate to denounce the one who cuts off ties with his sister or his mother. It is not permissible for you to go along with your father in cutting off ties with his sister; rather you have to uphold ties with her and treat her kindly, and try to reconcile between her and your father, doing all that you can to achieve this. \nPlease see also the answers to questions no.  4631, 7571 and 75411\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, family disputes are taken seriously, and it is encouraged to resolve them with wisdom, patience, and compassion. The Quran and Hadith provide guidance on how to handle family issues, such as disagreements between spouses, issues with children, or conflicts with extended family.\n\n1. **Communication**: Open and honest communication is essential. Each party should express their feelings and perspectives while also listening to the other's viewpoint.\n\n2. **Seeking Mediation**: If the dispute cannot be resolved amicably, seeking a neutral third party—such as a respected family member or community leader—can help mediate the disagreement.\n\n3. **Advice from the Quran and Sunnah**: The Quran encourages forgiveness and reconciliation. For example, Surah An-Nisa (4:35) advises that if there is a dispute between spouses, they should appoint a mediator from each side to seek reconciliation.\n\n4. **Patience and Forgiveness**: It is important to practice patience and forgiveness. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the significance of forgiving others and maintaining family ties.\n\n5. **Respect and Dignity**: All parties should conduct themselves with dignity and respect, avoiding harmful words or actions that could escalate the situation.\n\n6. **Prayer and Guidance**: Turning to Allah through prayer (dua) is also encouraged. Seeking divine guidance can provide clarity and peace in difficult situations.\n\nIf the disputes are severe and cannot be resolved through these means, it may be necessary to seek professional help or counseling that aligns with Islamic principles. It is essential to approach disputes with the intention of restoring harmony and ensuring the well-being of all family members."

        "question": "Prohibition of Shaking Hands With Non-Mahram Women",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    \n    Firstly: \n\n    In \n    Mukhtasar al-Akhdari and other Maliki books there is an indication that \n    it is haram to shake hands with a non-mahram woman according to the madhhab \n    of Malik (may Allah have mercy on him). \n\n    \n    ‘Aleesh said in Minah al-Jaleel Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel (1/22): It is \n    not permissible for a man to touch the face or hand of a non-mahram woman, \n    and it is not permissible for them to put their hands together without a \n    barrier. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace \n    and blessings of Allah be upon him) never accepted the oath of allegiance \n    (bay‘ah) of a woman by holding her hand; he would accept oaths of allegiance \n    from women verbally. According to another report: His hand never touched the \n    hand of a woman; rather he would accept their oath of allegiance verbally. \n    End quote. \n\n    \n    Secondly:\n\n    The \n    details that you mentioned have to do with nullifying wudu by touching; wudu \n    is nullified in the event of seeking pleasure, or finding pleasure (even if \n    he was not seeking it), or seeking it and finding it. Wudu is not nullified \n    when one does not seek pleasure or find it.\n\n    The \n    prohibition is connected to doing it deliberately, whether there is pleasure \n    or not.\n\n    For \n    more information please see the answer to question no. \n     \n    and \n    \n    \n    2459\n\n    And \n    Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the prohibition of shaking hands with non-mahram women (women who are not closely related and with whom marriage is permitted) is based on principles of modesty and maintaining appropriate boundaries between the sexes. The view among many scholars is that physical contact, such as shaking hands, can lead to temptation or inappropriate behaviors, which Islam seeks to avoid.\n\nThe majority of Islamic scholars agree that men and women who are not mahram should avoid physical contact. This is supported by various hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) that emphasize the importance of maintaining modesty and guarding one's senses. \n\nFor example, a well-known narration from the Sunnah indicates that the Prophet Muhammad avoided physical contact with women who were not of his immediate family. As such, it is generally recommended for Muslims to refrain from shaking hands with non-mahram women, instead opting for verbal greetings or gestures that don’t involve physical contact.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that different cultures and communities might have varying practices based on local customs and interpretations of Islamic law. Ultimately, individuals are encouraged to seek knowledge and guidance from trusted scholars and resources within their community to make informed decisions."

        "question": "Responding to Greeting of Parrot",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nAl-Fayyoomi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe babgha (parrot) is a well-known bird. The word babgha may be masculine or feminine, and the plural is Babghawat. \nAl-Misbah al-Muneer fi Ghareeb al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 1/35 \nSecondly: \nIt seems that it is not prescribed to return the greeting of a parrot which has learnt how to say salams (Islamic greeting), because saying salam is an act of worship and a supplication which requires intention on the part of the one who said it, and there is no such intention on the part of this trained creature. So one should not return its greeting. The ruling is the same as that on a tape on which the greeting is recorded and can be heard. It is a transmission of sound and does not come under the ruling on greeting when it is broadcast live, in which case returning the greeting is prescribed and is a communal obligation (fard kifayah).\nAl-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSometimes the greeting may be recorded and they put it on the tape and run it. If it is recorded then you are not obliged to return the greeting, because this is just a transmission of sound. \nLiqa’ al-Bab al-Maftooh, 28/229 \nSee the rest of the fatwa and details on this issue in the answer to question number  128737.\nBased on this, the parrot does not intend to give the greeting of salam, because it does not possess the power of reason, and when it speaks it is just repeating what it has been taught, without meaning what it says. \nSome of the scholars have stated that it is not prescribed to prostrate if one hears a verse from a parrot or from a recorded tape. \nOne of the conclusions of the book Bahjat al-Asma‘ fi Ahkam al-Sama‘ fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami by Prof. ‘Ali ibn Dhariyan ibn Faris al-Hasan al-‘Anzi (published by Dar al-Manar in Kuwait) is: \nThe listener need not do the prostration of recitation if he hears it from a source that is not human, such as a trained bird like a parrot or hearing it from an echo. End quote. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, responding to greetings is an important aspect of good manners and etiquette. The phrase \"Assalamu Alaikum\" (peace be upon you) is a greeting used by Muslims, and it is encouraged to respond to it appropriately, usually with \"Wa Alaikum Assalam\" (and peace be upon you too).\n\nAs for responding to the greeting of a parrot, it's essential to understand that animals cannot be held accountable for their actions in the same way humans are. While a parrot may mimic human speech, it does not have the understanding or intent behind the greeting. \n\nHowever, if someone feels inclined to respond to a parrot saying \"Assalamu Alaikum\" out of kindness or affection, it would not be considered wrong. It is a reflection of one's character to be friendly and polite, but it is not a religious obligation. The primary context for such greetings is among humans, and responses to animals are not traditionally addressed in Islamic jurisprudence. \n\nIn summary, while it's polite to respond to a parrot's greeting if you choose, it isn't necessary or required in Islam."
