        "question": "Rulings on Conservatorship and Bankruptcy",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The bankrupt (Muflis) is the one who has debts that are greater than the wealth he owns.\nIf the creditors ask the court to establish conservatorship (Hajr) and divide among them the wealth that the debtor has, the judge must respond to that.\nShaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said, explaining the rulings on conservatorship and bankruptcy:\n“1. What is meant by conservatorship in Shari`ah is preventing a person from disposing of his wealth.\nThe evidence for that in the Quran is the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And do not give the weak-minded your property, which Allah has made a means of sustenance for you, but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness.\nAnd test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age. Then if you perceive in them sound judgement, release their property to them.} [An-Nisa’ 4:5-6]\nThese two verses indicate that conservatorship should be imposed in the case of one who is weak-minded and the orphan to prevent them having access to their wealth, lest they mishandle it and lose it. The wealth should not be given to such a person until after it is established that he is mature and competent. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) imposed conservatorship on some of the Companions for the purpose of ensuring that the debt they owed to people would be paid off .\n2. Conservatorship is of two types:\n\nThe first type: conservatorship imposed on a person because he owes something to others, such as conservatorship imposed on a bankrupt person because of what he owes to his creditors.\nThe second type: conservatorship imposed on a person because that is in his best interests, lest he squander his wealth or mishandle it, such as conservatorship in the case of a minor, a weak-minded person and one who is insane.\n\nIn the first case, which is conservatorship imposed on a person because he owes something to others, what is meant in this case is conservatorship imposed on one who is bankrupt. The bankrupt person is one who owes a debt that has now become due, but the wealth that he has is not sufficient to pay it off. He should be prevented from disposing of his wealth, so that he does not harm the creditors.\nAs for the debtor who is in financial difficulty and is not able to pay off anything of his debt , he is not to be asked for it, and he should be given more time, because Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And if someone is in hardship, then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease.} [Al-Baqarah 2:280]\nAs for the one who is able to pay off his debt, it is not permissible to impose conservatorship on him, because there is no need for that. Rather he should be instructed to pay off his debt when the creditors ask him to do so, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “For a rich man to delay repayment is wrongdoing.” In other words, if one who can afford it is taking too long to pay off his debt, he is wronging the creditors, because he is withholding payment that he is obliged to make to people who are entitled to it. So if he refuses to pay off his debts, he should be imprisoned. Shaykh Taqiy Ad-Din Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever is able to pay off his debt but refuses to do so should be forced to pay it off by means of beating and imprisonment. This was stated by the leading scholars among the companions of Malik, Ahmad, Ash-Shafi`i and others. He said: And I do not know of any difference of scholarly opinion concerning that.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “For a rich man to delay repayment is wrongdoing, and it is permissible to speak ill of him and punish him.” (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and others)\nWhat is meant by speaking ill of him is complaining about him, and what is meant by punishing him is detaining him. The one who takes too long to pay off what he owes deserves to be punished by detention or otherwise, and that should be done repeatedly until he pays off what he owes. If he persists in taking too long to pay his debt, then the judge should intervene to sell his property and pay off his debts from the proceeds, because the judge will be playing the role of the one who is refusing to pay. That will also serve the purpose of alleviating harm from the creditors. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harm nor reciprocating harm.”\n3. From the above, it becomes clear that in the case of debt, there are two scenarios:\n\nThe first scenario: the debt has not yet become due. In this case, the debtor is not to be asked to pay it back until it becomes due, and he does not have to pay it before it becomes due. If the wealth he has is less than what he owes that has not yet become due, then he is not to be subjected to conservatorship because of that, and he is not to be prevented from disposing of his wealth.\nThe second scenario: the debt is now due. In that case, there are two possibilities:\n\nThe first possibility is that the wealth he has is greater than the debt he owes. In this case, he is not to be subjected to conservatorship regarding his wealth, but he should be instructed to pay off the debt if the creditor asks for it. If he refuses to do that, then he should be detained and punished until he pays off what he owes. If he puts up with detention and punishment, and refuses to pay off the debt, then the judge should intervene to pay off his debt from his wealth, selling whatever he needs to sell in order to do that.\nThe second possibility is that the wealth he has is less than the debt he owes. In this case, he should be subjected to conservatorship and prevented from disposing of his wealth, if he has creditors who ask for that, lest he harm them. That is because of the Hadith of Ka‘b ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) imposed conservatorship on Mu‘adh (may Allah be pleased with him) and sold his property. Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni and by Al-Hakim, who classed it as authentic. Ibn As-Salah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is a proven Hadith. If he is subjected to conservatorship in this case, then that should be announced and it should be made known to people that conservatorship has been imposed on him, lest they be deceived by him and do business with him, then end up losing their wealth.\n4. There are five rulings having to do with imposing conservatorship on someone.\n\nThe first ruling is that the rights of the creditors are connected to his wealth that existed before conservatorship was imposed and to any wealth that he acquired after it was imposed. So the wealth that he acquired later is subject to the conservatorship, just like the wealth that he owned before that. Thus he will have no authority to dispose of the wealth that he acquired after conservatorship was imposed in any way whatsoever. Even the wealth that he acquired before it was imposed cannot be disposed of in any way that harms his creditors.\n\nImam Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf what he owes of debts is equal to or more than what he has of wealth, then any donation he makes is not valid if he donates it in a way that harms his creditors, regardless of whether the judge has imposed conservatorship on him or not. This is the view of Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) and it is the view favoured by our Shaykh – meaning Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). He said: And it is the correct view, and no other view is appropriate according to the general guidelines of the [Hanbali] Madhhab. In fact, this is in accordance with the teachings and general guidelines of Shari`ah, because the rights of the creditors are connected to his wealth, therefore the judge has the right to impose conservatorship on him. Were it not for the fact that the creditors’ rights are connected to his wealth, then the judge could not impose conservatorship on him. Therefore he is like one who is terminally ill; allowing this debtor to donate his wealth would mean that the creditors would lose what is rightfully theirs, and Shari`ah cannot approve of such a thing. Rather Shari`ah emphasises the importance of protecting the rights of those who have rights by all possible means, and bars any means that could lead to the loss of their rights. End quote.\n\nThe second ruling is that if someone finds his exact wealth with the debtor that he sold to him or loaned to him or rented to him before conservatorship was imposed on him, then he has the right to take it back from the one who is bankrupt, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever finds his own goods with one who has become bankrupt, has more right to them [than other creditors].” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). The jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) stipulated six conditions in order for the one who finds his property with one who is bankrupt and has had conservatorship imposed on him to take it back:\n\n\nThe bankrupt person should still be alive in order for him to take his property back from him, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud  (may Allah have mercy on him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If [the debtor] has died, then the owner of the goods becomes equal to all other creditors.”\nThe bankrupt person should still owe him the price in full. If the creditor has received anything of its price, he is not entitled to take back the goods.\nThe goods should be fully in the possession of the bankrupt person. If the creditor only finds some of them, he cannot take them back, because he has not found his exact property; rather he has only found some of it.\nThe goods should be in the same condition as when they were sold, and none of their characteristics should have changed.\nThe goods should not be connected to the rights of someone else, such as if the bankrupt person gave them in pledge as collateral, and the like.\nThe goods should not have increased in size, such as growing fat [in the case of livestock].\n\nIf all these conditions are fulfilled, then it is permissible for the owner of the goods to take them away, if it has become known that the one who has them has become bankrupt, because of the hadith quoted above.\n\nThe third ruling is that the creditors should stop demanding repayment from him after conservatorship is imposed on him, until after it is lifted. So whoever sells something to him or lends something to him during this period should ask him to pay him or return it after the conservatorship is lifted.\nThe fourth ruling is that the judge may sell his property and divide its price commensurate with the size of the debts that are currently due, because this is the purpose of imposing conservatorship on him. Delaying that is wronging the creditors. However, the judge should leave for the bankrupt person whatever he needs of shelter and sustenance, and so on.\n\nAs for any debt that is not yet due, it does not become due when the person declares bankruptcy, and that does not impact the currently-due debts, because the deferral of time for payment is the right of the bankrupt individual, and that right, like all others, cannot be waived. It remains something that the bankrupt person owes. Then after distributing his wealth to those creditors whose payment is currently due, once he has paid them off and none of those currently-due debts remain, the conservatorship should be lifted automatically, without any need for a judicial ruling, because the reason for it no longer applies. If he still owes anything of the debts that are currently due, then the conservatorship is not to be lifted from him except by a judicial ruling, because the judge is the one who ruled that he was to be subject to conservatorship, so he is the one who should rule that the conservatorship is to be lifted.\" (Al-Mulakhkhas Al-Fiqhi  2/89-95)\nIf any debts remain unpaid, then they are still owed by the one who is bankrupt, until Allah, may He be Exalted, blesses him with wealth, whereupon he must repay these outstanding debts.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the concepts of conservatorship and bankruptcy are addressed with a focus on justice, fairness, and the avoidance of harm. Here are some key points regarding these issues:\n\n### Conservatorship\n\n1. **Definition**: Conservatorship refers to a legal arrangement whereby a court appoints an individual (a conservator) to manage the personal and financial affairs of a person who is unable to do so themselves due to incapacity or minority.\n\n2. **Islamic Perspective**: The welfare of the individual under conservatorship is paramount. Islam emphasizes the protection of the rights and interests of vulnerable individuals, which aligns with the objectives of conservatorship.\n\n3. **Responsibilities of the Conservator**: The conservator must act in the best interests of the individual they are appointed to care for and manage their affairs with honesty, integrity, and transparency. This aligns with the Islamic principles of stewardship (khilafah) and fiduciary duty.\n\n4. **Oversight and Accountability**: There should be mechanisms for oversight to ensure that the conservator is fulfilling their duties appropriately and not exploiting their position.\n\n### Bankruptcy\n\n1. **Definition**: Bankruptcy refers to a legal status of an individual or entity that cannot repay the debts owed to creditors, leading to a court-declared inability to pay obligations.\n\n2. **Islamic Rulings on Debt**: In Islam, debt is taken seriously. Muslims are encouraged to fulfill their financial obligations and avoid incurring debt unnecessarily. However, Islam also recognizes that financial difficulties can occur.\n\n3. **Insolvency**: If a debtor finds themselves in a situation where they cannot pay their debts, they should seek an amicable settlement with their creditors. This includes negotiating terms or seeking extensions of time.\n\n4. **Bankruptcy Filing**: If an individual is truly unable to repay their debts, seeking legal bankruptcy can sometimes be permissible, though it may depend on the context and the specific rulings of scholars in the respective Islamic school of thought.\n\n5. **Creditors' Rights**: In the Islamic framework, creditors should also show compassion and understanding towards debtors in hardship. The Quran advocates forgiveness and leniency, noting that if one defers repayment (in case of hardship), it can be considered as an act of charity (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:280).\n\n6. **Avoiding Riba (Usury)**: In all financial transactions, including those related to bankruptcy, it is crucial to avoid riba (interest), as it is strictly prohibited in Islam.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rulings on conservatorship and bankruptcy in Islam emphasize compassion, justice, and the protection of individual rights. It is advisable for individuals facing these situations to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars and adhere to Islamic principles to navigate the complexities involved."

        "question": "Recommended Recitation In the Two Sunnah Rak‘ahs Of Fajr and Maghrib",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What to recite in Sunnahs of Fajr and Maghrib?\nYes, it is recommended to recite Surat al-Kafirun and Surat al-Ikhlas in the two Sunnah rak‘ahs of Fajr and Maghrib. This is proven in the sahih Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recited in the two Sunnah rak‘ahs of Fajr {Qul ya ayyuha’l-kafirun (Say, \"O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] and {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah, [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112].\nIbn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I watched the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) twenty times reciting in the two rak‘ahs after Maghrib and in the two rak‘ahs before Fajr, {Qul ya ayyuha’l-kafirun (Say, \"O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] and {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah, [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112]. (Narrated by al-Nasai, 992)\nAn-Nawawi said in al-Majmu‘ (3/385): \n“Its isnad is jayyid. It was classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (3328) and by Shaykh Ahmad Shakir in Tahqiq al-Musnad (8/89).”\nAl-Mubarakfuri said in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (2/418):\n“That is, in the first rak‘ah of each of them he would recite {Qul ya ayyuha’l-kafirun (Say, O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] and in the second {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah , [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112].”\nThe scholars have stated that it is recommended to recite these two surahs in the Sunnah prayers of Fajr and Maghrib, in accordance with these hadiths. (See: al-Mughni (1/435); Mughni al-Muhtaj (1/464); al-Fatawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra (1/192); al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (27/159)\nWhy should we recite Surat al-Kafirun and Surat al-Ikhlas in Fajr and Maghrib Sunnah prayers?\nWith regard to the wisdom behind reciting these two surahs, that is because they include all three types of Tawhid . The surah {Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say, He is Allah, [who is] One)} [al-Ikhlas 112] refers to tawhid ar-rububiyyah (oneness of divine Lordship ) and tawhid al-asma wa’s-sifat (oneness of the divine names and attributes ), for it affirms that Allah, may He be exalted, is one God and denies that He has any son, father or peer, and that in addition to that, He is as-Samad, in Whom are combined all attributes of perfection.\nAnd the surah {Qul ya ayyuhu’l-kafirun (Say, O disbelievers)} [al-Kafirun 109] refers to tawhid al-‘ibadah (oneness of worship), which means that one should not worship anyone or anything except Allah, and should not associate anyone with Him in worship. Hence the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to start the day with them in the Sunnah prayer of Fajr , and he would end the day with them in the Sunnah prayer of Maghrib. In as-Sunan, it is narrated that he used to recite these surahs in Witr, so they were also a conclusion to the deeds of the night, just as they were a conclusion to the deeds of the day.” (This was stated by Ibn al-Qayyim in Badai‘ al-Fawaid, 1/145-146)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the two Sunnah Rak‘ahs of Fajr and Maghrib, it is recommended to recite specific Surahs after Al-Fatiha. \n\nFor the Sunnah Rak‘ah of **Fajr**, it is common to recite:\n- Surah Al-Kafirun (Surah 109) in the first Rak‘ah after Al-Fatiha.\n- Surah Al-Ikhlas (Surah 112) in the second Rak‘ah after Al-Fatiha.\n\nFor the Sunnah Rak‘ah of **Maghrib**, it is also common to recite:\n- Surah Al-‘Alaq (Surah 96) in the first Rak‘ah after Al-Fatiha.\n- Surah Al-Ikhlas (Surah 112) in the second Rak‘ah after Al-Fatiha.\n\nThese recitations are based on various Hadith narrations and are widely practiced among Muslims; however, one may recite any other Surah that one wishes after Al-Fatiha. It is always best to seek knowledge from local scholars or trusted sources to ensure proper practice."

        "question": "Difference between Shari’ah, Fiqh and Usul Al-Fiqh",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is Shari`ah?\nIn linguistic terms, Shari`ah refers to a water source, which is the source to which people who want to drink come, so they drink from it and fill their buckets, and perhaps bring their animals to drink from it as well.\nThe Arabs do not call a water source Shari`ah unless the water is flowing without interruption, and is visible and can be seen. (Lisan al-‘Arab (8/175)\nIn Shar‘i terminology, Shari`ah refers to the entire religion (Islam), which Allah has chosen for His slaves to bring them forth thereby from the depths of darkness into the light. It is what He has prescribed for them and what He has explained to them of commands and prohibitions, halal and haram.\nWhoever follows the Shari`ah of Allah, regarding as permissible (halal) that which He has permitted and regarding as forbidden (haram) that which He has prohibited, will triumph.\nWhoever goes against the Shari`ah (laws) of Allah has exposed himself to divine vengeance, wrath and punishment.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Then We put you, [O Muhammad], on an ordained way [Shari`ah] concerning the matter [of religion]; so follow it and do not follow the inclinations of those who do not know.” [al-Jathiyah 45:18]\nWhat does Fiqh mean?\nIn linguistic terms, fiqh means understanding. It may be said that so-and-so has been given fiqh fi’d-din, meaning understanding of the religion. Another example is the du‘a of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for Ibn 'Abbas: “Allahumma faqqihhu fi’d-din (O Allah, give him understanding of the religion).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (143) and Muslim (2477)   (Tahdhib al-Lughah (5/263)\nIn Shar‘i terminology, fiqh refers to knowledge of the practical, minor Shar‘i rulings which are derived from detailed evidence and proof. Al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (1/13)\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The definition of fiqh is: knowledge of the rulings of Shari`ah as derived from the Quran and the words of the one who was sent with it (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), for these rulings can only be taken from him.\nWhat is implied by this definition is: knowledge of the rulings of the Quran, and what abrogates and what is abrogated of it (an-nasikh wa’l-mansukh); and knowledge of the rulings in the hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), what abrogates and what is abrogated of it, and what is soundly narrated of it and what is not; and knowledge of the matters concerning which there was consensus among the scholars and what they differed about; and knowledge of how to refer differences of opinion to the Quran and Sunnah of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is what is meant by having knowledge of the rulings of Shari`ah.” (Al-Ihkam fi Usul al-Ahkam (5/127)\nIbn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Fiqh is understanding of the texts, Quranic verses and hadiths, and knowing how to derive rulings from them.” (Sharh Akhsar al-Mukhtasarat (1/2)\nWhat is Usul al-Fiqh?\nThe word asl (pl. usul) refers to the origin of a thing and what it is based on. Hence the father is the origin of the child, and the river is the origin of the channel. (Al-Misbah al-Munir (1/16)\nUsul al-Fiqh is knowledge of Shar‘i evidence and the way in which that evidence is interpreted in order to reach a ruling, in general terms or in detail. (Sharh Mukhtasar ar-Rawdah (1/106)\nIbn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Usul al-Fiqh may be defined in two ways:\n\nFirstly, on the basis of the two words that make up the phrase, namely the word usul and the word fiqh.\n\nUsul is the plural of asl, which is the basis on which something else is built, such as the foundation of a wall (asl al-jidar), or the trunk of a tree (asl ash-shajarah) from which the branches stem. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Have you not considered how Allah presents an example, [making] a good word like a good tree, whose root [asl] is firmly fixed and its branches [high] in the sky?” [Ibrahim 14:24].\nIn linguistic terms, fiqh means understanding; in Shar‘i terminology it refers to knowledge of the practical Shar‘i rulings, with detailed evidence.\nKnowledge may be definitive or speculative, because Shar‘i rulings may be either definitive (yaqini) or speculative (zanni), as is the case in many issues of fiqh.\nWhat we mean by the Shar‘i rulings (conclusions) is the rulings that are learned from the Shar‘i texts, such as the obligations and prohibitions. That excludes rulings (conclusions) derived by means of reasoning, such as knowing that the whole is greater than its parts, or regular rulings (conclusions), such as knowing that dew will come down on a winter’s night if the sky is clear.\nWhat we mean by practical is that which does not have to do with beliefs, such as prayer and zakah. That excludes anything that has to do with beliefs (‘aqidah), such as the Oneness of Allah (Tawhid) and knowledge of the divine names and attributes. Such topics are not called fiqh in Shar‘i terminology.\nWhat we mean by detailed evidence is evidence of fiqh that has to do with detailed issues of fiqh. This excludes Usul al-Fiqh, because discussing issues of Usul al-Fiqh is done on the basis of the general evidence of fiqh.\n\nSecondly, on the basis of the phrase (the two words together, Usul al-Fiqh) that forms the name of this branch of knowledge, it is defined as the branch of knowledge that deals with the general evidence of fiqh and how to make use of it, and the situation of the one who engages in this process (which is called ijtihad).\n\nWhat we mean by general is the general principle, such as when the scholars said that a command means that something is obligatory, a prohibition means that something is haram, and the soundness of a report means that it has authority. This excludes detailed evidence, which is not discussed within the framework of Usul al-Fiqh except by way of explaining a general rule.\nWhat we mean by how to benefit from it is knowing how to derive rulings from the evidence by studying what the words of the text mean, and whether the meaning is general or specific, applicable with no restrictions or subject to some restrictions, what abrogates and what is abrogated, and so on. This is done by understanding all of the evidence of fiqh from which rulings are derived.\nWhat we mean by the situation of the one who engages in this process is trying to find out his situation (and whether he is qualified), because he is the one who is engaging in this process (ijtihad), as he himself derives rulings through his efforts based on the evidence, as he has reached the level of ijtihad (having the ability to work out rulings based on the evidence). Knowing the definition of the mujtahid, the conditions and rulings on ijtihad, and so on, are matters that are discussed in the field of Usul al-Fiqh.\nThe benefit of Usul al-Fiqh is that it enables a person to attain the ability to derive Shar‘i rulings from the evidence by means of a sound process.\nThe first one to write about Usul al-Fiqh as an independent branch of knowledge was Imam ash-Shafi‘i, Muhammad ibn Idris (may Allah have mercy on him); then he was followed in that by  scholars who wrote various books on this topic.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic studies, the terms Shari’ah, Fiqh, and Usul al-Fiqh have specific meanings and roles that contribute to the understanding and application of Islamic law. Here’s an overview of each term:\n\n1. **Shari’ah**:\n   - **Definition**: Shari’ah literally means \"the way\" or \"the path.\" In an Islamic context, it refers to the divine law that encompasses all aspects of a Muslim's life. Shari’ah is derived from the Qur'an (the holy book of Islam) and the Sunnah (the practices and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad).\n   - **Scope**: Shari’ah covers not only legal regulations but also ethical, moral, and spiritual guidelines. It includes rules regarding worship, morality, social justice, and personal conduct.\n   - **Nature**: Shari’ah is considered to be a comprehensive system that is based on divine revelation and is immutable, meaning it does not change over time.\n\n2. **Fiqh**:\n   - **Definition**: Fiqh translates to \"understanding\" or \"comprehension.\" It is the human effort to interpret and apply the principles of Shari’ah to practical life situations. \n   - **Scope**: Fiqh pertains specifically to jurisprudence or the legal rulings derived from Shari’ah. It includes the study of how laws are applied and can vary based on context, culture, and interpretation.\n   - **Nature**: Since Fiqh is developed through human reasoning (ijtihad), it is subject to change and can differ among various Islamic schools of thought (madhahib). Scholars may reach different conclusions based on the same sources.\n\n3. **Usul al-Fiqh**:\n   - **Definition**: Usul al-Fiqh translates to \"the roots of jurisprudence.\" It is the foundational study of the principles and methodologies used to derive legal rulings from the sources of Shari’ah.\n   - **Scope**: Usul al-Fiqh examines the sources of Islamic law (like the Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus [ijma], and analogy [qiyas]) and the methodologies through which scholars derive rulings. \n   - **Nature**: This discipline aims to establish a systematized approach for interpreting Shari’ah, ensuring that Fiqh is rooted in sound principles.\n\n**Summary**:\nIn simpler terms, Shari’ah is the overarching divine law of Islam, Fiqh is the human interpretation and application of that law in various circumstances, and Usul al-Fiqh provides the methodology and principles that scholars use to derive Fiqh from Shari’ah."

        "question": "Scholarly consensus (ijmaa‘) as binding proof and the first consensus that occurred in Islam",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nConsensus (ijmaa‘) is one of the important sources of legislation that must be followed.\nThere are several definitions of consensus (ijmaa‘); the favoured view is that of as-Subki (may Allah have mercy on him), who defined it as follows: It is when there is unanimous agreement among the scholars of the ummah after the death of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), during any era, on some particular matter.\nEnd quote from Jam‘ al-Jaami‘, annotated by Wali ad-Deen al-‘Iraaqi, which is known also known as al-Ghayth al-Haami‘, p. 485\nThere is a great deal of definitive evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah for the fact that consensus constitutes binding proof. We have explained some of it previously in the answer to question no. 201682 .\nFor example, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination”\n[an-Nisa’ 4:115].\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever goes against it – that is, consensus – after coming to know of it, or after proof has been established on the basis of consensus, is deserving of the warning mentioned in the verse.\nEnd quote from Maraatib al-Ijmaa‘ by Ibn Hazm, p. 7.\nAl-Qaadi Abu Ya‘la (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Consensus constitutes binding proof with which one should comply and it is haraam to go against it; it is not possible for the ummah to agree on error.\nEnd quote from al-‘Uddah fi Usool al-Fiqh (4/1058).\nSecondly:\nWe have not come across anyone who mentioned the first consensus that occurred in Islam, or the first one to narrate such a thing.\nWe have stated above that consensus is when the scholars agree on a particular issue after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nHowever, during his lifetime (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), consensus did not constitute proof.\nAl-Aamidi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The consensus of those who were alive at the time of revelation did not constitute proof at the time of revelation, according to consensus; rather consensus became binding proof after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nEnd quote from al-Ahkaam by al-Aamidi (1/109).\nBased on that, it may be said that the first consensus that occurred after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) on the necessity of appointing a caliph, after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Therefore the Muhaajireen and Ansaar met in the saqeefah of Banu Saa‘idah for that purpose, before the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was buried, then they agreed to appoint Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) as caliph.\nAmong the first examples of consensus after that was the agreement of the Sahaabah on fighting the apostates, after some initial objection on the part of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), but then Allah opened his heart and caused him to feel at ease with the decision of Abu Bakr, and the Sahaabah agreed on that, without any dissent.\nImam Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, praised the Muhaajireen and Ansaar, and the earliest Muslims; the Qur’an speaks highly of the Muhaajireen and Ansaar in many places, and praises those who were present at Bay‘at ar-Ridwaan [when the Muslims affirmed their allegiance to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at al-Hudaybiyyah]. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Certainly was Allah pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, [O Muhammad], under the tree”\n[al-Fat-h 48:18].\nThese people whom Allah praised agreed to appoint Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) as their leader; they called him Khaleefat Rasool-Allah (the Successor to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), and swore allegiance to him, rallying behind him and affirming his virtue, for he was the best of the Sahaabah in the qualities that are required for a person to be a leader, such as knowledge, asceticism, wisdom, leadership abilities, and so on.\nEnd quote from al-Ibaanah fi Usool ad-Diyaanah, p. 66\nAnd he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What confirms the fact that Abu Bakr’s appointment as caliph was based on a strong foundation is the fact that all the Muslims rallied behind him and accepted his leadership.… Later on, we see that ‘Ali and al-‘Abbaas swore allegiance to him and agreed to accept his leadership. Therefore his leadership, after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), was based on the consensus of the Muslims.\nIt is not appropriate for anyone to say that what was in the hearts of ‘Ali and al-‘Abbaas [concerning the appointment of Abu Bakr as caliph] was something other than what they showed. If that argument was valid, then it would be almost impossible to establish consensus. The same argument could be used with regard to any consensus of the Muslims, but that would lead to the invalidation of the idea of consensus as binding proof, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has not obliged us to know what is hidden in people’s minds when it comes to the matter of consensus; rather He has obliged us to go by what people appear to be. Therefore consensus and agreement on the appointment of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq as caliph did indeed occur.\nEnd quote from al-Ibaanah, p. 66\nImam Abu ‘Uthmaan as-Saabooni (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars of hadith confirmed the validity of Abu Bakr’s appointment as caliph after the death of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because he was chosen by the Sahaabah; they were unanimously agreed on that and they all said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was pleased that he should lead us in our religious matters (prayers), therefore we are pleased for him to lead us in our worldly matters. In other words, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed him to lead the people in the obligatory prayers when he was sick, which is their religious affairs, so we accept him as the successor of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to our worldly affairs.\nWhen they said, The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put you ahead of us, so how could we put you back? What they meant was: the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put you ahead to lead us in prayer when he was sick, and we prayed behind you on his orders, so how could we put you back after he put you forward?\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke highly of Abu Bakr when he was alive, which indicated to the Sahaabah that he was the most deserving of being appointed caliph after him. Hence they agreed to rally behind him, and that was to their own benefit, and they gained honour and victory through him.\nEnd quote from ‘Aqeedat as-Salaf wa As-haab al-Hadith, p. 290.\nWe shall mention here the story of how ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) swore allegiance to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq on the first day.\nIbn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Haafiz Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi said: Abu’l-Hasan ‘Ali ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Haafiz al-Isfaraayeeni informed us: Abu ‘Ali al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali al-Haafiz told us: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Is-haaq ibn Khuzaymah and Ibraaheem ibn Abi Taalib told us: Bandaar ibn Bashaar told us: Abu Hishaam al-Makhzoomi told us: Wuhayb told us: Dawood ibn Abi Hind told us: Abu Nadrah told us, from Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri, who said:\nThe Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed away and the people, including Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, gathered in the house of Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah.\nThe spokesman of the Ansaar stood up and said: Do you know that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was one of the Muhaajireen, and his successor is one of the Muhaajireen, and we are the Ansaar (helpers) of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and we will be the Ansaar (helpers) of his successor as we were his helpers?\n‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab stood up and said Your spokesman has spoken the truth. If you had said something other than this, we would not have accepted that. And he took the hand of Abu Bakr and said: This is the right man, so swear allegiance to him. ‘Umar swore allegiance to him, and the Muhaajireen and Ansaar swore allegiance to him.\nThen Abu Bakr ascended the minbar and looked at the people, and he did not see az-Zubayr.\nSo he called for az-Zubayr, and he came.\nAbu Bakr said: (You are) the son of the paternal aunt of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his disciple; do you want to cause division among the Muslims?\nHe said: There is nothing to worry about, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. Then he stood up and swore allegiance to him.\nThen Abu Bakr looked at the people, and he did not see ‘Ali, so he called ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib and he came.\nAbu Bakr said: (You are) the son of the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his son-in-law; do you want to cause division among the Muslims?\nHe said: There is nothing to worry about, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. Then he stood up and swore allegiance to him.\nAbu ‘Ali al-Haafiz said: I heard Muhammad ibn Is-haaq ibn Khuzaymah say: Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj came to me and asked me about this hadith, so I wrote it down for him on a piece of paper and I read it to him. This hadith is worth a badanah (a valuable camel); indeed it is worth a badrah (sack of money)!\nEnd quote from al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah by Ibn Katheer (5/269).\nA badrah is a big sack full of money; it was said that it is one thousand or ten thousand dirhams, or seven thousand dinars.\nAl-Mu‘jam al-Waseet (p. 43); al-Qaamoos al-Muheet (p. 444).\nThen Ibn Katheer narrated a report about another oath of allegiance that ‘Ali swore after the death of Faatimah (ma y Allah be pleased with her). He said: This oath of allegiance that was sworn by ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) after the death of Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) was in confirmation of the reconciliation between them and it was secondary to the oath of allegiance mentioned above, that was sworn on the day of as-saqeefah, as was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah and classed as saheeh by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj. ‘Ali did not keep his distance from Abu Bakr, during these six months; rather he used to pray behind him, and he was present when Abu Bakr used to meet with some of the senior Sahaabah in order to seek their advice concerning some issues; he was also willing to ride with him on a campaign to Dhu’l-Qassah.\nIn Saheeh al-Bukhaari it says that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed ‘Asr a few days after the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, then he went out of the mosque and found al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali playing with some boys. He carried him on his shoulder and started saying: May my father be sacrificed for the one who looks like the Prophet and does not look like ‘Ali! And ‘Ali smiled (at this joke).\nBut when this second oath of allegiance occurred, some narrators thought that ‘Ali had not sworn allegiance (to Abu Bakr) before that, so they denied that (the first oath of allegiance) had happened. But if someone confirms that something happens, that takes precedence over the report of someone who says that it did not happen, as we have mentioned and explained above. And Allah knows best.\nEnd quote from al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah (5/307)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, scholarly consensus (ijma‘) refers to the agreement of scholars on a particular legal issue or doctrine after the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It is considered one of the sources of Islamic law (Sharia) and is viewed as binding proof in determining rulings when the Quran and Hadith do not provide explicit guidance.\n\nThe concept of ijma‘ reflects the collective understanding and agreement of qualified scholars (ulama) within a specific time and context. It signifies a united front in interpreting Islamic teachings and is highly regarded because it is believed to embody the collective wisdom and insight of the scholarly community.\n\nThe first consensus that is often cited in Islamic history occurred shortly after the death of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) regarding the leadership of the Muslim community. Following the Prophet's passing, the companions (Sahabah) came together to select Abu Bakr as the first caliph. Although there were discussions and differing opinions, the eventual consensus on Abu Bakr's caliphate is seen as a foundational act that established the principle of ijma‘ in the Muslim community.\n\nThe binding nature of ijma‘ is based on the belief that it reflects divine guidance in the preservation of the faith and legal practices, and it remains an important aspect of Islamic jurisprudence. However, it is important to note that for ijma‘ to be considered valid, it generally requires that the scholars in agreement be of a certain level of expertise and authority within the Islamic tradition."

        "question": "What Is Ijma` and What Are Its Types?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is ijma’?\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“In linguistic terms, ijma` means resolve and agreement. \nIn Shar‘i terms, ijma` means the agreement of the mujtahids of this ummah after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a shar‘i ruling . \nBy saying “agreement” we exclude differences of opinion; if there is a difference of opinion, even from one person, then we cannot say that there is ijma`. \nBy saying “the mujtahids” we exclude the common folk and those who follow or imitate scholars; it does not matter whether they agree or disagree. \nBy saying “this ummah” we exclude the consensus of others, which carries no weight. \nBy saying “after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)” we exclude their agreement at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); ijma` or consensus at that time does not count as evidence, because evidence is established by the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), whether in word or deed or by approval. Hence if a Sahabi says “We used to do” or that they (i.e., people) used to do such and such at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), this is indicative of the approval of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), according to consensus. \nBy saying “on a shar‘i ruling”, we exclude their agreement on a rational or human ruling, which has nothing to do with the matter under discussion, because we are talking about looking for ijma` as one of the kinds of shar‘i evidence. \nEvidence for the authority of ijma`\nIjma` counts as evidence on the basis of a number of pieces of evidence, including the following: \n\nThe verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Thus We have made you (Muslims), a Wasat (just) (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind” [al-Baqarah 2:143].  The words “witnesses over mankind” include testifying about their deeds and judging their deeds, and the words of the witness may be accepted.\nThe verse in which Allah, says (interpretation of the meaning): “(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves” [an-Nisa 4:59] indicate that whatever they agreed upon is sound and correct.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “My ummah will not unanimously agree on misguidance.”\nWe say: If the ummah unanimously agrees on something, it must be either true or false. If it is true, then it is proof. If it is false, how can this ummah, which is the dearest of nations to Allah since the time of its Prophet until the onset of the Hour, agree on something false with which Allah is not pleased? This is quite impossible.\n\nTypes of ijma`  \nIjma` is of two types: definitive and presumptive. \n\nDefinitive is that which is well known and well established, such as consensus that the five daily prayers are obligatory and that zina (fornication, adultery) is haram. No one can deny that this type of ijma` is proven and established, or that it constitutes proof in and of itself, or that the one who rejects it becomes a kafir, unless he is ignorant and may be excused for his ignorance.\nPresumptive is that which can only be known by means of research and study, where the scholars may differ as to whether there is ijma` (on a particular issue) or not. The most correct scholarly opinion concerning that is the view of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, when he said in al-‘Aqidah al-Wasitiyyah: The type of ijma` that is to be accepted is that of the righteous early generations (as-salaf as-salih), because after their time there was a great deal of disagreement and the ummah spread far and wide. End quote.\n\nIt should be noted that the ummah cannot agree on something that is contrary to an unabrogated, clear, sahih text, because it can only agree on what is true. If you see consensus that you think is contrary to that, then it must be one of the following: either the evidence is not clear, or it is not sahih, or it is abrogated, or there is a difference of opinion concerning the matter of which you were not aware. \nWhat are the conditions of ijma`? \nThere are certain conditions for ijma`, such as: \n\nIt should be soundly proven in the sense that it is either well known among the scholars or transmitted by a trustworthy narrator who has read widely.\nIt should not have been preceded by a well-known difference of opinion. If that was the case, then there is no ijma`, because scholarly opinions are not invalidated by the death of their authors.\n\nIjma` does not cancel out a previous difference of opinion; rather it prevents differences of opinion from arising. \nThis is the most correct view, because of the strength of its argument. \nAnd it was said that the second condition is not stipulated, so it is valid in a later period for there to be consensus on one of the previous opinions and for that to serve as proof for those who come afterwards. \nAccording to the majority, it is not essential that those who unanimously agree all die when still holding this view for  ijma` to be established; rather ijma` is established as soon as they (the scholars of a particular era) agree, and it is not permissible for them or anyone else to go against it after that, because the condition for the establishment of ijma` do not include any stipulation that the era (of the scholars who reached this consensus) should have come to an end with their passing. As ijma` is established at the moment they agree (on a particular issue), there is nothing that could cancel it out. \nIf one of the mujtahids (scholars) says or does something and that becomes well known among the mujtahids, and they do not denounce it even though they are able to do so, then it is said that there is ijma`. It was said that this establishes that there is ijma`; others said that it may be regarded as proof but not ijma`; and others said that it is neither ijma` nor proof. And it was said that if they all passed away before denouncing it then it is ijma`, because their silence until the time of their death, even though they were able to denounce it, constitutes proof of their agreement. This is the view that is most likely to be correct.” (Al-Usul min ‘Ilm al-Usul, 62-64) \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Ijma`, in Islamic jurisprudence, refers to the consensus of the scholars of the Muslim community on a certain issue. It is considered one of the sources of Islamic law (Sharia) alongside the Quran and Sunnah (the practices and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad). Ijma` plays a crucial role in deriving legal rulings when explicit texts from the Quran and Sunnah may not exist for a specific matter.\n\n### Types of Ijma`:\n\n1. **Ijma` Qabli (Prior Consensus)**: This form of ijma` occurs when a consensus is reached on a particular issue during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad or shortly after his death, that is, within the time of the companions (Sahabah). It is regarded as binding and carries significant authority.\n\n2. **Ijma` Ba'di (Subsequent Consensus)**: This type of consensus is reached by scholars after the time of the companions and refers to the agreement on legal issues made by later generations of Islamic scholars. This form is also binding, though with some scholars differing on its authority compared to ijma` qabli.\n\n3. **Ijma` Sihahi (Valid Consensus)**: This refers to a consensus where all scholars involved are in agreement, reflecting a true collective decision on an issue.\n\n4. **Ijma` Da'if (Weak Consensus)**: This can refer to a situation where the consensus is not based on all scholars or where the scholars may have differing opinions that undermine the strength of the consensus.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- **Types Based on the Participants**: Ijma` could also be categorized based on the number of scholars involved (e.g., consensus of all scholars vs. consensus of a specific group).\n  \n- **Ijma` will only occur on matters that are clear and do not conflict with established texts from the Quran or Sunnah.**\n\nOverall, ijma` serves as a vital mechanism in Islamic jurisprudence for maintaining unity and continuity in legal rulings, adapting to new issues that may arise within the Muslim community over time."

        "question": "Is it mustahabb to wash the hands with soap?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIslamic sharee‘ah is a flexible way that is based on general principles and holistic foundations governing human conduct. At the same time it allows room for new developments that occur with changes in time and place. For example, it does not put undue restrictions on people with regard to customs and purely worldly actions; rather it gives them the freedom to act in accordance with what is appropriate to their desires and interests, and what will benefit them, so long as any given custom is not contrary to the text of the Qur’an or Sunnah. This is the meaning of what was affirmed by the fuqaha’ and scholars of usool when they said: The basic principle with regard to customs is that they are permissible and are allowed. \nBased on that, there is nothing wrong with the Muslim benefiting from what has been invented or discovered in modern times, such as cars, airplanes and electricity… and modern means of cleaning the body or clothes. \nThe Muslim is not required to go back to riding camels or using the kind of cleaning agents that were used by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because these are not worship in which he is required to follow the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); rather these are customs and traditions. \nAsh-Shaatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWith regard to customs, the Lawgiver focused on the idea of achieving a given purpose, not on a literal following of a shar‘i text, unlike acts of worship which must be based on a shar‘i text.\nEnd quote from al-Muwaafaqaat, 2/523 \nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) encouraged cleanliness and that which will protect good health in general terms, and for that purpose he used the means and things that were available at his time (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). If something new is introduced and it leads to the same purpose (i.e., cleanliness and maintenance of good health) without causing any harm, then there is nothing wrong with the Muslim using it and benefiting from it. \nIn Islam there are many teachings that are indicative of paying attention to cleanliness of the body, clothing and place where one is. To confirm that, it is sufficient to note that wudoo’ – which involves washing the hands, mouth, nose, and face – is one of the conditions of prayer, which is the foundation of the faith, being valid. \nUsing cleaning agents with water was not widely practised at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) because of the scarcity of these cleaning agents and the scarcity of water itself. \nYet despite that it is proven in the Sunnah that lote leaves may be used in some cases where ghusl is done that require extra attention to care and cleaning, such as washing the deceased prior to burial, ghusl for a woman whose period has ended, and ghusl for the kaafir who becomes Muslim. The fuqaha’ also mentioned using saltwort as well for the purpose of cleaning and bathing. \nSaltwort (salsola) is a plant that grows in sandy ground; it or its ash is used for washing clothes and hands.\nAl-Mu‘jam al-Waseet, 1/91 \nWith regard to lotus, this is a plant that grows on water. Its fruit is the lotus fruit (nabq) and its leaves are used for washing. See: Lisaan al-‘Arab, 4/354 \nIt was narrated that Umm ‘Atiyyah al-Ansaariyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) entered upon us when his daughter died and said: “Wash her three times, or five, or more than that, if you see fit, with water and lotus leaves, and put camphor in the last time, or a little camphor”.\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 1253; Muslim, 939 \nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThis indicates that it is mustahabb or encouraged to use lotus leaves when washing the deceased. There is unanimous agreement that it is mustahabb.\nEnd quote from Sharh Muslim, 7/3 \nIbn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nAl-Maymooni said: I read to Ibn Hanbal: Is it acceptable for the woman whose menses has ended to do ghusl using only water? \nHe dictated to me: If she cannot find anything but water on its own, then she should do ghusl with it. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your water and your lotus leaves,” and this is more than ghusl in the case of janaabah. \nI said: What if she did ghusl using water only, then she found (lotus leaves)? \nHe said: I prefer that she should repeat it, because of what he said.\nEnd quote from Fath al-Baari, 1/471-472 \nIt was narrated from Qaasim ibn ‘Aasim (may Allah be pleased with him) that he became Muslim, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed him to do ghusl using water and lotus leaves.\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi, 605. He said: It is hasan. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi. \nIt is obvious that using lotus leaves when doing ghusl does not come under the heading of acts of worship; rather it is the matter of customs that change with time and place. Whoever uses any cleansing material in the place of lotus leaves has fulfilled the spirit of the Sunnah and has fulfilled the purpose for which the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed people to do ghusl with lotus leaves. \nOn our website, in a number of answers, we have explained that it is not mustahabb to imitate the actions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he did on the grounds that they were customs or personal habits or preferences, and doing so does not bring any greater reward than other customary matters. Rather reward is attained by adhering to Sunnahs of worship and related matters. \nShaykh Dr. Muhammad al-Ashqar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe ruling on these matters of custom and similar issues is that they are indicative of something being permissible, and no more, except in two cases: \n1.Where there is a report of words enjoining or encouraging something, in which case it seems that it is something prescribed in Islam\n2.Where it seems that it is connected to Islam by circumstantial evidence other than words, such as placing the deceased in his grave facing towards the qiblah. That is obviously connected to something that is prescribed in Islam.\nEnd quote from Af‘aal ar-Rasool, 1/237 \nSee also the answer to question no. 69822 \nSecondly: \nWith regard to what you mentioned about not owning a lot of clothes, what is required of the Muslim with regard to food, drink and clothing, and the house in which he lives and the furniture on which he sits, and other such matters, is that he should not go beyond what he needs. So what he has of clothing and furnishings should be in accordance with what he needs and no more than that. If it is more than what he needs, then he comes under the heading of extravagance which is condemned in Islam. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not Al-Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance)”\n[al-An‘aam 6:141]. \nAs-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nExtravagance may mean having more than is sufficient and consuming too much of food that is harmful to the body; or it may mean going to excess in luxury in food, drink and clothing; or it may mean overlooking what is halaal and favouring what is haraam. \n“certainly He (Allah) likes not Al-Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance)” means that Allah hates extravagance and it is harmful to the individual’s body and livelihood, because he may end up being unable to meet his financial obligations. This verse commands us to consume food and drink and it forbids us to neglect them or be extravagant with them.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is recommended (mustahabb) to maintain cleanliness, which includes washing the hands. While there is no specific requirement in the Quran or Hadith to use soap, using it can enhance cleanliness by effectively removing dirt and impurities. Washing hands with soap before performing certain acts of worship, such as prayer (Salah), is considered good hygiene practice and aligns with the broader Islamic principle of cleanliness. Thus, while not obligatory, using soap when washing hands is encouraged for greater cleanliness."

Unjust prevention of marriage means preventing a woman from marrying\na compatible man of whom she approves.\nFor example, the Prophet (blessings and\npeace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage except with a\nguardian.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2085; at-Tirmidhi, 1101; Ibn Maajah, 1881, from Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi\nAnd he (blessings and peace of Allah be\nupon him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the permission of her\nguardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her\nmarriage is invalid.”\nNarrated by Ahmad, 24417; Abu Dawood, 2083; at-Tirmidhi. 1102.\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani\nin Saheeh al-Jaami‘,\n2709\nIf it is proven that marriage has been\nunjustly prevented, guardianship passes to the next closest male relative (on\nthe father’s side), such as the (paternal) grandfather, then the brother,\nbrother’s son, paternal uncle and so on. If none of these relatives are present\nor they refuse to give the woman in marriage, then she may be given in marriage\nby the Muslim judge if there is one, otherwise the imam of the mosque or a\nMuslim of similar standing may give her in marriage.\nBut if the guardian refuses to give a\ngirl in marriage to a married man who has children, this is not regarded as\nunjustly preventing marriage, because he thinks that it is not appropriate for\nher or he fears that she may suffer in this marriage, or he fears that there\nmay be problems between her and the first wife, as happens in many cases of\nplural marriage, many of which end in failure and termination of married life.\nThe guardian has to look at what is in\nthe best interests of the female relative under his guardianship. In most cases\nhe is better able than she is to let reason and wisdom prevail over emotion,\nhence Islam has given him this duty.\nAn-Nasaa’i\n(3221) narrated that Buraydah said: Abu Bakr and ‘Umar both proposed\nmarriage to Faatimah, but the Messenger of Allah\n(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “She is too young.” Then ‘Ali\nproposed to her and he gave her in marriage to him. This hadeeth\nwas classed as saheeh by al-Albaani\nin Saheeh an-Nasaa’i.\nAs-Sindi said\nin his commentary on an-Nasaa’i: The words “Then ‘Ali\nproposed to her” indicate that happened straight afterwards without any delay,\nas is indicated by the word fa (translated\nhere as “then”). Thus it is known that the Prophet (blessings and peaces of Allah be upon him) thought that she was too young\nfor them (i.e., Abu Bakr and ‘Umar)\nbut that did not apply in ‘Ali’s case. This indicates that being of the same\nage or close in age is something to be paid attention to because it is more\nlikely to lead to harmony. End quote.\nThus it is known that it is possible to\nreject a man who is of good character and religiously committed, if the\nguardian thinks that his daughter is not suitable for him in terms of age or if\nhe fears that she may suffer in the marriage, or that she may have troubles\nwith the co-wife, or he hopes that she may receive a proposal from someone who\nis more suitable for her.\nIt says in Asna’l-Mataalib\n(3/108): It says in al-Ihya’: just as it is mustahabb to marry a virgin, it is mustahabb\nnot to give one’s daughter in marriage except to a virgin who has never been\nmarried, because people usually feel more at ease with the first spouse. End\nquote.\nSo do not object to your parents if they\nreject this suitor, because they have more insight into married life than you\nand they are the keenest of people to get what is good for you. Their opinion\nis based on experience and reasoning, not emotion, and perhaps Allah will bless\nyou with something good by virtue of your obeying your parents.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the guardian (wali) has a significant role in the marriage process, particularly for women. The guardian's responsibility is to ensure that the marriage is in the best interest of the woman, considering her well-being, happiness, and future.\n\nIf a woman wishes to marry a man who is already married and has children, the guardian's refusal may be based on various factors, including concerns about the man's ability to fairly treat multiple wives, the dynamics of the blended family, and the overall welfare of the woman. It is essential for the guardian to consider whether the marriage would be beneficial and suitable for the woman in question.\n\nIn this context, the guardian's refusal to give consent is not inherently unjust; rather, it may be a protective measure depending on the circumstances. However, it is also important for the woman to express her desires and opinions, as her agency in the matter is recognized in Islamic teachings. Ideally, open communication between the woman and her guardian can help address concerns and lead to a decision that respects both the woman’s wishes and the guardian's responsibilities.\n\nUltimately, in matters of marriage, mutual respect, understanding, and consideration for the rights and wellbeing of all parties involved are essential. It may also be helpful to seek guidance from knowledgeable scholars or community leaders to mediate and provide counsel in such situations."

        "question": "Words and deeds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) before his mission began",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) before his mission began are outside of the legislative Sunnah, and that we are not required to follow him or take him as an example in that regard, except in cases where sharee’ah – after his mission began – affirmed that something was prescribed or Islamically acceptable, either by way of being obligatory or mustahabb, such as fulfilling promises, helping the destitute, honouring guests, helping people when calamity strikes and so on. In that case we are obliged to follow his example, because it became a law for us after his Prophethood began, and not just because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did it before he was a Prophet. Based on this, there are some actions that he did before his mission began that we are not obliged to follow, either because there is no proof that it is prescribed for us or because there are reports to show that it was abrogated after his mission began. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The things that happened before Prophethood are not mentioned as things to be followed or that are legislated, as is the case with his actions after Prophethood, because the Muslims are unanimously agreed that what is obligatory with regard to believing in him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and following what he brought, is that which has to do with what happened after he became the Prophet. \nHence whoever stays away from Jumu’ah prayer and prayers in congregation, and lives alone in caves and mountains, where there is no Jumu’ah or prayer in congregation, and claims to be following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) because he was used to worship alone in the cave of Hira’ before his Prophethood, thus forsaking the acts of worship that were prescribed and enjoined by Allah and His Messenger, and following the example of what he used to do before Prophethood, is wrong. That is because, after Allah honoured him with Prophethood, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) no longer did what he used to do before that, of worshipping alone in the cave of Hira and so on.  \nNone of his Sahaabah after him went to the Cave of Hira’, and they did not stay away from Jumu’ah prayer or prayers in congregation in isolated places, and none of them observed any kind of forty-day retreat, as some of the later Muslims did. Rather they worshipped Allah by means of the prescribed acts of worship that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordained for them. End quote from Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (18/10). \nWith regard to the muhaddithoon (scholars of hadeeth), they paid attention to what was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at all times, even if it was before his mission began. That is part of the Sunnah according to the definition of the muhaddithoon, who regard everything that was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as Sunnah, so they narrated it in their books on that basis. \nSee: Af’aal al-Rasool sall-Allahu ‘alayhi wa sallam wa Dalaalatuhaa ‘ala al-Ahkaam, by Dr. Muhammad al-‘Aroosi (149). \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Before the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) received the divine revelation and began his mission as a Messenger of Allah, he was known for his exemplary character and integrity. Here are some key aspects of his words and deeds during that period:\n\n1. **Al-Amin (The Trustworthy)**: The Prophet was known as \"Al-Amin\" (the Trustworthy) among his people in Mecca. He was respected for his honesty and reliability in trade and personal matters. This reputation played a significant role in his acceptance later as a prophet.\n\n2. **Reputation for Integrity**: He was well-regarded in society for his integrity and moral character. He avoided the practices of dishonesty, cheating, and deceit that were common in pre-Islamic society.\n\n3. **Disapproval of Idolatry**: Although he lived among a polytheistic society, he rejected the idolatrous practices prevalent in Mecca. He would often retreat to the Cave of Hira for contemplation and reflection, seeking truth.\n\n4. **Kindness and Compassion**: The Prophet was known for his kindness and compassion towards others, including the poor and the oppressed. He demonstrated empathy and a caring attitude in his interactions.\n\n5. **Family Values**: He was a loving family man, treating his wife Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) with great respect and affection. Their marriage was characterized by mutual respect and support.\n\n6. **Avoidance of Social Evils**: The Prophet distanced himself from the social evils of his time, including drinking alcohol and engaging in immoral behavior, which were rampant in Meccan society.\n\n7. **Reflections and Contemplation**: Muhammad (peace be upon him) often engaged in deep thoughts about the social injustices and moral decay surrounding him. His time spent in meditation was a precursor to the divine revelations he would later receive.\n\nThese aspects of his character laid the groundwork for his prophethood and served as an example for his followers. His honesty, integrity, and sense of justice made him a credible and trustworthy messenger when he began to proclaim the message of Islam after receiving revelations from Allah."

If the content is deemed inappropriate, immoral, or contrary to Islamic teachings, then it would be discouraged or prohibited.\n\n2. **Intent**: The intention behind the voice acting plays a significant role in determining its permissibility.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, or Shari'ah, Ahadeeth (plural of Hadith) are considered important sources of law and guidance. They document the sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The categories of Ahadeeth that are typically considered as Shar’i evidence include:\n\n1. **Sahih (Authentic)**: These Ahadeeth have been rigorously authenticated by scholars due to their strong chain of narration and trustworthy narrators. Examples include those found in Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim.\n\n2. **Hasan (Good)**: These Ahadeeth may have some weakness in their chain but are still considered acceptable for deriving rulings as long as the weakness is not severe.\n\n3. **Da'if (Weak)**: Generally, weak Ahadeeth are not used as a basis for legal rulings in strict terms, but there are exceptions where certain scholars allow the application of weak Ahadeeth for encouraging good deeds or in specific contexts, provided that they do not contradict stronger evidence.\n\n4. **Mutawatir (Continuous)**: These Ahadeeth have been reported by a large number of narrators at every level of transmission, making it impossible for them to be false. They carry a high degree of certainty and are considered strong evidence.\n\n5. **Ahadeeth known as Ma’qool (Logical) stories**: Some Ahadeeth convey teachings that reflect sound reason and common sense in their implications, and thus can be considered valid for establishing morality and ethical guidance.\n\n6. **Qudsi (Sacred)**: These are Ahadeeth where the Prophet Muhammad narrates the words of Allah in a way that is distinct from the Quran. They can also provide guidance and ethical teachings.\n\nIt is important to note that while Ahadeeth are a significant source of Shari'ah, they are often used in conjunction with other sources, such as the Quran, consensus (ijma'), and analogy (qiyas), to derive legal rulings. The interpretation and application of Ahadeeth must be done with a comprehensive understanding of Islamic jurisprudence by qualified scholars (Ulama)."

        "question": "Religious titles in Islam and Christianity",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The religion which Allaah has chosen is the religion of Tawheed, Islam, for which He sent the Messengers and revealed the Books. It is by His grace towards His slaves that He has preserved this religion and decreed that it will survive and continue and its basic principles will be preserved through the sincere and devout scholars who are entrusted with the Revelation and who bear that trust and deliver it as enjoined by their Lord.  \nAmong previous nations in history there has been distortion and changing of the contents of the messages of the Prophets to a great extent, because most of their scholars betrayed the trust and sold the covenant of Allaah for a small price. They were misled by their whims and desires and by the shaytaan, and they introduced into the religion things for which Allaah gave no permission. One of the most serious ways in which they distorted the message of the Prophets was by introducing the principle of al-waasitah (mediation) between Allaah and His creation, between the almighty Lord and His slaves, thus aiming to protect the thrones of the tyrants who oppressed the people thereby and held their destiny in their hands, through the body that spoke in the name of “heaven”. They invented names and titles for this organization and classified them in varying degrees and levels, where the clergyman could progress through the ranks that had been invented in the name of “the Lord” until he reached the position of acting as the deputy of “God” as the “high priest” or “pope”. \nThe English historian Wills said in his book, Milestones of Human History (3/270):  \nBut even though the fully-developed Christianity of the fourth century preserved the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels as its foundation, it was in essence a sacerdotal religion of the type that had been familiar to people for thousands of years. The altar was the focus of its elaborate rituals and the essential act of worship was the sacrifice consecrated by the priest for the Mass, and it had a structure that quickly formed, composed of the deacons, priests and bishops. End quote. \nThis body developed its authority and its method of organization from the political hierarchy of the Roman Empire as Shaykh Safar al-Hawaali said in his book al-‘Ulmaaniyyah (79): \nThe presence of priests and monks within the Roman Empire helped to support their position and reinforce it, because they copied from the political system and hierarchy of the state the idea of creating a priestly system and hierarchy. Just as the state system resembled a pyramid with the emperor at the top and the troops at the bottom, the church system also resembled a pyramid, with the pope at the top and the priests at the bottom. As a result of the principle of separating church and state, the empire took care of sponsoring the church hierarchy, and did not find anything in it that contradicted or opposed the state hierarchy. Thus it was settled and became strong. End quote. \nBut in the sharee’ah of Islam that was divinely protected, you do not find the kind of class system that could reinforce tyranny and oppression, and you can only find texts which speak of equality among all people and state that the best of them are those who are most pious and closest to Allaah and who follow His laws most closely. \nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At‑Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]”\n[al-Hujuraat 49:13] \n“And for all, there will be degrees according to that which they did, that He (Allaah) may recompense them in full for their deeds. And they will not be wronged”\n[al-Ahqaaf 46:19]\nHence the essence of Islamic sharee’ah is based on cancelling out the mediation of bandits who come between the people and Allaah in the name of “mediation” or “intercession”. Islam attributes this attitude to the mushrikeen who fought the message of Tawheed, of whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And they worship besides Allaah things that harm them not, nor profit them, and they say: ‘These are our intercessors with Allaah.’ Say: ‘Do you inform Allaah of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?’ Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they associate as partners (with Him)!”\n[Yoonus 10:18]\nThe guided French scholar Naasir al-Deen Dinet said: \nThe issue of mediation was one of the major issues in which Islam superseded all other religions, because there is no intermediary between Allaah and His slave. There are no priests or monks in Islam; these intermediaries are the cause of all evil in other religions and that is indeed the case no matter what their beliefs and no matter how sincere they are and how good their intentions. The Messiah himself understood that. Did he not drive the sellers out of the temple? But his followers do not act as he did, and today if Jesus were to return how many like the sellers in the temple would he drive out?  End quote from al-‘Ulmaaniyyah (p. 81). \nAs for the status of the fuqaha’ and scholars in Islam, it is purely academic, i.e., whether a person has enough knowledge to qualify him to talk about religion is based on his studies and academic qualifications and what he has learned from universities, study circles and books. It has nothing to do with any religious hierarchical body or priestly rituals that give them authority in the name of the Lord. Rather it is a level of specialized knowledge – as in any other field of knowledge studied by specialists. They may be correct or incorrect, and they are subject to criticism on the basis of evidence. None of them has any authority or power to declare things halaal or haraam, or to issue commands and prohibitions, except the Lord of the Worlds. They are no more than conveyors of His laws, and teachers who tell the people of what was revealed from the Lord of the Worlds. Moreover, as we have pointed out, they are not infallible in their understanding of the message brought by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or in the way they preserve it and convey it. Rather the infallible ruling, which Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it (cf. Fussilat 41:42), and which is to be referred to in the case of a dispute, is the Revelation of Allaah, may He be exalted: His Holy Book and what is narrated in saheeh reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then that on which there is consensus among the ummah, for his ummah cannot agree on misguidance. \nThe titles and names that the scholars bestow on some of them, or that the people bestow on them, are only referring to the level of knowledge that a person acquires of the rulings of sharee’ah. There may also be a kind of distinguishing the type of knowledge in which a person has specialized, such as faqeeh and mufti for those who have specialized in fiqh and issuing fatwas, respectively, or mufassir for the one who has specialized in tafseer or commentary on the Book of Allaah, or muhaddith and hafiz for those who have specialized in the study of hadeeth. \nThe scholar may also be given titles of praise for his vast knowledge and learning, such as Shaykh al-Islam or ‘Allaamah or Imam and other such titles which ascribe knowledge and learning to those who are entitled to them. In no way are they meant as indicators of priestly status that has been earned in a gradual manner through stages of devotion and monasticism.  \nEven describing the academic level by using these titles is not something precise, such that the one who reaches a certain level will be called by a different name than someone who has reached a lower level. Rather they are relative descriptions and do not refer to precise distinctions between one level and another, and they are not indicative of different levels of knowledge, rather they point to general praise or particular specializations. \nThere is no precise difference between the titles of imam, ‘aalim and Shaykh and it is not permissible for anyone to understand their usage in books or by scholars in terms of the innovations of other nations with regard to clergymen and priests. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",

        "question": "Our attitude towards the differences of opinion among the imams with regard to covering the face",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nAt the time of the Revelation, the Muslims learned the rulings of Islam from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) through the verses of the Holy Qur’aan and the ahaadeeth of his Sunnah. Hence there were no differences of opinion among them except with regard to some minor issues. If that happened, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would explain to them what was correct. \nWhen the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died and the Sahaabah spread out to various regions to teach the people Islam, there appeared some differences with regard to some matters of fiqh which arose at different times and in different places. These differences were due to a number of reasons, which we will sum up here from the words of the scholars: \n1-The evidence had not reached the one who held a different opinion, and he made a mistake in forming his opinion.\n2-The hadeeth had reached the scholar, but he did not regard the transmitter as trustworthy, and he thought that it went against something that was stronger, so he followed that which he thought was stronger than it.\n3-The hadeeth had reached him but he forgot it.\n4-The hadeeth had reached him but he understood it in a way other than the intended meaning.\n5-The hadeeth reached him but it was abrogated, and he did not know the abrogating text.\n6-He thought that it contradicted something that was stronger than it, whether that was a text or scholarly consensus (ijmaa’)\n7-The scholar used a weak hadeeth as the basis for his ruling, or he derived the ruling by means of weak arguments.\nFor a detailed discussion of these reasons and others, see  Raf’ al-Malaam ‘an al-A’immati’l-A’laam by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, and al-Khilaaf bayna al-‘Ulama’: Asbaabuhu wa Mawqifuna minhu by Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen. \nWe think that what we have mentioned about the reasons for differences among the scholars i.e., with regard to matters of fiqh, will be clear to you, in sha Allaah. \nSecondly: \nWhat should the Muslim’s attitude be towards differences that arise between the scholars? In other words, which scholarly opinion should the Muslim follow in matters where they differed? The answer depends: \n1 – If the Muslim is one who has studied shar’i knowledge and learned its basic principles and minor issues, and he can distinguish right from wrong with regard to scholarly views, then he has to follow that which he thinks is correct and ignore that which he thinks is wrong. \n2 – If he is one of the rank and file, or has not studied shar’i knowledge, and thus cannot distinguish between right and wrong with regard to scholarly views, then he must follow the fatwa of a scholar whose knowledge he trusts and who he believes to be trustworthy and religiously committed, whether he is from his own country or another country, and differences between scholars will not matter after that. He does not have to change what he is doing because he hears another scholar issuing a fatwa that differs from the one he is following, unless he realizes that what he learned later on is the correct view, on the basis of his confidence in the religious commitment and knowledge of the second Shaykh. \nShaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nThe one who has knowledge of evidence is required to follow the evidence, even if it goes against some of the imams, if it does not go against the consensus of the ummah. \nThe one who does not have any knowledge should ask the scholars, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  “So ask  of those who know the Scripture, if you know not” [al-Nahl 16:43]. He should ask one who he thinks has more knowledge and is more religiously committed, but that does not mean that doing so obligatory, because the one who is better may make a mistake with regard to a particular issue, and the one who is regarded as less knowledgeable may be right with regard to it. But priority should be given to following the one who is more knowledgeable and more religiously committed. \nSee also the answers to questions no. 8294 and 10645. \nThirdly: \nIf you ask about our view on the issue of covering the face, the most correct scholarly view in our opinion is that it is obligatory to cover the face in front of non-mahram men. There is a great deal of evidence and scholarly views concerning that, as among the Maalikis. Many of them said that it is not permissible for a woman to uncover her face in front of non-mahram men, not because it is ‘awrah but because uncovering it runs the risk of fitnah. But some of them think that it is ‘awrah. Hence women, in their view, are forbidden to go out in front of non-mahram men with their faces uncovered. \nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen”\n[al-Ahzaab 33:53]\nal-Qaadi Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maaliki (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nThe entire woman is ‘awrah, her body and her voice, so it is not permissible to uncover that except in cases of necessity, such as when testimony is given against her, or medical treatment, or asking her about her health issues. End quote. \nAhkaam al-Qur’aan by Ibn al-‘Arabi (3/1578, 1579). \nAl-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him), who is also Maaliki, said: \nThis verse indicates that Allaah has given permission to ask of them from behind a screen if there is some need, or when they ask a question about something. That includes all women. Because it is a basic shar’i principle that the entire woman is ‘awrah, her body and her voice – as stated above –it is not permissible to uncover that except in cases of necessity such as when testimony is given against her, or medical treatment, or asking her about her health issues. End quote. \nIn al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam al-Qur’aan (14/227) it says: \nFor more information on the views of Maaliki fuqaha’ concerning the obligation for women to cover their faces, see: al-Ma’yaar al-Mu’arrab by al-Wanshireesi (10/165 and 11/226 and 229), Mawaahib al-Jaleel by al-Hattaab (3/141), al-Dhakheerah by al-Quraafi (3/307) and Haashiyat al-Dasooqi ‘ala al-Sharh al-Kabeer (2/55). \nWe have discussed this issue and its evidence in more than one answer on this site. Please see the answers to questions no. 11774, 12525, 13998, 21134 and 21536. \nFourthly: \nWith regard to what you mention about the laws in your country forbidding women to cover their faces, that is something that makes us feel very sad, to hear that covering and chastity are being opposed and wanton display and unveiling are being encouraged everywhere, especially when that happens in a country that is supposed to be Muslim. \nIf the laws forbid women to cover, and you fear persecution because of covering your faces, then there is no sin on you if you do not do it in that case, so long as that is based on necessity. So a woman should not go out of her house with her face uncovered except in cases of necessity. If she can break the law and put up with a little bit of hassle, let her do so for there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. \nSee also the answer to question no. 2198 and 45672. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, differences of opinion among scholars (ulama) are often referred to as \"ikhtilaf.\" Such differences can arise from varying interpretations of the Qur'an and Sunnah, contextual understanding, and the methodologies used in deriving rulings. When it comes to the issue of covering the face (niqab), there are differing opinions among the scholars of various schools of thought.\n\n1. **Hanafi School:** Generally, the Hanafi school considers the face to be part of the body that does not require covering in front of non-mahram men, though it is still recommended to dress modestly.\n\n2. **Maliki School:** The Maliki scholars typically hold that covering the face is not obligatory, but it is permissible and preferred in certain circumstances.\n\n3. **Shafi'i School:** The Shafi'i school considers the face and hands to be 'awrah (parts of the body that should be covered) but allows for some flexibility based on context.\n\n4. **Hanbali School:** The Hanbali school tends to be more inclined towards the view that covering the face is obligatory, especially in situations where modesty could be compromised.\n\nWhen engaging with these differences, it is essential to foster an attitude of respect and understanding. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n- **Respect for Opinions:** Acknowledge the sincerity of scholars who have arrived at their conclusions based on their understanding of the texts and the context of their time.\n\n- **Contextual Understanding:** Recognize that cultural and societal contexts can influence these rulings and that some practices may be more suitable in specific environments than others.\n\n- **Unity and Brotherhood:** Strive to maintain unity among the Muslim community despite differences. Acknowledge that differing opinions exist within the broader framework of Islamic scholarship, and these differences can enrich the diversity of thought within the ummah.\n\n- **Personal Choice:** Ultimately, it is important for individuals to seek knowledge, understand the different viewpoints, and follow what they believe is most correct while considering their own context and circumstances.\n\n- **Seek Knowledge:** Encourage individuals to consult knowledgeable scholars and engage in sincere study to make informed decisions based on their beliefs and circumstances.\n\nUltimately, the approach to differences of opinion regarding covering the face should be characterized by mutual respect, a commitment to the values of Islam, and an understanding that differing opinions can coexist within the framework of Islamic teachings."
