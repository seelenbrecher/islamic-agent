        "question": "Do You Get Reward for Listening to the Quran Without Understanding It?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The command to listen to the Quran attentively \nAllah, may He be exalted, has commanded the believers to listen to the Quran attentively , in a general command. He says (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy.” [Al-A`raf 7:204] \nShaykh As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“This command is general and includes everyone who hears the Book of Allah being recited. He is enjoined to listen to it and keep quiet. The difference between listening and keeping quiet is that keeping quiet is done outwardly by not speaking or being distracted with anything that would keep one from focusing on listening to it. \nAs for listening to it, this means that one hears it with an attentive heart, pondering the meaning of what one is listening to. The one who adheres to these two commands when the Book of Allah is recited will attain a great deal of good, beneficial knowledge, ongoing and renewed faith, increased guidance and insight into his religion. Hence Allah connected the attainment of mercy to them, which indicates that the one who does not keep quiet and listen attentively when the Book is recited to him will be deprived of the share of mercy and has missed out on a great deal of good. \nThe most emphatic command with regard to listening to the Quran attentively has to do with prayers in which Quran is recited out loud by the imam , in which one is enjoined to listen attentively, to such an extent that most of the scholars say that his focusing on keeping quiet and listening attentively takes priority over his reciting Al-Fatihah etc.” (Tafsir As-Sa`di, 314) \nThe greater aim of keeping quiet and listening attentively is so that the listener may ponder and understand the meanings, and act upon them. \nImam At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“Allah says to those who believe in Him and in His Book, for whom the Quran is guidance and mercy: “So, when the Quran is recited”, to you, O believers; “listen to it”, i.e. lend your ears so that you might understand its verses and learn from its exhortation; “and be silent” and listen to it attentively, so that you might understand and ponder, and do not utter idle talk during it lest you do not understand; “that you may receive mercy” i.e., that you might receive the mercy of your Lord by heeding His exhortation and adhering to His limits and to what He enjoins upon you in the verses.” (Tafsir At-Tabari, 13/244) \nIf a person manages to achieve that, i.e., keeping quiet, listening attentively, pondering what is recited to him and understanding its meanings, that will bring him goodness in this world and the Hereafter. \nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“By means of this listening, Allah guides His slaves and sets straight their affairs in this world and the Hereafter; with this the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent, and he enjoined it upon the Muhajirin and Ansar and those who followed them in truth. The early generations used to gather for this purpose. When the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gathered together, they would tell one of their number to recite whilst they listened. `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) would say to Abu Musa: Remind us of our Lord, and Abu Musa would recite the Quran whilst they listened.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 11/626) \nDo you get reward for listening to Quran without understanding it?\nAs listening in the complete sense is that in which one understands and ponders, there is no doubt that the one who does that as much as he is able is to be commended for what he does, and he is excused for what he is incapable of. But what one is incapable of should not be an excuse for not doing what one is able to do of goodness. What is possible is not to be omitted because of what is difficult; in other words, whatever a person is able to do of obligatory or recommended actions is not waived because of what he is incapable of doing, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can” [At-Taghabun 64:16]  \nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: \nWill a person be rewarded if he reads the Quran, even if he does not understand its meanings? \nHe replied: \n“The Glorious Quran is blessed, as Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.” [Sad 38:29] \nSo man is enjoined to read it, whether he understands its meanings or not. But the believer who is enjoined to act upon it should not read the Quran without understanding its meanings. If a person wants to learn medicine, for example, and studies the books of medicine, he cannot benefit from them unless he understands their meanings and they are explained to him; in fact he will be very keen to understand the meanings so that he can apply them. So why do you think anyone should read the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, which is a healing for what is in the hearts and exhortation to people, without pondering and without understanding its meanings? For this reason the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) would not move on from ten verses until they had learned them and learned the knowledge they contained and how to act upon it. So they learned the Quran and knowledge and action all together. \nA person will be rewarded for reading the Quran whether he understands its meanings or not, but he should be very keen to understand its meanings and to learn these meanings from scholars who are trustworthy in their knowledge. If he has no access to a scholar who can teach him the meanings, he may refer to the trustworthy books of Tafsir, such as Tafsir Ibn Jarir, Tafsir Ibn Kathir and others which pay attention to the Tafsir that is based on reports narrated from the Companions and the Successors (may Allah be pleased with them).” (Fatawa Nur `ala Ad-Darb) \nFor more details, please see the following answers: 106961 , 50010 , 124657 , 78370 , 174743 , 10672 , and 147164 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, listening to the Quran is considered a meritorious act, regardless of whether one understands the meanings or not. The Quran is viewed as the word of Allah, and engaging with it, whether through recitation or listening, is beneficial for one's spirituality.\n\nWhile understanding the meanings of the Quran certainly enhances the experience and allows for deeper reflection and guidance, simply listening to it can still bring rewards. Many scholars emphasize that any form of connection to the Quran can lead to blessings and spiritual benefits.\n\nUltimately, the intention behind listening—seeking closeness to Allah and enhancing one’s spiritual state—holds significant weight in determining the rewards one may receive."

        "question": "Can repeating a certain portion of the Quran for a time equivalent to completing the entire Quran be regarded as a khatm?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: We congratulate you on what you are doing of good by constantly reciting Quran, and you should carry on with that, because the religious texts speak of the great virtue of doing that.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites a letter of the Book of Allah will have one good deed recorded for him, and the good deed brings a tenfold reward. I do not say that alif-lam-mim is a letter; rather alif is a letter, lam is a letter and mim is a letter.” At-Tirmidhi (2910); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nThis reward is attained by everyone who reads or recites any surah of the Quran, whether he recites it as part of a khatm in the correct order, or in his prayer, or in any kind of recitation, without paying attention to any particular khatm.\nBut repeating what you have memorized from al-Baqarah to al-An‘am is not regarded as a real khatm of the Quran, even though you will attain reward for reciting Quran. So strive to recite what you recite well from memory, then complete the rest by reading from the Mushaf.\nThe practice of the early generations (the salaf) was to complete the entire Quran, then go back to the beginning and start again, and so on.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is disliked (makruh) to take too long in completing the Quran and to take more than forty days to complete it.\nAhmad said: What I mostly heard is that the Quran should be completed within forty days.\nThat is because taking longer than that will lead to forgetting the Quran and becoming negligent about it. Therefore what we have mentioned is more appropriate.\nThis applies if there is no excuse. If there is an excuse, then the matter is flexible.  End quote from al-Mughni (2/611).\nSecondly: you should understand that the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He has told us the timeframe for completing the Quran, and one should not go beyond that.\nIt was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Read the Quran in a month.” I said: I can do more than that… Until he said: “Read it in seven days, and do not do more than that.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (4767).\nHe also forbade them to complete it in less than three days. It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who reads the Quran in less than three days will not understand it.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (1394); classed as sahih by al-Albani.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the longest timeframe for completing the Quran?\nHe replied: There is no set timeframe for that, and the best one can do in that regard is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained to ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As when he asked him about how to read the Quran. ‘Abdullah told him that he completed the Quran every day and fasted all the time, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to fast and not fast, and to sleep and pray qiyam, and to complete the Quran every month. He said: “Your own self has a right over you, your wife has a right over you, and your guest has a right over you, so give each of them his or her due.” ‘Abdullah asked for more, and in the end, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to read it in a week, as he said: “Read it every week,” meaning every seven days.\nSo the best timeframe to complete the Quran is seven days, and if a person takes longer to do it, there is nothing wrong with that. So it may be completed in a month, or in twenty days, or more than that. The minimum time frame for completing it is three days, as it says in the hadith “The one who reads the Quran in less than three days will not understand it,” or however the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it. End quote from the Shaykh’s website.\nWe have previously given a detailed answer regarding this matter; please see question no. 156299.\nThirdly:\nCompleting 8 juz’ in an hour and a half means that each juz’ is completed in 11 minutes, which is a very short time to recite an entire juz’ of the Quran. It is barely possible for a person to recite in a proper manner in this time, and to recite it as it should be recited, let alone understand what he is reciting and reflect on it.\nThe early generations disallowed reciting Quran quickly, if that will lead to mispronouncing the words or will not give any opportunity for reflection. It was narrated that Ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Do not recite the Quran rapidly as you recite poetry, and do not utter its words carelessly in the manner of handling poor quality dates. Rather, pause to reflect on its wonders and let your heart be moved by it. The main focus of one of you should not be merely to reach the end of the surah. Al-Bayhaqi: Shu‘ab al-Iman (1883).\nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: There was a time in our lives when one of us would learn about faith before learning about the Quran, and a surah would be revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he would learn what it permitted and what it prohibited, and where one should pause to reflect and understand, as you learn the Quran. Then he said: I have seen some men, one of whom starts to recite Quran, and he recites it from al-Fatihah to the end without realising what it enjoins and what it prohibits, or where he should pause and reflect, and the way in which he recites it is (careless) like one who is handling poor quality dates. Narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (1/35); he said: It is a sahih hadith according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim, and I am not aware of any problem with the hadith. And adh-Dhahabi agreed with him.\nReciting the Quran with speed is described by the scholars as qira’at al-hadr.\nOne of the conditions of qira’at al-hadr is that it should not lead to mispronunciation. Qira’at al-hadr means reciting one word after another in rapid succession, whilst paying attention to grammar and the correct pronunciation, and pronouncing the letters clearly. See: al-Itqan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran (1/345).\nReciting a juz’ in ten minutes does not allow one to pronounce words correctly or pay attention to grammar; rather it is reciting at such speed that it is not possible to follow the meaning.\nWhat was narrated from ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), that he recited the entire Quran in a rak‘ah, is not a precedent to be followed by others; rather it is something unique to ‘Uthman. We are not like him, and what he was enabled to do is something that we cannot be enabled to do. If it is said that this is a karamah (miracle or extraordinary feat) with which he was honoured, that would not be far-fetched, but most of the Sahabah used to recite the Quran in seven days.\nAl-Hafiz al-‘Iraqi said: The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to complete the Quran every seven days… Among those who completed it every seven days were: Tamim ad-Dari, ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Yazid, Ibrahim an-Nakha‘i, ‘Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, Abu Mijlaz, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and the wife of Ibn Mas‘ud. Masruq regarded that as something good. Among those who would complete it in eight days were Ubay and Abu Qilabah. Among those who would complete it in six days was al-Aswad ibn Yazid. Among those who would complete it in five days was ‘Ilqimah ibn Qays. Among those who would complete it in three days was Ibn Mas‘ud. And he said that the one who recites it in less than three days is reciting at speed. End quote from Tarh at-Tathrib fi Sharh at-Taqrib (3/102).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, a \"khatm\" refers to the completion of reciting the entire Quran. The term is derived from the Arabic word that means \"to complete\" or \"to conclude.\" To achieve a traditional khatm, one must recite the entire Quran from start to finish.\n\nRepeating a certain portion of the Quran (such as a specific surah or set of verses) for a time equivalent to the duration it would take to complete the entire Quran does not count as a khatm in the conventional understanding. While repetition of specific portions can carry its own merits and rewards, it does not substitute for the complete recitation of the Quran as a whole.\n\nThat said, engaging in the recitation of portions of the Quran, seeking their understanding, and reflecting on their meanings is highly encouraged and commendable in Islam. Each individual effort towards the Quran's recitation is valued, and one is encouraged to recite at their own pace. However, if one is seeking the spiritual reward associated with a khatm, it would be important to complete the entire Quran."

        "question": "Miraculous Language of the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Noble Quran is a sign from Allah, the Exalted and Praised, and Allah has placed within it many signs of truth. Among the signs of its truthfulness and proofs that it is from Allah, the Exalted, are the unique phonetic properties not found in any other text. Indeed, the Quran contains phonetic styles that are unmatched elsewhere.\nDr. Muhammad Daraz says, \"Let the proficient reciter read the Quran; recite it properly, descending upon the inclination of the Quran, and not imposing his own inclinations upon it. Then distance yourself from him to a remote place where you do not hear the ringing of its letters, but you hear its movements and stillness, its elongations and melodies, its connections and pauses, then lend your ear to this phonetic collection, made exclusive and released plainly into the air. You will find yourself facing a strange and wonderful melody; you will not find it in any other speech even if it were rendered exclusive and refined in this manner.\nYou will find a harmony and unity that captivates your hearing as music and poetry do, yet it is not the tunes of music, nor the patterns of rhythm of poetry, and you will find something else that you do not find in music or poetry. That is because you listen to a poem and find its rhythm unified line by line, and part by part, and you listen to a piece of music and find its moods similar and going in a close direction; so your hearing soon rejects it, and your nature tires of it, if it is repeated and recited to you with one signature.\nWhereas with the Quran, you are always in a varied and renewed melody, moving between causes and pegs and pauses in different positions, each string of your heart's chords taking an equal share, so that no matter how often it is repeated, it does not bring you boredom or weariness, but you constantly seek more of it,\" End quote.\n\"An-Naba' Al-Adhim\" (p. 133 - 134).\nHe also mentioned the beauty of the articulation points of the letters, saying, \"If you bring your ear a little closer, the jewels of its letters coming out from their correct articulation points will strike your hearing, surprising you with another pleasure in the arrangement of those letters and their lining up, and the ordering of their positions among themselves; this one taps and that one whistles, a third whispers and a fourth declares loudly, another lets the breath slide over it, and another holds the breath. And so on, you see the linguistic beauty manifest before you in a different yet harmonious collection, without rattling or babbling, without softness or harshness, without discord or repulsion.\nThus, you see speech that is neither the bland urban nor the rough Bedouin, but you see it having blended within it the robustness and grandeur of the desert with the delicacy and fluidity of the city, and the matter is measured in such a way that neither exceeds the other. It is as if it is the essence of the two languages, and their progeny, or as if it is the point of contact between the tribes, where their tastes meet, and upon it their hearts agree,\" End quote.\n\"An-Naba' Al-Adhim\" (p. 135).\nSecondly:\nThere is a correlation between the parts of the Noble Quran, which scholars refer to as the coherence between the verses and Surahs. This coherence may be between one Surah and another, between the beginning of a Surah and the one following it, between the verses of a single Surah, and between the beginning and end of a Surah.\n\"And there is not a Surah except that it has its own (landmarks) that distinguish it, whether they are short or long Surahs, and the shorter the Surahs, the greater this characteristic becomes. This is clear from the fact that Allah, the Exalted, did not make the short Surahs a single independent Surah except for a great wisdom, which is the independence of each one of them with what distinguishes it from others.\"\nSee: \"Misbah Ad-Durar fi Tanasub Ayat Al-Quran Al-Karim wa As-Suwar\" (p. 93).\nThere is also a close proximity between the topics of the Surahs and their objectives, as each Surah of the Quran has a purpose and goal, that is, a significance to which the meanings of the Surah and its content return, and represents its spirit that flows through all its parts.\nThe objective may be the same as the topic of the Surah, or the objective may differ from the topic, in that a single Surah may have a number of topics, and these topics return to one objective.\nKnowing the topics of the Surah and its objective is one of the most important aids to contemplating the Surah and realizing its miraculous nature, because you find that despite the different topics of the Surah, it leads to one goal in a harmony that compels the observer to deem it impossible for this speech to be of human origin.\nThe search for the topics of the Surah and its objective requires certain matters:\nThe most important of which are: understanding the meanings of the Surah, realizing the appropriateness between the verses, and realizing the appropriateness between the Surah and what precedes and follows it. All this makes the reader of the Quran more attentive to what he recites and more present in understanding it.\nAmong the important books in this field are:\n1- Asma' Suwar Al-Quran wa Fada'iliha, Dr. Munirah Al-Dosari, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi, it is an important book in its field.\n2- An-Naba' Al-Adhim, Dr. Muhammad Daraz, Tafakkur Center.\n3- Muhtawayah Suwar Al-Quran Al-Karim, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Taweel, Dar Al-Watan.\n4- Dalail An-Nizam, by the teacher Abdul Hamid Al-Farahi.\n5- Al-Burhan fi Tanasub Surah Al-Quran, by Imam Ibn Zubair Al-Gharnati, Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi.\n6- At-Tanasub bayna As-Suwar fi Al-Muftatah wa Al-Khawatim, Dr. Fadil Al-Samarrai, Dar Ibn Kathir.\nAnd among the Tafsirs that have taken care of highlighting these aspects are:\n1- Nazm Al-Durar fi Tanasub Al-Ayat wa As-Suwar, by Imam Al-Biqa`i.\n2- At-Tahrir wa At-Tanwir, by Imam Al-Tahir Ibn Ashur.\n3- Masu`at At-Tafsir Al-Mawdu`i, University of Sharjah.\nAnd see: \"Ad-Dalil ila Al-Quran,\" Amr Al-Sharqawi (p. 78).\nThirdly:\nWe have not been able to personally examine the details of the attempts mentioned in the question, nor have we seen anything of them.\nHowever, we mention here some general methodological alerts, which we summarize as follows:\n1- One should not force oneself to research the characteristics of letters and their connection to the word and then the position of this word in the sentence, because this may obscure the main purpose of the Quran, which is to be a book of guidance.\n2- It must be known that this is merely one of the delicacies of the Quran, and its seasoning, and not from the solid knowledge, nor from the general objectives of the Noble Quran, nor the central meanings it brought; rather, it is closer to being, if correct, from the superficial layer as the scholar (Daraz) expresses.\n3- Writing in such a field, and the possibility of contributing one's own insights, requires special knowledge and tools; the most important of which are specialization in phonetic studies and related sciences, then proficiency in the sciences of Arabic morphology and rhetoric; and such is not attainable by everyone, so the matter should be put in its proper place, and one should not undertake what one has no knowledge of, nor should one pretend to be an expert in a field for which the tools of research and examination are not complete, even if one's tools of research and examination were complete.\n4- If something of this is established for a person, there is no harm in speaking of it, but as his own ijtihad, which should be presented to the solid knowledge, its essence, and its core; and one should not exaggerate in this so that it is said to be from the \"miraculous nature,\" lest the Word of Allah and its miraculous nature be exposed to speculation and debate, as has happened with those concerned with examining aspects of the \"scientific miracles\" of the Noble Quran; and indeed, both extremes in intending matters are reprehensible!!\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The term \"Miraculous Language of the Quran\" refers to the unique and unmatched linguistic qualities of the Quran, which Muslims believe to be the literal word of God (Allah) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). There are several aspects that highlight the miraculous nature of the Quran's language:\n\n1. **Inimitability (I'jaz)**: One of the most prominent features of the Quran is its inimitable nature. It challenges humanity to produce a verse or chapter like it and claims that none can do so. This challenge emphasizes the Quran's unmatched eloquence, style, and depth of meaning.\n\n2. **Eloquent Style**: The Quran is known for its rich and eloquent language, which combines both prose and poetry. Its rhythm, rhyme, and flow are considered to be of extraordinary quality, making it unique in its literary form.\n\n3. **Depth of Meaning**: The Quran conveys profound spiritual, moral, and philosophical concepts. Its language possesses layers of meaning, often allowing for various interpretations that resonate with different audiences across time and cultures.\n\n4. **Use of Metaphor and Imagery**: The Quran employs metaphor and imagery effectively to convey complex ideas and emotions, making it relatable and impactful for its readers.\n\n5. **Preservation**: The Quran has been preserved in its original language, Arabic, since its revelation over 1,400 years ago. This preservation contributes to its authenticity and the ability of future generations to experience its linguistic miracle.\n\n6. **Impact on the Arabic Language**: The Quran has significantly influenced the Arabic language, enriching it with vocabulary and expressions. It is considered a benchmark for classical Arabic and has shaped literary and linguistic standards.\n\nMuslims believe that the Quran's miraculous language and style serve as a testament to its divine origin, setting it apart from any human-made text. The Quran is thus seen as both a religious scripture and a literary masterpiece."

        "question": "Quranic Challenge to the Jinn",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Quran is the Speech of Allah, spoken by Him with His letters and meanings, as He, the Exalted, said (translation of the meaning): {And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the Words of Allāh [i.e., the Quran]. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.} (At-Tawbah:6).\nIn the Quran, there are statements of various peoples that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has mentioned, including the believers like the prophets and the truthful, and the disbelievers, like Pharaoh and Qarun, and the hypocrites, as well as the angels, the jinn, the birds like the hoopoe, the ants, and others.\nThe purpose of mentioning these statements is to convey the meaning and not necessarily the exact wording. Sometimes the conveyed message is the exact wording, and sometimes it is the meaning, especially if it is impossible for it to be the exact wording, such as when the speaker is not speaking in Arabic. This has been explicitly stated by more than one of the scholars:\nZain Ad-Din Ar-Razi Al-Hanafi said in \"Questions and Answers on the Oddities of the Verses of Revelation\" (p. 144): \"If it is asked: How did Allah, the Exalted, narrate here the speech of the sorcerers who believed and of Pharaoh (translation of the meaning): {They said, 'We believe in the Lord of the worlds'} to the saying of Allah: {And cause us to die as Muslims}, then narrated this meaning in Surah Taha and Surah Ash-Shu`ara with additions and omissions in the words attributed to them, when this event only occurred once, so how did their expression differ in it?\nWe say: The answer to this is that they spoke in their language, not in Arabic, and Allah, the Exalted, narrated that from them in Arabic several times, for a wisdom that necessitated repetition and reiteration, which we will explain in Surah Ash-Shu`ara, Allah willing. So, at one time He narrated it matching their wording in the translation, taking care of the wording, and after that, He narrated it by meaning, following the custom of the Arabs in varying speech and differing in their styles; so as not to bore if it was merely repetitive.\" End quote.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in \"At-Tis`iniyyah\" (2/464): \"Indeed, the letters and sounds that Moses heard were Hebrew, and those that Allah mentioned about him in the Quran were Arabic. If speech were merely letters and sounds, there would be no commonality at all between the speech that Moses heard and that which Allah mentioned that he heard. Thus, reporting that he heard these sounds, which he did not hear, would be a lie.\nLikewise, all those whom Allah narrated in the Quran that they spoke from the previous nations who spoke languages other than Arabic, they spoke in their languages, and Allah narrated that in the language in which the Quran was revealed, which is Arabic. And the Speech of Allah is truth. If their speech was just letters and sounds, and the letters and sounds they said are not like these, then it would not be possible to narrate from them at all. Rather, their speech was letters and meanings, so Allah narrated that from them in another language, and the letters follow the meanings, and the meanings are the main intended purpose, as the speech of all creatures is translated.\" End quote.\nAt-Tahir said: \"The meaning of the statement here is: to convey their intention to those they want to reach among their kind, in the manner in which they understand each other,\" At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (29/220).\nAnd he said: \"This is narrated from the speech of the jinn,\" At-Tahrir wat-Tanwir (29/222).\nIn summary, what this ignorant objector mentioned only demonstrates his ignorance, narrow-mindedness, and poor understanding.\nIf Allah's narration of the speech of the jinn or humans, whether believers or disbelievers, in His Book, meant that those whom Allah narrated from them said \"Quran,\" then that would mean that all these humans, and the jinn, had brought forth a Quran from themselves, and then Allah transmitted this Quran in \"His Quran\"; then He challenged them to produce something like it.\nThis could not be from the weakest of people in intellect; rather, it is only imagined and found problematic by someone who is ignorant, who does not know the places of argument, and the aspects of speech.\nAnd it is astonishing that anyone would believe such nonsense, be disturbed by it, and think there is a real problem!!\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Quranic challenge to the jinn is addressed in several verses, particularly in Surah Al-Jinn (Chapter 72) and Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2, Verse 23). In these verses, Allah challenges both humans and jinn to produce something similar to the Quran if they doubt its divine origin.\n\nFor example, in Surah Al-Baqarah, Allah says:\n\n**\"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to Our Servant (Muhammad), then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses besides Allah, if you should be among the truthful.\"** (Quran 2:23)\n\nThis challenge invites anyone, including the jinn, to attempt to replicate the literary, linguistic, and spiritual qualities of the Quran, which is considered inimitable (known as the concept of \"I'jaz al-Quran\"). \n\nThe significance of this challenge lies in its assertion of the Quran's status as the miraculous word of God, emphasizing that no one, whether human or jinn, has been able to successfully meet this challenge, thereby affirming the Quran's unique nature and divine source.\n\nIn Surah Al-Jinn, the jinn express their acknowledgment of the Quran’s authority and the message brought by the Prophet Muhammad, showing that even they recognize its divine origin:\n\n**\"And we have sought to reach the heaven; but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames.\"** (Quran 72:8)\n\nThis indicates that the Quran and its message are of profound significance, not just for humans, but for all of creation, including the jinn."

        "question": "Belief of the Salaf Concerning the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The belief of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) concerning the Quran is like their belief in all the Names and Attributes of Allah, which is a belief that is based on what is indicated by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah (traditions) of His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him). \nWe all know that Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, has described the Quran as being His Word and that it was sent down from Him. Allah, may He be Sxalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And if any of the polytheists seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allah (the Quran), and then escort him to where he can be secure.” [At-Tawbah 9:6]\nUndoubtedly what is meant by the Word of Allah here is the Noble Quran .\nAnd He, may He be exalted, says:\n“Verily, this Quran narrates to the Children of Israel most of that about which they differ.” [An-Naml 27:76]\nSo the Quran is the Word of Allah in both wording and meaning. Allah spoke it in a real sense and gave it to Jibril (peace be upon him) the trustworthy, then Jibril brought it down to the heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that he might be one of the warners, in a plain Arabic tongue. \nThe Salaf believe that the Quran was revealed ; Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, revealed it to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) piecemeal, i.e., bit by bit, over twenty-three years, in accordance with the Wisdom of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted. \nMoreover, some of the revelation was revealed for a specific reason for which it was sent down, and some of it was revealed without a specific reason. Moreover, some of it was revealed to tell of something that happened to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions. Some of it was revealed concerning Shar`i (legal) rulings, according to what the scholars have said concerning this matter. \nThen the Salaf say that the Quran is from Allah in the first place and it will return (to Him) at the end of time. This is the view of the Salaf concerning the Noble Quran. \nIt is clear to us that Allah has described the Noble Quran in superlative terms. He has described it as wise (Hakim), noble (Karim), great (`Adhim), and glorious (Majid). \nThese qualities, in terms of which Allah has described His Book, may be attainable by one who adheres to this Book and acts upon it both inwardly and outwardly. Allah will give him some share of glory, greatness, wisdom, honour and authority that is not given to the one who does not adhere to the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted. \nHence I call all Muslims, rulers and ruled, scholars and ordinary folk, to adhere to the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, both inwardly and outwardly, so that they may attain honour, happiness and glory, and prevail in the east and in the west.” (Fatawa Kibar `Ulama Al-Ummah)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The belief of the Salaf (the early generations of Muslims, particularly the Prophet Muhammad's companions and their successors) concerning the Quran is rooted in a strong and unwavering faith in its authenticity, inerrancy, and divine origin. Here are some key points that characterize the Salaf's belief about the Quran:\n\n1. **Divine Revelation**: The Salaf believed that the Quran is the literal word of Allah (God), revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel (Jibril) over a period of approximately 23 years. They held that it is not a creation or a product of human speech but rather a timeless and eternal manifestation of divine guidance.\n\n2. **Inimitability (I'jaz)**: The Quran is viewed as inimitable, meaning that no one can produce a text comparable to it in its eloquence, depth, and wisdom. This belief is essential to its status as a miracle of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n3. **Preservation**: The Salaf believed in the complete preservation of the Quran, both in its text and meanings, as a divine promise from Allah. They emphasized that the Quran has not been altered or tampered with since its revelation and is kept intact in its original form.\n\n4. **Recitation and Memorization**: The practice of reciting and memorizing the Quran was highly valued among the Salaf. They placed great importance on the pronunciation and proper recitation (Tajwid) of the Quran as it was revealed.\n\n5. **Understanding and Interpretation (Tafsir)**: The Salaf stressed the importance of understanding the Quran in accordance with the context of its revelation and the interpretations provided by the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. They often sought knowledge from the earliest scholars and adhered to the teachings of the Salafi methodology in understanding the Quran.\n\n6. **Implementation**: The Salaf believed that the Quran is not just a text to be recited but also a guide to be implemented in all aspects of life. They practiced its teachings and viewed it as a complete code for personal and communal conduct.\n\n7. **Rejecting Any Form of Alterations**: They staunchly rejected any notion that the Quran could be subject to alterations, interpretations that contravene the established teachings, or any form of denial regarding its divine nature.\n\nIn summary, the belief of the Salaf concerning the Quran is characterized by a profound respect for its divine origin, a commitment to preserving its text and meanings, and an emphasis on understanding and applying its teachings faithfully in daily life."

        "question": "Repetition of stories in the Quran with different wording",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The repetition of stories and their wording in the Holy Quran, but in different contexts and synonymous wording, is one of the obvious characteristics of Quranic story-telling, as one story may be repeated in more than one surah, and each time it is told in a different context and different style. Thus the story is repeated with new phrases which give different shades of meaning and offer new lessons, in various eloquent styles. Hence the scholars and commentators regarded this variation in wording and phrases as one of the aspects of eloquence, and they stated that one of the objectives of the Quranic stories is that one incident may be mentioned in different contexts. They even wrote books devoted to this technique, one of which is the book al-Muqtanis fi Fawa’id Tikrar al-Qasas, by Badr al-Din ibn Jama‘ah, which was mentioned by al-Suyuti in al-Itqan (2/184).\nAl-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Presenting the same idea with different techniques and styles is quite clearly a sign of eloquence.\"(Al-Burhan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran 3/26).\nIf we want to count the benefits that this variation in presentation may add to the beauty of the Quran, we would list many such benefits. We will mention some of them below:\n1.\nAdding some details that were not mentioned in other contexts. The example mentioned in the question is one type of these benefits. The verses in Surat al-Hijr add a more specific description of the material from which Adam (peace be upon him) was created, which is the fact that he was created from dry clay, made from black mud moulded into shape, which was not mentioned in the verses of Surat al-A‘raf which refer to the same idea.\n2.\nConfirming the challenge that the Quran brought to the polytheist Arabs, to produce something like what is in the Quran. This variation in presenting one idea exposed their inability to produce anything like it in any style and in any words they could come up with.\n3.\nEnlivening the story so that the reader will not get bored with it. That is because a new variation in presentation of the story makes one more attentive and more inclined to listen, and it keeps the reader engaged and interested when reading this holy text. This is also one of the greatest objectives. Thus the eloquent person will find himself inclined to listen to it, because of the natural human inclination to move between a variety of things, each of which gives its own pleasure.\n4.\nPresenting one topic in an amazing way when it is presented in different styles. The polytheists at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were amazed at how often these stories were repeated, in a different style every time, even though the topic was the same. Thus Allah, may He be glorified, showed them that what they were amazed at was produced by One Whose power is infinite and Whose words cannot be counted.\n5.\nCreating harmony between the topic and the context in which the story is presented. Sometimes the context requires highlighting some aspect of the story in the discussion that takes place therein, that did not need to be highlighted in another context in which the same story was mentioned. This reason is one of the bases of the eloquence of the Quran and its miraculous nature. It is discussed in more detail in some books of Tafsir.\nYou can read about these benefits and others in the book al-Burhan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran (3/26-29).\nDr. Fadl Hasan ‘Abbas (may Allah have mercy on him) says: The storytelling method in the Holy Quran is a brilliant and miraculous method, as a story may be mentioned in many surahs. Although some surahs may mention a single detail from the story, other scenes and incidents are mentioned in other surahs in which the same story is mentioned, whether there are many events in the story or few. Thus in each surah you will find a detail of the story that you do not find elsewhere, and each surah mentions some detail that is appropriate to the topic and context of that surah. Thus the story is mentioned in the surahs in a particular place in each surah that is appropriate for it.\"(Al-Qasas al-Qurani  81).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the Quran, the repetition of stories with different wording serves several important purposes:\n\n1. **Emphasis on Key Lessons**: By narrating the same story multiple times, the Quran emphasizes certain moral and spiritual lessons. Each retelling may highlight different aspects of the story or provide additional insights, reinforcing the teachings intended for the audience.\n\n2. **Addressing Different Contexts**: Different verses may be revealed in different contexts or circumstances, allowing for a tailored message appropriate to the needs of the community or individuals at specific times. This can address various issues faced by the believers.\n\n3. **Encouragement and Comfort**: Repeating stories of past prophets and communities serves to encourage and comfort the believers, reminding them of the trials and tribulations faced by previous generations and how they maintained their faith in the face of challenges. It can provide solace and strengthen resolve.\n\n4. **Enhancing Understanding**: Different narrations can reveal new dimensions of understanding. The varied wording and details may help listeners engage with the story on multiple levels, encouraging deeper reflection and contemplation.\n\n5. **Literary Style**: The Quran's unique literary style allows for repetition to enhance its rhythm and beauty. The Quran is not just a religious text but also a piece of literature that employs repetition as a powerful poetic device.\n\nOverall, the repetition of stories in the Quran with different wording is a deliberate and significant aspect of its message, aimed at deepening the understanding and impacting the hearts of its readers and listeners."

        "question": "Can the basmalah be recited in the middle of a surah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that if a person recites the basmalah when beginning his reading of Quran in the middle of a surah, that is not recommended, because Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):\n{When you recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan} [An-Nahl 16:98].\nHe did not instruct us to say anything else. Therefore so long as there is a specific text concerning the matter which states that what is required from the one who wants to read Quran is to seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan, this text makes specific what is mentioned in general terms in the hadith, “Every important matter that does not start with ‘Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful), is devoid of blessings.” End quote.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\nLiqa’at al-Bab al-Maftuh (1/177).",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, the basmalah (بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ), which translates to \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,\" is recited at the beginning of each surah (chapter) of the Qur'an, except for Surah At-Tawbah (Surah 9). \n\nRegarding its recitation in the middle of a surah, scholars have differing views. Generally, it's permissible to recite the basmalah in the middle of a surah if doing so serves a purpose, such as to separate two themes or sections within the surah. However, it is not a common or established practice and is often discouraged unless there is a specific reason.\n\nIn summary, while it's not the normative practice to recite the basmalah in the middle of a surah, it may be done in specific circumstances. Always refer to knowledgeable scholars for guidance tailored to your situation."

        "question": "Writing verses of Quran and erasing them with water, then drinking the water",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Doing that is permissible. It is permissible for a person to write Quran with ink that it is permissible to drink, then to put the written paper in water and shake it, then drink it. Some of the early generations used to do that, and they would do it using vessels such as bowls and the like. If a person does that, he has a precedent for doing it. The evidence quoted for doing that is the general meaning of the verse in which Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We send down of the Quran that which is healing and mercy for the believers} [al-Isra’ 17:82].\nSo if healing is sought by means of the Quran in this manner, and it is tried and turns out to be beneficial, then it is included in the general meaning of this verse.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him).\n(Al-Liqa’ al-Maftuh (p. 112).",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the act of writing verses of the Quran and then erasing them with water, followed by drinking that water, is generally not an accepted practice. The Quran is considered the holy word of God, and it is treated with great reverence and respect. \n\nWhile there are certain practices in Islamic tradition where verses of the Quran are used in water for healing purposes (known as \"ruqyah\"), these practices are typically done with specific verses recited and not by writing and erasing them.\n\nIt is important to approach the Quran with respect and to follow established practices as taught by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the consensus of scholars. Any practice that involves altering or disrespecting the Quran could be considered inappropriate.\n\nIf you have specific needs or intentions behind such a practice, it is recommended to consult with knowledgeable scholars who can provide guidance based on Islamic teachings."

        "question": "When were Surat al-Falaq and Surat an-Nas revealed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The hadiths indicate that the Mu‘awwidhatayn (Al-Falaq) and An-Nas) were revealed in Madinah.\nThis is mentioned in the hadith of ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not see verses that have been revealed tonight, the like of which has never been seen? {Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak} [Al-Falaq 113] and {Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind} [An-Nas 114].”\n‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) accompanied the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Madinah, and these two surahs were revealed after the bewitching incident.\n‘Abd ibn Humayd narrated in al-Muntakhab (1/228): Ahmad ibn Yunus told me: Abu Mu‘awiyah told us, from al-A‘mash, from Yazid ibn Hayyan, from Zayd ibn Arqam, who said: A Jewish man bewitched the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he fell sick. Jibril came to him, bringing down al-Mu‘awwidhatayn, and said: A Jewish man has bewitched you, and the item used for witchcraft is in the well of So-and-so. So he sent ‘Ali, who brought it to him, then he instructed him to untie the knots and recite verses, so he started reciting and untying, until the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up as if he had been released from restraints. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say anything to that Jewish man about what he had done to him, and he never confronted him with it.\nThe narrators of this isnad are trustworthy (thiqat); it was classed as sahih by the commentators on the book, and by Shaykh al-Albani in as-SIlsilah as-Sahihah (6/617).\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said:\nHe said: Because of that, al-Mu‘aawidhatayn were revealed. End quote.\nThis was narrated by ath-Tha‘labi from Ibn ‘Abbas in a mu‘allaq report, and from ‘A’ishah, also in a mu‘allaq report.\nThe isnad going back to ‘A’ishah is sahih. It was narrated by Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah in his Tafsir from Abu ‘Ubaydillah, from Hisham ibn ‘Urwah, from his father, from ‘A’ishah. In it, it says: And {Qul a‘udhu bi Rabb il-falaq} [Surat al-Falaq] was revealed.\"(At-Talkhis al-Habir  6/2689).\nAs for the number of knots being eleven, no sahih hadith has been narrated concerning that.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs-Suhayli stated that the number of knots was eleven, so it was appropriate that the number of verses of the Mu‘awwidhatayn should be eleven, so that with every verse, one knot was undone.\nI say: al-Bayhaqi narrated in ad-Dala’il something similar with a da‘if isnad, in the story in which it is said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was bewitched… At the end of the hadith, it says that they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and Surat al-Falaq and Surat an-Nas were revealed, so every time he recited a verse, one knot came undone.\nIbn Sa‘d narrated with a munqati‘ (interrupted) isnad from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent ‘Ali and ‘Ammar, and they found a string in which there were eleven knots, and he mentioned a similar report.\"(At-Talkhis al-Habir 6/2689-2690).\nAnd Allah knows best.",

While the exact dates of their revelation are not specified, they are commonly understood to have been revealed toward the later period of the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) life. \n\nBoth surahs emphasize seeking protection from various forms of evil and are frequently recited for spiritual safeguarding."

        "question": "Ruling on writing verses of the Qur’an on walls and the front of houses",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt is not prescribed to write Qur’anic verses on walls, and it is disliked (makruh) according to the majority of scholars; some of them described it as haram.\nIbn al-Humam (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fath al-Qadir (1/169): It is disliked (makruh) to write Qur’an and the names of Allah, may He be exalted, on coins, mihrabs, walls and furnishings. End quote.\nAd-Dardir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ash-Sharh al-Kabir (1/425):\nWhat appears to be the case is that engraving [of Qur’anic verses] is disliked, even Qur’an [on graves]. And it should be regarded as haram, because it could lead to mishandling and disrespect, as they said.\nAn example of that is engraving Qur’an and the names of Allah on walls. End quote.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Rawdat at-Talibin (1/80): It is makruh to write it on walls, whether in the mosque or elsewhere, and on garments. End quote.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on writing verses and hadiths on the walls of mosques? He replied: That is a distraction to people.\nAs for writing verses on walls, whether in the mosque or elsewhere, it is an innovation (bid‘ah) and there is no report from the Companions to suggest that they used to engrave verses on their walls.\nMoreover, engraving verses on walls is a kind of disrespect towards the words of Allah. Hence we find some of them writing verses in a calligraphic style to look like castles, minarets, mosques and the like, shaping the words to make them look like a castle. Undoubtedly this is toying with the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nFurthermore, even if we assume that the words are written in clear Arabic writing, this is not the way of the righteous early generations.\nWhat benefit can there be in writing verses on walls?\nSome people say that it will be a reminder for people. We say: Reminding is done by spoken words, not by writing the verses.\nMoreover, sometimes they write on the walls {And do not spy or backbite each other} [al-Hujurat 49:12], and you will find that those who are sitting underneath this verse are gossiping and backbiting people, so it is as if they are mocking the verses of Allah.\nTherefore writing verses in mosques and on the walls of houses all comes under the heading of innovation (bid‘ah), as it is something that was not known at the time of the righteous early generations.\nAs for writing hadiths in the mosque, if it is in the direction of the qiblah, then undoubtedly it is a distraction, because people, even some of the worshippers who are standing behind the imam during the prayer, may steal glances at it. The scholars regard it as disliked to write anything in the qiblah of the mosque.\nIf that is done in houses, there is nothing wrong with writing a hadith [on the wall] if there is some benefit in it, such as the supplication offered as expiation for a gathering (kaffarat al-majlis): “Subhanak Allahumma rabbana wa bi hamdik, ashhadu an la ilaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk (Glory and praise be to you, O Allah our Lord. I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except You. I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You),” then this serves as a reminder.\"(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh 197/13).\nSee also the answer to question no. 254, in which there is a discussion of the negative consequences of hanging verses on walls, most of which are also applicable to writing directly on the walls.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to sitting on the roof of the house, which rests on the walls on which, or on parts of which, Qur’an has been written, there is nothing wrong with it, and it is not like sitting on the Qur’an, because who sits on walls?! Rather they sit on the roof, away from the walls.\nAs for your saying “anyone who climbs onto the roof of the house feels that he is stepping on that dhikr,” this comes under the heading of waswasah (intrusive thoughts; whispers from the shaytan).\nBeware of getting carried away with it, because waswasah is a serious problem and a great evil; may Allah keep us all safe and sound.\nThe remedy for waswasah is to ignore it and pay no attention to it, whilst also reciting a great deal of dhikr and doing acts of worship.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, writing verses of the Qur'an on walls and the fronts of houses can be seen as a way to show respect for the words of Allah and to promote a positive atmosphere. However, there are certain considerations and rulings to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Respect and Cleanliness**: The Qur'an is the holy book of Islam, and its verses should be treated with utmost respect. If verses are written on walls, they should be done in a clean and respectful manner. The area should be free from filth and disrespect.\n\n2. **Permanence**: Some scholars argue against writing Qur'anic verses in places where they might easily get disrespected or neglected, such as areas that are exposed to dirt or damage.\n\n3. **Avoiding Distraction**: If the writing can be a source of distraction or cause people to overlook the importance of the verses, it may not be advisable.\n\n4. **Intention**: The intention behind writing the verses should be pure, aimed at remembering Allah and reflecting upon His words.\n\n5. **Cultural Context**: In many Muslim communities, it is common to see such expressions of faith, and they can be a source of inspiration and spiritual reminder for those who live there.\n\nIn conclusion, while writing Qur'anic verses on walls is generally permissible if done with respect and care, it is essential to consider the context, intention, and manner of such practices. It's also recommended to consult local scholars or community leaders for guidance reflecting the specific cultural practices and beliefs within the community."

        "question": "Ruling on using auto-tune and vocal effects for the Holy Qur’an",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nRuling on using vocal effects for recitation of Qur’an\nThere is nothing wrong with using enhancers and vocal effects for recitation of Qur’an, if that will not lead to repetition of the sound of letters, or cause them to disappear, or change the rules of tajwid, provided that the reciter is reciting without restricting himself to a certain maqam (mode or scale) or tune.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: One of the imams of the mosques is asking: We heard you talking about vocal enhancement (echo); what did you say?\nHe said: What we said was that if this vocal enhancement (echo) leads to repeating the sound of the letter, then it is haram, because it is adding something to the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and that is not permissible.\nBut if it does not lead to repeating the sound, then we examine the matter further: If it makes the reciter’s voice sound like the voice of a singer, then it is also not allowed, but in this case we cannot say definitively that it is haram, because there is no addition to the wording of the Qur’an. This is what we say about these enhancements.\nMoreover, we say: O brothers, what matters is not the tune that moves you and you find pleasurable; rather what matters is to focus with humility (and be moved by the words of the Qur’an). How many people recite without a microphone, let alone vocal enhancements, but it is more conducive to focus and reflection for him and for his listeners.\"(Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftuh  109/14).\nSecondly:\nUsing auto-tune for recitation of Qur’an\nAuto-tune is a sound-purifying tool which works to enhance the sound, cancel any distortion and alter the pitch of the sound.\nThe ruling on reciting with maqamat (modes or scales) has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 169799 .\nBut it is not permissible to use auto-tune, even if the reciter does not pay attention to maqamat and does not restrict himself to that, because of what it leads to of omitting some vowels and even some letters, let alone some rules of tajwid, according to what some specialists have told us.\nShaykh Sulayman al-Majid (may Allah preserve him) was asked: What is the ruling on using filters and vocal effects for recitation of Qur’an, such as what are known as auto-tune filters? I hope you will answer my question, may Allah bless you.\nHe replied: It is not permissible to introduce these vocal effects into recitation of Qur’an. End quote.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the recitation of the Holy Qur'an is a deeply revered practice that requires sincerity, respect, and adherence to traditional methods. The use of auto-tune or vocal effects on Qur'anic recitation raises important considerations:\n\n1. **Intent and Respect**: The primary goal of Qur'anic recitation is to communicate the words of Allah with clarity and dignity. Any alterations that may detract from the natural beauty and seriousness of the recitation may not be favored.\n\n2. **Preservation of Meaning**: The Qur'an's message and its intended emotional and spiritual impact should remain intact. If auto-tune or effects distort the words or render them less recognizable, this could be seen as inappropriate.\n\n3. **Tradition**: Traditional methods of recitation (Tajweed) emphasize the proper pronunciation and melodious nature of the Qur'an without mechanical alteration. Using vocal effects may go against the Sunnah of how the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the companions recited the Qur'an.\n\n4. **Community Acceptance**: The views of recognized scholars and the general consensus within the community can play a significant role in determining the permissibility of such practices.\n\nIn general, many Islamic scholars would likely discourage the use of auto-tune and heavy vocal effects in the recitation of the Qur'an, advocating instead for a sincere and natural recitation that reflects reverence and respect for the holy text. It's best for individuals seeking a definitive ruling to consult knowledgeable scholars in their own communities for context-specific guidance."

This was stated by al-Mutawalli.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, when a person is reading the Qur'an and gets interrupted, it is recommended to repeat the isti‘aadah (the phrase \"A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim\", meaning \"I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed devil\") when they resume reading. \n\nThough it is not obligatory to repeat it, it is preferable to do so as a means of seeking Allah’s protection from distractions and negative influences when continuing to recite the Qur'an.

        "question": "What Is the Last Verse Revealed in the Quran?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed as to which was the last verse of the Quran to be revealed, and there are several views, as each of the scholars spoke of the conclusion to which his Ijtihad (reaching rulings on the basis of individual opinion based on Shar’i evidence) led. There is nothing that has been soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) concerning this matter that could be definitive.\nMost of the scholars are of the view that the last verse to be revealed was the verse in Surah Al-Baqarah in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah. Then every soul will be compensated for what it earned, and they will not be treated unjustly} [Al-Baqarah 2:281]\nJalal Ad-Din As-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThere is a difference of scholarly opinion as to which verse was the last to be revealed.\n·        Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated that Al-Bara’ ibn `Azib said: The last verses to be revealed were:\n{They request from you a [legal] ruling. Say, “Allah gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants [as heirs]”} [An-Nisa’ 4:176] and the end of Surah At-Tawbah.\n·        Al-Bukhari narrated that Ibn `Abbas said: The last verse to be revealed was the verse of Riba. Al-Bayhaqi narrated something similar from `Umar.\nWhat is meant is the verse in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest …} [Al-Baqarah 2:278]\n·        An-Nasa’i narrated via `Ikrimah that Ibn `Abbas said: The last verse of the Quran to be revealed is (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah… } [Al-Baqarah 2:281]\n·        Ibn Abu Hatim narrated that Sa‘id ibn Jubayr said: The last verse of the entire Quran to be revealed was (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah… } [Al-Baqarah 2:281]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) lived for nine more days after this verse was revealed, then he died on the night before Monday, the second day of Rabi‘ Al-Awwal.\nIbn Jarir narrated a similar report from Ibn Jurayaj.\n·        And he narrated via `Atiyyah that Abu Sa`id said: The last verse to be revealed was (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah… } [Al-Baqarah 2:281]\n·        Abu ‘Ubayd narrated in Al-Fada’il that Ibn Shihab said: The last verse of the Quran be revealed was the verse of Riba [Al-Baqarah 2:278] and the verse of debt [Al-Baqarah 2:282].\n·        In Al-Mustadrak it is narrated that Ubay ibn Ka`b said: The last verse to be revealed was (interpretation of the meaning): {There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves} [At-Tawbah 9:128] until the end of the Surah.\n·        Ibn Mardawayh also narrated that Ubay said: The last verses of the Quran to be revealed were these two verses (interpretation of the meaning): {There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves…} [At-Tawbah 9:128-129]. Abu Ash-Shaykh narrated in his Tafsir via ‘Ali ibn Zayd, from Yusuf Al-Makki, that Ibn `Abbas said: The last verse to be revealed was (interpretation of the meaning): {There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves} [At-Tawbah 9:128].” (Al-Itqan fi `Ulum Al-Quran (1/101-103) See also: Tafsir Ibn Katheer (2/168)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe soundest view regarding the last verse of the Quran to be revealed is that it was the verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah… } [Al-Baqarah 2:281]” Fath Al-Bari (8/317)\nAbu Bakr Al-Baqillani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The Companions and those who came after them differed concerning which verse of the Quran was the last to be revealed… Then he mentioned the different views, then he said:\nThere is no report which can be attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) concerning that. Rather it is narrated from the one who said it. It is possible that it is a kind of Ijtihad on the basis of what is most likely to be the case and what circumstantial evidence indicates. Learning about that is not something essential, and it is not something concerning which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said something that he explained and made known to people, or made it obligatory to know about it and made it something by means of which proof could be established.\nIt may be that what was stated by each of those whose view we have mentioned above was based on the last thing that he heard from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and someone else heard something that was revealed after that, and the first one did not hear [what was revealed later] because he was not present, and the revelation [of more verses] came down after that.\nThen he discussed the reasons why there are different views regarding this issue.

        "predicted_answer": "The last verse revealed in the Quran is generally considered to be from Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), Verse 281. This verse states:\n\n\"And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah. Then every soul will be recompensed for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.\" (Quran 2:281)\n\nHowever, some scholars also highlight the significance of the last part of Surah Al-Ma'idah (Chapter 5), Verse 3, which addresses the completion of the religion of Islam.

        "question": "Can You Touch the Mus-haf Cover without Wudu?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The cover of a Mus-haf that is attached to it with binding or glue, and the like, comes under the same ruling as the Mus-haf. So it is not permissible for anyone who does not have Wudu to touch it. \nAs for the cover that is separate from the Mus-haf , like the sleeve in which the Mus-haf is placed to protect it, there is nothing wrong with touching it without Wudu.\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah: \n“The majority of jurists – Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi`is and Hanbalis – are of the view that it is not allowed for one who is not in a state of purity to touch the cover of the Mus-haf that is attached to it, or the margins on which there is no writing on the pages of the Mus-haf, or the white spaces between the lines, and the same applies to pages that are free of any writing at all. That is because they are part of the book. Some of the Hanafis and Shafa`is are of the view that that is permissible.”\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“It is not permissible for the Muslim to touch the Mus-haf unless he is in a state of purity and free of both major and minor impurity. The same applies to moving it from one place to another, if the one who is moving it is not in a state of purity.\nBut if he touches it or moves it with a barrier, such as if he picks it up in a wrapper or sleeve, and the like, there is nothing wrong with that. As for touching it directly when he is not in a state of purity, that is not permissible according to the correct view, which is the view of the majority of scholars, for the reasons mentioned above. \nAs for reciting or reading, there is nothing wrong with him reciting it from memory even if he is in a state of minor impurity , or reading when someone else hold the Quran for him and prompts him; there is nothing wrong with that.\" (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz  10/149-150)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, the Mus-haf (the physical copy of the Qur'an) must be treated with respect. The majority opinion among scholars is that one should be in a state of ritual purity (Wudu) when touching the Mus-haf itself. However, the cover of the Mus-haf is generally considered less sacred than the Qur'an itself.\n\nThat said, it is preferable to maintain a level of respect and purity. Many scholars advise that if a person is not in Wudu, they should avoid touching the Mus-haf, even its cover, to uphold the reverence associated with the Qur'an. \n\nFor the most accurate guidance based on specific circumstances, it is always recommended to consult a knowledgeable scholar or local authority in your community."

        "question": "The sending down of the Quran began on Laylat al-Qadr in Ramadan, but fasting was not enjoined until the second year AH",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Quran was revealed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at the beginning of his mission, and the first revelation came in the month of Ramadan, on Laylat al-Qadr, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Indeed, We sent the Quran down during the Night of Decree} [al-Qadr 97:1]\n{Ha, Meem.\nBy the clear Book. \nIndeed, We sent it down during a blessed night. Indeed, We were to warn [mankind]} [ad-Dukhaan 44:1-3].\nThen it continued to be sent down piecemeal until shortly before the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [it is] a Quran which We have separated [by intervals] that you might recite it to the people over a prolonged period. And We have sent it down progressively} [al-Isra’ 17:106].\nFasting was not enjoined at that time; rather fasting was not enjoined until the second year AH – in other words, fifteen years after the revelation of the Quran began.\nSo there is no connection between the sending down of the Quran and fasting.\nRather the connection is between the Quran and the month of Ramadan and Laylat al-Qadr. The month of Ramadan was known before the Prophet's mission began and afterwards, as were all the other [Arabic] months.\nThere is no connection between Laylat al-Qadr and fasting, because Laylat al-Qadr is a night in the month of Ramadan, which was known before fasting was enjoined.\nWhat appears to be the case is that this is the reason for your question, which is that you think that there is a connection between Laylat al-Qadr and fasting, and you have not borne in mind the fact that this night and the month in which it occurs were known even before fasting was enjoined.\nTo sum up:\nThe sending down of the Quran began in Ramadan of the first year of the Prophet’s mission, and continued for 23 years.\nWith regard to fasting, it was enjoined approximately fifteen years after the Prophet’s mission began – that is, after the first words of the Quran were revealed – and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fasted nine Ramadans; during these years, the Quran continued to be revealed.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words of Allah, may He be exalted, {Indeed, We sent it down} refer to the Quran. It is not mentioned by name in this soorah because what is being referred to is clear, and the entire Quran is like a single soorah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{The month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Quran} [al-Baqarah 2:185]\n{Ha, Meem.\nBy the clear Book. \nIndeed, We sent it down during a blessed night} [ad-Dukhaan 44:1-3]\n– what is meant is on Laylat al-Qadr.\nAsh-Sha‘bi said: What is meant is: We began to send it down on Laylat al-Qadr.\nAnd it was said: Rather Jibreel (peace be upon him) brought it all down at once on Laylat al-Qadr, from al-Lawh al-Mahfooz to the lowest heaven, to Bayt al-'Izzah, and Jibreel dictated it to the angelic scribes, then Jibreel brought it down to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) piecemeal, and between the first and the last of it there were twenty-three years. This was stated by Ibn 'Abbaas.\" (Tafseer at-Tabari  20/129).\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: The Battle of Badr took place in Ramadan of the second year AH, and during that year fasting was made obligatory.\" (Fath al-Baari  1/50).\nFor more information on the sending down of the Quran piecemeal, please see the answer to question no. 180883 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, you are correct. The revelation of the Quran began on Laylat al-Qadr, which is described in Surah Al-Qadr (Chapter 97) as a night that is \"better than a thousand months.\" It is one of the nights in the last ten days of Ramadan, when the Quran was first sent down to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). \n\nHowever, the obligation of fasting during the month of Ramadan was not instituted until the second year of the Hijra (AH). The command to fast was revealed in Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2:183-185), making it obligatory for Muslims to fast from dawn until sunset during the month of Ramadan.\n\nThis timeline highlights a significant aspect of the growth of Islamic practice during the early years of the Prophet's mission, as the community was gradually introduced to the fundamental tenets of the faith."

        "question": "The final review of the Qur’an, and was any Qur’an revealed after that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWhat is meant by the review is that Jibreel reviewed the Qur’an with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) every year in Ramadan.\nIt was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: He [the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] told me: Jibreel used to review the Qur’an every year with him once or twice, but this year he reviewed it with him twice. He said: “I think that my death has drawn near, so fear Allah and be patient, for what a good example I am for you.” Narrated by Muslim (2450).\nAccording to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari (3624), “Jibreel used to review the Qur’an with me once every year, but this year he has reviewed it with me twice, and I think that my death is approaching, and you [Faatimah] will be the first of my family to join me.” So I [Faatimah] wept, then he said: “Does it not please you that you will be the leader of the women of Paradise, or of the believing women.” So I smiled at that.\nAmong the Sahaabah, ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood and Zayd ibn Thaabit witnessed this review.\nIbn Katheer said: What is meant by Jibreel’s reviewing the Qur’an with him every year is that he checked it to make sure that it was exactly as he had brought it down to him from Allah, may He be exalted, so that what was meant to remain would remain and what had been abrogated would not remain. This review was by way of verifying, ensuring and preserving, therefore the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reviewed it with Jibreel twice in the last year of his life, and Jibreel reviewed it with him. From this, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) understood that the time of his death was approaching.\n‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) compiled the master copy of the Mushaf on the basis of this final review.\nRamadan was chosen out of all of the months for this review, because the beginning of the revelation occurred during that month. Hence it is recommended (mustahabb) to study the Qur’an and recite it repeatedly in Ramadan, and the leading scholars strove hard in reciting the Qur’an in that month.\" (Tafseer Ibn Katheer  1/51).\nSecondly:\nThere is no cause for confusion in the fact that this annual review did not cover the entire Qur’an every single year, because the revelation of the Qur’an had not yet been completed. This is clear.\nThat is also applicable to what happened during the final review in Ramadan: the review was only of what had been revealed up to that point, and there is nothing to rule out that something could be revealed after Ramadan or after the final review of the Qur’an, that was not included in that review.\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The hadith indicates that the word Qur’an may refer to some of it or most of it, because at the time of the first review in the first Ramadan after the Prophet’s mission began, only some of the Qur’an had been revealed. Then it went on like that every Ramadan after it, until the final Ramadan, in which all of the Qur’an had been revealed except that which was delayed and was revealed after that particular Ramadan.\nFrom 10 AH and until the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died in Rabee‘ al-Awwal 11 AH, one of the verses that were revealed during that time was the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{This day I have perfected for you your religion} [al-Maa’idah 5:3].\nThis verse was revealed on the day of ‘Arafah, when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was in ‘Arafah, according to scholarly consensus.\nIt is as if what was revealed during those days, because it was so little compared to what had already been revealed, was overlooked as far as reviewing it was concerned.\" (Fath al-Baari  9/44).\nFor more information on the issue of the final review of the Qur’an, please see: al-‘Ardah al-Akheerah: Dalaalaatuha wa Atharuha, by Dr. Naasir al-Quthaami, Chair in Qur’anic Sciences.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, the final review or compilation of the Qur'an is considered to have been completed during the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) before his passing in 632 CE. The Qur'an is believed to be the last revelation from Allah to humanity, delivered through the Angel Gabriel (Jibril). \n\nAfter the Prophet's death, the Qur'an was compiled into a single book format under the caliphate of Abu Bakr and then standardized under the caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan. \n\nMuslims believe that no further revelations or scriptures have been sent after the Qur'an, and it is regarded as the final guidance for humanity. Therefore, according to Islamic doctrine, no Qur'an or holy scripture has been revealed after it."

Some people choose this sound to be Qur’an, the adhaan, a du‘aa’ or a beneficial nasheed, and some choose it to be a song or music, and so on.\nIn principle, there is nothing wrong with this service, so long as the sound that the caller chooses is something permissible.\nIt is not permissible for this sound to be music or indecent songs, because of the proof that songs and music are haraam. This has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 5000 .\nWith regard to choosing the sound of a qaari’ reciting Qur’an, this may be a type of disrespect towards the Holy Qur’an, because Allah, may He be exalted, sent down the Qur’an to be read, reflected upon, recited as an act of worship and acted upon.\nThe words of Allah, may He be exalted, are too great for us to make them simply a means of passing the time or to alert us to something.\nSimilarly, with regard to the adhaan, it was prescribed to alert people to the best and most important act of worship in Islam, namely the prayer, so it is deserving of appropriate respect and veneration. Therefore it should not be used for this service.\nWith regard to du‘aa’, the matter is more lenient.\nShaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserving) was asked: What is your opinion on those who put the adhaan or recitation of the Holy Qur’an as ring tones on their mobile phones instead of music?\nHe replied: This is disrespectful towards the adhaan, dhikr and the Noble Qur’an; they should not be used as alarms, and the Qur’an should not be used as an alarm. \nIt may be said: This is better than music.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is permissible to use recordings of du'aa, Qur'an, or the adhaan as a ringtone or dial tone on your phone. Here are a few points to consider regarding this practice:\n\n1. **Remembrance of Allah:** Using Qur'anic recitations or adhaan as a ringtone can serve as a reminder to maintain consciousness of Allah and can uplift the spirit.\n\n2. **Respecting Sacred Texts:** It is essential to ensure that the recording is respected and not treated lightly. The recitation should be played in a manner that reflects its sanctity, such as avoiding settings where it may be disrespected (e.g., loud places where it could be interrupted).\n\n3. **Intention:** The intention behind using such recordings should be to promote good, be it reminding oneself or others about religious duties and responsibilities.\n\n4. **Context:** It’s also important to consider the setting in which the ringtone will be heard. In places of worship or during gatherings where concentration is key, one should be cautious about using such tones to avoid disrupting others.\n\nIn conclusion, using a recording of du'aa, Qur'an, or the adhaan as a dial tone is generally considered permissible in Islam, provided it is done respectfully and thoughtfully."

        "question": "Definition of al-Mufassal in the Quran, and the long and short soorahs of al-Mufassal",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nAl-Mufassal refers to the short soorahs of the Quran which have many breaks between them, in which the Basmalah (“Bismillah al-Rahmaan al-Raheem”) appears. They are called mufassal (divided) because a lot of breaks appear in them. \nThere was a difference of scholarly opinion concerning the definition of al-Mufassal. Does it begin from Soorat Qaaf or from al-Hujuraat? There was also a difference of opinion as to which soorahs are regarded as long, medium and short. There are several opinions: \nIn al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (33/48) it says: They differed concerning al-Mufassal. The Hanafis are of the view that the long soorahs of al-Mufassal start with al-Hujuraat and end with al-Burooj; the medium soorahs begin there and end with al-Bayyinah; and the short soorahs begin there and go to the end of the Quran. \nThe Maalikis said that the long soorahs of al-Mufassal start with al-Hujuraat and end with al-Naazi‘aat; the medium soorahs begin with ‘Abasa and end with al-Duha; and the short soorahs begin with al-Duha, until the end of the Quran. \nThe Shaafa‘is said: The long soorahs of al-Mufassal are soorahs such as al-Hujuraat, al-Qamar and al-Rahmaan; the medium soorahs are soorahs such as al-Shams and al-Layl; and the short soorahs are soorahs such as al-‘Asr and Qul Huwa Allah Ahad (al-Ikhlaas), \nThe Hanbalis are of the view that al-Mufassal begins with Soorah Qaaf, because of the hadith of Aws ibn Hudhayfah who said: I asked the companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah upon him) how they divided the Quran. They said, Three and five and seven and nine and eleven and thirteen, and Hizb al-Mufassal [This refers to the number of soorahs in each hizb or portion of Quran. Thus the first hizb contains the first three soorahs, the second contains the next five soorahs, and so on. Hizb al-Mufassal is the last portion of the Quran, from Soorat Qaf until the end]. Narrated by Abu Dawood (1396) and Ibn Maajah (1345); its isnaad was classed as hasan by Ibn Katheer in Fadaa’il al-Quran (83) and as da ‘eef (weak) by al-Albaani in Da‘eef Abi Dawood. They said: This implies that the beginning of al-Mufassal is the forty-ninth soorah from the beginning of al-Baqarah, not from al-Faatihah. The end of the long soorahs is al-Naba’, the medium soorahs go up to al-Duha and the short soorahs go from there to the end of the Quran. End quote. \nSee: Fath al-Baari, 2/249; al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Quran by al-Suyooti, 1/180 \nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nAl-Mufassal starts with Soorah Qaaf and goes to the end of the Quran, according to the sound opinion. It is called mufassal because there many breaks between the soorahs, where the Basmalah appears, according to the correct opinion. End quote from Fath al-Baari, 2/295. See also Fath al-Baari, 9/43. \nSecondly: \nWith regard to who first called that al-Mufassal, this name was widespread and well known among the Sahaabah and was narrated in many various hadiths from the Sahaabah. \nA man came to Ibn Mas‘ood and said: I recited al-Mufassal last night in one rak‘ah. He said: This is like the hasty recitation of poetry. I know the pairs of soorahs that the Messenger of Allah (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite in each rak‘ah. And he mentioned twenty soorahs from al-Mufassal, two soorahs in each rak‘ah. \nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (775), Muslim (922). \nThe hadiths in which the name al-Mufassal is mentioned are very many and various, in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere, which makes it likely that this name was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). \nIt was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Mu‘aadh used to pray with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then he would go back and lead his people in prayer. [One night] he prayed ‘Isha’ and started to recite Soorat al-Baqarah, and one man left the congregation (and prayed by himself). It was as if Mu‘aadh criticized him. News of that reached the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he said: “[You are] one who puts people off praying in congregation, one who puts people off praying in congregation, one who puts people off praying in congregation roblems,” three times, and he told him to recite two of the medium-length soorahs of al-Mufassal. ‘Amr - the narrator of the hadith - said: I do not remember them. \nNarrated by al-Bukhari (701) and Muslim (465). \nAnd Allah knows best.",

        "question": "Ruling on memorizing Qur’an using the “five fortresses” method",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The “five fortresses” method for memorizing the Qur’an is a method based on a plan for preparing the pages that one wants to memorize, a method for memorizing and a method for reviewing what one has previously memorized.\nIt is a method that includes reading from the Mushaf, listening to a skilled narrator, repeating what one wants to memorize, then reviewing what one has memorized without looking at the Mushaf.\nBased on that, it does not seem that there is anything objectionable about this method. Rather it is a good method that connects the Muslim to the Qur’an on a daily basis, and gets him used to reciting the Qur’an and not forget it. It is well known that educational means and methods of reviewing and memorizing, and the like, are only means of acquiring knowledge and memorizing and reviewing the Holy Qur’an.\nThe ruling on these means is that they are permissible, so long as Islam has not forbidden them.\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf a method is not forbidden and it is effective, then there is nothing wrong with it. Means are not the same as objectives, and it is not essential that Islam should state for every means or method that it is permissible or otherwise, because means and methods are innumerable and unlimited, so everything that is a means of achieving good is good. End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab (15/30).\nMoreover, when determining whether a particular method is better and choosing it over others, we should look at experience and what is best suited to each individual. What is suitable and beneficial to one person is not always suitable and beneficial for another; rather it may be suitable for someone else, or some other method may be more beneficial for him. So each person should look at what is most suitable for him and will help him. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless.”\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The \"five fortresses\" method is a technique used to help memorize the Qur'an more effectively. This method can involve breaking down the text into manageable portions and employing various mnemonic devices and techniques to assist with memorization. While there isn't a specific ruling on the \"five fortresses\" method itself in classical Islamic jurisprudence, several important principles can guide the use of any memorization technique for the Qur'an.\n\n1. **Intention (Niyyah)**: The most crucial aspect is the intention behind memorizing the Qur'an. It should be done sincerely for the sake of Allah and with the intention of understanding, implementing, and spreading its teachings.\n\n2. **Respecting the Qur'an**: Any method of memorization should maintain the sanctity of the Qur'an. This includes ensuring that the text is treated with respect and that learners are in a suitable environment to facilitate focus and reflection.\n\n3. **Competence**: The method used should be appropriate and effective for the individual. Different people have different learning styles; thus, it's essential to find a method that suits one's personal strengths.\n\n4. **Continuous Repetition**: Memorization should involve consistent review and repetition, which is a common principle in memorizing any text, especially the Qur'an. The \"five fortresses\" method may incorporate this principle, making it compatible with the general recommendations for memorization.\n\n5. **Consultation with Scholars**: If there are prevailing practices or methods in your community, it may be beneficial to consult with knowledgeable scholars or teachers of Qur'an memorization to ensure the method is in line with Islamic etiquette and principles.\n\nIn summary, while there is no specific ruling against the \"five fortresses\" method, it should be used in a way that aligns with Islamic values and enhances one’s ability to memorize and comprehend the Qur’an. Always strive for methods that foster a deep connection with the text and its teachings."

        "question": "Reading Quran with an accent in which some letters such as tha’ and dhal are altered",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is obligatory to read Quran with the letters with which Allah has revealed it, with sound Arabic pronunciation, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And truly, this (the Quran) is a revelation from the Lord of the ‘Aalameen(mankind, jinn and all that exists),\n193. Which the trustworthy Rooh [Jibreel (Gabriel)] has brought down\n194. Upon your heart (O Muhammad) that you may be (one) of the warners,\n195. In the plain Arabic language” [al-Shu’ara 26:192-195] \n“Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran in order that you may understand” [Yoosuf 12:2]\nIt is not permissible for anyone to deliberately change any letter of it when he is able to pronounce it correctly. This is a kind of mistake which is a sin. \nIf a person finds it difficult to pronounce the letters correctly – such as people in whose language some of the Arabic letters, such as tha’, dhal and kha’ do not exist – they have to try to learn the correct pronunciation, but if they are unable to master it then they are excused, but their example should not be followed, and they should be called upon to strive their hardest to learn and correct their pronunciation. And none of them should lead the prayer, unless he is leading others like him who cannot pronounce well either. \nIbn al-Jazari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever is able to read the words of Allah with correct Arabic pronunciation but he deliberately pronounces it incorrectly like a non-Arab, out of arrogance, stubbornness and complacency, or because he is too proud to go to a scholar who could help him to correct his pronunciation, is undoubtedly falling short and sinning and being dishonest. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Religion is sincerity: to Allah, to His Book, to His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.” \nBut if a person’s tongue will not obey him or he cannot find someone to teach him the correct pronunciation, then Allah does not burden any soul beyond its scope. \nEnd quote from al-Nashr fi’l-Qiraa’aat al-‘Ashr, 1/299 \nIt should be noted that Allah has made it easy to memorize and recite Quran, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And We have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?” [al-Qamar 54:17]\nHence we see many of our brothers in the countries referred to who are able to pronounce the letters perfectly, better than many of their Arab brothers. So you should strive to learn the correct pronunciation and recite Quran with proper Tajweed, and not despair or give up.\n And Allah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the recitation of the Quran (Tajweed) holds significant importance, and it is recommended to recite the Quran with proper pronunciation of the Arabic letters. Altering the sound of letters, such as changing \"tha’\" (ث) to \"ta\" (ت) or \"dhal\" (ذ) to \"dal\" (د), can affect the meaning and clarity of the recitation.\n\nWhile it is recognized that individuals may have varying levels of proficiency in Arabic, it is essential to strive for correct pronunciation. This involves learning and practicing the rules of Tajweed to ensure that the Quran is recited as accurately as possible, preserving its meaning and beauty. \n\nIf someone finds it difficult to pronounce certain letters correctly due to regional accents or dialects, it is encouraged to seek guidance from a knowledgeable teacher or a Quranic tutor who can assist in improving pronunciation without altering the letters' correct sounds. This helps in maintaining the integrity of the Quranic text and enhancing the recitational experience."

        "question": "Supplication after reciting Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt was narrated by an-Nasaa’i in as-Sunan al-Kubra (11067) and in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah (308), and by at-Taaraani in ad-Du‘aa’ (1912) that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never sat in any gathering, or recited Quran, or offered any prayer, but he concluded that with certain words. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I see that you never sit in a gathering, or recite Quran, or offer any prayer, but you conclude it with these words. He said: “Yes. Whoever spoke good words, that will be like a seal on what he did of good and whoever spoke ill, it will be an expiation for him: “Subhaanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika, laa ilaaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk (Glory and praise be to you, O Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You).”\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (3164).\nIn this hadith, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained that the dhikr of expiation for a gathering should be said at the end of any gathering in which a man sits, whether it was a gathering of dhikr or a gathering in which there was some ill or idle talk, for if it was a gathering of dhikr, it will be a seal on it for him.\nAs-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat is meant is that it will be an affirmation of what he did of good, and will raise his deed to such a level that Allah will accept it, and it will like a guarantee that it will not be rejected, and if it was otherwise, then it will be an expiation for him. See: Mir‘aat al-Mafaateeh (8/204).\nBased on that, it is mustahabb for the Muslim to end any gathering with these words, no matter what kind of gathering it was. If it was a gathering to read Quran or to offer a prayer, or he sat with his friends, or with his family members, or to reconcile between people, or any other gathering, then he wants to leave, he should recite this dhikr just before he gets up to leave, then he should get up.\nSecondly:\nThere is no proven supplication specifically for completing the Quran, neither this supplication nor any other. From what has been explained above, it is clear that this dhikr and du‘aa’ is not specifically for completing the Quran or anything else; rather it is general and may be recited in any gathering.\nHowever, the scholars have stated that it is mustahabb to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. An-Nawawi said: It is strongly encouraged (mustahabb)  to attend gatherings in which the Quran is completed. At-Tibyaan fi Aadaab Hamlat al-Quran (159).\nIbn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (2/126): It is mustahabb to gather one’s family and others when completing the Quran to listen to the supplication.\nAhmad said: When Anas completed the Quran, he would gather his family and his children.\nThat was narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood and others.\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 65581 and 37683 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is highly encouraged to make supplications (dua) after reciting the Quran. While there are no specific, universally mandated supplications to be recited after Quranic recitation, it is beneficial to engage in personal supplication and ask Allah for guidance, forgiveness, and blessings. \n\nMany scholars recommend using verses from the Quran to guide your supplications, such as asking for increased understanding (knowledge) or mercy. One common practice is to recite the final prayer (dua) from Surah Al-Baqarah (2:285-286) or applying the meanings of verses that resonate with one’s current life situation.\n\nA general advice is to thank Allah for providing the Quran as guidance and to ask for the strength to implement its teachings in daily life. Here’s an example of a supplication you might say: \n\n“Ya Allah, make the Quran a guide for me, lighten my heart with its wisdom, and help me to act upon its teachings.”\n\nFeel free to express your own needs and desires in your supplication, as sincerity in prayer is highly valued in Islam."

        "question": "Interacting with the meanings of Qur’an whilst reciting",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIt was narrated that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I prayed with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) one night. He started to recite al-Baqarah, and continued to recite until he completed one hundred verses, and I thought that he would bow. Then he continued until he had recited two hundred verses, and I thought that he would bow. And he continued until he completed it, and I thought he would bow. Then he started to recite an-Nisa’, and he recited, then he bowed, and his bowing was as long as his standing, and he said  whilst bowing: Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘Azeem (Glory be to my Lord Most Great). Then he prostrated, and his prostration was as long as his bowing, and he said whilst prostrating: Subhaana Rabbiy al-A‘laa (Glory be to my Lord Most High). When he came to a verse that spoke of mercy, he prayed for mercy; when he came to a verse that mentioned punishment, he sought refuge with Allah from it; and when he came to a verse that glorified Allah, he glorified Allah.\nNarrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad (23261) and by Ibn Khuzaymah in as-Saheeh (586).\nSuch was the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when reciting Qur’an and interacting with the meanings of the verses. This is a type of reflecting and pondering the meaning. As-Suyooti said: It is Sunnah to recite with reflection and pondering the meaning. That is the greatest goal and most important aim, by means of which hearts find comfort and illumination.\nHow that is done: the worshipper should focus on the meaning of the words he is uttering, so that he will think of the meaning of each verse, reflect on the commands and prohibitions, and affirm to himself that he will comply with them. If there is something concerning which he fell short in the past, he should apologize and seek forgiveness. If he comes to a verse that mentions mercy, he should feel hopeful and ask Allah for it; if he comes to a verse that mentions punishment, he should feel concerned and seek refuge with Allah from it; if he comes to a verse that glorifies Allah, he should declare Allah to be above all shortcomings and glorify Him; if he comes to a verse in which there is a supplication, he should turn to Allah and ask of Him.\nEnd quote from al-Itqaan (1/369).\nWith regard to interacting with the meaning of the verses in general terms, there is nothing wrong with that, such as when a person understands the meaning of a verse and feels moved by it, so he says Subhaan Allah (Glory be to Allah) or similar words which show that the verse has had an impact on him, saying words that are appropriate to the context and meaning of the verse.\nBut that is on condition that he does not burden himself with doing that (rather it should come naturally). For we are forbidden to go out of our way to do something that we find burdensome. Moreover, obliging ourselves to say words, even if it is glorification of Allah (tasbeeh) or supplication (du‘aa’), every time we come to a verse could interrupt the attention of the one who is listening to the one who says that, if he is listening to the recitation of someone else, or it could interrupt the flow of his recitation, if he himself is the one who is reciting.\nWith regard to interacting with the meanings of the verses in prayer, Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: The best is to remain silent and listen attentively, when the imam is reciting in Maghrib, ‘Isha’ and Fajr, or in Jumu‘ah. The best is to remain silent and listen attentively, so you should not say tasbeeh when hearing the verses that mention glorifying Allah or proclaiming His oneness, and you should not say salawaat when a verse mentions the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So when the Qur'an is recited, then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy” [al-A‘raaf 7:204]. So the best is to listen attentively. But if one sends blessings on the Prophet, or says Subhaan Allah when the names of Allah are mentioned, there is nothing wrong with that, although it is better not to do it, because what is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is that when he recited in a prayer in which recitation is done out loud, he did not pause when he came to a verse that mentions mercy, or a verse that contains a warning, or a verse that mentions the names and attributes of Allah. Rather he would carry on reciting. Therefore it is better for you to listen and not pause or say anything when the imam comes to these verses when he is reciting, or for you to do that when you are reciting in an obligatory prayer.\nIn the case of supererogatory prayers, however, the matter is broader in scope, such as when praying tahajjud at night and the like. When you are reciting, you may pause at a verse that mentions mercy and ask Allah for mercy; and at a verse that mentions a warning and seek refuge with Allah; and at verses which mention the names of Allah and glorify Him; and at verses which mention the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and send blessings on him, and so on. This also applies if you are praying behind an imam in prayers such as Taraweeh and qiyaam in Ramadaan; if the imam pauses to offer supplication, you may offer supplication; or if he pauses to send blessings upon the Prophet, you may also send blessings upon him. But if he carries on reciting, you should keep quiet and listen attentively, because you are enjoined to listen attentively.\nEnd quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, ash-Shuway‘ir (12/351).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 85481 and 96028 .\nConclusion:\nBecause this is something that is narrated as a Sunnah practice, to ask for mercy when coming to verses that mention mercy, and seeking refuge with Allah when coming to verses that mention punishment, and glorifying Allah when coming to verses that mention glorifying Him, then it is something that is undoubtedly prescribed, outside of prayer.\nWhen one is praying, however, it is prescribed in general terms, although the scholars differed as to whether that applies only to the supererogatory prayers, because that is what is mentioned in the Sunnah, or whether it may be applied by analogy to the obligatory prayers too, which is the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baaz and other scholars, as has been explained previously on our website.\nAs for going beyond that, and working out a supplication for every verse, what appears to be the case is that this is not prescribed, especially in the prayer, because of what it involves of overburdening oneself, interrupting the flow of recitation and not listening attentively to it.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Interacting with the meanings of the Qur'an while reciting it is a highly recommended and encouraged practice in Islam. Here are some important points to consider regarding this interaction:\n\n1. **Intention (Niyyah)**: Before reciting the Qur'an, it is essential to have a sincere intention of engaging with the divine message. This intention can enhance understanding and reflection.\n\n2. **Understanding and Reflection**: It is important to strive to understand the meanings of the verses being recited. This can involve studying the Tafsir (interpretation) of the Qur'an and reflecting on how the guidance applies to one’s life.\n\n3. **Presence of Heart (Khushu)**: Maintaining focus and humility while reciting is crucial. This means being present mentally and emotionally, allowing the heart to connect deeply with the words and their implications.\n\n4. **Meditation on Verses**: One can pause during recitation to ponder over specific verses, especially those that resonate or provoke thought. This contemplation helps to internalize the lessons and apply them practically.\n\n5. **Praying for Guidance**: As you recite, it is beneficial to make du'a (supplication) for understanding and guidance in implementing the teachings of the Qur'an.\n\n6. **Regular Recitation**: Consistency in reciting the Qur'an while engaging with its meanings can lead to spiritual growth and a stronger relationship with Allah. It is not only about reading but also living by the principles enshrined in the Qur'an.\n\n7. **Implementing the Teachings**: One of the most significant ways to interact with the Qur'an's meanings is to put them into practice in daily life. This includes implementing ethical teachings, moral guidance, and laws.\n\nIn summary, interacting with the meanings of the Qur'an during recitation enriches the experience and fosters a deeper spiritual connection. It encourages believers to not only recite the words but also to embody their wisdom in everyday life."

        "question": "The honour of being connected to the Qur’an",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah has described the Qur’an in various ways, including describing it as a mighty Book , as He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Indeed, those who disbelieve in the message after it has come to them. And indeed, it is a mighty Book. \nFalsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it; [it is] a revelation from a [Lord who is] Wise and Praiseworthy” [Fussilat 41:41-42].\nAnd He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Qaf. By the honored Qur'an” [Qaaf 50:1].\nAnd there are many other descriptions of it.\nThe one who adheres to the Qur’an will attain honour and high status because of his adherence to the Qur’an. In the hadith narrated by Muslim (817) from ‘Aamir ibn Waathilah, it says that Naafi‘ ibn ‘Abd al-Haarith met ‘Umar in ‘Usfaan, and ‘Umar had appointed him as governor of Makkah. He said: Whom did you appoint over the people of the valley? He said: Ibn Abza. He said: Who is Ibn Abza? He said: One of our freed slaves. He said: You have appointed a freed slave over them?! He said: He is well versed in the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and he has knowledge of the shares of inheritance that are prescribed in Islam. ‘Umar said: Your Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah raises some in status by means of this Book and He lowers others by means of it.”\nThe point is that being connected to the Qur’an is an honour for the one who is connected to it and it raises him in status, no matter what the nature of that connection to the Book of Allah, whether it is in writing, calligraphy, uttering, memorizing, reciting, learning or acting upon it. Every kind of connection to the Book of Allah and occupying oneself and one’s time with it is an honour for him and raises him in status in this world and the hereafter, commensurate with the level of this connection, for Allah has set a measure for all things.\nIt does not seem to us that there is any problem with the idea that the fact that the Qur’an was revealed in Makkah was an honour for the sacred land of Allah, and that the fact that it was revealed in Ramadan was an honour for the month of Ramadan, and that the fact that the Qur’an was revealed to the heart of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was an honour that Allah bestowed upon him, and that the fact that the Qur’an was borne from heaven, from the Lord of the Worlds, was an honour to its bearer, the trustworthy angel (Jibreel – peace be upon him). For the Qur’an is the noblest of speech; it is the words of the Lord of the worlds.\nHowever, it is incorrect to say that these are the only reasons for honour, or that the honour is limited only to that, regardless of how one may think of it, because this is a kind of speaking about Allah without knowledge, and it is also far-fetched, and there is no need for that.\nIn fact it is incorrect to think that the revelation of the Qur’an was the beginning of honour for each of those mentioned.\nJibreel was the best of the angels, the envoy of the Lord of the Worlds to His prophets, before he was sent down with the Qur’an.\nMakkah, the sacred land of Allah, was made a sanctuary by Ibraaheem, and its honourable status was established before the Qur’an was revealed.\nAllah’s Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was already the leader of the sons of Adam, the last of the prophets, when Adam was still in the form of clay.\nThe most that can be said is that one of the causes of honour is being connected to the Book of Allah, for everyone who is connected to it, in whatever way, as mentioned above.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the Qur'an is regarded as the holy book and the word of God (Allah) revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Angel Gabriel. The honour of being connected to the Qur'an is immense and multifaceted. \n\n1. **Guidance for Humanity**: The Qur'an serves as a guide for all aspects of life, offering wisdom, moral teachings, and guidance on personal and communal matters. Being connected to the Qur'an means one is receiving divine guidance that can lead to righteousness and a fulfilling life.\n\n2. **Memorization (Hifz)**: Those who memorize the Qur'an are given a special status in the community. They are often referred to as \"Hafiz\" or \"Hafiza,\" which translates to \"guardian\" of the Qur'an. This act of memorization is highly revered and seen as a way to draw closer to Allah.\n\n3. **Recitation**: The act of reciting the Qur'an (Tilawah) is an important form of worship. The beauty of its recitation invokes spiritual reflection and tranquility. Being able to recite the Qur'an, especially with proper tajweed (rules of recitation), is considered a great honour and an important skill in Islam.\n\n4. **Teaching and Spreading Knowledge**: Those who engage in teaching the Qur'an also hold a respected position in the Muslim community. They contribute to the preservation and dissemination of Islamic knowledge.\n\n5. **Intercession on the Day of Judgment**: According to various Hadiths, the Qur'an will intercede for those who adhered to it and lived by its teachings on the Day of Judgment.\n\n6. **Connection to Allah**: Being connected to the Qur'an fosters a deeper relationship with Allah. It encourages believers to reflect on His words, understand His message, and strive to implement its teachings in their lives.\n\nThus, the honour of being connected to the Qur'an encompasses spiritual, educational, and personal dimensions, making it a cornerstone of a Muslim's faith and practice."

        "question": "Can You Pray Tarawih Alone?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can you pray tarawih alone?\nIt is prescribed to offer the night prayers in Ramadan in congregation or individually, but it is better to do it in congregation than to do it individually. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led his Companions in offering these prayers in congregation on several nights. \nIt is proven in al-Sahihayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led his Companions in prayer (Tarawih ) for several nights, then on the third or fourth night he did not come out to them. When morning came he said: “Nothing prevented me from coming out to you except the fact that I feared that it would be made obligatory for you.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1129)\nAccording to the version narrated by Muslim (761): “But I feared that night prayers would be made obligatory for you and you would not be able to do them.” \nOffering Tarawih prayer in congregation\nOffering Tarawih prayer in congregation is something that is established by the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated the reason why he did not persist in offering this prayer in congregation, which is that he feared that it might be made obligatory. This reason ceased to be applicable after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, because when he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, the revelation ceased and there was no longer any worry that it might be made obligatory. Once the reason, which was the fear of it being made obligatory, disappeared with the cessation of the revelation, then the fact that it is Sunnah to offer this prayer in congregation resumed.  (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 4/78) \nImam Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“This indicates that praying qiyam in Ramadan is one of the Sunnahs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and is recommended and encouraged. It was not introduced by ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, rather he revived something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) loved and approved of. Nothing stopped him from doing it regularly except the fear that it might be made obligatory upon his ummah. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was kind and compassionate towards his ummah. ‘Umar knew from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the obligatory duties would not be increased or decreased after his death (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so he revived this practice and enjoined it upon the people. That happened in 14 AH, and ‘Umar has the honour of being the one who revived this Sunnah.” (Al-Tamhid, 8/108, 109) \nAfter the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) prayed Tarawih in small groups and individually, until ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) united them behind a single imam. \nIt was narrated that ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Abd al-Qari said: I went out with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) one night in Ramadan to the mosque , and the people were scattered, with one man praying by himself and another with a group of men following his prayer. ‘Umar said: “I think that if I gather them behind one reader, it will be better.” Then he decided to unite them behind Ubayy ibn Ka’b. Then I went out with him on another night, and the people were praying behind their reader. ‘Umar said: “What a good innovation this is. But the prayer that they forget about and sleep is better than the one they are offering.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1906) \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, when refuting the view of those who quoted ‘Umar’s words “What a good innovation this is” as meaning that innovation (bid`ah) is permissible: \nWith regard to qiyam in Ramadan , the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) introduced this to his ummah, and he led them in prayer for a number of nights, because at his time they used to pray in congregation and individually. But he did not persist in leading them in one congregation, lest that be made obligatory for them. \nWhen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, the Shari`ah was established (and would not change after that). When ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) became caliph, he united them behind one imam, Ubayy ibn Ka’b, who united the people in one congregation on the orders of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him). ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was one of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, of whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs after me; cling tightly to it.” So what he did was Sunnah but he said, “What a good innovation this is,” because it was an innovation in the linguistic sense, as they were doing something that they had not done during the life of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), i.e., gathering to do this, but it is Sunnah in the Shar`i sense.”  (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/234, 235) \nIs completing the Quran in Ramadan sunnah?\nCompleting the Quran in Ramadan , whether during prayer or outside prayer, is something that is praiseworthy. Jibril (peace be upon him) used to review the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) every Ramadan, and in the Prophet’s last year he reviewed it with him twice. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, you can pray Tarawih alone. While it is highly recommended to pray Tarawih in congregation at the mosque during the month of Ramadan, it is not obligatory. If you are unable to go to the mosque for any reason, you can perform the Tarawih prayer at home by yourself. The important thing is to maintain the spirit of worship during this blessed month."

        "question": "Verses that are entirely clear (muhkam) and verses that are not entirely clear (mutashaabih) in the Holy Qur’aan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“It is He Who has sent down to you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) the Book (this Qur’aan). In it are Verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book [and those are the Verses of Al-Ahkaam (commandments), Al-Faraa’id (obligatory duties) and Al-Hudood (laws for the punishment of thieves, adulterers)]; and others not entirely clear. So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah (polytheism and trials), and seeking for its hidden meanings, but none knows its hidden meanings save Allaah. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: “We believe in it; the whole of it (clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord.” And none receive admonition except men of understanding”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:7]\nWhat is meant is that the Qur’aan contains verses that are entirely clear and verses that are not entirely clear. The entirely clear verses (muhkam) are those which are clear and concerning which there is no confusion; this applies to most of the verses of the Qur’aan. These verses are the “foundations of the Book”. As for the verses which are not entirely clear (mutashaabih) these are verses which may not be clear to some people, in exclusion to others. The scholars know them but the ignorant do not, and there are some which only Allaah knows. \nThose who follow the truth refer the verses which are not entirely clear to the verses which are entirely clear, whereas those who follow deviation follow the verses which are not entirely clear, and they use the verses which are not entirely clear to contradict the verses which are entirely clear, for the purpose of creating confusion, distorting and misleading. \nIbn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (2/6): Allaah tells us that in the Qur’aan there are verses which are entirely clear, which are the foundation of the Book, i.e., they are clear in meaning, with no confusion for anyone; and there are other verses which are not entirely clear as to what they mean for many or some people. The one who refers that which is unclear to him to that which is clear, and uses the clear verses to understand what is not clear to him, will be guided. But the one who does the opposite will be misguided. Hence Allaah says: “It is He Who has sent down to you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) the Book (this Qur’aan). In it are Verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book” i.e., they are the root to which reference should be made in the event of confusion; “and others not entirely clear” i.e., they could be interpreted in accordance with those that are entirely clear or they could be interpreted in some other way, based on the wording and the way they are written, not according to the meaning. \n“So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation”, i.e., misguidance, and ignoring the truth in favour of falsehood, “they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof” i.e., they interpret that which is not entirely clear in such a way that allows them to distort it to suit their corrupt aims, because the wording could be interpreted in the way they want. But in the case of the verses which are entirely clear, they have no chance of doing that, so that is clear proof against them. Hence Allaah says: “seeking Al-Fitnah (polytheism and trials)” i.e., to misguide their followers and give them the impression that they are using evidence from the Qur’aan to support their bid’ah (innovation). This is evidence against them, not for them. It is similar to when the Christians argue that the Qur’aan says that ‘Eesa (Jesus) is a Spirit from God and His Word that He bestowed upon Maryam (Mary), but they ignore the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“He [‘Eesa (Jesus)] was not more than a slave. We granted Our Favour to him …”\n[al-Zukhruf 43:59]  \n“Verily, the likeness of ‘Eesa (Jesus) before Allaah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!’ — and he was”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:59]\n-- and other clear verses which unambiguously show that he was one of the creatures created by Allaah, and a slave of Allaah, and one of the Messengers of Allaah. \nAnd the words “and seeking for its hidden meanings” mean, they distort it as they wish. \nEnd quote. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:\nAllaah, may He be blessed and exalted, has divided the Holy Qur’aan into two categories: the verses which are entirely clear and those which are not entirely clear. What is meant by those which are entirely clear is that the meaning is clear and obvious to everyone, like the heavens and earth, stars, mountains, trees, animals and so on. This is entirely clear because there is no ambiguity in its meaning. The verses which are not entirely clear are those of which the meaning is ambiguous or unknown to most people, and is known only to those who are well-versed in knowledge, such as some verses which are general in meaning and do not give details, but they are explained in detail in the Sunnah. An example is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And perform As-Salaah [prayer]”\n[al-Baqarah 2:43]. \nHow prayer is to be performed is not known from this verse; all that is known from it is that it is obligatory to perform prayer. But how that is to be done is known from other evidence. The wisdom behind the fact that the Qur'aan was revealed with verses of these two types is that this is a test, because those in whose hearts is deviation will follow that which is not entirely clear and will thus remain confused. But those who are well-versed in knowledge believe in all of it, both that which is not entirely clear and that which is entirely clear; they know that it is from Allaah and that there is no contradiction in it. An example of verses that are not entirely clear are the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“There will then be (left) no Fitnah (excuses or statements or arguments) for them but to say: ‘By Allaah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allaah’”\n[al-An’aam 6:23]. \n“On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will wish that they were buried in the earth, but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allaah”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:42]\nSomeone may come along and say that they contradict one another. How can they say “By Allaah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allaah”, then it is said of them that “they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allaah”? They quote the verses against one another in order to confuse people. But those who are well-versed in knowledge say: It is all from Allaah and there is no contradiction in the words of Allaah. They said: The Day of Resurrection will be as long as fifty thousand years, and things will change throughout that Day. The first verse is applicable to one stage and the second verse is applicable to another.\nEnd quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb. \nAnd he also said: As for the people of misguidance and deviance, they followed the verses which are not entirely clear and made them a cause to create doubt and suspicion, so they were misguided and misguided others. They imagined, on the basis of verses that are not entirely clear, something that is not befitting to Allaah or His Book or His Messenger. \nAn example of the first is the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We give life to the dead” [Yaa-Seen 36:12] and “Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9] – and other verses in which Allaah attributes something to Himself using the plural pronoun (We). The Christians followed that which is not entirely clear and claimed a plurality of gods, saying that Allaah is the third of three, and they ignored that which is entirely clear and indicates that Allaah is One.  \nBut those who are well-versed in knowledge interpreted the plural pronoun as being in terms of respect for the numerous attributes of Allaah and their greatness. They referred the verses that are not entirely clear to that which is entirely clear (interpretation of the meaning): “And your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God — Allaah), Laa Ilaaha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He)” [al-Baqarah 2:163]. So they say to the Christians: The claim you make is because of the confusion that you have, so Allaah has deemed you to be kaafirs (disbelievers) and has rejected your claim when you said that. Listen to the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Surely, disbelievers are those who said: “Allaah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).” But there is no Ilaah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilaah (God —Allaah)” [al-Maa'idah 5:73] i.e., they disbelieved when they said that God is the third of three.  \nAn example of the second is the verses in which Allaah says to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily, you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) guide not whom you like”\n[al-Qasas 28:56]. \nAnd\n“And verily, you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e. Allaah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism)”\n[al-Shoora 42:52]. \nIn these two verses there is an imagined contradiction, so the one who has deviation in his heart may think that they contradict one another, because in the first verse there is a negation and in the second there is an affirmation. So he thinks that there is a contradiction in the Qur’aan. \nBut those who are well-versed in knowledge say that there is no contradiction between these two verses, because what is meant by guidance in the first verse is guidance by means of divine help or inspiration, which no one has control over except Allaah alone; neither the Messenger nor anyone else has any power over that. And what is meant by guidance in the second verse is guidance on the basis of evidence and proof, which may come from Allaah or from others, so it may come from the Messengers and their heirs, meaning the sincere scholars.\nEnd quote from Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (4/186). \nThese are all examples of relative ambiguity which some people may not be able to understand, but those who are well-versed in knowledge understand it. As for the verses which are not entirely clear and which no one knows except Allaah, these have to do with matters such as the essence and nature of Allaah’s attributes, or the essence of what is with Allaah of the delight of the people of Paradise and the torment for those who disobey Him. All of that is known to no one except Allaah. \nSecondly: \n Whoever is confused about any of the verses which are not entirely clear should try to understand it in the light of that which is entirely clear, if he is a scholar who is able to use evidence in order to reach conclusions. Otherwise he should ask the scholars, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“So ask of those who know the Scripture, if you know not”\n[al-Nahl 16:43]. \nWhatever the case, let him say (interpretation of the meaning): “We believe in it; the whole of it (clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:7].  \nSome of the heretics and deviants, in the past and in modern times, tried to seek out everything in the Qur'aan and Sunnah that is not entirely clear (al-mutashaabih), for the purpose of creating confusion and doubt.. But the scholars rose to this challenge and wrote beneficial books which refute these doubts. An example of that is the book which was written by Ibn Qutaybah (may Allaah have mercy on him), entitled Ta’weel Mukhtalif al-Hadeeth; and the book by Shaykh al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) entitled Daf’ Eehaam al-Idtiraab ‘an Aayi’l-Kitaab. \n, there is no contradiction between the verses of the Qur’aan, or between the Sunnah and the Qur’aan, because it is all from Allaah, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:82]. \nWe ask Allaah to guide us and you and to grant us all beneficial knowledge and enable us all to do righteous deeds. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the context of the Qur'an, verses are categorized into two main types based on their clarity and meaning: **Muhkam** and **Mutashaabih**.\n\n1. **Muhkam (المحكم)**: These are verses that have clear and explicit meanings. They are straightforward and do not require further interpretation. The guidance provided by these verses is direct, and they are often considered fundamental principles of the Islamic faith. An example of a muhkam verse is the declaration of the oneness of God found in Surah Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112), and the verses that establish the pillars of Islam.\n\n2. **Mutashaabih (المتشابه)**: These verses, on the other hand, have meanings that are not entirely clear or may be open to multiple interpretations. They can contain parables, allegorical language, or concepts that require deeper understanding or scholarly interpretation. An example of mutashaabih verses can be found in references to the unseen, such as descriptions of Paradise and Hell or certain attributes of Allah that are beyond human comprehension.\n\nThe Qur'an itself references this distinction in Surah Al-Imran (3:7):\n\n> \"It is He who has sent down to you the Book; in it are verses that are clear (muhkam) — they are the foundation of the Book — and others, ambiguous (mutashaabih). But those in whose hearts is deviation pursue that which is ambiguous seeking discord and seeking an interpretation. But no one knows its interpretation except Allah.\"\n\nMuslim scholars advise that while engaging with the Qur'an, one focuses on the muhkam verses for directing doctrinal beliefs and ethical practice, while approaching the mutashaabih with caution and an understanding that ultimate knowledge belongs to Allah alone. It is also important to seek guidance from established scholars for proper interpretation of mutashaabih verses."

        "question": "When Was Surat al-Fatihah Revealed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.When was Suat Al-Fatihah revealed?\nSurat al-Fatihah is one of the Makkan surahs [i.e., revealed during the Makkan period, before the Hijrah], according to the majority of scholars. The scholars quoted several things as evidence for it being classified as Makkan, including the following:\n\nThere is a great deal of sahih (sound) evidence to support this view, including the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have certainly given you, [O Muhammad], seven of the often repeated [verses] and the great Quran” [Al-Hijr 15:87]\n\nThis verse from Surat al-Hijr is Makkan according to scholarly consensus. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained the “seven often repeated [verses]” as referring to Surat al-Fatihah, which implies that al-Fatihah was revealed during the Makkan period. \n\nPrayer was enjoined in Makkah , and prayer is not valid without Surat al-Fatihah .\n\nIn fact, some of the scholars were of the view that al-Fatihah was the first thing to be revealed, but this is a weak view.\nIbn Taymiyah said: “The Opening of the Book [i.e., Surat al-Fatihah] was undoubtedly revealed during the Makkan period.…\nThe view of those who say that al-Fatihah was not revealed until the Madinan period is undoubtedly wrong.” (Majmu‘ al-Fatawa, 17/190-191)\nA number of well-versed scholars – such as Ibn Taymiyah, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Hajar, al-Baydawi, al-Kawashi, and others – preferred the view that Surat al-Fatihah was revealed during the Makkan period. (See: al-Makki wa’l-Madani by ‘Abd ar-Razzaq Husayn, 1/446-468)\nWas Surat al-Fatihah revealed before enjoining prayer?\nAl-Qurtubi said in al-Jami‘ li Ahkam al-Quran (1/115): \n“There is no difference of opinion concerning the fact that prayer was enjoined in Makkah , and there is no report to suggest that there was a time when Muslims offered their prayers without “al-hamdu Lillahi Rabbi l-‘alamin”. This is indicated by the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, “There is no prayer except with the Opening of the Book.” This is speaking about the ruling, not when it began. And Allah knows best.”\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Surat al-Fatihah, also known as \"The Opening,\" is the first chapter of the Qur'an and is considered a foundational prayer in Islam. It was revealed in Mecca during the early period of Muhammad's prophethood. Scholars generally agree that it was one of the first revelations, although specific dates are not clearly documented. It is often placed towards the beginning of the Meccan period, which lasted approximately from 610 to 622 CE."

        "question": "The Mus-haf (Quran) that we have today is that on which there was consensus among the Sahaabah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nFirst of all, we would like to share with the questioner our experience with this type of inquiry, because we have found that those who are behind such queries are usually people who specialize in mixing issues in order to cause confusion, and try to reach a definite conclusion that the idea of the preservation of the Quran is completely incorrect and unfounded, and that no one can prove whether the Mus-hafs that we have nowadays are the word of Allah, may He be glorified, or not. This is a dangerous slippery slope.\nThere is one idea that could prove the point, which is that even if we assume – for the sake of argument – that some verses and soorahs that were recited at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were not written in the Mus-haf, for one reason or another, that does not mean that everything that has reached us of the Quran is false and incorrect – Allah forbid.\nAnother idea that could prove the point is the fact that by always assuming that in any process of large-scale historical transmission – such as the transmission of the Quran, the number of verses of which are in the thousands, and these verses were also transmitted by thousands of the Sahaabah, and it was written down on thousands of slates, skins, pieces of other material and so on – it is inevitable that historical reports will tell us that there were some small errors on the part of one or some of the transmitters, or there were some debates between them, or that there were small variations between others. This is something that invariably happens, without a doubt, in the process of transmission or memorization.\nAs for distortion, however, that is done by people of whims and desires, who try to twist the facts and try to confuse non-specialists, so they regard such issues as evidence of the Quran “being distorted”, or that its transmission process is not credible.\nThey forget that the Quran was transmitted to us – in the version that we have nowadays, with the same script, shape and way of writing – through hundreds of thousands of proven, sound chains of narration that are spread throughout the Muslim world, and that the copies of the Quran that have chains of narration going all the way back to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are innumerable and are housed in libraries throughout the world. If huge academic institutions were to be established to list all these chains of transmission, Mus-hafs and books, and to collect evidence to prove that the Quran was narrated via tawaatur [i.e., it was transmitted from so many by so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a mistake], that would not be possible.\nIf we think that this will undermine the credibility of the transmission of the Quran, and that makes us think that there were additions and subtractions to it, then in that case we are rejecting all the rules and standards on how to judge a text from an academic point of view, and we are dismissing all the proven ways of sound transmission, and we are dismissing all that was transmitted of the legacy and history of nations, because of one report here or there that we did not reflect upon or understand properly, and we did not know the right way to approach it. There is no criticism that was mentioned in the context of the topic under discussion, regardless of how sound and correct it may be when subjected to examination, but it would be possible to find many more criticisms like it, whether of the same type or otherwise, to that which people transmitted of reports, knowledge, history and the ancient legacy, all of which came to us through transmission. Moreover, the transmission of the Quran – and indeed, the Sunnah too – was clearly undertaken by trustworthy narraters, and this transmission is proven to be sound, in a manner that is not applicable in the case of any other book or report.\nPerhaps the questioner will agree with us, that it is very strange and amazing to find someone who believes that the Quran is the word of Allah, the Creator of all things, the controller of all things, the Creator of all the wonders of this universe, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, and He has power over all things, yet despite all that he finds it unacceptable that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, should decree that the recitation of a few verses be abrogated, or that the rulings thereof be abrogated, or that both the recitation and ruling thereof be abrogated.\nIs not Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, the one Who sent down these verses, Who spoke these words, the one Who issued the rulings mentioned? So why can he not understand and accept the idea that Allah, may He be glorified, may decree that some of these words be removed from the pages of the Mus-haf, yet remain part of His holy words, just as the Torah and Gospel are words and commands of Allah, yet despite that, the Quran abrogated both of them, yet what is remains of the Torah and Gospel that has not been distorted is still to be venerated and appreciated, on the grounds that it is the word of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted?\nWhat harm is there in any of that?\nWe can see an example of this issue in this world, in anyone who writes a book or composes a speech. He may take out (or “abrogate”) something that he had mentioned in his book, or he may change the order of the ideas of what is mentioned in the book. How could anyone think that this is the right of a weak, created individual, yet some people think that it is a shortcoming in the case of the Creator, may He be glorified and exalted!\nIf someone were to say that abrogation means that Allah realized that there were some shortcomings and problems in what was already there, then He decided to abrogate it and present the verse or soorah in a new way, the response to that is: This is proof that this person does not understand the issue of abrogation in the first place. All that abrogation of recitation means is simply that the verse is no longer part of the Quran, and that reciting it is no longer to be regarded as an act of worship, although its ruling remains in effect, or that the verse is no longer to be regarded as part of the Quran and its ruling is to be abrogated also, although it is still regarded as being the words of Allah.\nIt is well-known that worshipping Allah in a particular manner is a matter that is not subject to rational thinking in the first place, so how can anyone object by saying that abrogation of the recitation of the verse means that it became clear that there was some shortcoming or problem with it.\nOn our website, in the answer to question no. 105746 . we have given some examples of verses of which the recitation was abrogated, and we have quoted what the scholars of said about the great wisdom behind this type of abrogation.\nThirdly:\nOnce you understand the above, it will become clear that what the scholars of Sunnah said about the verse of stoning, the recitation of which was abrogated whilst the ruling remains in effect, comes under the heading of abrogation (naskh), which has already been discussed and guidelines concerning it have been explained above, and there is a clear reference to it in the Quran itself, in the verses in which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?\nDo you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and [that] you have not besides Allah any protector or any helper?”\n[al-Baqarah 2:106-107].\nFor more detailed information on what was narrated concerning the verse of stoning, please see the answers to questions no. 179886.\nFourthly:\nSimilarly, we may say that there was no difference among the Sahaabah concerning the Quran. Rather some people think that there was a dispute among them because they saw that some of the Sahaabah wrote some interpretations and explanations in their own Mus-hafs, whilst other Sahaabah were still keeping these verses of which the recitation had been abrogated. Therefore they thought – by mistake or deliberately – that this was a real difference of opinion among the Sahaabah concerning the Quran, when in fact it was not a difference of opinion at all; rather it was, as noted above, a commentary and explanation written by the Sahaabi in his own personal copy. Therefore some people distorted this fact, trying to give the impression that it was part of the Quran, or it was verses and soorahs that had been abrogated, but this Sahaabi did not erase them from his own personal copy, in order to remember them and act on the ruling, but he knew and accepted that he could not recite them as an act of worship.\nFor more details concerning these matters, please see questions no. 178209, 195880 and 197942.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Mus-haf (Qur'an) that we have today is indeed based on a consensus among the Sahaabah (companions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). After the death of the Prophet, there was a need to compile the Qur'an into a single, standardized written text to preserve its integrity and ensure its accurate recitation.\n\nDuring the caliphate of Abu Bakr (the first caliph), after the Battle of Yamama, where many Qur'an memorizers were martyred, it was suggested that the Qur'an be compiled into a book form. Zaid ibn Thabit, one of the scribes of the Prophet, was tasked with this project. This compilation was based on written fragments and the recitations of those who had memorized the Qur'an.\n\nLater, during the caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan (the third caliph), a standardized mus-haf was produced to resolve differences in recitation among various communities. Uthman ordered the creation of several copies of this standardized Quran, and all other variant texts were ordered to be burned to prevent discrepancies. This version is what is now known as the Uthmanic codex and is the basis for all copies of the Qur'an around the world today.\n\nThus, the Qur'an as we have it today is indeed a result of the collective effort and consensus of the Sahaabah to ensure the preservation and uniformity of the divine message."

        "question": "Ruling on deliberately making mistakes in recitation of Qur’an for the purpose of teaching",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to deliberately make mistakes when reciting the Holy Qur’an, even if that is for the purpose of teaching, because it is distorting the words of Allah, may He be exalted, and because of the possibility that the mistake may become fixed in the mind of the listener.\nIt says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (35/214): The Qur’an is the miraculous words of Allah that was sent down to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and was transmitted by tawaatur [i.e., it was transmitted from so many by so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a mistake].\nIt is haraam to deliberately mispronounce it, whether that changes the meaning or not, because its words and phrases are tawqeefi [not subject to change] and it was transmitted to us by tawaatur. Therefore it is not permissible to change any word or phrase in it by changing the vowels at the end of words, or by changing its letters by switching letters around. End quote.\nIt says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (vol. 3, 2/219): What is the ruling on deliberately making mistakes in recitation of the Holy Qur’an when teaching, so as to draw the student’s attention to that? We visited a teacher in the company of the educational supervisor, and he approved of this method of teaching and asked us to do it, but we refused to do that, because this method is not usually used in teaching, and because the mistake may become deeply rooted in the students’ minds [thinking that this is correct], and you know how easily things may become entrenched in children’s minds when they are very young; the students are no older than eight or nine. Please advise us, may Allah reward you.\nAnswer: Deliberately making mistakes in recitation of the Holy Qur’an when training students, for the purpose of drawing their attention to that, is not known from any of the righteous early generations who conveyed the Holy Qur’an and taught it to people. Teaching the Qur’an to learners is an act of worship by means of which one may draw closer to Allah, may He be exalted, so it is not permissible to do it in any manner other than the correct manner.\nThe Qur’an teacher may pose questions to his students to help them to memorize better, and to deal with any mispronunciations. If he does that, there will be no need to deliberately distort the verse when reciting it to the student.\nAnd Allah is the source of strength.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the recitation of the Qur'an (Tajwid) is a significant practice, and it is important to recite it correctly. However, when it comes to teaching, the intention behind making deliberate mistakes should be carefully considered.\n\nGenerally, the preferred approach is to strive for correct recitation when teaching the Qur'an. Deliberately making mistakes can lead to confusion among students and may not convey the correct understanding of the text. If a teacher does make mistakes, it is usually encouraged to clarify these errors immediately to ensure that students can learn the proper pronunciation and rules of Tajwid.\n\nIf a teacher feels that demonstrating a mistake could be pedagogically beneficial, they should ensure that it is done in a clear context, with the understanding that the correct recitation is ultimately what is being taught. This helps students learn what not to do while also reinforcing the correct way.\n\nIn summary, while some educators may use mistakes as a teaching tool, it is important to clarify and emphasize correct recitation to maintain the integrity of the Qur'an and its recitation. The ultimate goal is to teach and encourage proper recitation and understanding of the Qur'an."

        "question": "Ruling on reading a commentary on the Qur’an whilst praying",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe questioner should look at the commentary on the verses that he is going to recite in the prayer outside of the prayer first, i.e., before starting to pray, so that he will be free to focus on his recitation and reflect on the meanings.\nIbn Katheer said: The verse “and stand before Allah, devoutly obedient” [al-Baqarah 2:238] means: with humility, humbling oneself before Him. This requires not speaking whilst praying, because that defeats the purpose. Hence, when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not return the greeting of Ibn Mas‘ood when the latter greeted him when he was praying, he apologized to him for that, and said: “Prayer is a preoccupation.”\nEnd quote from at-Tafseer (1/654).\nThe hadith was narrated by al-Bukhaari (1216).\nSecondly:\nThe fuqaha’ stated that reading in books whilst praying is makrooh, although some of them said that there is nothing wrong with it, subject to two conditions:\n\nThat he be only looking at the tafseer, and not moving his lips whilst reading;\nit should not require a great deal of movement, such as picking up the book, opening it, and turning the pages, because a great deal of movement invalidates the prayer.\n\nImam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he reads Qur’an from the Mus-haf, that does not invalidate his prayer, whether he has memorized it or not. Rather that is obligatory in his case if he has not memorized al-Faatihah, as noted above. If he turns over the pages sometimes whilst praying, that does not invalidate the prayer.\nIf he looks at anything written that is not Qur’an and reads it to himself, that does not invalidate his prayer, even if he does that at length, but it is makrooh (disliked). This was stated by ash-Shaafa‘i.\nEnd quote from al-Majmoo‘ (4/95). See also: Rawdat at-Taalibeen (1/294).\nAl-Mirdaawi said in al-Insaaf: The prayer is not invalidated by a lengthy looking at a book, if he reads it in his heart and does not move his lips, according to the correct view, which was deemed to be more correct in al-Furoo‘ and elsewhere. The author and others said: This is our view. It was narrated from Imam Ahmad that he did that.\nAnd it was said that it does invalidate the prayer. This was stated by a number of our companions, including Ibn Haamid.\nEnd quote (3/616).\nConclusion:\nPrayer is not invalidated by looking in a Mus-haf in which there is commentary on Qur’an, and the like, on condition that the worshipper does not move his lips when reading anything except Qur’an. Rather, if he looks at the meaning and thinks of it, there is nothing wrong with that, if he needs to do it.\nHowever, what he should do is to avoid all of that completely, and when he is praying behind an imam, he should be content with listening attentively to his imam and following his recitation. If he is leading the prayer or is praying alone, he should recite to himself whatever he can, and he should not let himself be distracted by anything except reciting Qur’an and doing the actions of the prayer, because prayer should be his focus and preoccupation, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said.\nSee also the answers to questions no. 9505 and 125619.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In general, it is not permissible to read a commentary on the Qur'an (Tafsir) while performing the prayer (Salah). The prayer is an act of worship that requires full concentration and is specifically established for the recitation of the Qur'an and prayer-related actions. \n\nThe primary focus during Salah should be on the recitation of the Qur'an in Arabic, the remembrance of Allah, and the physical movements of the prayer. Reading a commentary, which often requires understanding and reflection, can distract one from the appropriate focus and humility that prayer necessitates.\n\nHowever, if the commentary is being read silently in one's heart with the intention to reflect on its meanings while praying—though this is not the common practice—it is still advisable to avoid it in favor of concentrating fully on the recitation of the Qur'an.\n\nIn summary, it is best to refrain from reading Tafsir or any other form of commentary during prayer and to dedicate that time solely to the prayer itself."

        "question": "The reasons for differences in the wording of some abrogated verses",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.One of the texts which is abrogated and removed from the Mushaf is this verse: “If the son of Adam had two valleys of wealth he would desire a third, but nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust.”\nThat is because of the report narrated by Muslim (1050) from Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari who said: We used to recite a soorah which we likened in its length and strictness to Baraa’ah [Soorat at-Tawbah], then I was caused to forget it, but I remember from it the words: “If the son of Adam had two valleys of wealth he would desire a third, but nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust.”\nWe have previously discussed that in the answer to question no. 176972.\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining the different types of abrogation:\nAbrogation of the text and the ruling: It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to recite a soorah that was equal in length to Soorat at-Tawbah; I do not remember anything of it except this verse: “If the son of Adam had two valleys of gold, he would desire a third, and if he had a third, he would desire a fourth, but nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust, and Allah turns in mercy to whoever repents.”\nEnd quote from an-Naasikh wa’l-Mansookh by Ibn Hazm (p. 9).\nPerhaps the reason for the different wordings narrated for this verse is that when it was abrogated, it was no longer Qur’an, so the narrators were less careful about its wording, and were not so careful about it as they were in the case of the Qur’an or the hadith of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which they wanted to convey to those who came after them. Do you not see that Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to recite a soorah which we likened in its length and strictness to Baraa’ah [Soorat at-Tawbah], then I was caused to forget it?\nThe focus of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) was on preserving and memorizing that which was proven, in order to convey it to the people. As for that which had been abrogated, they were not very concerned with it, so it was sufficient for them and for those who narrated from them to narrate it in general terms, or to narrate the meaning, or to narrate it with less precision in some of the phrases, especially since both the text and the ruling were abrogated. If the ruling remained in effect, they would pay more attention to the wording in order to apply it.\nAl-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Then think about what the Sahaabah mentioned of the verses which were abrogated; they only mentioned the meaning and some words, not the exact wording as revealed.\nThe context and style of the Qur’an confirm what they mentioned about that, and what they narrated here is clearly far removed from the style and eloquence of the Qur’an.\nEnd quote from Ikmaal al-Mu‘lim bi Fawaa’id Muslim (3/585).\nIt may be that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said something along these lines with different wording on different occasions, on the grounds that this is a prophetic hadith, then these wordings became mixed with the wording of the abrogated verse, because of what we have noted above, or the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did not focus their attention on memorizing verses of which the text had been abrogated. Hence Anas said: I do not know whether it was something that was revealed to him or something that he said. Narrated by Muslim (1048).\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence and theology, the concept of abrogation (naskh) refers to the process by which certain verses (ayahs) of the Qur'an or rulings of earlier Islamic teachings are replaced or superseded by later verses. The differences in the wording of some abrogated verses can be attributed to several reasons:\n\n1. **Contextual Changes**: The socio-political and historical context during the time of revelation evolved significantly. Some verses were revealed in specific circumstances, and the need for certain rulings to change was based on the changing conditions faced by the Muslim community.\n\n2. **Gradual Legislation**: Islamic teachings were revealed gradually, which allowed the community to adapt slowly to the ethical, social, and legal norms. Thus, initial verses may have provided a more lenient or limited guidance that was later expanded or made more stringent according to the needs of the community.\n\n3. **Divine Wisdom**: The variations in wording and the abrogation process reflect God’s wisdom in providing guidance that is best suited for humanity's spiritual growth and societal needs at different times. These changes are seen as part of Divine knowledge and strategy to lead people towards a higher moral and ethical state.\n\n4. **Preservation of the Message**: Abrogated verses may still have significant lessons or insights, and their varied wordings help preserve the essence of the message, allowing for deeper reflection on the changes in rules and ethical standards over time.\n\n5. **Clarification and Specificity**: As laws were revealed, there often arose a need for clarification. The later verses might have used different wording to provide clearer instructions or to address specific situations more effectively.\n\n6. **Confirmation of Authority**: Changes in wording may also serve to reinforce the authority of later revelations, indicating that they are the final and definitive guidance for the Muslim community.\n\nIt is important to approach the topic of abrogation with the understanding that it emphasizes the dynamic and responsive nature of Islamic law and morality to human circumstances, rather than a rigid or static system. Scholars of tafsir (Qur'anic exegesis) and fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) study these nuances to derive relevant legal rulings and moral teachings for contemporary issues."

        "question": "Leaving a recording of the Quran playing without listening to it",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Listening to the Holy Quran and paying attention to it when it is recited is recommended according to Islamic teachings. There is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether that is obligatory, and there are two views, the more sound of which is that it is not obligatory, except in the case of prayer, when it is obligatory. This is the view of the majority of scholars.\nBut the Muslim should be keen to listen attentively when the Quran is recited, and not let his attention wander from it, except in the case of work or need. This comes under the heading of venerating and respecting the Quran. We have discussed this previously in the answer to question no. 88728.\nWith regard to leaving the broadcast of the Holy Quran playing whilst you are in the house or out of the house, awake or asleep, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as there is nothing happening at the same time that would drown it out, and there is no noise, idle talk or arguments, and so long as it is not in an inappropriate place. In such cases it is more appropriate to turn off the broadcast. This comes under the heading of venerating and respecting the Quran, which is something enjoined and encouraged.\nShaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on having a radio or cassette recorder playing the Holy Quran in the house, when going out of the house to visit family or relatives?\nHe replied: There is nothing wrong with that, so long as there is no idle talk going on around it. If there is someone nearby who is engaging in idle talk and speaking and arguing, then that is not right; it is better not to leave the radio on in that case, and it should be turned off, because that is a kind of showing disrespect towards the Quran. But if the radio is on when there is no one around, or there is someone who is listening, or keeping quiet, or sleeping, then there is nothing wrong with it. End quote.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, playing a recording of the Quran without actively listening to it raises a discussion about intention and respect for the sacred text. The Quran is meant to be recited, listened to, and understood, and many scholars emphasize the importance of engaging with it purposefully.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Respect for the Quran**: The Quran is considered the literal word of Allah, and Muslims are encouraged to treat it with great respect. Leaving a recording playing without listening may not demonstrate the intended reverence.\n\n2. **Intention**: In Islam, intention (niyyah) plays a significant role in the acceptance of actions. If one plays the Quran with the intention to benefit from its recitation or to create an environment filled with its blessings, it can be seen as positive.\n\n3. **Listening and Reflection**: The Quran encourages reflection and understanding. It is recommended to listen to the words of the Quran attentively, allowing oneself to reflect on its meanings and lessons.\n\n4. **Context**: There are certain circumstances where you might leave a recording playing, such as during gatherings or to create a peaceful atmosphere. In such cases, while the connection may not be direct listening, the presence of Quranic recitation can still be seen as beneficial.\n\nUltimately, while it may not be wrong to leave a recording of the Quran playing in a respectful manner, actively listening and reflecting on its meanings is the preferred approach in Islam."

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, if Allah enables someone to memorize the Quran, it is often seen as a sign of His mercy and favor toward that person. Memorizing the Quran is considered a virtuous act that holds great reward in this life and the hereafter. Many scholars believe that such a privilege indicates that Allah wills good for that individual, as it opens the door for them to understand, practice, and spread His words.\n\nMoreover, the act of memorization is not just about the ability to recite the words but entails a deeper connection with the teachings, guidance, and moral principles of Islam. It is also worth noting that with such a blessing comes a responsibility to uphold and disseminate the knowledge gained, as well as to embody the teachings of the Quran in one's life.\n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that the will of Allah encompasses a broader understanding that may be beyond human comprehension. While memorization can be seen as a sign of goodness, it does not automatically guarantee one's ultimate fate or piety.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Virtues of reciting Surat al-Baqarah in the home\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has told us of the great virtue of Surat al-Baqarah as a whole, and of some of its verses, such as Ayat al-Kursiy and the last two verses of the surah . \nAmong the things that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has told us about its virtue is that the devils flee the house in which this surah is recited, and that is beneficial in protecting against and remedying sihr (witchcraft ).\nAbu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not make your houses into graves, for the Shaytan flees from a house in which Surat al-Baqarah is recited.” Narrated by Muslim (780).\nAbu Umamah al-Bahili said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Read Surat al-Baqarah, for reciting it regularly is a blessing and forsaking it is a cause of regret, and the magicians cannot withstand it.” Narrated by Muslim (804).\nMust Surat Al-Baqarah be recited out loud?\nIt is not stipulated that it be recited in a loud voice; rather it is sufficient that it be read and recited in the house, even if it is recited in a low voice. Similarly, it is not stipulated that it be recited all in one go; rather it may be recited in stages. And it is not stipulated that it be read by only one member of the household; rather if it is shared out among them, that is acceptable. However, with regard to all of that, the best is if it is recited all in one go by one person.\nPlaying a recording of Surat al-Baqarah in the home: Enough?\nIt is not permissible to rely on the recitation coming from a broadcast or recording; rather it must be read directly by the members of the household themselves.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:\nThere is a hadith from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which says that if a person recites Surat al-Baqarah, the Shaytan will not come into his house. But what if the surah is recorded on a tape; will that achieve the same result?\nHe replied:\n“No, no; the voice on the tape is nothing and will not serve any purpose, because it cannot be said that one has read or recited Quran; rather it may be said that one has listened to the voice of somebody who recited it before. Hence if we record the adhan of a muadhdhin, then when the time comes we play it over the loudspeakers, and we leave it to call the adhan, is that acceptable? It is not acceptable. If we record a moving khutbah (sermon), then on Friday we play this recording of the “imam of the microphone”, and the recording says “As-salamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu (peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings),” then the muadhdhin gives the call to prayer, then the recording of the khutbah is played, is this acceptable? It is not acceptable; why is that? Because this recording is a voice that was recorded in the past. It is like if you wrote it on a piece of paper or put a Mushaf in the house; is that sufficient instead of reading or reciting it? It is not sufficient. (As’ilat al-Bab al-Maftuh (question no. 986)\nBut if there is no one in the house who is able to read or recite Surat al-Baqarah, and there is no one who can recite it for them in the house, and they use a recorder to recite it, then what appears to be the case – if Allah wills – is that it will serve this purpose and make the Shaytan flee from the house, especially if there is someone in the house who is listening to the recitation from the recorder.\nFor a detailed commentary on certain verses from Surat al-Baqarah, please see these answers to questions: 141772 , 118142 , 12191 , 1024 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",

However, the focus should also be on understanding the teachings within the surah and applying them in daily life.\n\nAdditionally, while reciting, it is preferred to do so in a state of worship, such as after performing salah (prayer) or during special nights like Fridays, as the rewards are magnified.\n\nIn summary, reciting Surat al-Baqarah in the home is beneficial, and Muslims are encouraged to engage with it regularly for spiritual elevation and protection."

Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Or has he not been informed of what was in the scriptures of Moses\nAnd [of] Abraham, who fulfilled [his obligations] – \nThat no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another\nAnd that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives\nAnd that his effort is going to be seen\nThen he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense… ”\n[an-Najm 53:36-40 … until the end of the soorah].\nSimilar to that is the well-known verses at the end of Soorat al-A‘laa, which are quoted above.\nWhat is required of us is only to believe in general terms in the Scriptures that Allah, may He be exalted, sent down to His Prophet Moosaa (peace be upon him), and to believe in whatever is proven to us to be sound through the revelation sent to the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in which there are lessons and exhortations. As for anything more than that, such as details of what those Scriptures contained, we are not obliged to know it and we have no way of knowing it or finding out about its details. Trying to find out about that is taking on something that cannot be proven, and we have no need of that according to the teachings of our religion, for Allah has perfected our religion for us and is pleased with Islam for us as our religion.\nWe know of no religious text that suggests that the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) is still extant, or that the knowledge contained therein reached any of the people of Islam in such a manner that it can be proven and relied upon.\nWhat appears to be the case is that its knowledge was abrogated a long time ago and was lost to people.\nIn fact, this is applicable to the books of the Children of Israel, namely the Torah and the Gospel; there is no longer anything that can be authenticated in that which is extant among them, except for that which is confirmed by Islamic religious texts. As for everything other than that, the most that can be said is that we neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it.\nIf this is the case with regard to the books of the Children of Israel, despite the large numbers of people who venerate them, pay attention to them and refer to them, then it is even more likely that this is the case with regard to the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him). The most can be said about what is extant among people of that, that is attributed to the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), is that it is like the Scriptures and Books of the Children of Israel: we neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it.\nFor more information, see the answers to questions no. 199116 and 126004.\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the Zaboor of Dawood (peace be upon him), it is the Book that Allah revealed to him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And your Lord is most knowing of whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And We have made some of the prophets exceed others [in various ways], and to David We gave the book [of Psalms [Zaboor]]” [al-Israa’ 17:55].\nThe word zaboor refers to something written. Tafseer at-Tabari (6/17).\nAt-Taahir said:\nIt is the name for the collected sayings of Daawood (peace be upon him) – some of which are words that were revealed to him, and some are words with which he was inspired, words of supplication and conversing with Allah. It is the book that is known nowadays as the Book of Psalms in the Old Testament.\nEnd quote from at-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer (15/138).\nThe scholars have stated that the Zaboor of Dawood contained words of praise and glorification of Allah, may He be exalted; it did not contain any rulings on what is lawful and what is prohibited (halaal and haraam), or on shares of inheritance or hudood punishments. See Tafseer at-Tabari (14/625).\nAl-Qurtubi said: The Zaboor is the book of Dawood. It contained one hundred and fifty chapters, in which there were no rulings or statements of what is lawful and what is prohibited; rather it was words of wisdom and exhortation.\nThere are references to the contents of the Zaboor and the Scripture of Ibraaheem in some reports which are not proven.\nIn the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) it says:\nI said: O Messenger of Allah, what was the Scripture of Ibraaheem?\nHe said: “It was all proverbs, such as:\nO powerful and arrogant king, I did not appoint you to pile up worldly gains one on top of another; rather I appointed you to avert from Me the supplication of the one who has been wronged, for I do not reject it even if it comes from a disbeliever.\nEvery rational individual, unless he loses his mind, must have certain times: a time in which he converses with his Lord, a time in which he takes stock of himself, a time in which he reflects upon the creation of Allah, and a time in which he focuses on meeting his need for food and drink.\nEvery rational individual should not focus his mind except on three things: seeking provision for the hereafter [by doing righteous deeds], working to earn a living, and finding pleasure in something that is not prohibited.\nThe intelligent man should have insight into the era in which he lives, focus on his own affairs and guard his tongue.\nWhoever regards his words as being among his deeds will speak little and will only speak about what concerns him.”\nI [Abu Dharr] said: O Messenger of Allah, what was the Scripture of Moosa?\nHe said: “It was all exhortations:\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of death, for how can he rejoice?\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of the Fire, for how can he laugh?\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of the divine decree, for how can he strive too hard?\nI am astounded by the one who sees this world and its vicissitudes, for how can he be at ease with it?\nI am astounded by the one who is certain of the reckoning tomorrow, for how can he not strive?”\nThis hadith was narrated by Ibn Hibbaan (361) and others. Al-Arnaa’oot said in his comments on the book of Ibn Hibbaan: Its isnad is da‘eef jiddan (very weak). The same was stated by Shaykh al-Albaani in ad-Da‘eefah. See Tafseer Ibn Katheer (2/472).\nWhat we have stated above about the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) with regard to how authentic it is and the extent to which we may trust its contents, we may also state with regard to the Zaboor, because we have no report to indicate that it has survived. Whatever has been transmitted of it via the People of the Book comes under the same ruling as the Israa’eeliyyaat (reports narrated from Jewish sources), which are of three categories:\n\nAcceptable: this refers to that which is known to be sound due to its having been soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nThat concerning which no verdict is given: this refers to that for which it cannot be known whether it is valid or false. It is permissible to narrate reports of this category for the purpose of exhortation and admonition, but we do not believe that it is either sound or false, in compliance with the command of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nRejected: this refers to that which is known to be false, and it is not appropriate to believe it, accept it or narrate it.\n\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 265035 and 22289.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, the Scriptures of Ibraaheem (Abraham) and the Zaboor (Psalms) of Dawood (David) are considered important revelations given by Allah to His prophets. However, unlike the Quran, which Muslims believe has been preserved in its original form, the exact texts of the Scriptures of Ibraaheem and the Zaboor are not available to us today in their original form.\n\nThe Scripture of Ibraaheem, also known as the Scrolls of Abraham, is believed to contain guidance and laws revealed to the prophet Ibraaheem. It is mentioned in Islamic texts but not in detail.\n\nThe Zaboor is associated with the Psalms, which are known to have been revealed to Dawood. While certain passages could correspond to those found in the Biblical Psalms, Muslims believe that the original form of the Zaboor as revealed to Dawood has been altered and is not in its original state today.\n\nIn summary, both the Scriptures of Ibraaheem and the Zaboor of Dawood are acknowledged in Islam, but they are not considered fully preserved like the Quran. The teachings and guidance found in these scriptures are thus understood to be part of the broader prophetic tradition leading up to the final revelation of the Quran."

        "question": "The principles of tafseer (Qur’anic exegesis)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe should understand that there are principles and guidelines for interpreting the Qur’an, which must be properly understood by the one who engages in tafseer (exegesis) of the word of Allah, may He be blessed and exalted. The scholars have written about the guidelines and principles of tafseer, and have explained the difference between tafseer on the basis of reports and tafseer on the basis of one’s own understanding; they have explained when it is acceptable for a person to speak on the basis of his own understanding; and have differentiated between good understanding and poor understanding, especially with regard to what is mentioned in the question about a person coming up with his own understanding of a verse and understanding it on the basis of what he thinks to be right. Such personal understanding and thoughts should be measured against what the scholars said about the interpretation of this verse, and so on.\nIf the one who has his own personal understanding and thoughts is a seeker of knowledge, and is able to check what the commentators and scholars said, then he may find out for himself what was narrated concerning the meaning of the verse, and the views of respected commentators about the meaning and how they explained the meaning. Then if what he came up with about the meaning of the verse is in accordance with some of these views of respected scholars, then all well and good.\nBut if it is not in accordance with these scholarly views, then he must correct his understanding of the verse by checking it against the views of the scholars. However, he may not find the meaning that he came up with mentioned in the books (of tafseer) that he checks, or it may not be stated exactly as he had in mind, but the view that he came up with may be in harmony with the wording and context of the verse, and with the way that meanings are expressed in Arabic, and may indicate that meaning or point to it in one way or another, and in a way of expression that is regarded as possible by the scholars.\nThis requires further examination and study of the views of the scholars (concerning the verse), because the understanding that he developed could be implied in the wording of some scholars in their commentary on the verse.\nHe may, if possible, discuss his idea (about the meaning of the verse) with some scholars who have knowledge of the Book of Allah and the meaning of its verses.\nYou can refer to the following books\n\nSharh Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer, by Shaykh Dr. Musaa‘id at-Tayyaar\nAt-Tahreer fi Usool at-Tafseer by Shaykh Dr. Musaa‘id at-Tayyaar\n\nto learn about these issues that you need to learn and understand before you venture into the interpretation of the word of Allah, may He be exalted.\nSecondly:\nThe scholars have stated that the Qur’an may be interpreted:\n\nBy the Qur’an\nBy the Sunnah\nBy the words of the early generations (salaf)\nBy the rules of the Arabic language\nBy referring to some of the reports of the People of the Book, and the reasons for revelation (asbaab an-nuzool), in order to understand the meaning of a particular verse.\n\nFor each of these guidelines there is shar‘i evidence, within the framework of which tafseer is to be done. The Qur’an is the most appropriate means of understanding the Qur’an, because it is the word of Allah, may He be exalted. The Messenger is the one who explains the words of Allah, for that is his role. The Qur’an was revealed in the language of the Arabs, so it [the Arabic language and its rules of grammar and expression] is one of the basic means of understanding the Qur’an. The early generations were the closest of people to the language and the most knowledgeable of what meaning the Messenger intended when he spoke, for they were witnesses to the revelation and were aware of the circumstances of and reasons for revelation; they are also people who were proven to be good and righteous, so their interpretation takes precedence over that of others.\nIf you want detailed proof, we advise you to refer to the book al-Istidlaal ‘ala al-Ma‘aani fi Tafseer at-Tabari, by Dr. Naayif az-Zahraani, in which he mentions the evidence for all of this.\nThirdly:\nThe scholars have ways of differentiating between what is sound (saheeh) and what is weak (da‘eef), namely mustalah al-hadith (the science of hadith). By means of this science, a scholar is able to differentiate between what is sound and what is not, and to differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not acceptable of reports.\nThey have a particular way of dealing with the reports of tafseer; you can find details of that in the books mentioned above.\nFourthly:\nWith regard to the hadith “Whoever gives his personal view about the Book of Allah and it turns out to be correct is still mistaken,” that is, because he spoke about something of which he has no certain knowledge, and he approached the matter in a way other than what is enjoined. So even if he was correct in what he said about the meaning when he gave his view on the matter, he still erred, because he did not have the right approach to the matter. He is like one who judges between people on the basis of ignorance: he will be in the Fire, even if he happened to give the right ruling, but his sin is less grave than that of one who gives a wrong ruling. And Allah knows best. This is similar to the case in which Allah calls those who accuse others of adultery (“slander”) liars, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when they do not produce the witnesses, then it is they, in the sight of Allah, who are the liars” [an-Noor 24:13]. The slanderer is a liar, even if his accusation of adultery is correct in and of itself, because he spoke of something of which it is not permissible to speak, even if he spoke on the basis of what he knows, because he has spoken of something of which he does not have certain knowledge. And Allah knows best.\nSee: Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (13/371); Tafseer Ibn Katheer (1/11).\nFor more information, please see the answers to questions no. 205290 and 262476.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic scholarship, tafseer (Qur’anic exegesis) is a critical discipline that involves the interpretation and explanation of the Quran. The principles of tafseer are essential for understanding the Quran’s meanings accurately and responsibly. Below are some fundamental principles of tafseer:\n\n1. **Language and Grammar**: A deep understanding of the Arabic language, including grammar, vocabulary, and syntax, is essential. Since the Quran was revealed in classical Arabic, knowledge of the language helps interpreters grasp nuanced meanings.\n\n2. **Context (Asbab al-Nuzul)**: Understanding the historical and social context surrounding the revelation of specific verses is vital. Asbab al-nuzul refers to the circumstances and events that led to the revelation of certain verses, which illuminates their intended meanings.\n\n3. **Tafseer by the Quran**: One of the primary methods of interpretation is to use the Quran itself. This involves seeking clarifications for ambiguous verses within other verses, noting that the Quran is its own best interpreter.\n\n4. **Hadith and Sunnah**: The sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) provide context and elaboration on the Quranic text. Authentic hadiths play a crucial role in tafseer, as they help explain and exemplify Quranic teachings.\n\n5. **Consensus of Scholars (Ijma)**: The agreement of Islamic scholars on specific interpretations can serve as a guiding principle. Ijma reflects a collective understanding of the text over time and can help confirm established interpretations.\n\n6. **Reason and Logic (Qiyas)**: While the Quran and Sunnah are primary sources, rational thinking and reasoning can also be applied in the interpretation process, particularly in understanding legal and moral principles.\n\n7. **Avoiding Speculation**: Tafseer should avoid unfounded speculation or personal opinions that deviate from established interpretations. Scholars emphasize the need for cautious, well-reasoned approaches to ensure adherence to Islamic teachings.\n\n8. **Thematic and Conceptual Understanding**: Recognizing overarching themes and concepts in the Quran can aid in understanding individual verses. This includes noting how different verses interact with each other and contribute to the Quran's overall message.\n\n9. **Abrogation (Naskh)**: Some verses may abrogate others, meaning that a later revelation supersedes an earlier one. Understanding which verses are abrogated and which are the abrogating ones is important for accurate interpretation.\n\n10. **Diverse Interpretations**: Accepting that different interpretations exist can enrich the understanding of the Quran. Scholars may have varying viewpoints that take different contexts and methodologies into account, provided they are grounded in reliable sources.\n\nThese principles guide scholars in their exegesis and help ensure that the interpretations remain faithful to the original text and spirit of the Quran."

        "question": "Does Reading the Quran on Phones Rewardable?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The best with regard to reading or reciting the Quran is that which will increase a person in focus of mind. If he will have more focus of mind when he recites from memory, then that is best. If he will have more focus of mind when reading from the Mus-haf or from his mobile phone, then that is best.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Adhkar (p. 90-91):\n“Reading the Quran from the Mus-haf is better than reciting from memory . This is the view of our companions, and it is the well-known view among the early generations (may Allah be pleased with them). But this is not absolute; rather if a person can reflect, ponder and focus more when he recites from memory than when he reads from the Mus-haf, then in his case reciting from memory is better. If both options are equal in that regard, then reading from the Mus-haf is better. This is what the early generations meant when discussing this issue.”\nSome inauthentic Hadiths were narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which are not sound enough to be taken as evidence, concerning the virtue of looking in the Mus-haf. For more information on that, please see the answer to question no. 32594 .\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is there a difference in reward between reading the Quran from the Mus-haf or reciting from memory ? If I read the Quran from the Mus-haf, is it acceptable to read with my eyes only or must I also move my lips? Is it sufficient to move the lips, or must there also be some sound?\nHe replied: \n“I do not know of any evidence to suggest that there is a difference between reading from the Mus-haf or reciting from memory; rather what is prescribed is to reflect and focus, whether one reads from the Mus-haf or recites from memory. It can only be called recitation if it can be heard; it is not sufficient just to look with the eyes, or to think of the words without uttering them. The Sunnah is for the reader to utter the words and reflect, as Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“[This is] a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded.” [Sad 38:29]\n“Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon [their] hearts?” [Muhammad 47:24]\nIf reciting from memory will help one to focus more and reflect more on the Quran, then that is better; if reading from the Mus-haf will help one to focus more and reflect more, then that is better. And Allah is the source of strength.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 24/352)\nThus it will become clear that if you read the Quran from your mobile phone with focus and reflecting on the meaning, your reward will not be less than that for reading from the Mus-haf, in sha Allah. What matters is focus of mind and benefitting from reading the Quran.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 108242 , 125930 , 108477 , and 131946  \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, reading the Quran is indeed a highly rewarding act, and this includes reading it on phones or other electronic devices. The intention behind reading the Quran is crucial. If a person reads the Quran with sincerity and a desire to understand and seek guidance, whether on a phone, tablet, or physical copy, they can receive rewards from Allah. \n\nMany scholars emphasize the importance of holding the Quran in a respectful manner, regardless of the medium used. Thus, using a phone to read the Quran can be seen as acceptable and beneficial, especially if it facilitates easier access and comprehension. \n\nHowever, it is preferable to maintain the same level of attention and focus as one would while reading a physical copy. Moreover, ensuring that the phone is free from distractions can enhance the experience of reciting and reflecting upon the verses."

        "question": "All of the Qur’an is good, but some parts are more special than others",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be glorified, sent down the Qur’an to His Prophet, and made its soorahs 114 in number. Some of these soorahs are more special than others, as there are saheeh hadiths which highlight the special virtue of Soorat al-Faatihah, al-Ikhlaas, Soorat al-Kaafiroon, the Mi‘wadhatayn [al-Falaq and an-Naas], az-Zalzalah, al-A‘laa, Soorat al-Baqarah and Aal ‘Imraan. As for the rest of soorahs of the Qur’an, they have their own special virtues too.\nThe soorahs are given names, because each one discusses a particular topic which makes it stand out from other soorahs, and contains rulings, exhortation and etiquette, and it has a particular significance in that the one who recites it will have a reward according to what the soorah contains of exhortation and rulings that are unique to it.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the Qur'an is regarded as the literal word of God (Allah) and is considered to be perfect and complete. While all parts of the Qur'an are valuable and significant, some verses (ayah) and chapters (surah) may hold particular importance due to various reasons such as their themes, teachings, or the circumstances of their revelation.\n\nFor instance:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Fatiha**: Often referred to as the \"Opening\" of the Qur'an, it is recited in every unit of the Muslim prayer (Salah) and is considered fundamental to the practice of worship.\n\n2. **Ayat al-Kursi (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255)**: This verse is well-known for its profound description of God's sovereignty and is frequently recited for protection.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Ikhlas**: This chapter emphasizes the oneness of God and is often recited for its significant message about monotheism.\n\n4. **Surahs of Remembrance and Reflection**: Certain parts of the Qur'an are often highlighted for their wisdom and guidance, such as Surah Al-Baqarah and Surah Al-Anfal, which deal with various aspects of faith and social justice.\n\n5. **Context and Application**: Some verses may be particularly relevant in specific contexts or moments in history, and scholars often reference them to derive lessons applicable to contemporary issues.\n\nIn summary, while all of the Qur'an is deemed good and holds significance, certain sections may be considered particularly special due to their teachings, purposes, or the aspects of guidance they present to believers.

        "question": "Is it permissible to complete the Qur’an every day? How are we to understand the proven reports which say that the salaf used to complete it in less than three days?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nReading and reciting the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is one of the greatest acts of worship in Islam. How can that not be the case, when what is read is the words of Allah, may He be exalted? In addition to this honour that is attained by the one who reads the Qur’an, Allah, may He be exalted, has promised the reader great rewards in this world and the hereafter, such as it being guidance and healing for him, that for every letter he will have ten good deeds (hasanaat) to his credit, that the Qur’an will intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection, and other rewards and benefits.\nPlease see the answer to question no. 141700.\nHence we see that the noble Sahaabah and Taabi‘een, and those of the early generations of this ummah who followed them, were keen to read the Book of their Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, and they would allocate for themselves a portion of it to be read every day.\nDespite their eagerness to read the Book of their Lord, they adhered to the guidelines set out by Islamic teachings and did not overstep the bounds, and did not let their eagerness cause them to do anything contrary to prophetic guidance. Hence the majority of scholars are of the view that the Qur’an may be completed every seven days, and whoever has the strength to do more should not complete it in less than three days, except in specific circumstances which we will mention below.\nMost of the early generations adhered to the practice of completing it in seven days, following the advice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Read the Qur’an in a month.” I said: I am able to do better than that… Until he said: “Then read it once every seven days, and do not do any more than that.”\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari (4767) and Muslim (1159).\nSo they did not complete it in less than three days, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) discouraged them to do that. \nIt was narrated that ‘Abdullah – that is, ibn ‘Amr – said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one properly understands who reads the Qur’an in less than three days.”\nNarrated by at-Tirmidhi (2949), Abu Dawood (1390) and Ibn Maajah (1347); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.\nThis is what the Sahaabah understood from the Prophet’s teachings, and the leading scholars followed them in that.\n-1-\nIt was narrated that Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Read the Qur’an in seven days and do not read it in less than three days.\nNarrated by Sa‘eed ibn Mansoor in his Sunan with a saheeh isnaad, as was stated by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Fadaa’il al-Qur’an (9/78)\n-2-\nIt was narrated from Mu‘aadh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) that he regarded it as makrooh to read the Qur’an in less than three days.\nNarrated by Abu ‘Ubayd in Fadaa’il al-Qur’an (p. 89)’ classed as saheeh by Ibn Katheer in Fadaa’il al-Qur’an (p. 254).\n-3-\nIbn Katheer said:\nMore than one scholar among the early generations regarded it as makrooh to read the Qur’an in less than three days. This is also the view of Abu ‘Ubayd, Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh and others of the later generations.\nFadaa’il al-Qur’an (p. 254)\nIn addition to the fact that the one who reads it in less than three days does not understand it properly, he also does not benefit from the sublime and subtle meanings that are understood by the one who reads the Qur’an with reflection, at a measured pace.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nReading Qur’an in the manner enjoined instils great faith in the heart, and increases a person in certainty, reassurance and healing.\nMajmoo‘ al-Fataawa (7/283).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to what is mentioned in scholarly books about some people completing the Qur’an four times in one day or four times in one night, such reports should be investigated to find out whether they are soundly narrated from their alleged sources, because it is highly unlikely that that happened, as the time is not long enough for that in the first place. The same may be said concerning the claim that some of them completed the Qur’an between Maghrib and ‘Isha’ (!) and other claims that cannot be believed, even if one is able to read quickly. As for reading the entire Qur’an in a single day, that is possible; in fact some of the leading scholars did that – as was narrated from them – in a single rak‘ah.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for those who completed the Qur’an in a single rak‘ah, they are innumerable, because they are so many. They include: ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan, Tameem ad-Daari, and Sa‘eed ibn Jubayr.\nAl-Adhkaar (p. 102)\nBut is the one who does that following the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), or is he doing something that is not permissible according to Islamic teachings?\nThe answer is that the one who does that as a habit and way of life is undoubtedly doing something that is contrary to Islamic teachings, and he can only be doing that at the expense of neglecting other shar‘i duties such as prayer, teaching his children, upholding ties of kinship and taking care of his family, or by neglecting working to earn a living.\nAs for the one who does that occasionally with the aim of reviewing what he has memorised, or to make the most of auspicious times – such as the month of Ramadan – or because he is observing i‘tikaaf (retreat for worship) in the mosque, or because he is focusing on worship for a limited time in Makkah, for example – then that is not contrary to Islamic teaching. It is in this manner that we may interpret the reports narrated from some of the imams (leading scholars), that they completed the Qur’an twice in one day or once in a day; it is not to be understood that this was their way of life at all times.\nIbn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nQataadah regularly used to complete the Qur’an every seven days, and in Ramadan he would complete it every three days, and in the last ten nights of Ramadan he would complete it every single night. In Ramadan ash-Shaafa‘i used to complete the Qur’an sixty times [i.e., twice a day], reciting it outside of prayer. Something similar was also narrated from Abu Haneefah.\nThe prohibition on reading the entire Qur’an in less than three days is to be understood as referring to doing that persistently. But at auspicious times, such as the month of Ramadan, and especially on the nights on which Laylat al-Qadr is sought, or in auspicious places, such as Makkah for those who go there and are not residents, then it is mustahabb to read a great deal of Qur’an so as to make the most of that time or that place. This is the view of Ahmad, Ishaaq and other leading scholars, and is indicated by the actions of other scholars, as mentioned above.\nLataa’if al-Ma‘aarif, p. 171\nSee also the answer to question no. 50781\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, completing the Qur'an is highly encouraged and viewed as a virtuous act. While there is no explicit restriction in Islamic texts that forbids completing the Qur'an in one day, scholars generally advise against it for several reasons.\n\n1. **Understanding and Reflection**: The primary purpose of reciting the Qur'an is to understand and reflect upon its meanings. Completing it too quickly may lead to a lack of focus and comprehension. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of reflection in recitation, which can be sacrificed if one rushes through the text.\n\n2. **Salaf Practices**: The reports regarding the Salaf (the early generations of Muslims) completing the Qur'an in less than three days should be understood in context. They had a profound connection to the Qur'an and often recited with deep contemplation and understanding. Their lives often revolved around acts of worship, and they would engage with the Qur'an in a manner that cultivated both their faith and understanding.\n\n3. **Balanced Approach**: Many scholars suggest that a balanced approach is preferable. For example, completing the Qur'an in a month is often recommended, as this allows for daily recitation that is manageable while still encouraging reflection. The popular practice is to aim for 1/30 of the Qur'an each day, which allows for completing it in a month while dedicating adequate time to understanding.\n\n4. **Individual Capacity**: Ultimately, the permissibility of completing the Qur'an daily can depend on a person's capacity, intention, and ability to engage with the text thoughtfully. If a person feels they can maintain focus and reflection while completing the Qur'an in a short time, they may choose to do so, keeping in mind the importance of understanding the message intended within the text.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is technically permissible to complete the Qur'an every day, it is important to consider the quality of engagement with the text. Striking a balance between recitation, reflection, and understanding is key to making the most of one's relationship with the Qur'an."

        "question": "Some of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) who memorised the Book of Allah, may He be exalted",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were the most eager of people to do good and the swiftest in doing righteous deeds, and the most able to do such deeds.\nOne of the greatest of their concerns was memorising the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, learning it and acting upon it, then teaching it to people. They used to learn it from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and they would teach it to one another. So whoever missed out on learning something from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because they were preoccupied with jihad, would learn it from his companions.\nThe most famous of those who used to teach people the Quran include: ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan, ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, and Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with them). They taught many of the younger Sahaabah and, after that, many of the Taabi‘een.\nAbu ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sulami said: Those who used to teach us the Quran told us that they used to learn it from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). When they learned ten verses, they would not move on until they put into practice what those verses said, so we used to learn the Quran and how to act upon its teachings together.\"(Tafseer al-Qurtubi  1/80).\nSo the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) strove to memorise the Book of Allah and teach it to people and help them to memorise it.\nSuwayd ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez said: When Abu’d-Darda’ had prayed Fajr in the mosque of Damascus, the people would gather to learn Quran from him, so he would put them into groups of ten, with an instructor for each group, and he would stand in the mihrab watching them. If one of them made a mistake, he would refer to his instructor, and if the instructor made a mistake, he would refer to Abu’d-Darda’ and ask him about that.\nIt was narrated that Ibn Mashkam said: Abu’d-Darda’ said to me: Count those who are studying the Quran with me. I counted them, and they were over one thousand and six hundred, and for each group of ten there was a teacher.\"(Ma‘rifat al-Qurra’ al-Kibaar, p. 20)\nSecondly:\nA great number of the Sahaabah memorised the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and they were so great in number that they could not all be listed. A number of the scholars mentioned the most prominent of those among them who memorised the Book of Allah.\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAbu ‘Ubayd mentioned those among the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who memorised the Quran. Among the Muhaajireen he listed the four caliphs, Talhah, Sa‘d, Ibn Mas‘ood, Hudhayfah, Saalim, Abu Hurayrah, ‘Abdullah ibn as-Saa’ib and the ‘Abdullahs. Among the women he listed ‘Aa’ishah, Hafsah and Umm Salamah. But some of these only completed its memorisation after the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had died.\nIn Kitaab ash-Sharee‘ah, Ibn Abi Dawood listed among the Muhaajireen also: Tameem ibn Aws ad-Daari and ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir. Among the Ansaar he listed: ‘Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit, Mu‘aadh who was known by the kunyah Abu Haleemah, Mujammi‘ ibn Haarithah, Fadaalah ibn ‘Ubayd, Maslamah ibn Makhlad, and others. He stated that some of them only memorised it after the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had died. Among others who also memorised it was Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari, who was mentioned by Abu ‘Amr ad-Daani. Some later scholars also listed ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, Sa‘d ibn ‘Abbaad and Umm Waraqah as being among those who memorised the Quran.\"(Fath al-Baari  9/52)\nSee also: al-Itqaan by as-Suyooti (1/248-249)\nAmong the most prominent of these Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) are the following:\n1. Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe died on a Monday in Jumaada al-Oola 13 AH at the age of sixty-three. ‘Umar led the funeral prayer for him, and he was buried with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (5/316)\n2. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab\nHe was killed on a Wednesday 26 Dhu’l-Hijjah 23 AH, at the age of sixty-three; there are other views concerning his age.\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (7/441)\n3. ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe was one of those who memorised the Quran at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died a martyr, unlawfully killed in his house, on 18 Dhu’l-Hijjah 35 AH, at the age of eighty-two, according to the correct view.\n4. ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe was killed in Kufah on the morning of 17 Ramadan 40 AH. He memorised the Quran after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and it was said that he memorised it during his lifetime.\n5. Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe was the most prominent of the Quran-reciters, the one who had best memorised the Book of Allah. He memorised it at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) he died in Madinah in 20 AH or 19 AH.\n6. ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood ibn Ghaafil (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe memorised the Quran at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in Madinah at the end of 32 AH.\n7. Zayd ibn Thaabit ibn ad-Dahhaak (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe memorised the Quran at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in 45 AH, according to the more correct view.\n8. Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari, ‘Abdullah ibn Qays (may Allah be pleased with him)\n He learned the Quran from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in Dhu’l-Hijjah 44 AH according to the correct view.\n9. Abu’d-Darda’ ‘Uwaymir ibn Zayd al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in 33 AH.\n10. Abu Hurayrah ad-Dawsi (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b. He died in 57 or 58 or 59 AH.\n11. ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbaas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b. He died in at-Taa’if in 68 AH.\n12. ‘Abdullah ibn as-Saa’ib ibn Abi’s-Saa’ib, the most prominent reciter of the people of Makkah\nHe was a companion of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and narrated a few reports. He was one of the younger Sahaabah. He learned the Quran from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b.. He died around 70 AH, during the governorship of Ibn az-Zubayr.\nSee: Ma‘rifat al-Qurra’ al-Kibaar by al-Haafiz adh-Dhahabi (p. 10-25).\n13. Mu‘aadh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in 17 or 18 AH, at the age of thirty-four.\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (10/187).\n14. Saalim the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in 11 AH on the day of al-Yamaamah.\nAl-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah (9/497).\n15. ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab\nHe learned the Quran from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and from ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan and Zayd ibn Thaabit. He died in 73 AH or, it was said, in 74 AH.\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (5/330)\n16. ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allah be pleased with him)\nIbn Maajah (1346) narrated that he said: I memorized the Quran and once I recited it all in one night. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I am afraid that you may live a long life and that you may get tired …” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.\nHe died in 63 AH; it was also said that he died in 65 or 68 AH, and there were other views.\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (5/338)\n17. ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him)\nHe learned the Quran from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He died in 58 AH.\nTahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (7/243)\n18. ‘Aa’ishah bint Abi Bakr, the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and may Allah be pleased with her)\nShe learned the Quran from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).

        "predicted_answer": "Among the Sahaabah (companions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) who memorized the Qur'an, several are particularly notable for their dedication to preserving the Word of Allah. Here are a few prominent individuals:\n\n1. **Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him)** - The first caliph of Islam and a close companion of the Prophet, he was known for his strong commitment to the Qur'an.\n\n2. **Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him)** - The second caliph and another close companion of the Prophet, he was also among those who memorized the Qur'an and promoted its recitation.\n\n3. **Uthman ibn Affan (may Allah be pleased with him)** - The third caliph, he played a crucial role in the compilation of the Qur'an in written form and was noted for his memorization.\n\n4. **Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him)** - The fourth caliph and the cousin of the Prophet, he was known for his deep knowledge of the Qur'an and his efforts in teaching it.\n\n5. **Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him)** - A notable scribe of the Prophet, he was responsible for compiling the Qur'an and was known for his memorization.\n\n6. **Abdullah ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him)** - One of the early converts to Islam, he was recognized for his profound knowledge and memorization of the Qur'an and was one of the esteemed reciters.\n\n7. **Abdullah ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him)** - Cousin of the Prophet, he was known for his deep understanding and explanations of the Qur'an.\n\nThese companions played an essential role in the transmission and preservation of the Qur'an, ensuring that it was transmitted accurately to future generations.

        "question": "False reports than attribute some linguistic errors to the Holy Qur’an",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tWhen answering \n\tthis question, we cannot hide our extreme astonishment that this specious \n\targument was accepted by some researchers and educated people. In fact we \n\tcannot hide our astonishment at how anyone could let this specious argument \n\tconfuse him in the first place, not only because the Muslims should accept \n\tthe infallibility of the Qur’an because Allah promised to preserve it, but \n\talso because we see that this specious argument has no sound rational or \n\tlogical basis.\n\n\tWe may sum up \n\tour refutation of this argument in the following points:\n\n\tI.\n\n\tWe should \n\trealise that the rules of grammar are only based on the styles of expression \n\tthat have been transmitted to us from the eras that are regarded as \n\tauthoritative, and there is no difference of opinion among linguists \n\tconcerning the fact that the era of Prophethood is one of the authoritative \n\teras. Any word narrated soundly to us (from that era) constitutes a valid \n\tlinguistic proof; rather it is valid to be accepted as forming a foundation \n\tfor some rule of Arabic grammar.\n\n\tII.\n\n\tTo clarify that \n\tfurther, we may say: is it valid for a researcher to quote some lines of \n\tverse from Imru’ul-Qays that the scholars narrated from him, and there is no \n\tdoubt concerning its narration, then think that there is some grammatical or \n\tlinguistic error in his view, and thus conclude that Imru’ul-Qays made some \n\tgrammatical errors in his poetry?!\n\n\tIs that not \n\tundermining the foundation on which the rules of grammar are based, and \n\tdemolishing this entire branch of knowledge itself? So how about if some \n\tignorant person concluded that there is a linguistic or grammatical mistake \n\tin the Holy Qur’an, when the noble Sahaabah and Taabi‘een transmitted the \n\tQur’an during the authoritative era and during the time when everyone spoke \n\tcorrect Arabic (fus-ha), and in fact the scholars, grammarians and people of \n\teloquence recited the Qur’an and transmitted it, without anyone among them \n\traising any objection, with a few exceptions with regard to some modes of \n\trecitation that did not reach some grammarians via chains of transmission \n\tthat reached the level of tawaatur.\n\n\tIs it not the \n\tcase that this ignorant person is more deserving of criticism and being \n\tdescribed as mistaken than the pure Arabs, on whose speech the rules of the \n\tlanguage are based?\n\n\tIII.\n\n\tIf we reflect \n\tupon the verses in which they think there was a mistake, we will realise \n\tthat they are in fact in harmony with some known grammatical rules, and that \n\this thinking that there is a mistake in those verses is very far-fetched.\n\n\tAs-Suyooti (may \n\tAllah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tThe scholars of \n\tArabic language spoke about these verses, and they found an explanation for \n\ttheir grammatical structure.\n\n\tAs for the verse \n\t(interpretation of the meaning), “Verily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]” \n\t[Taa-Haa 20:56], there are several explanations:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tIt is in \n\taccordance with a dialect in which the dual form always appears with the \n\talif [i.e., -aani rather than –ayni] in all three cases [nominative \n\t(subject), accusative (object) and genitive (possessive)]. This is the \n\twell-known dialect of Kinaanah and, it was said, of Banu’l-Haarith.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tThe subject of\n\tinna (translated here as Verily), which is omitted, is in the \n\taccusative [in accordance with grammatical rules], so the sentence is \n\tsubject and predicate, the predicate of inna.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tWhat is meant by\n\tinna is kadhaalika (moreover). The word saahiraan (two \n\tmagicians) is the predicate of a hidden [or omitted] subject [and therefore \n\tappears in the nominative form, in accordance with the rules of Arabic \n\tgrammar]. The implied meaning is: they are indeed two magicians.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tWhat is meant by\n\tinna in this instance is “Yes”.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tThe first \n\tsyllable of the word haadhaani [these two] is a pronoun, and the \n\twords “dhaani la saahiraan” are the subject and predicate of inna. \n\tBut we have explained above that this is not possible, because inna \n\tis written on its own and the syllable haa- is connected to the rest of its \n\tword, therefore the way it is written in the Mus-haf does not allow this \n\tinterpretation.\n\n\tI – that is, \n\tas-Suyooti – say: It seems to me that there is another possible explanation, \n\twhich is that the reason why the alif is used here is so as to make the word\n\tsaahiraan rhyme with the word yureedaan (they [dual form] \n\twant). A \n\tsimilar example is seen in the words “and \n\tI have come to you from Saba' (Sheba) with true news [min sabaa’in bi \n\tnabaa’in]” \n\t[an-Naml 27:22].\n\t\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe words “and \n\tthose who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) wa’l-muqeemeena as-salaata” \n\t[an-Nisa’ 4:162], there are also several explanations for it:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tIt is \n\tdisconnected from the context, as if it is saying: And I praise… – because \n\tthat is more eloquent.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the phrase “believe \n\tin what has been sent down to you” \n\tthat is, and they believe in those who perform as-Salaah [the prayer], \n\tnamely the Prophets or, it was said, the angels. It was said that what is \n\tmeant is that they believe in the religion of those who perform the prayer, \n\tso what is meant thereby is the Muslims.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the word “before”, that is, before you and before those who perform the \n\tprayer.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the pronoun “you” in the phrase “before \n\tyou”.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the pronoun “you” in the phrase “to \n\tyou”.\n\n\t6.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the pronoun “them” in the phrase “among \n\tthem”.\n\n\tThese \n\tpossibilities were narrated by Abu’l-Baqa’.\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe words “and \n\tthe Sabians [wa’s-saabi’oona]” [al-Maa’idah 5:69], \n\tthere are also several interpretations:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tIt is a subject \n\tof which the predicate is omitted; in other words, and the Sabians are also \n\tlike that.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the particle inna and the word which follows it (alladheena \n\t– those who), which together form the subject, and it is the predicate, \n\ttherefore it appears in the nominative [in accordance with the rules of \n\tArabic grammar]. \n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt is connected \n\tto the subject of the verb haadu, which means to be Jewish (“those \n\twho are the Jews”).\n\t\n\n\t4.\n\tInna \n\there means Yes. So the words “those who believe” and what comes after that \n\tare nominative, and the words “and \n\tthe Sabians [wa’s-saabi’oona]” \n\tare connected to that.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tIt is like using \n\tthe plural form when referring to the singular.\n\n\tThese \n\texplanations were narrated from Abu’l-Baqa’.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tal-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (1247-1249), ed by Markaz ad-Diraasaat \n\tal-Qur’aniyyah.\n\n\tWe realise that \n\texplaining these grammatical possibilities may take a long time, and many \n\treaders may not understand them because of their subtlety, but we have \n\tquoted them here so that the ignorant ones who try to undermine the Holy \n\tQur’an will realise the extent of their ignorance of Arabic grammar and \n\tlanguage, and thus they may know their limits and not go beyond the dictates \n\tof sound reasoning.\n\n\tIV.\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe reports narrated from some of the Sahaabah and Taabi‘een about this \n\ttopic, there are many such reports, which were compiled by al-Haafiz \n\tas-Suyooti in his book al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (p. 1236-1257), \n\twhere he discuss them in detail. We will limit it here to discussing the \n\thadiths mentioned in the question, which were narrated from ‘Aa’ishah and \n\t‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with them) concerning this matter.\n\n\tThe first report \n\twas narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her).\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah from his father, who said:\n\n\tI asked \n\t‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) about the grammatical mistakes in \n\tthe Qur’an: “Surely, \n\tthose who believe, those who are the Jews and the Sabians [wa’s-saabi’oona]”\n\t\n\t[al-Maa’idah 5:69]; \n\t“and those \n\twho perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) wa muqeemeena as-salaata \n\twa’l-mu’toona az-zakaata” [an-Nisa’ 4:162]; \n\tand “Verily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]” [Taa-Haa 20:63]. \n\tShe said: O son of my sister, these are the mistakes of the scribes; they \n\tmade a mistake when writing.\n\n\tThis report was \n\tnarrated from Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah by two of the Kufi narrators:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tAbu Mu‘aawiyah \n\tad-Dareer\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Sa‘eed ibn Mansoor in as-Sunan (4/1507, no. 769) with this \n\twording. It was also narrated by Abu ‘Ubayd in Fadaa’il al-Qur’an (p. \n\t229, no. 556) and via him by Abu ‘Amr ad-Daani in al-Muqni‘ (p. 119). \n\tIt was narrated by Ibn Jareer at-Tabari in Jaami‘ al-Bayaan (9/359) \n\tand Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif (p. 43).\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\t‘Ali ibn Mas-har \n\tal-Kufi\n\n\tAs was narrated \n\tby ‘Umar ibn Shubbah with his isnaad in Tareekh al-Madinah \n\t(3/1013-1014).\n\n\tSuch a report \n\tthat has such an isnaad is not sound. The problem with it is that the \n\tcritics spoke ill of the reports narrated by Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah himself when \n\the was in Iraq. Even though he was a trustworthy scholar, and in principle \n\twhat he narrated is to be taken as sound and acceptable, he made a few \n\tmistakes that the scholars could notice by examining the text of the hadith \n\tand researching other corroborating reports and similar reports. Because in \n\tthe text of this report there is something that is clearly odd, and there is \n\tno corroborating report narrated via any other chain of narrators, we can \n\tsay that there is a mistake in it.\n\n\tImam adh-Dhahabi \n\t(may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tWhen he – i.e., \n\tHishaam ibn ‘Urwah – came to Iraq at the end of his life, he taught a great \n\tdeal of knowledge, but there were a few hadiths that he reported (during \n\tthat teaching) that were not sound. Such a thing could happen to Maalik, \n\tShu‘bah, Wakee‘ and other trustworthy and prominent scholars.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tMizaan al-I‘tidaal (4/301). See the annotation of Sunan Sa‘eed ibn \n\tMansoor by Dr. Sa‘d al-Humayd (2/659). See also the commentary by Dr \n\tSa‘d al-Humayd (may Allah preserve him) on this report in his annotation of\n\tSunan Sa‘eed ibn Mansoor (4/507-514).\n\n\tIf someone were \n\tto ask: How could al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) and Muslim, in \n\ttheir Saheehs, narrate hadiths from Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah from the \n\tIraqis, and narrate from Abu Mu‘aawiyah, yet here you are rejecting them, \n\teven though as-Suyooti classed this report as saheeh in al-Itqaan (p. \n\t1236) and said that it meets the conditions of the two shaykhs (al-Bukhaari \n\tand Muslim)? The answer to that is that we are rejecting this report here \n\tbecause the text is obviously odd. It is unlikely that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with her) had not heard these verses with this grammatical \n\tstructure from the lips of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n\thim), and thought that the mistakes had occurred at the hands of the scribes \n\tof the Holy Qur’an.\n\n\tIf the critics \n\tfind something definitely odd in a text, they examine the isnaad, looking \n\tfor some subtle problem with it because of which this problem occurred in \n\tthe text. Here the problem is that it is a hadith from Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah \n\twhen he was in Iraq.\n\n\tThe second \n\treport is narrated from ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allah be pleased with \n\thim).\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tfrom him by a number of narrators:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\t‘Ikrimah the \n\tfreed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas.\n\n\tHe said: When \n\tthe Mus-hafs had been written, they were shown to ‘Uthmaan and he found in \n\tthem some grammatical mistakes, but he said: Do not change them, for the \n\tArabs will change them – or will read them correctly. If the scribe had been \n\tfrom Thaqeef and the one who dictated it had been from Hudhayl, these \n\tmistakes would not have occurred.\n\n\tNarrated by Abu \n\t‘Ubayd in Fadaa’il al-Qur’an (2/103, no. 562); Ibn Abi Dawood in \n\tal-Masaahif (1/235, no. 110). They attributed it to as-Suyooti in \n\tal-Itqaan (p. 1239); to Ibn al-Anbaari in ar-Radd ‘ala man khaalafa \n\tMus-haf ‘Uthmaan; and to Ibn Ashtah in al-Masaahif – the latter \n\tare two lost books. This is a da‘eef (weak) report, because the narration of \n\t‘Ikrimah from ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan is mursal, as is his narration from Abu \n\tBakr, ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib and the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace \n\tof Allah be upon him). See: Jaami‘ at-Tahseel (p. 239). Abu ‘Amr \n\tad-Daani clearly stated in al-Muqni‘ (p. 115) that there is an \n\tinterruption of the chain of narration between ‘Ikrimah and ‘Uthmaan. \n\tMoreover, ‘Ikrimah is referred to by Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif as \n\tat-Taa’i and not as the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas, and we have not come \n\tacross his biography.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tYahya ibn Ya‘mur\n\n\tHe said: It was \n\tnarrated by Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif (1/233) and Ibn Ashtah in\n\tal-Masaahif, as as-Suyooti mentioned in al-Itqaan (p. 1240). \n\tThis is also a mursal report, because it does not seem from the biography of \n\tYahya ibn Ya‘mur that he was a contemporary of ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may \n\tAllah be pleased with him). See his biography in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb \n\t(11/305). al-Bukhaari deemed it to be munqati‘ in at-Tareekh al-Kabeer \n\t(5/170). Moreover, there is some confusion about the isnaad, as sometimes it \n\tis narrated from Yahya ibn Ya‘mur from ‘Abdullah ibn Futaybah or ibn Abi \n\tFutaymah, and sometimes it is the other way round, so it is narrated from \n\tIbn Futaymah from Yahya ibn Ya‘mur, as in Tareekh al-Madinah \n\t(3/1013). Qataadah sometimes narrates from Nasr ibn ‘Aasim from Yahya, and \n\tsometimes he narrates from Yahya directly, without mentioning Nasr; or there \n\tmay be two other narrators between him and Yahya, as in the place referred \n\tto above in Tareekh al-Madinah. Al-Baaqillaani pointed out these \n\tdifferences in al-Intisaar li’l-Qur’an (2/136-137).\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\t‘Abd al-A‘la ibn \n\t‘Abdullah ibn ‘Aamir\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Ibn al-Anbaari in ar-Radd ‘ala man khaalafa Mus-haf ‘Uthmaan, as \n\twas mentioned by as-Suyooti in al-Itqaan (p. 1240). The biography of \n\t‘Abd al-A‘la is in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (87/6). In the book there is \n\tnothing to suggest that any of the scholars regarded him as a sound \n\tnarrator.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tQataadah\n\n\tIt was narrated \n\tby Ibn Abi Dawood in al-Masaahif. This version says: When ‘Uthmaan \n\t(may Allah be pleased with him) was given the Mus-haf to check it, he said: \n\tThere are mistakes in it, but the Arabs will recite it correctly. There is \n\tsome ambiguity in its chain of narration about one of the narrators, because \n\tit says: our companions told us.\n\n\tFrom the above \n\tit may be understood that the isnaads of this report are not sound, and \n\tweakness of the isnaad leads to doubt concerning the texts of the report and \n\tregarding the source of those texts.\n\n\tV.\n\n\tThe scholars \n\tdiscussed the way these reports should be understood, as we will highlight \n\there in brief, then follow that with lengthy quotations from the scholars \n\tfor anyone who wants this benefit.\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tThe fact that \n\tall the Mus-hafs that the Sahaabah had agreed on the way these verses were \n\twritten, and that all the Muslims agreed on their recitation, generation \n\tafter generation, proves that there was no grammatical mistake on the part \n\tof the scribe. Rather this is how it was heard from the Prophet (blessings \n\tand peace of Allah be upon him).\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tThe fact that \n\tthe Sahaabah and Taabi‘een were very keen and devoted a great deal of effort \n\tto transmitting the Holy Qur’an, and indeed to transmitting details of the \n\tProphet’s Sunnah and serving this religion, offering their souls and their \n\twealth, means that it is not possible for mistakes to have been made by the \n\tscribes who wrote down the Holy Qur’an, then for no one after them to have \n\tcorrected them until the present day.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt is not \n\tpossible that ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) could issue orders \n\tthat copies of the Qur’an be made and distributed to many regions, so as to \n\tput an end to disputes between reciters, then leave these mistakes caused \n\tthe scribes in the Mus-hafs, and not issue orders that they be corrected. \n\tBelieving that is contrary to sound reasoning.\n\n\t4.\n\t\n\tIt is possible \n\tto interpret ‘Uthmaan’s words, when he referred to mistakes, as referring to \n\tmistakes in recitation because the way some words are written may be unclear \n\tto some people, at some times. Therefore he reassured the people by saying \n\tthat the Arabs’ understanding of the language would make them correct anyone \n\twho made a mistake in reciting the words of the Qur’an. This is how Abu ‘Amr \n\tad-Daani interpreted this report.\n\n\t5.\n\t\n\tIt is also \n\tpossible to interpret the words of ‘Aa’ishah as meaning that she thought \n\tthat if other modes of recitation had been chosen (to write the Mus-haf in \n\taccordance therewith), that were in accordance with the rules of the Arabic \n\tlanguage with which ordinary people were familiar, that would have been \n\tbetter. So her regarding what is written as wrong means that it was \n\tdifferent from the recitation that is known and common among the Arabs.\n\n\tIbn Jareer \n\tat-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tIn the \n\trecitation of Ubayy ibn Ka‘b it says: “wa’l-muqeemeena \n\tas-salaata (and those who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah))”\n\t[an-Nisa’ 4:162]. That is how it was written in his Mus-haf, as some \n\thave narrated. If that was a mistake by the scribes, then what must have \n\tbeen the case is that this should have meant that all the other Mus-hafs, \n\tapart from our Mus-haf, must have the same mistake, in a manner contrary to \n\twhat is in our Mus-haf. The fact that our Mus-haf is the same as the Mus-haf \n\tof Ubayy proves that what is in our Mus-haf in that regard is correct and is \n\tnot wrong. Moreover, if that was a mistake in writing, the Companions of the \n\tMessenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), from whom it \n\twas learned, would not have taught the Muslims to recite in an incorrect \n\tmanner, and they would have recited it correctly and would have taught the \n\tummah the correct way of reciting it. The fact that the Muslims transmitted \n\tthe recitation of these verses in the way they are written is the strongest \n\tevidence that what is written is sound and correct, and that there is no \n\tmistake on the part of the scribe.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tJaami‘ al-Bayaan (9/397). See also: al-Kashshaaf by \n\taz-Zamakhshari (1/590).\n\n\tAbu ‘Amr \n\tad-Daani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tIf someone were \n\tto ask: What do you say about the report that they narrated from Yahya ibn \n\tYa‘mur and ‘Ikrimah the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas from ‘Uthmaan (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with him), that when copies were made of the Qur’an, they were \n\tshown to him and he found some grammatical mistakes in them, but he said: \n\tLeave it, for the Arabs will be able to recite it correctly – and this \n\tindicates that there were some mistakes in the writing?\n\n\tI say: This \n\treport, in our view, cannot be raised to the level of constituting proof, \n\tand it is not valid to quote it as evidence, on two counts:\n\n\tFirstly: in \n\taddition to the flaws in its isnaad and the problems with its wording, it is \n\talso mursal, because Ibn Ya‘mur and ‘Ikrimah did not hear anything from \n\t‘Uthmaan and did not see him.\n\n\tAlso, the \n\tapparent meaning of the wording cannot have been said by ‘Uthmaan (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with him), because this report implies criticism of him, and how \n\tcould that criticism be valid when he is known to have attained a high level \n\tof religious leadership, a high status of service to Islam, great sincerity \n\ttowards the ummah and great efforts to do that which is in the best \n\tinterests of the Muslims? It is not possible that he could have compiled the \n\tMus-haf with the help of other righteous Sahaabah, so as to put an end to \n\tdifferences concerning the Qur’an among them, then despite that leave in it \n\tgrammatical mistakes so that someone else (after he was gone) would have to \n\ttake on the task of changing it, who would no doubt not be able to reach his \n\tcalibre or level of knowledge. This is something that no one could accept \n\t(because it does not make sense), and it is not permissible for anyone to \n\tbelieve it.\n\n\tIf he were to \n\task: \n\n\tHow can you \n\tunderstand the report if it was soundly narrated from ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be \n\tpleased with him)?\n\n\tI say:\n\n\tThe way we may \n\tunderstand it is that what ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) meant by \n\tthe grammatical mistakes mentioned is mistakes in recitation, not in the way \n\tit was written, because in many places in the Qur’an, if the words were to \n\tbe recited as they were written, that would give the opposite meaning and \n\twould change the wording. Do you not see the verses in which it says: \n\t“la adhbahannahu (I \n\twill surely …slaughter him)” [an-Naml 27:21], “min naba’ il-mursaleen (the \n\tinformation (news) about the Messengers)” [al-An‘aam 6:34], \n\tand other examples in which an additional alif, yaa or waw appears in the \n\tway it is written. Anyone who recites these words who is not familiar with \n\thow they are usually written will add to the pronunciation something that is \n\tnot part of it, so he will have made a mistake that is clear to anyone who \n\thears him, even though the way it is written is valid and was common. So \n\twhen he realised that, ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said that \n\twhoever is not familiar with the way of writing (some particular words) and \n\tdoes not have knowledge of that among those who come after him, will learn \n\tthat from the Arabs, because the Qur’an was revealed in their language, so \n\tthey will teach him the correct recitation, and will explain to him the \n\tvalidity of the way in which it is written. This is how it is to be \n\tunderstood in my view. And Allah knows best.\n\n\tIf it is said: \n\twhat is meant by the words of ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) at \n\tthe end of this report, “If the scribe had been from Thaqeef and the one who \n\tdictated it had been from Hudhayl, these mistakes would not have occurred”?\n\n\tI say: What it \n\tmeans is that it would not be written in that way, because Quraysh and \n\tothers who took charge of writing the Mus-hafs from people other than \n\tQuraysh used to write these words in this manner, and this way of writing \n\tthese words was common among them, but Thaqeef and Hudhayl, despite their \n\tgood command of Arabic, did not use this way of writing these words. \n\tTherefore if they – and not the Muhaajiroon and Ansaar – had been in charge \n\tof writing the Mus-hafs, they would have written all these words as they are \n\tpronounced, not on the basis of their meaning, because that was the usual \n\tpractice among them and was common. This is how we may understand the \n\tcomment of ‘Uthmaan in my view, if it is proven and anyone can prove it. And \n\tAllah is the source of strength.\n\n\tIf it is said: \n\tThen what is the meaning of the report that you also narrated from Hishaam \n\tibn ‘Urwah, from his father, that he asked ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased \n\twith her) about grammatical mistakes in the Qur’an, about the verses, “Verily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]” [Taa-Haa 20:63], “and \n\tthose who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) wa’l muqeemeena as-salaata \n\twa’l-mu’toona az-zakaata wa’l-mu’minoona Billaah…], and give Zakaah” \n\t[an-Nisa’ 4:162] \n\tand “Surely, those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah, in His Messenger \n\tMuhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and all that was \n\trevealed to him from Allah), those who are the Jews and the Sabians \n\t[wa’s-saabi’oona]” [al-Maa’idah 5:69], \n\tand she said: O \n\tson of my brother, this is the work of the scribes; they made mistakes in \n\twriting?\n\n\tI say:\n\n\tIts meaning is \n\tclear: ‘Urwah did not ask ‘Aa’ishah about the written letters that may be \n\tadded for a reason or taken away for a reason, so as to make things clear \n\t(when adding) or to make writing easier (when taking away). Rather he was \n\tasking her about the modes of recitation in which words may differ, which \n\tmay lead to different meanings, according to the dialects in which Allah \n\tpermitted His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his \n\tummah to recite the Qur’an, and to adhere to whichever mode of recitation \n\tthey wanted, so as to make things easy for them. If this is the case, then \n\tthere is no room for mistakes, error, confusion and slips, for these \n\tdialects are widely known and clear in the Arabic language. If this is the \n\tcase, then she was not referring to the meaning of what is written and it \n\thas nothing to do with that at all. Rather ‘Urwah called that a mistake, and \n\t‘Aa’ishah called the way it is written a mistake, but they did not literally \n\tmean it was a mistake; rather it was by way of exaggeration, because that \n\twas contrary to their way and was not something that they would have chosen \n\tthemselves. That was more appropriate in their view and was what was more \n\tcommon in their view, although not in a definitive way, because of what we \n\texplained above about that being valid and common in the language, and it \n\tbeing common usage in the Arabic language. Furthermore there was consensus \n\tthat these words were to be recited as such and not as they (‘Aa’ishah and \n\t‘Urwah) thought they should be, except for the odd view of Abu ‘Amr ibn \n\tal-‘Ala’, who thought that it was to be recited inna haadhayni in \n\tthis particular instances. [This refers to “Verily! \n\tthese are two magicians [inna haadhaani la saahiraan]” [Taa-Haa 20:63]]. \n\tThis is how we should understand this report. But we cannot be certain that \n\tthe Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), despite her \n\thigh status and prominence, and her vast knowledge of Islam and the language \n\tof her people, would accuse the Companions of making grammatical mistakes \n\tand accuse the scribes of making errors, when she was of such a high level \n\tof eloquence and knowledge of Arabic, as was well known and no one would \n\tignore or deny it. That is not appropriate and cannot be true. Some of our \n\tscholars interpreted the words of the Mother of the Believers, They made a \n\tmistake in writing, as meaning that they made a mistake by not choosing what \n\tis more proper of the seven modes of recitation with which the people were \n\tfamiliar, not that what they wrote was a mistake and was not valid, because \n\twhat is not valid is to be rejected by all. no matter how long a time has \n\telapsed since the error was made and no matter how widespread it has become. \n\tSome interpreted the word lahn,  translated here as grammatical \n\terror, as referring to recitation and dialect, such as when ‘Umar (may Allah \n\tbe pleased with him) said: Ubayy is the best reciter among you, even though \n\twe overlook some of his lahn – i.e., his way of recitation and \n\tdialect. This is clear. And Allah is the source of strength. End quote from\n\tal-Muqni‘ (118-119).\n\n\tAs-Suyooti (may \n\tAllah have mercy on him) said:\n\n\tThese reports \n\tare very problematic.\n\n\tHow can it be \n\tthought of the Companions, first of all, that they made grammatical mistakes \n\twhen speaking, let alone when reciting Qur’an, when they were the most \n\teloquent of people in Arabic!\n\n\tSecondly, how \n\tcan it be thought that they made grammatical mistakes in the Qur’an which \n\tthey learned from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as \n\tit was revealed, and they memorised it and were very precise with regard to \n\tit?\n\n\tThirdly, how \n\tcould it be thought of them that they would all make the same mistake and \n\twrite it in a mistaken way?\n\n\tMoreover, how \n\tcan it be thought that they would not notice that and correct it?\n\n\tThen how can it \n\tbe thought that ‘Uthmaan would forbid them to correct the mistake?\n\n\tThen how could \n\tit be thought that the recitation of the Qur’an would continue on the basis \n\tof that mistake, when the Qur’an was transmitted via tawaatur, one \n\tgeneration after another?\n\n\tThis is \n\timpossible on the basis of rational thinking and Islamic teachings and on \n\tthe basis of how things are.\n\n\tThe scholars \n\tresponded to that on three counts:\n\n\t1.\n\t\n\tThat was not \n\tsoundly narrated from ‘Uthmaan. Its isnaad is weak (da‘eef), flawed \n\t(mudtarib) and interrupted (munqati‘). Moreover, ‘Uthmaan intended to make \n\tthe Mus-haf the reference point to be followed, so how could he see in it \n\tgrammatical mistakes and leave them for the Arabs to correct them when they \n\trecited it. If those who were charged with collecting the Mus-haf and \n\tputting it together in one book, who were the best of people, did not \n\tcorrect it, then how could others do that?!\n\n\tMoreover, \n\t‘Uthmaan did not only make one copy of the Qur’an; rather he made many \n\tcopies. So if it is said that there were grammatical mistakes in all of \n\tthem, it is very far-fetched to suggest that the same mistake would be \n\trepeated in all of them, or if the mistake happened in some of them, then \n\tthis is an acknowledgement that some were correct. But none of the reports \n\tsaid that this mistake was in one Mus-haf and not another. The Mus-hafs \n\tnever differed, except in cases where there is an alternative mode of \n\trecitation, and that is not a grammatical error.\n\n\t2.\n\t\n\tIf we assume \n\tthat the report is sound, then it is to be interpreted as referring to the \n\tsigns or symbols showing where something is omitted, such as the long alif \n\tin words such as al-kitaab (the book), as-saabiroon (the \n\tpatient ones) and so on.\n\n\t3.\n\t\n\tIt may be interpreted as referring to words where the way in \n\twhich they are pronounced is different from the way in which they are \n\twritten. For example, they wrote “la adhbahannahu (I \n\twill surely …slaughter him)” \n\t[an-Naml 27:21], \n\twith an alif after the laam, and “bi aydin (With power)” [adh-Dhaariyaat \n\t51:47] with two yaas. If these words to be recited as they are written, \n\tthat would be a grammatical mistake. \n\n\tThis response \n\tand the previous one were given by Ibn Ashtah in Kitaab al-Masaahif.\n\n\tIbn al-Anbaari \n\tsaid in ar-Radd ‘ala man khaalafa Mus-haf ‘Uthmaan, concerning the \n\thadiths narrated from ‘Uthmaan about that:\n\n\tThey do not \n\tconstitute proof, because their isnaads are interrupted and are not intact. \n\tNo man of common sense and reasoning could accept that ‘Uthmaan – who was \n\tthe caliph of the ummah and the leader of the people of his time – could \n\tunite them in accepting the Mus-haf which was the main reference, then \n\trealise that there were mistakes in it and mistakes in the way in which it \n\twas written, then not correct them. No, by Allah, no one who is fair minded \n\tand possesses understanding could think such a thing. He could not believe \n\tthat he would leave the mistake in the books of the people after him to \n\tcorrect it, when the people who would come after him would have no choice \n\tbut to refer to it and go by it. Whoever claims that when ‘Uthmaan said, “I \n\tsee mistakes in it,” he mean, I see mistakes in the way it is written, then \n\tif we recite it correctly the mistake in writing will not matter in the \n\tsense of distorting the words and going against grammatical rules, is \n\tmistaken, because the way it is written is the way it is to be recited and \n\tpronounced. So whoever makes a mistake in writing will make a mistake in \n\twhat he utters. ‘Uthmaan would never have delayed correcting a mistake \n\tconcerning the words of the Qur’an, whether in the way they are written or \n\tthe way they are pronounced. It is well-known that ‘Uthmaan was constantly \n\tin contact with the Qur’an, and was skilled in reciting it in accordance \n\twith the way it was written in the copies of the Qur’an that were sent to \n\tthe various regions. He (as-Suyooti) supported that with what Abu ‘Ubayd \n\tnarrated. He said: ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Mahdi told us, from ‘Abdullah ibn \n\tMubaarak: Abu Waa’il, an old man from Yemen, told us, from Haani’ \n\tal-Barbari, the freed slave of ‘Uthmaan, who said: I was with ‘Uthmaan when \n\tthey were presenting the Mus-hafs to him. He sent me to Ubayy ibn Ka‘b with \n\tthe shoulder blade of a sheep, on which was written, “lam yatasanna” and \n\t“laa tabdeelah lil-khalq” and “fa amhil al-kaafireen”. He called for an ink \n\tpot and erased one of the two laams (in the word “lil khalq”) and wrote “li \n\tkhalq-illah (“in the creation of Allah” – referring to the verse \n\t“No \n\tchange let there be in Khalq¬illâh (i.e. the religion of Allâh)” \n\t[ar-Room 30:30]). \n\tHe erased the word fa amhil and wrote “fa mahhil” (“so give respite” \n\treferring to the verse“So \n\tgive respite to the disbelievers” \n\t[at-Taariq 86:17]). \n\tAnd he wrote lam yatasannah (“they show no change”, referring to the verse\n\t“they \n\tshow no change” \n\t[al-Baqarah 2:259]); \n\the added the letter haa’ to it. \n\n\tIbn al-Anbaari \n\tsaid: How can it be claimed that he saw some mistakes and let them pass, \n\twhen he was checking what was written and disputes between scribes were \n\treferred to him so that he could judge on the basis of truth, and he would \n\tcompel them to write what is correct and make it final?\n\n\tThis is also \n\tsupported by what Ibn Ashtah narrated in al-Masaahif. He said: \n\tal-Hasan ibn ‘Uthmaan told us: ar-Rabee‘ ibn Badr informed us, from Siwaar \n\tibn Shubayb, who said: I asked Ibn az-Zubayr about the Mus-hafs and he \n\tsaid:  A man went to ‘Umar and said: O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, the people are \n\targuing about the Qur’an. ‘Umar thought of collecting the Qur’an and making \n\tit according to one recitation, but then he was fatally stabbed. During the \n\tcaliphate of ‘Uthmaan, that man stood up and spoke to him about the issue, \n\tand ‘Uthmaan collected and made copies of the Mus-hafs. Then he sent me to \n\t‘Aa’ishah, and I brought the pages and showed them to her so that she could \n\tcorrect them, then he ordered that all other copies be destroyed. This \n\tindicates that they checked it and verified it, and they did not leave \n\tanything that needed to be corrected but they corrected it.\n\n\tThen Ibn Ashtah \n\tsaid: Muhammad ibn Ya‘qoob informed us: Abu Dawood Sulaymaan ibn al-Ash‘ath \n\tinformed us: Ahmad ibn Mas‘adah informed us: Ismaa‘eel informed us: \n\tal-Haarith ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahman told me, from ‘Abd al-A‘la ibn ‘Abdullah ibn \n\t‘Aamir who said: When the writing of the Mus-haf was finished, it was \n\tbrought to ‘Uthmaan and he looked at it, then he said: You have done well. I \n\tsee something but we will be able to correct it according to our dialect.\n\n\tThere is no \n\tproblem with this report, and it explains the meaning of what appears above. \n\tIt is as if it was shown to him immediately after the writing of it was \n\tfinished, and he saw something in it that was written differently from the \n\tway Quraysh would pronounce it, as happened with the word taaboot \n\t[which may be written with taa’ marbootah or taa’ maftoohah], so he promised \n\tto correct it according to the dialect of Quraysh. Then he fulfilled that \n\tpromise when he examined it and verified it, and he did not leave anything \n\t(that needed to be corrected but he corrected it). Perhaps the one who \n\tnarrated those reports quoted above distorted what he heard and did not \n\tremember it precisely as ‘Uthmaan had said it, which resulted in this \n\tconfusion. This is the best answer that could be given for this problem, to \n\tAllah be praise.\n\n\tSo none of these \n\tresponses is sound with regard to the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah.\n\n\tWith regard to \n\tthe response that classes it as da‘eef (weak), that is to be rejected \n\tbecause its isnaad is saheeh (sound) as you see. \n\n\tAs for the \n\tresponse which speaks of signs or symbols showing where something is \n\tomitted, ‘Urwah’s question about the words mentioned does not fit that \n\tdiscussion.\n\n\tIbn Ashtah said \n\t– and Ibn Jabbaarah followed him in Sharh ar-Raa’iyyah, that what is meant \n\tby her saying, They made a mistake means: in choosing that which was more \n\tappropriate of the seven modes of recitation, according to which all people \n\tcould recite. It does not mean that the way they wrote it is wrong and is \n\tnot permissible. He said: The evidence for that is that whatever is not \n\tpermissible is to be rejected by all, regardless of the passage of time \n\tsince that mistake was made.\n\n\tHe said: With \n\tregard to the view of Sa‘eed ibn Jubayr about it being a lahn on the part of \n\tthe scribe, perhaps what he meant by lahn is recitation and dialect, meaning \n\tthat this is the dialect of the one who wrote it and the way he recited it, \n\tand there is another way to recite it .\n\n\tThen he narrated \n\tfrom Ibraaheem an-Nakha‘i that he said: “inna hadhaani la saahiraan” \n\t[Taa-Haa 20:63] and “inna hadhayni la saahiraan” are the same. \n\tPerhaps they wrote alif instead of yaa, and in “wa’s-saabi’oona” [al-Maa’idah \n\t5:69] they wrote waw instead of yaa’.\n\n\tIbn Ashtah said:\n\n\tThat is, it is \n\takin to replacing a letter when writing it with another letter, as in the \n\twords salaah, zakaah and hayaat [which in the Qur’an are written with a waw \n\talthough they are pronounced as if they are written with a long alif].\n\n\tAnd I say: This \n\tanswer could be fine if it was recited with a yaa’, but the way it is \n\twritten is different. As recitation is done according to the way it is \n\twritten, there is no comparison between the two.\n\n\tEnd quote from\n\tal-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (p. 1241-1247).\n\n\tSee also: \n\tMajmoo‘ al-Fataawa by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (15/252-255)\n\n\tAnd Allah knows \n\tbest.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the Holy Qur'an is regarded as the literal word of God (Allah), revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the angel Gabriel. The Qur'an is considered perfect and inimitable, and Muslims believe that it is free from any errors, including linguistic ones. \n\nFalse reports or claims that attribute linguistic errors to the Qur'an often stem from misunderstandings, misinterpretations, or a lack of knowledge about the Arabic language and its nuances. The Qur'an employs a rich and complex style of Arabic, which includes eloquence, metaphor, and other rhetorical devices that may not be immediately clear to every reader.\n\nMany scholars and linguists have defended the linguistic integrity of the Qur'an by explaining its unique style, context, and the meanings behind various verses. Additionally, Islamic teachings encourage believers to seek understanding and knowledge, and many resources are available for those who wish to study the Qur'an’s language and rhetoric more deeply.\n\nIf someone encounters claims about errors in the Qur'an, it is advisable to refer to knowledgeable scholars or credible sources within the Islamic tradition to gain accurate insights and clarifications."

        "question": "Ruling on writing the Qur’an or part of it in an alphabet other than Arabic then pronouncing it in Arabic – will one have the reward of reciting it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly: \n\n\tIn the answer to question no. 97741 we \n\tstated that it is not permissible to write the Holy Qur’an in anything other \n\tthan ‘Uthmaani script. \n\n\tSecondly: \n\n\tIf it is not permissible to write the Holy Qur’an in anything \n\tother than ‘Uthmaani script, then it is more appropriate to note that it is \n\tnot permissible to write it in anything other than Arabic letters. \n\n\tThe Islamic texts indicate, and the scholars of Islam are \n\tunanimously agreed, that it is obligatory to protect the word of Allah, may \n\tHe be exalted, from distortion and alteration, and undoubtedly writing it in \n\tanything other than Arabic letters is one of the most likely ways that lead \n\tto distortion of its pronunciation and meanings, because of the clear \n\tdifference between the nature of the Arabic language – with its letters, \n\twords, style, ways of writing, ways of pronouncing, and the usage of its \n\tnative speakers – and other languages. \n\n\tIt says in the book Tahreem Kitaabat al-Qur’an al-Kareem \n\tbi Huroof ghayr ‘Arabiyyah (Prohibition on writing the Holy Qur’an in \n\tnon-Arabic letters – 1/36): \n\n\tAfter studying the topic, discussing it and exchanging \n\topinions concerning it, the Committee unanimously agreed that it is \n\tprohibited to write the Qur’an in Latin script or the letters of any other \n\tlanguage, for the following reasons: \n\n\t1.\n\n\tThe Quran was revealed in a clear Arabic tongue, both letters \n\tand meanings. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n\tmeaning):\n\n\t“And truly, \n\tthis (the Quran) is a revelation from the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, \n\tjinns and all that exists),\n\n\tWhich the trustworthy Rooh (Jibrael (Gabriel)) has brought \n\tdown\n\n\tUpon your heart (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be \n\tupon him)) that you may be (one) of the warners,\n\n\tIn the plain Arabic language”\n\n\t[ash-Shu‘ara’ 26:192-195]. \n\n\tWhat is written in Latin letters cannot be called Quran, \n\tbecause Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\t“And thus We have sent it down as a Quran in Arabic”\n\n\t[Ta-Ha 20:113]\n\n\t“And indeed We know that they (polytheists and pagans) say: \n\t\"It is only a human being who teaches him (Muhammad (blessings and peace of \n\tAllah be upon him)).\" The tongue of the man they refer to is foreign, while \n\tthis (the Quran) is a clear Arabic tongue”\n\n\t[an-Nahl 16:103]. \n\n\t2.\n\n\tThe Quran was written down when it was revealed, and when it \n\twas compiled by Abu Bakr and ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with them), in \n\tArabic letters. All the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) agreed to \n\tthat, as did all the Taabi‘een, and those who came after them, until the \n\tpresent day, despite the fact that there were those who did not speak \n\tArabic. And it is proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n\tupon him) that he said: “You must adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the \n\tRightly-Guided Caliphs after me…” \n\n\tSo it is obligatory to adhere to that, following what was \n\tdone at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n\tand the Rightly-Guided Caliphs who succeeded him, and acting in accordance \n\twith the consensus of the ummah. \n\n\t3.\n\n\tThe letters of different languages are something that people \n\tagree upon and are subject to being changed and replaced with other letters. \n\tTherefore there is the fear, if this door is opened, that it may lead to \n\tchange every time people decide to pronounce a certain letter in a different \n\tmanner, and there is the fear that the recitation may change accordingly, \n\twhich would lead to confusion with the passage of time, so that the enemies \n\tof Islam could find a way to criticise the Qur’an, as happened with the \n\tprevious Scriptures. So it is essential to prevent that, in order to \n\tpreserve the source of Islam and block the means that may lead to evil and \n\tcorruption. \n\n\t4.\n\n\tIf a concession is granted allowing that or it is approved, \n\tthere is the fear that the Quran may become a toy in people’s hands, so each \n\tone may suggest writing it in his alphabet or in any other alphabet, and \n\tundoubtedly that will lead to differences and confusion. It is essential to \n\tprotect the Quran from that, so as to protect Islam and preserve the Book of \n\tAllah from tampering and variations. \n\n\t5.\n\n\tWriting the Quran in letters other than Arabic will \n\tdiscourage the Muslims from learning the Arabic language, in which they \n\tworship their Lord and learn and understand their religion. \n\n\tAnd Allah is the source of strength; may Allah send blessings \n\tand peace upon Muhammad and his family and companions. \n\n\tCouncil of Senior Scholars \n\n\tWe put this question to His Excellency Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez \n\tibn Baaz, Secretary-General of the Academic Research Council, and he \n\tgraciously sent us this fatwa that was issued by the Council in its \n\tfourteenth session held in at-Taa’if in Shawwaal 1399 AH. \n\n\tFrom the above it is clear that the writing and recitation \n\tthat brings reward for the one who recites a letter of the Book of Allah \n\tonly refers to the one who writes it and reads it in Arabic, as Allah \n\trevealed it. As for the one who writes it in anything other than Arabic – \n\tand more so the one who pronounces it – he has done something that is not \n\tprescribed in Islam. \n\n\tBut for the one who is unable to write it in Arabic, or wants \n\tto quote from it in a book that he has written in a language other than \n\tArabic, he may write a translation of the meanings of what he wants to \n\tquote, but he should not write that for the purpose of recitation and \n\tworship, as appears to be referred to in the question. \n\n\tAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the Qur'an is considered the literal word of God, and its recitation is a highly revered act of worship. The original language of the Qur'an is Arabic, and it is recommended to recite it in Arabic to fully capture its linguistic beauty, rhythm, and meaning.\n\nWhen it comes to writing the Qur'an or parts of it in a different alphabet and then pronouncing it in Arabic, the general understanding among scholars is that while one might be able to express the sounds of the Arabic words, it does not equate to the actual recitation of the Qur'an in its original form. The reward for reciting the Qur'an as specified in Islamic teachings typically pertains to recitation in Arabic.\n\nThat being said, if someone is unable to read Arabic and uses a transliteration system to pronounce Arabic words, this may still be a way to learn and appreciate the Qur'an. However, it is important to strive towards learning to read the Qur'an in Arabic eventually, as that is the ideal and preferred method of recitation and carries the full reward associated with it.\n\nIn summary, while writing or pronouncing the Qur'an in a different alphabet may facilitate learning, it does not replace the merit and reward of reciting it in Arabic. It is beneficial to learn and recite the Qur'an in its original language whenever possible."

        "question": "Pausing at the ends of verses is Sunnah, even if they are connected to what follows",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tFirstly: \n\n\tIt is Sunnah to pause at the ends of verses, even if they are \n\tconnected to what comes after them, according to the more correct of the two \n\tscholarly opinions. \n\n\tIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used \n\tto interrupt his recitation, pausing at the end of every verse, so he would \n\tsay: “Al-hamdu Lillahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen (All \n\tthe praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, jinns \n\tand all that exists)),” \n\tand pause; “ar-Rahmaan ir-Raheem (The Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful)”, \n\tand pause; ‘Maaliki yawm id-deen (The Only Owner (and the Only Ruling \n\tJudge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of Resurrection))”… \n\n\tAz-Zuhri stated that the recitation of the Messenger of Allah \n\t(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was verse by verse, and this is \n\twhat is best, to pause at the ends of verses, even if they are connected to \n\twhat comes after them. \n\n\tSome reciters are of the view that one should pay attention \n\tto the meaning and context of the verses, and pause at the end of each \n\tmeaning, but following the practice and Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and \n\tpeace of Allah be upon him) is preferable. \n\n\tThis was mentioned by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan \n\tand others, and he regarded it is more correct to pause at the ends of \n\tverses, even if they are connected to what comes after them. End quote. \n\n\tZaad al-Ma‘aad \n\t(1/326) \n\n\tIbn al-Jazari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tSome of them regarded pausing at the end of the verses as \n\tSunnah. Abu ‘Amr said: That is dearer to me. This view was also favoured by \n\tal-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan and by other scholars. They said: What \n\tis best is to pause at the ends of verses, even if they are connected to \n\twhat comes after them. They said: Following the practice and Sunnah of the \n\tMessenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is preferable. \n\tEnd quote. \n\n\tAn-Nashr fi’l-Qiraa’aat al-‘Ashr \n\t(1/226) \n\n\tSecondly: \n\n\tThis is also indicated by what is proven in the Sunnah, that \n\tthe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pause at the \n\tends of verses. \n\n\tAbu Dawood (4001) and at-Tirmidhi (2927) narrated that Umm \n\tSalamah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n\thim) used to interrupt his recitation, so he would recite, “Al-hamdu \n\tLillahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen (All \n\tthe praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, jinns \n\tand all that exists)),” \n\tthen pause; “ar-Rahmaan ir-Raheem (The Most Beneficent, the Most \n\tMerciful)”, then pause. \n\n\tIbn al-Jazari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tThis is a hasan hadith; its isnaad is saheeh. \n\n\tAn-Nashr fi’l-Qiraa’aat al-‘Ashr \n\t(1/226) \n\n\tIt was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi \n\tDawood. \n\n\tAl-Qaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\t“He would interrupt his recitation” means that he would \n\trecite with pauses at the ends of verses. End quote. \n\n\tMirqaat al-Mafaateeh \n\t(4/1503) \n\n\tAhmad (26470) narrated from Naafi‘ ibn ‘Umar, from Ibn Abi \n\tMulaykah, from one of the wives of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah \n\tbe upon him) – Naafi‘ said: I think it was Hafsah – that she was asked about \n\tthe recitation of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be \n\tupon him), and she said: You cannot do that. He said: I said to her: Tell us \n\tabout it. He said: So she recited with a slow and deliberate pace. Naafi ‘ \n\tsaid: Ibn Abi Mulaykah demonstrated to us: “Al-hamdu \n\tLillahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen (All \n\tthe praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, jinns \n\tand all that exists)),” \n\tthen he stopped; “ar-Rahmaan ir-Raheem (The Most Beneficent, the Most \n\tMerciful)”, then he stopped; ‘Maaliki yawm id-deen (The Only Owner \n\t(and the Only Ruling Judge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of \n\tResurrection))”… \n\n\tThe commentators on al-Musnad said: Its men are \n\tthiqaat (trustworthy), the men of the two shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim]. \n\n\tIt was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Sifat as-Salaah \n\t(1/295). \n\n\tAt-Tirmidhi (2923), an-Nasaa’i (1022) and al-Haakim (1165) \n\tnarrated from Ya‘la ibn Mamlak that he asked Umm Salamah about the Messenger \n\tof Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his prayer. She \n\tsaid: His prayer is different from yours. Then she described his recitation, \n\tand she described a recitation in which every single letter was very clearly \n\tpronounced. \n\n\tClassed as saheeh by at-Tirmidhi and al-Haakim; classed as \n\thasan by al-Baghawi in Sharh as-Sunnah (4/482); classed as da‘eef by \n\tal-Albaani in Da‘eef at-Tirmidhi\n\n\tAs-Sakhkhaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tHer words “in which every single letter was very clearly \n\tpronounced” refer to what we have seen above in the first hadith about \n\tpausing at the end of every verse. End quote. \n\n\tJamaal al-Qurra’ \n\t(p. 668) \n\n\tThirdly:\n\n\t Some of the scholars are of the view that pauses should not \n\tbe made at the ends of verses if there is a strong connection to what \n\tfollows, as in the passage in which Allah, may He be exalted, says \n\t(interpretation of the meaning): “So \n\twoe unto those performers of Salat (prayers) (hypocrites), Who delay their \n\tSalat (prayer) from their stated fixed times” \n\t[al-Maa‘oon 107:4-5]. \n\n\tZakariyya al-Ansaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in \n\tal-Maqsid (p. 5): \n\n\tIt is Sunnah for the reciter to learn the pauses, and to \n\tpause at the ends of verses, except in cases where there is a strong \n\tconnection to what follows, as in the verses in which Allah, may He be \n\texalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And even if We opened to \n\tthem a gate from the heaven and they were to continue ascending thereto, \n\tthey would surely say: ‘Our eyes have been (as if) dazzled. Nay, we are a \n\tpeople bewitched’” [al-Hijr 15:14] and “(Iblees (Satan)) said: ‘By \n\tYour Might, then I will surely mislead them all, except Your chosen slaves \n\tamongst them (faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism)” [Saad \n\t38:82], because the structure of the wording in both cases indicates \n\tthat the second verse in each case is strongly connected to the preceding \n\tverse. End quote. \n\n\tHowever what is more likely to be correct is that one should \n\tpause at the ends of verses in all cases, even if it is strongly connected \n\tto what follows it, because of the apparent meaning of the Sunnah. \n\n\tShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) \n\tsaid:\n\n\tFor the reader to pause at the ends of verses is Sunnah, even \n\tif the following verse is strongly connected to the preceding verse. End \n\tquote. \n\n\tAl-Fataawa al-Kubra \n\t(5/334) \n\n\tHowever it is disallowed to stop reciting altogether at a \n\tparticular point if that will change the meaning, such as one who recites \n\tthe words “So \n\twoe unto those performers of Salat (prayers)” \n\t[al-Maa‘oon 107:4], and \n\tstops there without reciting the following verse. \n\n\tFourthly: \n\n\tOther books that discuss this topic – other than those \n\treferred to above – include the following: \n\n\t·Al-Jaami‘ li Ahkaam \n\tal-Qur’an (20/201) by \n\tal-Qurtubi\n\n\t·At-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer \n\t(1/76) by Ibn ‘Ashoor\n\n\t·Al-Muktafa fi’l-Waqf \n\twa’l-Ibtida by Abu ‘Amr \n\tad-Daani (p. 244)\n\n\t·Jamaal al-Qurra’ wa \n\tKamaal al-Iqra’ (p. 673) \n\tby ‘Alam ad-Deen as-Sakhkhaawi\n\n\t·Al-Burhaan fi ‘Uloom \n\tal-Qur’an (1/350) by \n\tBadr ad-Deen az-Zarkashi\n\n\t·Al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom \n\tal-Qur’an (1/299) by \n\tJalaal ad-Deen as-Suyooti \n\n\tFor more information, please see the answer to question no.\n\t13340\n\n\tAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the context of reciting the Quran, it is indeed a Sunnah to pause at the ends of verses (ayahs) even if they are connected to what follows. This practice is important as it allows for proper understanding and reflection on the meaning of the verses. \n\nPausing at the end of a verse does not only serve to enhance the clarity of recitation but also respects the structure of the Quran, which is originally divided into verses for a reason. This approach aligns with the etiquettes (adab) of reciting the Quran. However, it is also permissible to continue reciting without pause if the meaning remains clear and there’s no danger of misunderstanding or misinterpretation. \n\nUltimately, the way one chooses to recite can vary, but following the Sunnah of pausing is recommended for maintaining the beauty and integrity of the Quranic recitation."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n\tAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation \n\tof the meaning): “And \n\tAllah has created you and then He will cause you to die, and of you there \n\tare some who are sent back to senility, so that they know nothing after \n\thaving known (much)” [an-Nahl \n\t16:70].\n\n\tAnd He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the \n\tmeaning): “And \n\tamong you there is he who dies (young), and among you there is he who is \n\tsent back to senility, so that he knows nothing after having known” \n\t[al-Hajj 22:5]. \n\n\tAt-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tAllah, may He be exalted, is saying: Allah created you, O \n\tpeople, and brought you into being, when you had been nothing, and it was \n\tnot the gods whom you worship besides Him (who created you). Therefore \n\tworship the One Who created you, and no other, then He will take your souls \n\tin death. \n\n\tAnd some of you will grow old, and end up reaching a stage of \n\tsenility, which is the worst \n\tof stages. We only bring him back to senility so that he will once again \n\tbecome ignorant, as he was in infancy and childhood, so that he will not \n\tknow anything after the knowledge that he had when he was young. All of that \n\twill be lost when he grows old, and will be forgotten, and he will not know \n\tanything of it, for it will escape his mind. So after having possessed the \n\tpower of rational thinking, he will not understand anything. \n\n\tAs-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\t\n\n\tHere Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that it is He Who \n\tcreates people and causes them to move through the stages of creation, one \n\tafter another. Then after their lifespan has ended, He causes them to die, \n\tbut He causes some to live until they are \n\tsent back to senility, \n\ti.e., the worst age, in which a person loses his outward and inward \n\tstrength, even his power of reasoning, which is the essence of man. It grows \n\tweaker and weaker, until he forgets what he used to know, and his mind \n\tbecomes like the mind of an infant. End quote. \n\n\tTafseer as-Sa‘di \n\t(p. 444) \n\n\tAz-Zajjaaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tWhat is meant is that among you are some who grow very old, \n\tuntil they lose their power of reasoning, and after having known things they \n\tbecome ignorant. Allah does that in order to show you His might and power; \n\tjust as He is able to cause a person to die or give him life, He is also \n\table to cause him to move from knowledge to ignorance. End quote. \n\n\tZaad al-Maseer \n\t(2/571) \n\n\tWhat is meant is that Allah, may He be exalted, causes people \n\tto move from ignorance to knowledge, then from knowledge to ignorance, and \n\tfrom weakness to strength, then from strength to weakness. \n\n\tPeople vary in the extent of this ignorance to which they \n\tmove. Some of them will become completely senile, so that they do not know \n\tanything at all; some of them will hardly know anything; and some of them \n\twill know a few things but ignorance and lack of knowledge is mostly the \n\tcase for them. \n\n\tWhat is meant by the words of Allah, may He be exalted, “so \n\tthat he knows nothing after having known” \n\tis to highlight the fact that ignorance will prevail after he had knowledge, \n\tnot to rule out knowledge altogether for everyone who reaches this stage, \n\tbecause saying that he will know nothing is not to be taken literally; \n\trather it is by way of emphasis.   \n\n\tHence Allah says, “and \n\tamong you”, so as to \n\tindicate that not everyone who grows old and reaches old age will be \n\tsent back to senility; \n\trather some of them will be \n\tsent back to senility so \n\tthat they do not know anything after having known something, and some of \n\tthem will grow old but Allah will protect their reasoning, hearing and \n\tsight. \n\n\tIbn Jaziyy (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tIt does not mean that knowledge is ruled out altogether; \n\trather it is a reference to having little knowledge and to forgetting a \n\tgreat deal. End quote \n\n\tTafseer Ibn Jaziyy \n\t(1/431) \n\n\tAz-Raazi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tIf it is asked: How come Allah says: “so \n\tthat he knows nothing after having known” \n\t[al-Hajj 22:5], when he may well know some things, like a child? Our \n\tresponse is: What is meant is that his power of reasoning will be taken \n\taway, so he will become as if he does not know anything, because such a \n\tthing may be described in the negative for the sake of emphasis. End quote. \n\n\tTafseer ar-Raazi \n\t(23/205) \n\n\tIbn ‘Ashoor (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n\tHence there are levels of weakness of reason, depending on \n\tthe degree of senility. It may go so far as being unable to learn anything \n\tnew, but before that there are different levels of weakness of reason, such \n\tas forgetting things, mixing up information, and so on. End quote. \n\n\tAt-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer \n\t(17/202) \n\n\tConclusion: \n\n\tThese two verses do not mean that everyone who grows old will \n\tbe in this state of “senility”; \n\trather among those who grow old there will be some who are \n\tsent back to senility \n\tand will be in that state where they forget everything that they knew \n\tbefore. \n\n\tMoreover, this forgetfulness and being \n\tsent back to senility are of varying \n\tdegrees, and people vary in \n\tthat regard.

        "predicted_answer": "Certainly! The verse you are referring to is from Surah Al-Hajj (22:5). The verse states:\n\n**“O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then indeed, We created you from dust; then from a sperm-drop; then from a clinging clot; then from a lump of flesh, formed and unformed. And We develop in the wombs what We will for an appointed term. Then We bring you out as infants; then (We develop you) that you may reach your maturity. And among you is he who is taken in death, and among you is he who is sent back to the most abject old age so that he knows nothing after having known (much). And you see the earth barren, but when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells and brings forth (of) every beautiful kind (of) plants.”** (Quran 22:5)\n\n### Commentary:\n\n1. **Nature of Creation**: The verse begins by reminding humanity of the divine creation process. Allah created humans from dust, which emphasizes human humility and the fact that our origin is from something so basic. The stages of human development in the womb emphasize Allah’s power and knowledge in crafting each individual perfectly.\n\n2. **Cycle of Life**: It highlights the cycle of life from creation to death and the variation in human experience. Some are granted health and vigor, while others may face the decline associated with old age. This reminds believers of the fragility and temporality of life.\n\n3. **Return to Weakness**: The reference to being \"sent back to senility\" indicates that despite the knowledge and capabilities a person may have had in their youth, they may reach a point where they become dependent and lose their faculties. This serves as a warning against arrogance and self-sufficiency, reminding us all that ultimately, all power and knowledge come from Allah.\n\n4. **Reflection on Divinity**: The contrasting states of life (knowledge and ignorance, strength and weakness) point towards the signs of Allah's greatness and majesty. It encourages believers to reflect on their own lives and to be humble before their Creator.\n\n5. **Illustration of Resurrection**: The verse also alludes to the Resurrection. If Allah can create us, cause us to grow, and then lead us to old age and death, surely He has the power to resurrect us after we die. The natural process of bringing life back to barren earth with rain serves as a metaphor for resurrection, indicating both renewal and the power of Allah in bringing forth life.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThis verse encompasses profound lessons about creation, the human condition, the transience of life, and the signs of Allah's greatness within nature. It is a call to humility, reflection on the reality of life, and faith in the promises of the Hereafter. Believers are encouraged to remain steadfast, acknowledge the temporary nature of worldly life, and prepare for the eternal life that follows."

        "question": "Does a reprehensible pause [when reading Qur’an] lead to kufr?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.These words, in the general terms mentioned in the question, are clearly incorrect and are definitely contrary to the practice of the Muslims and all the imams or leading scholars, which is to quote part of a verse in their writings, lessons or khutbahs, without necessarily having to quote or write the entire verse as it appears in the Mus-haf. Rather they limit it to quoting of the verse only the part that is relevant to the context and relevant to the meaning they are trying to establish, so long as what is quoted of the verse is clear and readily understood.\nIf what you say is something that was said by one of the religious scholars, then he could not have meant it in general terms referring to all kinds of pause, as the questioner understood it. The only way we think he could have meant it is that what he was referring to was a type of pause that is reprehensible, as in the case  of a reciter who comes to a verse such as that in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “So know (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) that La ilaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah), and ask forgiveness for your sin, and also for (the sin of) believing men and believing women. And Allah knows well your moving about, and your place of rest (in your homes)” [Muhammad 47:19], and he recites “there is no god” then pauses there, without any good reason that would compel him to pause there, and without resuming the recitation by repeating some of the words in such a way as to make the meaning clear and make the context of the words understandable. \nPausing in such a manner is blameworthy and extremely reprehensible, as is quite obvious. Whoever does that deliberately, intending to convey that distorted meaning, is undoubtedly a disbeliever. \nThere are also other kinds of blameworthy pauses that corrupt the meanings of the words or give the impression of a meaning that is not intended by the text. \nAz-Zarkashi said in al-Burhaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (1/352-353): What is reprehensible is that which leads to the meaning not being understood, such as saying “al-hamd” [on its own]; there should be no pause on this word, or on any word without its adjective or predicate.\nEven worse than that is pausing on phrases such as “Surely, they have disbelieved who say” [al-Maa’idah 5:72] (because the following phrase is “ ‘Allah is the Messiah (‘Eeesa (Jesus)), son of Maryam (Mary)’”) and “And if any of them should say” [al-Anbiya’ 21:29] (because the following phrase is “ ‘Verily, I am an ilah (a god) besides Him (Allah)’”); or starting from phrases such as “Allah is the Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary)” [al-Maa’idah 5:17], “Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)” [al-Maa’idah 5:73] and “Verily, I am an ilah (a god)” [al-Anbiya’ 21:29], because it is impossible for the meaning to be correct if you begin in this manner. Whoever does that deliberately, intending that (distorted) meaning, is a disbeliever. \nSimilarly reprehensible is stopping at the following phrases: “So the disbeliever was utterly defeated and Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:258], “For those who believe not in the Hereafter is an evil description and for Allah” [an-Nahl 16:60] and the like, or “and if there be only one, for her is the half and for his parents” [an-Nisa’ 4:11] and “Only those will respond, who listen and the dead” [al-An‘aam 6:36]. \nEven worse and more reprehensible than that is stopping on a negation without completing the idea, as in the following examples:\n“There is no god but Allah”\n(pausing after the phrase “there is no god”, without completing the sentence, is wrong)\n“And We have sent you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) not but as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner”\n[al-Isra’ 17:105]\n(pausing after the phrase “we have sent you not” is wrong). \nAlso, pausing at the end of the following quotations is wrong:\n“Allah has promised those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) and do deeds of righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise) and those who disbelieve…”\n[al-Maa’idah 5:9-10]]\n“Those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah, and in the Message of Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah (Islamic Monotheism), He will render their deeds vain, and those who believe…”\n[Muhammad 47:1-2].\nIf the reader has no choice but to stop in order to take a breath, that is permissible, but then (when he resumes reading) he should go back to the phrase that came before it and connect it to what comes after it, and there is nothing wrong with doing so.

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic scholarship, a \"reprehensible pause\" (waqf al-makruh) when reading the Qur'an does not lead to kufr (disbelief). A reprehensible pause refers to stopping at a place in the Qur'an where it is better to continue reading, as it may disrupt the meaning or context of the verses.\n\nStopping at such places is generally discouraged, but it does not affect a person's faith or make them a disbeliever. Faith in Islam is based on belief in Allah and the fundamental tenets of Islam, and while proper recitation and understanding of the Qur'an is important, a mistake in recitation or pauses does not equate to disbelief.\n\nIt is always encouraged to strive for the proper etiquette of reading the Qur'an, but mistakes or less-than-ideal practices in recitation do not take one out of the fold of Islam. If there are specific concerns or teachings about recitation that you wish to explore, it may be beneficial to consult a knowledgeable scholar for further guidance."

        "question": "What should a person do if he memorised some of the Qur’an then forgot it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nUndoubtedly studying the Quran, reciting it and memorising it are among the best of righteous deeds. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to read Quran regularly lest we forget it, which means constantly reviewing what one has memorised and repeatedly reciting it. \nSimilarly, forgetting Quran is a blameworthy action, because it involves falling short, turning away from the Book of Allah and abandoning it. \nSee the answer to question no. 3704. \nSecondly: \nThe scholars differed concerning the ruling on forgetting Quran: \nIt was said that forgetting Quran is a major sin. \nIt was said that it is an act of disobedience and sin, but it does not reach the level of major sins. \nIt was said that it is a calamity that befalls a person and affects his religious commitment, or it may be a punishment from Allah for some of his deeds, even if it is not in and of itself a major sin or minor sin. This is the view that is most likely to be correct concerning this issue.\nHowever it is not appropriate for the one who has memorised it to neglect his recitation or to be careless about reviewing it. Rather he should adopt the practice of reciting a daily portion in order to help him to remember it and prevent himself from forgetting it, in the hope of reward and of benefitting from its rulings. \nThirdly: \nForgetting some of the Quran is a result of neglecting it, and some kinds of neglect are less serious than others, as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Fawaa’id (p. 82). But forgetting it because of turning away from it and being distracted by other things is undoubtedly a calamity that may lead to further calamities, in addition to the loss of reward. \nWhat is advised for one who memorised some of the Quran then forgot it is the following: \n·He should revise the soorahs that he had memorised until he has memorised them properly once again.\n·He should keep up with review in a regular fashion, so that he will not forget it again.\n·He should carry on memorising and reviewing under a well-versed shaykh.\n·He should review what he had memorised of large portions such as a juz’ or a hizb and the like, and strive hard to memorise an entire soorah, so that reviewing what he had previously memorised and has memorised again will help him to complete memorisation of the soorah.\n·As for reviewing small portions that he had memorised then forgotten, such as two or three verses and the like, he should not focus on that and should not go to the trouble of remembering what he had forgotten of them. \nHe should focus on re-memorising what he had forgotten of soorahs and large portions, as mentioned above, and there is no sin on him for not re-memorising those small portions, some of which he may have forgotten. He should examine his own situation, and whatever is a sin he should ask Allah to forgive him and repent from it; whatever is a shortcoming, he should amend it; and whatever was a case of turning away from matters of the hereafter and focusing on worldly matters, then he should refocus on the hereafter, for it is better and longer lasting. \nMoreover, it is better to put his efforts into reviewing what he has memorised of the Quran immediately, when he is still motivated and before he loses motivation and starts to procrastinate. Ibn al-Mubaarak narrated in az-Zuhd (1/469) that Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: These hearts sometimes have drive and focus and sometimes they slow down and become distracted, so make the most of the times when they have drive and focus, and let them be when they slow down and are distracted. \nUndoubtedly the fact that one who has forgotten Quran feels that he has fallen short and is asking how to restore it comes under the heading of having drive and focus after having slowed down and been distracted. One who is in this situation should start re-memorizing it immediately, and should not delay doing so. \nIf he is not able to revise it except during his free time, because he is very busy, has a lot of work and is striving to earn a living for his dependents, and the like, then there is no blame on him. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, if a person has memorized some parts of the Qur'an and later forgets it, they should not be overly distressed, as forgetting can happen to anyone. Here are some steps the person can take:\n\n1. **Renewing Intention**: They should renew their intention (niyyah) to memorize the Qur'an again, with sincerity for the sake of Allah.\n\n2. **Consistent Review**: Regularly review what has already been memorized to reinforce memory. Setting aside specific times daily for recitation and revision can help retain the memorized portions.\n\n3. **Seek Help**: They can join a study group or find a teacher to help them in memorization and revision. Being in a supportive environment can encourage consistency.\n\n4. **Dua (Supplication)**: Making dua to Allah for assistance in memorizing and retaining the Qur'an is essential. One can ask Allah to make it easy and to keep the heart firm on His Book.\n\n5. **Gradual Memorization**: Start again with smaller portions and gradually work up to the previously memorized sections. Repetition and consistency are key.\n\n6. **Maintain Connection**: Continuously engage with the Qur'an through listening, reciting, and reflecting on its meanings. This deepens one’s connection and facilitates memorization.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the effort made in attempting to memorize the Qur'an is highly regarded in Islam, and any hardship faced is also noted by Allah. Persistence, along with these steps, can lead to success in re-memorizing and retaining the Qur'an."

        "question": "The seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir and it is not permissible to cast aspersions on them",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe majority of scholars of recitation and usool are of the view that the seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir going back to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Some of them differed concerning that, such as Abu Shaamah – according to one of his views – and at-Tawfi and ash-Shawkaani. However the correct view concerning that is the view of the majority; that is the right view which must be adopted.\nShihaab ad-Deen ad-Dimyaati (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nTaaj al-A’immah as-Subki – who is Taaj ad-Deen ‘Abd al-Wahhaab as-Subki – said in his fatwas:\nThe seven modes of recitation to which ash-Shaatibi referred, to the exclusion of others, and the three others – namely the recitation of Abu Ja‘far, the recitation of Ya‘qoob and the recitation of Khalaf – are mutawaatir and well-known, and it is an established fact in the religion that they were revealed to the Messenger of Allah. No one would stubbornly disagree with that except one who is ignorant. They are not only regarded as mutawaatir by those who know these ten modes of recitation; rather they are regarded as mutawaatir by every Muslim who says “I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah,” even if he is rough and uneducated and has not memorised even one letter of the Qur’an.\nHe said: We could elaborate on the proof and evidence, but we do not have room to discuss this matter at length here. However, what is expected of every Muslim, and what he should do is to accept before Allah, may He be exalted, and be certain that what we have mentioned is mutawaatir and is known for certain, and there is no room for doubt or uncertainty about it.\nConclusion:\nThe seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir according to consensus, as are the three others: the recitations of Abu Ja‘far, Ya‘qoob and Khalaf, according to the more correct view. In fact the correct, favoured view, which is what we learned from most of our shaykhs, is that the recitations of the other four – Ibn Muhaysin, al-Yazeedi, al-Hasan and al-A‘mash, are odd (shaadhdh), according to scholarly consensus.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOur companions and others said:\nIt is permissible to recite, in prayer and otherwise, according to any of the seven modes of recitation, but it is not permissible to recite, in prayer or otherwise, according to an odd mode of recitation, because that is not Qur’an. Qur’an can only be proven by means of mutawaatir reports, and each of the seven modes of recitation is mutawaatir. This is the correct view which one must accept, and whoever says otherwise is wrong or ignorant.\nEnd quote from al-Majmoo‘ (3/392)\nIbn an-Najjaar al-Fatoohi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe seven modes of recitation are mutawaatir according to the four imams and other leading Sunni scholars. This was narrated by as-Sarakhsi, who was one of the companions of ash-Shaafa‘i, in Kitaab as-Sawm in al-Ghaayah. He said: The Mu‘tazilah said: (The modes of recitation are transmitted via) aahaad reports.\n[An aahaad hadith is one of which the narrators at each stage of the isnaad are too few for it to be regarded as mutawaatir.]\nEnd quote from Sharh al-Kawkab al-Muneer (2/127)\nAz-Zarqaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that is supported by evidence is that the ten modes of recitation are all mutawaatir. This is the view of the scholars of usool and of recitation, such as Ibn as-Subki, Ibn al-Jazari and an-Nuwayri.\nEnd quote from Manaahil al-‘Irfaan (1/441)\nSecondly:\nThere is a specious argument that may enter some people’s minds, which says that the isnaads of the recitations mentioned by the imams in their books are well known and limited, but they are ahaad isnaads, so how can it be said that their recitations are mutawaatir?\nThe response to that is: this is an old specious argument, which was answered by more than one of the scholars of recitation and usool. The leading scholars who specialised in this field, on whose teachings these modes of recitation are based, and to whom the isnaads go back, are not the only ones who were proficient in these modes of recitation or the only ones who specialised in them. Rather these modes of recitation were mutawaatir during their time, and remained so after their time, as there were other scholars like them who also specialised in that field and had other students who learned from them this branch of knowledge, which has to do with the modes of recitation and the rules and regulations governing them.\nImam Sharaf ad-Deen ad-Dimyaati (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that the isnaads that have to do with the modes of recitation are limited to one group does not mean that the modes of recitation did not have other isnaads. Rather the reports that have to do with the modes of recitation are attributed to them because they are the ones who became specialised in that matter and recorded the names of their shaykhs from whom they learned it, and each of them [the narrators in the isnaads] in his generation had many others who specialised in that field, which would raise the reports to the level of being mutawaatir.\nThis is the view of the scholars, and the dissenting view of Ibn al-Haajib, who differed with regard to some of what we have mentioned, was refuted by one who was very well versed in this field, namely Ibn al-Jazari, who refuted it at length in his book al-Munjid, which is worth reading.\nEnd quote from Ithaaf Fudala’ al-Bashar fi’l-Qiraa’aat al-Arba‘at ‘Ashar (p. 9)\nIbn an-Najjaar al-Fatoohi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSome said that the reports concerning the modes of recitation were aahaad reports, such as at-Tawfi in his Sharh. He said: The fact is that they (the modes of recitation) are widely known as being attributed to them, but they were not widely narrated from them, because the isnaads of the seven imams of recitation for the seven modes of recitation going back to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) are to be found in the books of recitation, which were transmitted from one scholar to another at a time, so they do not fulfil the conditions of being mutawaatir.\nThe response to that is as follows: the fact that the isnaads are limited to a particular group does not mean that the modes of recitation were not transmitted via other narrators. The inhabitants of every city used to learn recitation according to the recitation of their Imam, who was one of the Sahaabah or otherwise, so a large number of people would learn from another large number like them, and so on. Therefore the transmission of the recitations was mutawaatir, but the imams who became specialised in the modes of recitation recorded the names of their shaykhs from whom they learned their mode of recitation, and that is why they made their isnaads available (whilst others did not). This is like the reports about the Farewell Pilgrimage which are known to be aahaad, but the reports of the Farewell Pilgrimage continued to be transmitted in the manner of mutawaatir reports, from one large number of people to another, throughout the ages. So one should pay attention to that, and not be deceived by the arguments of those who say that the isnaads of the scholars of recitation are aahaad.\nEnd quote from Sharh al-Kawkab al-Muneer (2/127-128)\nThirdly:\nWith regard to the questioner’s asking: how can we say that (the modes of recitation) are mutawaatir when the term mutawaatir did not appear before Ibn Mujaahid who was the seventh of seven?\nThe response to that is as follows:\nWhat is meant by something being mutawaatir is learning something on the basis of certainty when there is no doubt at all, as opposed to learning something on the basis of probability. The level of certainty concerning the soundness of the seven modes of recitation is established, and it was transmitted by way of mutawaatir reports, which effectively gives certainty. And that is the point, regardless of whether this terminology was known at that time or not. This is simply the matter of terminology that has to do with setting out guidelines in various fields of knowledge and developing them. The Arabs (before Islam) used to observe the rules of grammar in their language, giving words case endings according to whether words were nominative, accusative or genitive, and so on, but if the people of the Jaahiliyyah were to come back to life now, none of them would know the terminology of Arabic grammar; in fact none of them knew anything about grammar as people speak of it now.\nSimilarly, with regard to knowledge of hadith, usool al-fiqh and other branches of Islamic knowledge, the fact that the specific terminology of any particular field appeared later on does not mean that the ideas and concepts that the terminology refers to were not known previously to specialists in that field.\nAs for the notion that the concept was unknown among people who were not specialists, or that it was not widely used by others in general, that does not undermine the fact that the concept was there, and it does not undermine the soundness of a particular academic issue.\nImam Shams ad-Deen adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe fact that something is mutawaatir does not necessarily mean that the entire ummah is aware of it. For the scholars of recitation, there are matters that are mutawaatir among them, but not among others. For the fuqaha’ there are issues that are mutawaatir among them and narrated from their imams via mutawaatir reports, of which the scholars of recitation are unaware. Among the hadith scholars, there are mutawaatir hadiths that the fuqaha’ have never heard, or at least for the fuqaha’ they were not mutawaatir; rather they were at the level of probability only. For the grammarians there are definitive issues, and the same is true of the linguists. End quote.\nSiyar A‘laam an-Nubala’ (10/171)\nSee also the answer to question no. 5142\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, the seven modes of recitation of the Qur'an, known as the \"Qira'at,\" are indeed considered authentic and accepted.

        "question": "Tafseer on the basis of narrated texts and tafseer on the basis of individual understanding",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      \n      When explaining the meanings of a verse of the Qur’an, the mufassir \n      (scholarly commentator on the meanings) follows one of two methods:\n\n    The \n    first method \n    is to see whether there is anything in the texts of the Qur’an or the \n    Prophet’s Sunnah, or in texts narrated from the righteous early generations, \n    that explains this verse. If there is an explanation of it in these sources, \n    he follows it and is content with it. This is what is called “tafseer on the \n    basis of narrated texts”; it is of several types: \n\n    1.\n    \n    Tafseer of the Qur’an by the Qur’an: as some parts of the \n    Qur’an explain other parts.\n\n    \n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in \n    Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer (p. 93): \n\n    If \n    someone were to ask: what are the soundest ways of interpreting the meanings \n    of the Qur’an? The answer is that the soundest way of doing that is to \n    interpret the Qur’an by the Qur’an, because sometimes it may refer to a \n    matter in brief, then explain it in more detail elsewhere, or it may state \n    something in a few words in one place, then expand upon it elsewhere. End \n    quote. \n\n    Some \n    examples of that: \n\n    Al-Bukhaari \n    (4236) narrated from ‘Alqamah (may Allah have mercy on him) that ‘Abdullah \n    ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the verse “…and \n    confuse not their belief with Zulm (wrong)…” [al-An‘aam 6:82] was \n    revealed, his companions (i.e., the companions of the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) said: Which of us has not done wrong? Then the \n    verse “Verily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm \n    (wrong) indeed” [Luqmaan 31:13] was revealed. [From the latter verse it \n    is understood that the zulm referred to in the first verse is the zulm of \n    shirk (joining others in worship with Allah), and not any lesser \n    wrongdoing.] \n\n    But \n    although interpreting the Qur’an by the Qur’an may sometimes be unambiguous \n    and clear, as in the example mentioned above, in which case it is binding \n    proof that must be followed and not opposed, sometimes it is based on the \n    mufassir’s own ijtihaad and understanding, when he is trying to put together \n    similar verses. Undoubtedly this is of a lesser status than the above, \n    because the one who engages in ijithaad may be wrong or right. \n\n    2.\n    \n    The tafseer of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him), explaining the meanings of the Qur’an, because he (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him) came to both convey and explain to us what is \n    said in the holy Qur’an. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): “With clear signs and Books (We sent \n    the Messengers). And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad blessings \n    and peace of Allah be upon him) the reminder and the advice (the Quran), \n    that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they \n    may give thought” [an-Nahl \n    \n    16:44]. \n\n    An \n    example of that: \n\n    Al-Bukhaari \n    (4510) narrated concerning the interpretation of the verse in which Allah, \n    may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “and eat and \n    drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from \n    the black thread (darkness of night)” [al-Baqarah 2:187]. \n\n    It \n    was narrated that ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I \n    said: O Messenger of Allah, what is the meaning of the white thread being \n    distinct from the black thread? Are they two threads? He said: “The back of \n    your heard must be very broad if you want to watch the two threads.” [‘Adiyy \n    was thinking in terms of threads in a literal sense, which he wanted to put \n    under his pillow and examine to see when they became distinct from one \n    another with the approach of dawn, but the Prophet (blessings and peace of \n    Allah be upon him) pointed out that if he wanted to put the two threads – \n    which in fact refers to the light of dawn being distinct from the darkness \n    of night – under his pillow, then his pillow must be very big indeed, in \n    which case he must have a very large head! – Translator’s note]. Then he \n    said: “No; rather it is the darkness of the night and the light of the \n    day.” \n\n    If an \n    explanation of a verse or a word in the Qur’an has reached us from the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), it is obligatory for us \n    to adhere to it and be content with it. \n\n    The \n    interpretation of a verse may be understood from the Sunnah of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), from his actions and words, and \n    from the things that he approved of. \n\n    The \n    Sunnah came to explain the Qur’an. Allah, may He be exalted, has instructed \n    us to pray, give zakaah, perform Hajj, carry out the hadd punishments and so \n    on, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), through his \n    Sunnah – his actions and words – has explained to us in detail what is meant \n    by these words. But if the mufassir cannot find any explanation for a verse \n    in the Sunnah, he should look at the sayings of the Sahaabah. \n\n    3.\n    \n    Tafseer based on reports from the Sahaabah (may Allah be \n    pleased with them):\n\n    Their \n    tafseer takes precedence over that of anyone else, because their tafseer is \n    likely to be based on what they learned from the Prophet (blessings and \n    peace of Allah be upon him), as Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) \n    said: One of us would learn ten verses then he would not move on (and learn \n    more) until he understood their meaning and put them into practice. Narrated \n    by at-Tabari in his Tafseer (1/80); its isnaad was classed as saheeh \n    by Shaykh Ahmad Shaakir (may Allah have mercy on him). \n\n    In \n    some cases the tafseer of the Sahaabah was based on their own ijtihaad and \n    understanding, and their ijtihaad takes precedence over that of those who \n    came after them, because they accompanied the Prophet (blessings and peace \n    of Allah be upon him) and were aware of the circumstances in which the \n    verses of the Qur’an were revealed, such as the reasons for revelation and \n    the place where revelation came down. They were contemporaries who were well \n    aware of the reality of the circumstances in which the Qur’an was revealed \n    and how people were at that time. Moreover, they had a greater understanding \n    than others of the language in which the Qur’an was revealed; they had \n    deeper knowledge, were less complicated (i.e., they were straightforward \n    people), and the furthest removed from misguidance and error in terms of \n    their knowledge and deeds. \n\n    \n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer \n    (p. 95): Then if you do not find the explanation of the meaning in either \n    the Qur’an or the Sunnah, you should refer to the words of the Sahaabah, \n    because they had greater knowledge of that, because of what they witnessed \n    of the Qur’an, and because of the advantages they had, and what they had of \n    perfect understanding and sound knowledge, especially the scholars and \n    leading figures among them… End quote. \n\n    The \n    views of the Sahaabah concerning tafseer take precedence over the views of \n    anyone else, unless the Sahaabah differed concerning it, in which case the \n    mufassir must try to work out which view is most correct. \n\n    4.\n    \n    Tafseer based on reports from the Taabi‘een\n\n    If \n    the mufassir does not find anything in the words of the Sahaabah to explain \n    the meaning of the verse, then he should look at the tafseer of the \n    Taabi‘een, who acquired their knowledge from the companions of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them), because in their circumstances, \n    words, deeds and time they were – naturally – closer to the Sahaabah and to \n    their teachings and were able to learn from them directly. \n\n    \n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in \n    Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer (p. 102): if you do not find the \n    explanation of the meaning in either the Qur’an or the Sunnah, and you do \n    not find it in what is reported from the Sahaabah, in that case many of the \n    imams (leading scholars) turned to the views of the Taabi‘een… End quote. \n\n    He \n    (may Allah have mercy on him) also said (p. 37): \n\n    Among \n    the Taabi‘een are some who learned all their tafseer from the Sahaabah, as \n    Mujaahid said: I showed the Mushaf to Ibn ‘Abbaas, pausing at each verse and \n    asking him about it. Hence ath-Thawri said: If the interpretation of the \n    meaning of a verse comes to you from Mujaahid, it is sufficient for you. \n    Hence ash-Shaafa‘i, al-Bukhaari and other scholars relied on his (Mujaahid’s) \n    tafseer. End quote. \n\n    If \n    the scholars of tafseer among the Taabi‘een are agreed upon a view \n    concerning the meaning of a verse, then undoubtedly it is obligatory to \n    follow it. But if they differed, the view of one of them is not necessarily \n    stronger than that of another and cannot be given precedence over another or \n    be regarded as the ultimate proof. Rather it must be examined and his proof \n    may be quoted or referred to, (but it is not binding proof). \n\n    \n    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\n    \n    Undoubtedly the Taabi‘een differed, but those who learned tafseer from the \n    Sahaabah are not equal to those who did not do so. \n\n    \n    However, if they did not state that they learned it from a Sahaabi, then \n    their view is not proof against those who came after them, if they differed \n    in their views, because they are not of the same status as the Sahaabah, but \n    their views are more likely to be closer to the truth. The closer people are \n    to the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), the \n    more likely they are to be correct than those who come after them. This is \n    very clear, because of the prevalence of whims and desires in subsequent \n    periods, and because of the presence of numerous intermediaries between them \n    and the time of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). \n    Undoubtedly this distance detracts from the value of their opinions; hence \n    we know that referring to the view of earlier generations is very important.\n\n    End \n    quote from Sharh Muqaddimat at-Tafseer, p. 140 \n\n    The \n    second method \n    is for the mufassir who has knowledge of tafseer to use his understanding to \n    interpret the meaning of the verse of the Qur’an, and his ijtihaad must be \n    based on the proper method, following the guidelines and principles of \n    tafseer. This is what is called tafseer on the basis of individual \n    understanding and ijtihaad. \n\n    \n    Az-Zarqaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Manaahil al-‘Irfaan \n    fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (2/43): \n\n    With \n    regard to the permissible type of tafseer on the basis of one's \n    understanding, it is essential to be aware of what has been narrated from \n    the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions \n    that may give the mufassir some insight into how he should interpret the \n    meaning on the basis of his understanding. The one who does that must also \n    have extensive knowledge of the rules of the Arabic language and its styles \n    and manner of expression, as well as deep insight into the rules of \n    sharee‘ah, so that he will be able to interpret the words of Allah on the \n    basis of what is well established of the rules and regulations of His \n    sharee‘ah. End quote. \n\n    \n    Tafseer that is based on one’s individual understanding is blameworthy in \n    the following scenarios: \n\n    1.\n    \n    When the one who is seeking to interpret the meaning is not \n    qualified to do so, and he is trying to explain the words of Allah without \n    knowledge. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n    “Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ‘(But) the \n    things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (great evil sins, \n    every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.) whether committed openly or \n    secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in \n    worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things \n    about Allah of which you have no knowledge’” [al-A‘raaf 7:33]; “O mankind! \n    Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the \n    footsteps of Shaitan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy” [al-Baqarah \n    2:168-169].\n\n    2.\n    \n    When he is following his own whims and desires and his aim is \n    to support his bid‘ah (innovation) and opinion, even if that is by twisting \n    the meanings of the words or not paying attention to the proper way of \n    understanding, the ways in which the Arabs express different ideas in their \n    language, and the guidelines of sharee‘ah, as some innovators among the \n    Raafidis and others did, when they interpreted some verses in a manner that \n    is contrary to what is indicated by the guidelines of sharee‘ah and \n    knowledge of the Arabic language.\n\n    \n    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    \n    Interpretation of the Qur’an based on individual opinion: sometimes, in \n    order to be in harmony with his preconceived ideas, as the followers of \n    whims and desires do, a person may say that what is meant by a given word or \n    phrase is such and such – saying something that is in harmony with his \n    preconceived ideas. That includes some later scholars who interpreted the \n    Qur’an in such a manner as to be in harmony with the latest scientific \n    discoveries – whether astronomical or terrestrial – when the Qur’an does not \n    indicate that. In that case they are interpreting the Qur’an on the basis of \n    their own preconceived views, because the Qur’an does not indicate that, \n    either on the basis of the text or of what is indicated by the language. \n    This is their own opinion, and it is not right to interpret the Qur’an on \n    that basis. \n\n    \n    Similarly, if a person does not understand the linguistic meaning or the \n    shar‘i meaning indicated by the verse, if he then says something without \n    knowledge, he is sinning, such as if one of the common folk were to \n    interpret the verse of the holy Qur’an according to his understanding, \n    without basing it on proper understanding of the linguistic or shar‘i \n    guidelines, in which case it is haraam for him to do that, because the one \n    who interprets the meanings of the Qur’an is testifying that Allah meant \n    such and such. This is a very serious matter, because Allah has forbidden us \n    to say about Him that which we do not know.\n\n    “Say \n    (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ‘(But) the things \n    that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (great evil sins, every \n    kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.) whether committed openly or \n    secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in \n    worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things \n    about Allah of which you have no knowledge’” [al-A‘raaf 7:33]. \n\n    Any \n    person who says about Allah that which he does not know about the meaning of \n    His words or any of His rulings has made a serious error. \n\n    End \n    quote from Muqaddimat at-Tafseer, p. 142 \n\n    And \n    Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic scholarship, the term \"Tafseer\" refers to the interpretation of the Quran. There are primarily two approaches to Tafseer: \n\n1. **Tafseer bil Ma'thoor (Tafseer on the basis of narrated texts)**: This approach relies on the interpretations and explanations provided by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), his companions, and subsequent scholars who base their interpretations on these early sources. Such Tafseer emphasizes the importance of authentic Hadith, the words and actions of the Prophet, and the insights of those who were directly linked to him. This method seeks to understand the Quran through historical context, linguistic analysis, and the scholarly traditions of the early Muslim community. Scholars like Ibn Kathir and Al-Tabari are well-known for their works that utilize this approach by incorporating authentic narrations as part of their exegesis.\n\n2. **Tafseer bil Ra'y (Tafseer on the basis of individual understanding)**: This method refers to interpretations derived from an individual's reasoning and intellectual analysis. While there is a place for personal reasoning, it is crucial that this approach is grounded in the fundamental principles of Islam and does not contradict established Islamic teachings. Scholars who engage in this kind of Tafseer must possess deep knowledge of the Arabic language, the context of the verses, and the principles of Islamic jurisprudence and theology. While individual reasoning can enhance understanding, it must remain within the bounds of orthodoxy and not deviate into personal whim or speculation.\n\nBoth approaches can complement each other, and scholars often use a combination of narrated texts and reasoned interpretation to reach a comprehensive understanding of Quranic verses. It is, however, important for interpreters of the Quran to be knowledgeable and cautious with their interpretations, ensuring they do not misrepresent the divine message."

        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the concept of *tawqeef* refers to matters that are established by divine revelation and must be accepted as they are without personal interpretation or alteration. Regarding the names of the Surahs (chapters) in the Qur'an, scholars generally agree that they are indeed considered a matter of *tawqeef*.\n\nThis means that the names of the Surahs are believed to be derived from divine guidance and are not simply the result of human choice. Many of the Surahs have specific names that reflect themes, topics, or significant phrases found within them. In traditional scholarship, altering the names of the Surahs would not be appropriate, as they hold a specific place in the Qur'an and Muslim practice.\n\nFor example, the names of the Surahs are used in prayers and recitations, and changing them could lead to confusion or misrepresentation of the text. Therefore, while there may be some variation in the names used in different cultures and languages, the original Arabic names as they appear in the Qur'an are maintained and respected."

        "question": "Will the Qur’an testify, on the Day of Resurrection, against those who went against it as it will testify for its companions (those who read it and acted upon it) and intercede for them?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIt is proven in the saheeh Sunnah that the Quran will intercede for its companions on the Day of Resurrection. Muslim (804) narrated that Abu Umaamah al-Baahili said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Read the Qur’aan, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection interceding for its companions.” \nImam Ahmad (6589) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting and the Quran will intercede for a person on the Day of Resurrection. Fasting will say: O Lord, I kept him from his food and desires during the day; let me intercede for him. And the Quran will say: I kept him from sleeping during the night; let me intercede for him. And they will be allowed to intercede.”\nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 7329 \nSee also the answer to question no. 14035 \nSecondly: \nJust as the Quran will intercede for its companions on the Day of Resurrection, it will also testify against those who went against it by neglecting it, ignoring its obligations and transgressing against the limits it set. \nMuslim (223) narrated that Abu Maalik al-Ash‘ari said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Qur’aan is evidence for you or against you.” \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nEither it will be for you, if you sought to draw close to Allah means of it, and you fulfilled the obligations towards the Holy Quran, namely believing its stories, obeying its commands, heeding its prohibitions and venerating and respecting the Holy Quran, in which case it will be proof for you, \nOr it will be the opposite, if you disrespected the Quran and neglected its words and meanings and failed to act upon it, and you did not fulfil the obligations towards it. In that case it will be a witness against you on the Day of Resurrection. \nEnd quote from Sharh Riyadh as-Saaliheen, p. 30 \nIbn Hibbaan narrated in his Saheeh (124) from Jaabir that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Quran is an intercessor whose intercession will be accepted and an opponent whose testimony will be accepted. Whoever puts it in front of him, it will lead him to Paradise, and whoever puts it behind his back, it will drive him to Hell.” \nClassed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, 2019; ad-Daaraqutni mentioned it in al-‘Ilal, 5/102, where he said that it was mawqoof and its isnaad stopped at Ibn Mas‘ood. \nIbn Hibbaan said, commenting on this hadith: \nThis is a report from the wording of which one who does not have deep knowledge may think that the Quran is something created, but that is not the case. The Arabs may give the name of a thing to its cause and they may give the name of the cause to the thing. Because acting in accordance with the Quran will lead a person to Paradise, the name of that thing, which is acting in accordance with the Quran, is given to its cause, which is the Quran. It does not mean that the Quran is created. \nan-Nihaayah, 4/636 \nan-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nIt says in az-Zaahir: What is meant is that the one against whom the Quran testifies and says that he fell short and neglected it will be in Hell. And it is said: Do not make the Quran an opponent, i.e., to testify against you. \nEnd quote from Fayd al-Qadeer, 4/699 \nIt was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (30667), Ibn Qutaybah in Ta’weel Mukhtalif al-hadith (p. 258), Ibn ad-Durays in Fadaa’il al-Quran (89), via Muhammad ibn Ishaaq, from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, that his grandfather said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say:\n“The Quran will appear on the Day of Resurrection in the form of a man who will bring the man who learned it but went against its commands. It will appear as a disputant against him and will say: O Lord, You made him learn about me but what a bad learner he was; he transgressed my limits, neglected my obligations, disobeyed me and did not obey me. It will keep throwing accusations at him until it is said: Do what you like with him. Then it will take him by the hand and will not let him go until it throws him onto a rock in Hell. And it will bring a righteous man who learned it and adhered to its teachings. It will appear as a defendant and will say: O Lord, You made him learn about me and what a good learner he was; he respected my limits, did the obligatory duties, avoided the sins mentioned in me and obeyed my instructions. And it will keep presenting arguments in his favour until it is said: Do what you like with him. Then it will take him by the hand and will not let him go until it dresses him in brocade and puts on him the crown of a king.” \nThis is a da‘eef (weak) isnaad, because Ibn Ishaaq is mudallis and used the word ‘an (narrating from, i.e., he did not state clearly that he heard it directly). But al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Khalq Af‘aal al-‘Ibaad (474): \n‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The Quran will appear in the form of a man on the Day of Resurrection and will intercede for its companions.”\nZuhayr ibn Harb told me: Ya‘qoob ibn Ibraaheem told us: my father told me from Ibn Ishaaq, and ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr told me, from his father, from his grandfather: I heard this from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Abu ‘Abdullah (i.e., al-Bukhaari) said: “This is his earnings and his deeds.” End quote. \nSo it is proven that Ibn Ishaaq heard the hadith from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, thus the hadith is proven. \nThe words “The Quran will appear on the Day of Resurrection…” mean that his recitation of the Quran will appear to him. \nSee the answer to question no. 91306\nIt was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (30676) and ad-Daarimi (3325) from ash-Sha‘bi, from Ibn Mas‘ood who said: “The Quran will come on the Day of Resurrection and will intercede for its companion, and it will lead him to Paradise, or it will testify against (a person) and will drive him to Hell. Ash-Sha‘bi did not hear from Ibn Mas‘ood, as it says in al-Maraaseel by Ibn Abi Haatim (p. 25). \nBut there is a corroborating report that says: “The Quran is an intercessor whose intercession will be accepted and an opponent whose testimony will be accepted. Whoever puts it in front of him, it will lead him to Paradise, and whoever puts it behind his back, it will drive him to Hell.” \nThis was narrated via a number of isnaads from Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him).See: Fadaa’il al-Quran  by al-Firyaabi (20); Fadaa’il al-Quran by Abu ‘Ubayd (44); Fadaa’il al-Quran by Ibn Durays (94); az-Zuhd by Imam Ahmad (p. 155); Shu‘ab al-Eemaan by al-Bayhaqi (2010); al-Mu‘jam al-Kabeer by at-Tabaraani (8655). \nFrom the above it is clear that just as the Quran will testify for its companions on the Date of Resurrection, it will also testify against those who went against it. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, the Qur'an is considered to have a significant role on the Day of Resurrection (Yawm al-Qiyamah). It's mentioned in various Hadiths that the Qur'an will intercede for those who read and acted upon its teachings. This is supported by narrations that highlight the Qur'an as a source of guidance and mercy for its adherents.\n\nConversely, it is also understood that the Qur'an may bear witness against those who neglected it or went against its teachings. This dual role emphasizes the importance of adhering to the guidance provided in the Qur'an, both in terms of recitation and action.\n\nThe specifics of these intercessions and testimonies are ultimately known to Allah, but the key takeaway is that the Qur'an is a source of reward and intercession for those who uphold it, while also serving as a witness against those who disregard its message. \n\nIt is always advised to refer to authentic sources and consult knowledgeable scholars for deeper understanding on such matters."

        "question": "Whoever adds or takes away a letter from the Qur’an deliberately has committed an act of kufr (disbelief)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In the answer to question no. 158204 we stated that if a person makes a mistake in reciting a soorah, or forgets something of it, whilst he is praying, then he should try to correct the mistake and remember what he forgot. If he is not able to do that, then he may skip that verse and move on to the next one, or he may stop reciting that soorah and start reciting a different one. \nBut if he adds to the Qur’an something that is not part of it deliberately – whether that is during the prayer or otherwise, then this is emphatically forbidden and the scholars have stated that whoever omits a letter of the Qur’an or substitutes a different letter or adds a letter has committed an act of kufr. \nAl-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe Muslims are unanimously that the Qur’an which is recited in all corners of the earth, and is written in the Mushaf between the two covers by the hands of the Muslims, from the beginning of Soorat al-Faatihah to the end of Soorat an-Naas is indeed the word of Allah and His Revelation that He sent down to His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); that everything in it is truth; and that anyone who deliberately omits a letter of it, or substitutes one letter for another, or adds to it a letter that is not included in the Mushaf on which there is consensus, and there is consensus that it is not part of the Qur’an, has committed an act of kufr.\nEnd quote from ash-Shifa, 2/304-305; see also at-Taqreer wa’t-Tahbeer by Ibn Ameer al-Haaj, 2/215 \nIt says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 35/214: The Qur’an is the word of Allah, the miracle that was sent down to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and was transmitted by means of tawaatur (i.e., it was narrated from so many people by so many people that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a lie). It is haram to deliberately make mistakes in it, whether that changes the meaning or not, because its words and phrases are tawqeefi (i.e., to be accepted and recited as they were revealed, and they cannot be altered) and it was transmitted to us by means of tawaatur. It is not permissible to change any word of it by altering the vowels or changing the letters, replacing one letter with another. End quote. \nBased on that, it is not permissible for a student to write a word or a letter that he knows is not part of the Qur’an or that does not belong in this verse; rather he should either try hard to remember, or he should leave the parts that he has forgotten blank. He can also apologize for that by explaining that he forgot where this word goes and that he did not want to write something of which he was not certain in this case. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the Qur'an is considered the literal word of God, preserved in its original form. To intentionally alter, add to, or take away from the Qur'an is viewed as a serious offense. Scholars typically emphasize that doing so can be seen as an act of disbelief (kufr), as it shows a lack of respect for the sanctity and integrity of God's words.\n\nThis understanding is grounded in various hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) and the consensus of Islamic scholars over centuries. However, this categorization can depend on the intent and context of the action. \n\nIt is essential for Muslims to treat the Qur'an with the utmost respect and to recite it as it has been transmitted.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    You should bear in mind these \n    two important matters, which are from the bounty of Allah that He has \n    bestowed upon His slaves. \n\n    The first is that Allah, may He \n    be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have indeed \n    made the Quran easy to understand and remember, then is there any that will \n    remember (or receive admonition)?” [al-Qamar 54:17]. \n\n    The second is that the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who is skilled in \n    reciting Qur’an will be with the noble, honourable scribes and the one who \n    recites Qur’an and falters therein, and finds it difficult, will have a \n    double reward.”\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4937) \n    and Muslim (798). \n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy \n    on him) said: \n\n    The one who falters is the one \n    who stumbles in his recitation because of his poor memorisation. He will \n    have a double reward: the reward for reciting and the reward for faltering \n    in his recitation and the difficulty he encounters. End quote. \n\n    If we learn that the Qur’an is \n    easy to remember and understand, and we learn that the one for whom any of \n    that is difficult to learn, memorize or understand will have a double reward \n    – once this is established, it will be appropriate for the wise person to \n    strive his utmost to achieve that and to show patience in seeking to attain \n    this sublime goal. How often has Allah made it easy for non-Arabs who do not \n    speak Arabic well to memorize His Book in its entirety. To achieve this \n    great virtue it is worth spending a great deal of time and competing with \n    others. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    One of the things that help one \n    to memorize the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is listening to it often \n    on recordings. If it is easy for you to memorize it in this way, then you \n    will become one of those who have memorized the Book of Allah, attained that \n    goal and earned the reward and status of the hafiz, by Allah’s leave. The \n    individual’s precision in recitation, memorization and acting upon the Holy \n    Book and its rulings and teachings will determine his reward and his status \n    before Allah, if he is sincere in his intention and seeks reward with Him. \n\n    However it is better to combine \n    two things in that regard: striving to recite it and to memorize whatever \n    you are able to whilst looking at the Mushaf, so as to attain the virtue of \n    reading it yourself and the virtue of looking in the Mushaf. Then by \n    listening to a recording of the Qur’an you will be able to do two things: \n    correct your recitation and make sure that you have got it right before \n    memorizing it, and then continue revising it and reminding yourself of what \n    you have memorized after that. \n\n    Undoubtedly the one who listens \n    to the recitation by his shaykh or teacher directly will learn the Book of \n    Allah more precisely than the one who listens to it from a recording. The \n    Muslim cannot memorize properly unless he learns directly from a shaykh and \n    attends his classes whenever he can. \n\n    But for the one who does not \n    have access to a shaykh but does have access to a recording, there is \n    nothing wrong with him listening to it and memorizing in that manner. \n\n    For more information, please see \n    the answers to questions no. 112763 and\n    147816 \n\n    Thirdly: \n\n    Competing and hastening to \n    reward is something that is open to everyone. The one who cannot compete in \n    memorizing and reciting Qur’an can compete in prayer, fasting, giving \n    charity, remembering Allah, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is \n    evil, doing good deeds, upholding ties of kinship, honouring parents or \n    other innumerable types of righteous deeds. \n\n    All of the proven, prescribed \n    adhkaar bring a great reward, but there are some that bring a greater \n    reward. In the case of the Qur’an – which is the best dhikr – reciting \n    Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad (i.e., Soorat al-Ikhlaas 112) is equivalent to one \n    third of the Qur’an. Soorat al-Faatihah is the best soorah and Ayat al-Kursiy \n    (al-Baqarah 2:255) is the best verse. Whoever recites the last two verses of \n    Soorat al-Baqarah at night, they will suffice him. Memorizing these passages \n    and others is something that everyone can do, and in reciting them and \n    repeating them there is a great deal of reward. \n\n    Other adhkaar include the \n    following: \n\n    ·That which was narrated by Muslim (2729) from Juwayriyah, who \n    said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) \n    left her house one morning when he prayed Fajr, and she was in her \n    prayer-place, then he came back after the forenoon had come, and she was \n    still sitting there. He said: “Are you still as you were when I left you?” \n    She said: Yes. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n    “After I left you I said four words three times, which if they were weighed \n    against what you have said today, they would outweigh it: ‘Subhan \n    Allah wa bi hamdih, ‘adada khalqihi, wa rida nafsihi, wazinata ‘arshihi, wa \n    midaada kalimatihi (Glory \n    and praise be to Allah, as much as the number of His creation, as much as \n    pleases Him, as much as the weight of His Throne and as much as the ink of \n    His words).”\n\n    ·“Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem \n    (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty).” al-Bukhaari \n    (6682) and Muslim (2694) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of \n    Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Two words that are \n    light on the tongue and heavy in the balance and beloved to the Most \n    Merciful: Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem \n    (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty).”\n\n    ·The best of prayers for forgiveness (sayyid al-istighfaar): \n    al-Bukhaari (6306) narrated from Shaddaad ibn Aws (may Allah be pleased with \n    him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The \n    best of prayers for forgiveness is to say: “The best prayer for seeking \n    forgiveness is to say: ‘Allaahumma anta rabbi la ilaaha illa anta, \n    Khalaqtani wa ana ‘abduka wa ana ‘ala ‘ahdika wa wa’dika ma astata’t. \n    A’oodhu bika min sharri ma sana’tu, aboo’u laka bi ni’matika ‘alayya wa \n    aboo’u laka bi dhanbi, faghfir li fa innahu laa yaghfiru’l-dhunoob illaa \n    anta (O Allah, You are my Lord. None has the right to be worshipped but \n    You. You created me and I am Your slave, and I am faithful to my covenant \n    and my promise (to You) as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from all \n    the evil I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have \n    bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So I entreat You to \n    forgive my sins, for nobody can forgive sins except You).’ Whoever says this \n    during the day, having faith in it and dies before the evening comes, will \n    be among the people of \n    Paradise, and whoever says it during the night, having faith in it, and dies \n    before the morning comes, will be among the people of Paradise.” \n\n    Other kinds of dhikr, in \n    general, are the adkhaar to be recited in the morning or the evening, those \n    that are to be recited following the obligatory prayers and those that are \n    to be recited before going to sleep, for the one who regularly recites them \n    will have a great reward. \n\n    Please see also the answer to \n    question no 174947\n\n    Fourthly: \n\n    It is prescribed for the Muslims \n    to vary the adhkaar and all acts of worship. So sometimes he may read Qur’an, \n    sometimes he may remember Allah (dhikr), sometimes he may pray, sometimes he \n    may study books of knowledge, and sometimes he may relax by doing various \n    kinds of permissible leisure activities. He should not limit himself to one \n    specific type of worship, never doing anything else, because by doing that \n    he will miss out on the reward and virtue of the other types of worship that \n    he ignores, in addition to the fact that there is the fear that he may get \n    tired and bored.\n\n     Please see also the answer to \n    question no. 195274\n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the intention behind an action is crucial, and memorizing the Qur'an is a highly commendable act. A person who memorizes the Qur'an, whether from an audio recording or any other source, can indeed be rewarded for their effort, provided their intention is sincere and they strive to understand and implement the teachings of the Qur'an in their lives.\n\nUsing audio recordings can be a helpful method for memorization, especially for those who may not have access to traditional teachers or who may need additional resources. As a general principle, the means of memorization—whether through listening, reading, or reciting—are less important than the intent behind it and the effort applied.\n\nThat being said, it is advisable for a person to ensure that their memorization is done correctly, which may also involve consulting with knowledgeable individuals or using appropriate resources to verify the accuracy of what is being memorized.\n\nThus, as long as the endeavor is pursued with sincerity and effort, memorizing the Qur'an through audio recordings can indeed lead to spiritual rewards."

        "question": "Ruling on referring to Qur’anic verses whilst changing some of the words",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In Arabic linguistics, this action is called iqtibaas (lit. borrowing); this means referring to a verse or hadeeth when speaking, without attributing it to its source, whether one alters a word sometimes or quotes it as it is. The basic principle concerning this is that any such quotations or references should be within a proper context and implying an appropriate meaning. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nNo one has the right to use the wording of the Qur’an for any purpose other than that for which Allah revealed it. This is how the scholars interpreted the hadeeth, “The Book of Allah should not be quoted” i.e., the Qur’an should not be referred to inappropriately.\nAn example of that is if one says to someone who has come to discuss a need, “Then you came here according to the fixed term which I ordained (for you), O Moosa” (cf. Ta-Ha 20:40); or if a person says when arguing: “When will this promise be fulfilled?”(cf. Yaa-Seen 36:48),or “Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars” (cf. at-Tawbah 9:107). \nFurthermore, if the person says that by way of belittling the Qur’an or making fun of it, this is tantamount to kufr (disbelief). \nHowever, if he recites the verse to support a ruling for which this verse was revealed, or in the context of discussing some ruling, this is acceptable. That includes what the fuqaha’ concluded of rulings on the basis of analogy, and what shaykhs and preachers quote to support to what they say. \nEnd quote from Mukhtasar al-Fataawa al-Misriyyah, 172 \nAs-Suyooti wrote an essay on this topic entitled Raf‘ al-Baas wa Kashf al-Iltibaas fi Darab al-Mathal min al-Qur’an wa’l-Iqtibaas, in the book al-Haawi li’l-Fataawa (1/305): on our website we have discussed this manner of speaking in detail; please see the following fatwas (in Arabic): 119673, 103923, 127745 and 150303.\nFrom these fatwas we may conclude that it is haraam to refer to texts in the scenarios mentioned above; that is based on the following points: \n-1-\nit seems, from the phrases quoted above, that they were referred to for the purpose of mocking and making fun of others; in this case the Holy Qur’an was used as a tool for mockery in one of the most abhorrent ways of dealing with this holy Book which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sent down as a book of light and guidance, the words of which showed the way for mankind to follow, in the light of its teachings, and formed the foundation for much historical, linguistic, geographical and scientific research, as well as cultural and moral theories. If we bear all of that and more in mind, there will be no hesitation in regarding as abhorrent the words of one who says “But the Brothers bore it” instead of “But man bore it” (cf. al-Ahzaab 33:72), making fun of a group of Muslims. Is there anything more disrespectful towards the words and meanings of the Qur’an than this?\n -2-\nwe are very upset by much of what we have seen from some irresponsible media such as newspapers, magazines, satellite channels and so on, who take advantage of recent painful events in the Muslim world and use the Holy Qur’an in this manner, referring to its verses to address religious people and to mock some political Islamic groups and their predicament in some countries. It is as if the Holy Qur’an is not a Book for all Muslims, rather it is a book for some of them only. And it is as if the one who refers to it in this manner is trying to tell people, “We can come up with something like this Qur’an which you recite and venerate, in order to point out your faults!” For example, he may write “And those who were of the Brotherhood will be driven to Hell in groups” (cf. “And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups” [az-Zumar 39:51]); this poor man does not realise that the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is of a sublime status and is not to be touched by any but those who are purified; those who are not purified with regard to religious commitment and manners are only exposing the darkness that resides in their hearts and the foolishness of their minds. They lose in worldly terms, let alone in terms of the Hereafter, by using this kind of mocking language, telling lies about Allah, distorting the meaning of His Book and, in fact, blatantly distorting the wording thereof. \n-3-\nhere we will quote the views of some scholars who forbade this kind of referring to the text if it is done in the context of mockery and disrespect. \nAs-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nOne kind of reprehensible referral to texts is quoting a verse in the context of a joke – we seek refuge with Allah from that – such as saying (in verse):\n“She conveyed a message to her lovers with her eyes, ‘Far, very far is that which you are promised’ [cf. al-Mu’minoon 23:36];\nSeek physical intimacy with her – ‘For the like of this let all strive, who wish to strive’ [cf. as-Saaffaat 37:61].” \nEnd quote from al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an, 1/387; as-Suyooti quoted this categorization (of ways of quoting or referring to Qur’an, into those which are acceptable and those which are not) from one of the scholars, and approved of this categorization. \nThen he (as-Suyooti – may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nI do not know of any difference of opinion among the scholars that this is permissible to refer to the Qur’an, provided that the context is not one of approving of promiscuity, immorality, mockery on the part of evildoers, drinking alcohol, promoting homosexuality, and so on.\nEnd quote from Tanweer al-Hawaalik Sharh Muwatta’ Maalik, 1/312\nIbn ‘Aqeel al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nReferencing the Qur’an in the context of improper speech is not permissible. \nEnd quote from Ibn Muflih in al-Adaab ash-Shar‘iyyah, 2/289. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some examples of referring to Qur’anic texts, such as when someone said, “Today we have seen Noon and what they know (noonwa ma ya ‘lamoon)”\n(this is a rhyme which tries to sound like what is mentioned at the beginning of Soorat al-Qalam). \nHe replied: \nAs for the one who said that by way of mockery, this is a very serious matter; it may even be said that he has gone beyond the pale of Islam, because it is not permissible under any circumstances to quote the Qur’an by way of mockery, and the same applies to Islamic rulings. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The hypocrites fear lest a Soorah (chapter of the Quran) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: ‘(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.’\nIf you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: ‘Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (SAW) that you were mocking?\n‘Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimoon (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.)’”\n[at-Tawbah 9:64-66]. \nHence the scholars (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever utters a word of disbelief, even if that is jokingly, has become a disbeliever; he must repent and believe that he is repenting from apostasy, and he has to renew his Islam. The verses of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and the words of His Messenger are too great to be taken as a joke. \nHowever, in the case of one who quotes a verse in relation to some incident that occurs, there is nothing wrong with that. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) quoted verses in relation to incidents that occurred. He quoted the verse (interpretation of the meaning), “Your wealth and your children are only a trial” [at-Taghaabun 64:15], when [his grandsons] al-Hasan and al-Husayn came stumbling; he came down from the minbar and said: (interpretation of the meaning), “Your wealth and your children are only a trial” [at-Taghaabun 64:15]. So there is nothing wrong with quoting verses in relation to some incidents that occur. But to quote verses inappropriately, in ways that are not in accordance with that which was intended by Allah, especially if that is in the context of joking and mocking – this is a very serious matter.\nEnd quote from Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, 60/13 \nAnyone wishing to know more may refer to the book al-Iqtibaas: Anwaa‘uhu wa Ahkaamuhu, by Dr. ‘Abd al-Muhsin ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez al-‘Askar. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the Qur'an is considered the literal word of God (Allah), and it is highly revered. Changing the words of a Qur'anic verse can lead to significant issues, as it may alter the intended meaning and message. \n\nGenerally, scholars agree that it is impermissible to deliberately change the words of the Qur'an, as this could lead to misinterpretations and misunderstandings of its teachings. The Qur'an should be recited and conveyed in its original form to maintain its authenticity and convey the message intended by Allah.\n\nIf one is seeking to explain or paraphrase a verse for educational purposes or to convey a concept but does not intend to misrepresent it, it is essential to make it clear that this is a paraphrase or an interpretation, and to remain as faithful to the original meaning as possible.\n\nFor any specific rulings or scholarly opinions, it's always best to consult knowledgeable scholars or sources of Islamic jurisprudence."

        "question": "How can the Qur’an be a miracle for the non-Arabs when it is Arabic and they do not know Arabic?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    The hadeeth referred to in the question is as follows: \n\n    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \n    “There is not a single Prophet who was not given signs so \n    that the people would believed in him because of them. What I have been \n    given is a Revelation that Allah has revealed to me, and I hope that I will \n    be the one with the most followers on the Day of Resurrection.”\n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1044) and Muslim (152). \n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There \n    are several possible interpretations of the hadeeth: \n\n    It was said that what is meant is that the miracles of the \n    Prophets have come to an end with the end of their time, and no one \n    witnessed them except those who were present, but the miracle of the Qur’an \n    is ongoing and will continue until the Day of Resurrection. It is \n    extraordinary in its style and eloquence, and in what it foretold of future \n    events of the unseen, so that no era passed except something appeared that \n    the Qur’an said would come to pass, which proves the truthfulness of its \n    claim. This is the strongest of the interpretations of the hadeeth. \n\n    It was also said that what is meant is that the miracles of \n    the past were visible and could be seen with the eyes, such as the she-camel \n    of Saalih and the staff of Moosa, whereas the miracle of the Qur’an may be \n    comprehended with the intellect, so the number of those who followed the \n    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) because of it \n    were more numerous, since that which can be seen with the eyes comes to an \n    end when the looking ends, whereas that which may be comprehended with the \n    intellect will continue to be understood by those who come after the first \n    generations. \n\n    Fath al-Baari, 9/70 \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    The answer to the question, How can the Qur’an be a miracle \n    for the unlettered non-Arabs who formed the majority of inhabitants of the \n    world at that time? is as follows:\n\n    it is known that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be \n    upon him) was sent among the Arabs, who were distinguished by their great \n    eloquence and beautiful style in speech, so Allah, may He be exalted, made \n    the miracle or sign of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) of the same nature of that by which his people were distinguished, so \n    that the miracle and challenge would be more effective, just as the sign of \n    Moosa (peace be upon him) was his staff or stick, with which he overcame the \n    deceit of the sorcerers, and the sign of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) was the \n    healing of those who had been born blind and of the lepers, because \n    knowledge of medicine was widespread at his time. \n\n    With regard to the non-Arabs, in the past and at present, and \n    how the Qur’an may be a miracle for them, and whether they were included in \n    its challenge, this may be explained from several angles: \n\n    -1-\n\n    Not all Arabs have great knowledge of the Arabic language and \n    its style and eloquence, just as not all non-Arabs are ignorant of the \n    Arabic language. Hence it is known that the miracle and the challenge is \n    addressed to all those who know Arabic, whether they learned it from birth, \n    like the Arabs, or they learned it later on, like the non-Arabs. Thus it is \n    clear that the case of the non-Arabs is like that of Arabs who have no \n    knowledge of their language. \n\n    Abu ‘Abdullah al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    If it is said: “With regard to reviving the dead, turning the \n    staff into a snake and other, similar miracles, they are very clear and no \n    one who observes that will have any doubt about it. It will be clear to all \n    rational people and no doubt will remain; rather they will all reach a \n    definitive conclusion after seeing that. But this is not the case with \n    regard to your Prophet’s claim of the miraculous nature of the Qur’an, \n    because not everyone will be able to understand its miraculous nature; \n    rather it is only you (Arabs) who can see that, and this applies only to \n    those Arabs who have a good command of the language, as you claim. As for \n    those who do not have a good command of the language, or non-Arabs who do \n    not understand Arabic, they will not understand its miraculous nature. If a \n    non-Arab is asked to speak a word of Arabic, he will not be able to do so, \n    so the fact that he is not able to do that, does not prove that what you are \n    challenging him with is true. Similarly, if an Arab who does not have a good \n    command of Arabic is asked to speak proper Arabic, he will not be able to do \n    so; therefore for him the Qur’an is not miraculous.” \n\n    The answer to that is: \n\n    We will explain, insha Allah, some aspects of its miraculous \n    nature, of which there are many, some of which can be understood by ordinary \n    people, town dwellers and desert dwellers alike, and these aspects are as \n    clear as turning the staff into a snake and raising the dead. If we assume, \n    for the sake of argument, that it is only miraculous with regard to its \n    eloquence and style, which is different to the style of the speech of \n    ordinary people, then we say that the miraculous nature of the Qur’an, \n    raising the dead and turning the staff into a snake are not going to be \n    understood equally or at the same time by rational people. Rather the one \n    who appreciates the miraculous nature of any miracle is the one who knows \n    how and why that thing is a miracle, as he knows that it is something that \n    cannot be achieved by human tricks and cannot be reached by discovering some \n    material with special characteristics. \n\n    It may not be far-fetched to say that a specious argument may \n    be developed in the mind of one who is ignorant of medicine or magic, which \n    prevents him from seeing the miracle; therefore he may say: Perhaps Moosa \n    had some extra knowledge of magic that the sorcerers did not know and had \n    never learned, and by the same token, perhaps ‘Eesa had found some stones \n    with special qualities or some other material with special qualities by \n    means of which he was able to achieve what he achieved. Such a specious \n    argument can only develop in the mind of one who is ignorant of medicine and \n    magic. As for the one who has any knowledge of medicine or magic, no such \n    confusion will arise in his mind, because he realises, on the basis of his \n    knowledge and experience, that the miracle performed by a prophet is \n    something that cannot be achieved by means of professional tricks or finding \n    some materials with special characteristics; rather it is a miracle that \n    happens by the will of the Creator of the universe, by means of which He \n    intended to give proof of the authenticity of the one who called people to \n    Him. Thus we conclude that understanding of the miraculous nature of raising \n    the dead and turning the staff into a snake was first reached by the \n    sorcerers and magicians, and it may not have been understood by many of the \n    fools who were ignorant of medicine and magic. The same may be said of the \n    miraculous nature of the Qur’an, without any differences: understanding of \n    it came to those who had knowledge of the Arabic language and would see, \n    based on their knowledge of Arabic, the difference between the Qur’an and \n    regular Arabic speech. Thus they would conclude that it was not within the \n    ability of the Arabs to say things in the same style. If the eloquent Arabs \n    and those who were well versed in Arabic were unable to match it, then \n    others are more unlikely to be able to do so. As we say, if the doctors are \n    unable to raise the dead and heal those who were born blind and lepers, \n    people other than doctors are more unlikely to be able to do so; and if the \n    sorcerers were unable to turn a stick into a snake, then people other than \n    sorcerers are more unlikely to be able to do so. \n\n    The statement that matching the Qur’an is something that the \n    Arabs are not able to do, and non-Arabs are not involved in this challenge, \n    is similar to saying that only doctors are unable to raise the dead, and \n    people other than doctors are not involved in this challenge, or saying that \n    only sorcerers are unable to turn a stick into a snake, and people other \n    than sorcerers are not involved in this challenge. As the challenge in the \n    other two cases (raising the dead and turning the stick into a snake) is \n    expected to be undertaken by those who have the relevant skills, the same \n    applies in the case of the Qur’an. Rather, in the case of the Qur’anic \n    miracle, it has aspects that we will discuss which everyone can understand, \n    whether he is a non-Arab or an Arab, a Magian or a Jew or Christian. We will \n    discuss it below, in sha Allah. \n\n    So we may conclude from what we have said that Muhammad \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) brought the Qur’an, challenged \n    people with it and it is a miracle, and anyone who brings a miracle and \n    challenges others with it is truthful. Therefore the certain conclusion is \n    that Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is true. \n\n    Al-I‘laam bima fi Deen an-Nasaarah min al-Fasaad \n    wa’l-Awhaam wa Izhaar Mahaasin al-Islam, p. 326 \n\n    -2-\n\n    Some of the scholars said that the miracle in the Book of \n    Allah, may He be exalted, is not only in the wording, but also the meanings, \n    the sequence of meanings and the way in which ideas are presented. So the \n    miracle and challenge for the Arabs has to do with the style, and for others \n    it has to do with the fact that no one among the speakers of any other \n    language is able to come up with something similar to the Qur’an in any \n    other language. \n\n    Al-Jassaas (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The words of Allah, may He be exalted, (interpretation of the \n    meaning): “Say: ‘If mankind and \n    the jinns were together to produce the like of this Qur’an, they could not \n    produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another’” \n    [al-Isra’ 17:88] prove the miraculous nature of \n    the Qur’an. Some people say that its miracle is in the wording and style on \n    the one hand, and in the meanings and the sequence in which ideas are \n    presented, on the other hand. They quote as evidence for that the fact that \n    in this verse the Qur’an challenges both the Arabs and the non-Arabs, the \n    jinn and humans. It is well-known that the non-Arabs could not be challenged \n    on the aspect of the wording and style, therefore the challenge for them \n    should have to do with the meanings and the sequence in which ideas are \n    presented. \n\n    Some of the scholars insist that its miraculous nature is \n    limited to its style and eloquence of expression. They say: The miraculous \n    nature of the Qur’an has many aspects: its beautiful style, its eloquent and \n    concise wording, the way in which it combines many meanings in few words, in \n    addition to the fact that it is completely free of any words that sound \n    ineloquent or any ideas or meanings that are out of place, as well as being \n    free of any contradictions. All of it, from beginning to end, is consistent, \n    as described above. The words of people, on the other hand, especially if \n    they speak at length, cannot be free of cheap words, corrupt meanings and \n    contradictions. What we have mentioned of the flaws in people’s speech are \n    present in the speech of people of all languages; it does not apply only to \n    those who speak Arabic. Thus it is possible that the challenge of the Qur’an \n    may be applicable to the non-Arabs in that way: challenging them to bring \n    something that is free of the faults and flaws referred to above, because \n    saying things in an eloquent manner is not something that is limited only to \n    Arabic, to the exclusion of other languages, even though the Arabic language \n    is the most eloquent. We know that the Qur’an is the pinnacle of eloquence, \n    so it is possible that the challenge to the non-Arabs is by way of \n    challenging them to produce words at the highest level of eloquence in their \n    own languages. \n\n    Ahkaam al-Qur’an, 5/34, 35 \n\n    -3-\n\n    There are many aspects to the miraculous nature of the Book \n    of Allah; it is not limited to style and eloquence only. Hence some of the \n    scholars said that the miraculous nature of the Book of Allah which all \n    people, not only the Arabs, may understand, and that Allah’s challenge to \n    produce something like it, is only applicable to these aspects. Hence Allah \n    issued this challenge to the jinn as well as to mankind, to produce \n    something like this Qur’an. One of these aspects is that it foretold events \n    that would happen and foretold the time at which they would happen, for \n    example. \n\n    Abu ‘Abdullah al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    … The third aspect of the miraculous nature of the Qur’an is \n    what it includes of news of the future before any human even knew anything \n    about it, and foretelling events before they happened. This is something \n    that cannot be known except via the truthful ones who are conveying from \n    Allah, may He be exalted. We will refer to some events just to prove this \n    point in brief, with no need for a lengthy discussion. \n\n    For example, Allah, may He be exalted, said (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\n\n    “Certainly, you \n    shall enter Al-Masjid al-Haram; if Allah wills, secure, (some) having your \n    heads shaved, and (some) having your hair cut short, having no fear”\n\n    [Al-Fath 48:27]. \n\n    This verse is one of the clearest miracles of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, \n    promised him that He would cause him to enter al-Masjid al-Haraam, him and \n    his people, in safety, and that He would grant them the conquest of Makkah \n    in the best state. They kept waiting for that until its time came and Allah \n    fulfilled His promise. Then they entered it as He had promised, and \n    conquered it as they had been foretold. \n\n    Al-I‘laam bima fi Deen an-Nasaarah min al-Fasaad \n    wa’l-Awhaam wa Izhaar Mahaasin al-Islam, p. 337 \n\n    There are other opinions too, but what we have quoted above \n    is sufficient, and it is the strongest view concerning this matter. \n\n    To sum up: the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) was an Arab and the Qur’an is Arabic. He was sent to eloquent, \n    well-spoken Arabs, hence his greatest miracle was the Book of Allah, may He \n    be exalted. They were unable to match its wording, phrases, style and \n    eloquence. Thus the rational people among the eloquent and well-spoken \n    realised that this was not the words of a human being, hence they believed. \n\n    As for those Arabs who were not eloquent or well spoken, and \n    the non-Arabs, what is to be mentioned to them is the meanings and rulings \n    of the Qur’an, and those aspects of its miraculous nature that they are able \n    to understand. Thus they may develop conviction based on the knowledge and \n    understanding that this is not the words of a human being. Hence many of the \n    non-Arabs became Muslim because of coming across the meaning of a verse. In \n    such cases, this non-Arab could not understand its eloquence and style, but \n    its meaning is the reason why he became Muslim. Many such stories have been \n    passed down by numerous narrators, and in our own time there are many more. \n    Those people only became Muslim after they learned what there is in these \n    verses that no human being could have produced, and that at the time of the \n    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) there was no technology \n    and no scientific discoveries that could enable him to tell people about \n    these matters. Thus they accepted that this was revelation from heaven, so \n    they became Muslim. Hence we can see the extent to which the hadeeth the \n    questioner referred to is applicable to real facts. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Qur'an is considered a miracle for all of humanity, not just Arabic speakers, for several reasons that transcend language barriers. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Universal Message**: The Qur'an conveys a universal message that speaks to fundamental human values, morals, and beliefs. The themes of justice, compassion, and guidance are applicable to all people, regardless of language or culture.\n\n2. **Translations and Interpretations**: While the original text of the Qur'an is in Arabic, various translations exist that convey its meaning and teachings. Although translations may not capture the full linguistic beauty and nuances of the Arabic text, they nonetheless provide insight into its core messages and lessons.\n\n3. **Literary and Aesthetic Qualities**: The Qur'an's linguistic style, rhythm, and eloquence are often noted as miraculous features. Non-Arabic speakers may appreciate the impact of its content, but scholars and readers familiar with Arabic often emphasize its unparalleled literary qualities.\n\n4. **Impact and Influence**: The Qur'an has had a profound impact on civilizations and cultures around the world, inspiring art, philosophy, and social systems across different societies. This impact serves as a testament to its miraculous nature, as it transcends linguistic and cultural boundaries.\n\n5. **Personal Experience and Spiritual Guidance**: Many individuals, regardless of their linguistic background, report experiencing a deep sense of connection and spiritual awakening when engaging with the Qur'an, whether through reading translations or listening to recitations. This experience can be considered a form of witnessing its miraculous effect.\n\n6. **Inspiration for Non-Arabic Speakers**: The Qur'an encourages exploration and understanding beyond language, prompting non-Arabs to seek knowledge about Islam and its teachings, thereby inviting them into a broader dialogue about faith and spirituality.\n\nIn summary, while the Qur'an is in Arabic, its messages, themes, and influences are accessible to all, making it a miracle for both Arabs and non-Arabs alike. The essence of its teachings speaks to the heart of humanity, inviting individuals to reflect, learn, and grow spiritually, irrespective of their native language."

        "question": "Ruling on learning recitation and tajweed of Qur’an by means of an electronic pen",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    There is no kind of bid‘ah (innovation) in the program \n    mentioned, in sha Allah, because this is a new educational means in which \n    there is nothing contrary to Islam, that helps one learn how to read Qur’an \n    correctly and helps one to memorise it and understand its meanings. \n\n    This is like using computers, modern recording devices, \n    videos and so on to record and broadcast lectures and the like. Such things \n    do not come under the heading of bid‘ah. \n\n    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n    Bid‘ah means worshipping Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in ways \n    other than what He has prescribed. Based on that, innovation does not \n    include anything other than acts of worship. Rather, newly developed or \n    introduced worldly matters may be examined to see whether they are halaal or \n    haraam, but it cannot be said that they are bid‘ah. … Based on that, what \n    people have introduced nowadays of things that are used to help in matters \n    of worship cannot be said to be bid‘ah even if they did not exist (at the \n    time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)). That \n    includes loudspeakers. Loudspeakers did not exist at the time of the Prophet \n    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); rather they were introduced \n    recently, but they serve a religious purpose, as they convey to the people \n    the prayer, recitation and khutbah of the imam. The same applies to \n    organising lectures, as they achieve good and serve the interests of the \n    people, so they are good. Therefore buying loudspeakers for the mosque for \n    this purpose is something that is prescribed, for which a person will be \n    rewarded.\n\n    End quote from Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, 2/426 \n\n    Please see also the answer to question no.\n    3175 and\n    95430\n\n    Secondly: \n\n    In the answer to question no.\n    88728 and\n    112763 we have stated that \n    listening attentively to recitation of the Qur’an outside of prayer, whether \n    it is recitation from a reciter or via a recorder, is not obligatory, \n    although it is mustahabb and prescribed. \n\n    There is nothing wrong with repeating after the reciter in \n    order to perfect one’s recitation or to review when memorising. Using this \n    electronic pen to help you to memorise, perfect your recitation, correct \n    mistakes and learn about the commentary on the verses is something \n    praiseworthy; there is nothing wrong with it in sha Allah. \n\n    Thirdly:\n\n    With regard to reward, listening to recitation from a machine \n    is not like listening directly to the reciter, as we have explained \n    previously in the answer to question no.\n    112763 \n\n    Similarly, listening is not like reciting; rather reciting it \n    is better than listening. However, varying between prescribed acts of \n    worship is a good thing and is something required, and it is better than not \n    doing some of them all of the time. \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allah have mercy on him) \n    said: \n\n    A person will be rewarded for his good intention and for \n    listening to recitation of the Qur’an, commentaries thereon and Prophetic \n    hadeeths, whether that is from the lips of a reciter or from a recorded \n    voice on the radio or otherwise, although the basic principle with regard to \n    listening to the recitation of the Qur’an, that was narrated from the early \n    generations, is that it should be listening to the voice of the reciter \n    himself, without any intermediary. And if a person recites Qur’an himself, \n    pondering the meaning and with humble focus of mind, that is better and \n    greater in reward. \n\n    End quote from Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, \n    13/81 \n\n    Reciting whilst listening to tajweed of the Qur’an and \n    correcting mistakes is better than mere recitation in which the reciter \n    makes mistakes, because correct recitation with tajweed is better than \n    recitation without tajweed and that in which there are mistakes. \n\n    That applies to the one who does not know how to recite \n    properly with tajweed. \n\n    But if you do not know how to recite Qur’an well, then \n    reciting Qur’an with tajweed, following a reciter who recites with tajweed \n    by means of the electronic pen, is better than simply reading Qur’an and \n    making some mistakes and not reciting with tajweed. But for one who knows \n    how to recite well with tajweed, it is better for him to stick to reciting \n    from the Mushaf or reciting from memory, if he has memorised it, because \n    this is the basic principle – to recite Qur’an without combining it with \n    listening – because this is how it was done by the early generations, the \n    imams, and the people after them. And because that helps the reciter to \n    achieve proper focus and ponder the meanings. But sometimes it is prescribed \n    for him to focus on listening to recitation from someone else, especially if \n    that person recites well and it will be of greater benefit to him.  \n\n    However, there is no limit to the bounty of Allah and the \n    blessings He bestows upon His slaves. But the recitation of one who is \n    skilled in recitation is better than the recitation of someone else. If a \n    person strives hard to learn properly and memorise, although that is \n    difficult for him, Allah that will reward him for that and will make up for \n    his shortcomings, as al-Bukhaari (4937) and Muslim (798) narrated that \n    ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon \n    him) said: “The one who is skilled in reciting Qur’aan will be with the \n    noble, honourable scribes and the one who recites Qur’aan and falters \n    therein, and finds it difficult, will have a double reward.” \n\n    An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The one who is skilled is the one who has memorised it \n    precisely, and he does not falter or find it difficult to recite because he \n    has memorised it properly. As for the one who falters therein, he is the one \n    who falters in his recitation because he does not have a good memory. He \n    will have a double reward: a reward for reciting and a reward for faltering \n    in his recitation and the difficulty he encounters. Al-Qaadi and other \n    scholars said: It does not mean that the one who falters there in will have \n    a greater reward than the one who recites with skill; rather the one who \n    recites skilfully will have a better and greater reward, because he will be \n    with the noble, honourable scribes and he will have many rewards, and this \n    status is not mentioned for anyone else, so how can the one who did not make \n    the effort to learn the Book of Allah properly and memorise it, perfect his \n    knowledge of it and recite it be like one who made that effort until he \n    became proficient in it. End quote. \n\n    To sum up: \n\n    As you do not recite well with tajweed and you sometimes make \n    mistakes in recitation, and this pen helps you to correct your mistakes and \n    recite well, whilst also learning the meaning, then your following this \n    program is something good and is Islamically prescribed; there is no bid‘ah \n    in it, in sha Allah. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, learning the recitation of the Qur'an and its tajweed is highly encouraged, as it is fundamental to the proper understanding and worship associated with the Qur'an. The use of modern technology, such as an electronic pen that reads or assists with the recitation of the Qur'an, is generally permissible as long as it serves the purpose of learning and does not detract from the reverence owed to the Holy Book.\n\nThe electronic pen can be a useful tool for practicing pronunciation and understanding the rules of tajweed. However, it is important that the learner also seeks guidance from qualified teachers when possible, as this can enhance understanding and ensure correct application of tajweed rules.\n\nAs with any means of learning, users should ensure that their approach remains respectful and focused on the teachings of Islam. If using an electronic pen contributes positively to this goal, there should be no issue in its use for learning purposes."

        "question": "Ruling on tankees or altering the order of verses when memorising Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Tankees or altering the order of verses when reciting is haram, whether that is during prayer or otherwise. \nIt says in Asna’l-Mataalib (1/63): It is haram to switch the order of verses when reciting, because that undermines the miraculous nature of the text and it ignores the wisdom behind the order in which the verses appear. End quote. \nIt says in Haashiyat ad-Dasooqi (1/242): Switching the order of soorahs is makrooh, and switching the order of consecutive verses in one rak‘ah is haram and invalidates the prayer, because it distorts it. End quote. \nIt says in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (1/343): It is makrooh to switch the order of soorahs, such as reciting al-Inshiraah (94), then reciting ad-Duha (93) after it, whether that is in one or two rak‘ahs, because of the report narrated from Ibn Mas‘ood, according to which he was asked about someone who recited Quran in the wrong order. He said: His heart is disordered. Abu ‘Ubayd explained that as referring to when a person recites one soorah, then after it he recites another that comes before it in the order (of soorahs in the Mushaf). This was mentioned by Ibn Nasrullah in ash-Sharh as being similar to the case with verses, that is, a similar ruling of it being makrooh applies in the case of switching the order of the verses. It says in al-Furoo‘ that there is consensus on this point. Ibn Nasrullah said: If it was said that it is haram to switch the order of verses, that would be a valid opinion. The evidence for it being only makrooh is not clear, and using as evidence the way the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) learned it is subject to further discussion, because that was due to need, as the Quran was revealed according to events. Shaykh [Ibn Taymiyah] said: Following the order of verses is obligatory, because the order in which they appear is based on clear instructions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), according to scholarly consensus. End quote. \nBut if the switching of the order occurs when memorising, not when reciting or asking someone to listen so as to check one’s memorisation, there is nothing wrong with that. So one may begin by memorising the fifth verse, for example, then the fourth, then when one wants to recite them, one recites the fourth verse and then the fifth, without switching the order. Then when he has memorised the third, and he wants to recite what he had memorised, he should recite them in the proper order without switching it. So he should recite the third, then the fourth, then the fifth. There is nothing wrong with this; some teachers do it this way and think that it is the best way of memorising. \nTo sum up: It is not permissible to recite two consecutive verses in the wrong order, and it is not permissible to switch the order of words in one verse. \nFor more information please see the answer to question no. 7198  \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, when it comes to memorizing the Quran, it is important to adhere to the proper method and respect the order of the verses as they were revealed.

        "question": "Why There Is No Bismillah in Surah At-Tawbah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Reciting the Basmalah before reading the Quran\nPart of the etiquette of reciting the Quran is for the reciter to always say Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) at the beginning of every Surah, except Surah At-Tawbah.\nImam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“He should always recite Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim at the beginning of every Surah except Surah Bara’ah (At-Tawbah), because the majority of scholars said that it is a verse wherever it is written in the Mushaf, and it was written at the beginning of all the Surahs except Surah At-Tawbah. If he recites it at the beginning of every Surah (other than At-Tawbah), then there is certainty that he had recited the entire Quran or Surah, and if he fails to recite the Basmalah, he has omitted part of the Quran according to the majority.” (At-Tibyan fi Adab Hamalat Al-Quran, 100.)\nBut if he recites from partway through a Surah, he does not have to recite the Basmalah and it is sufficient for him to seek refuge with Allah (by saying A‘udhu Billahi min ash-Shaytan ir-rijim (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed devil), but if he does say the Basmalah there is nothing wrong with that. \nWhy doesn’t Surah At-Tawbah start with Bislmillah?\nThe reason why the Basmalah does not appear at the beginning of Surah At-Tawbah is that the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did not write it at the beginning of this Surah in the Mushaf, following the example of the caliph `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him). At-Tirmidhi narrated in As-Sunan that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I said to `Uthman ibn `Affan: ‘What made you put Al-Anfal which is one of the Mathani, next to Bara’ah [At-Tawbah], which is one of the Mi’in? Why did you not put the line Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim in between them when you put it at the beginning of the rest of Al-Sab’ Al-Tiwal [the long seven Surahs]?” `Uthman said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to receive revelation of Surahs with many verses. When they were revealed, he would call his scribes and tell them, ‘Put these verses in the Surah where such-and-such is mentioned.’ Al-Anfal was one of the first Surahs to be revealed in Madinah, and Bara’ah (At-Tawbah) was one of the last parts of the Quran to be revealed. Its stories were similar to the stories mentioned in Al-Anfal, so it was thought that it was part of it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken [i.e., died] without explaining whether it was indeed part of it, so they were put next to one another, and the line Bismillahi ir-Rahman ir-Rahim was not written between them, and it [At-Tawbah] was put among the Sab’ Al-Tiwal [seven long Surahs].” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 4/225)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: … The correct opinion is that there is no Basmalah between it (Surah At-Tawbah) and Al-Anfal, because the Basmalah is a verse of the Book of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, and if the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say to put the Basmalah between the two Surahs, they did not put it between them. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is the one who decided and said: Put the Basmalah, and he did not tell them to put the Basmalah between Surah Al-Anfal and Surah At-Tawbah, so they did not write it. But it remains to be said: if he did not give instructions to this effect, why is there a separation between it and Surah Al-Anfal? Why did they not make it one Surah? We say: Yes, they did not make it one Surah because they were uncertain as to whether it was the same Surah as Al-Anfal or they were two separate Surahs, so they said: Let us make a separation between the two Surahs and not write the Basmalah. This is the correct opinion concerning the absence of the Basmalah between Surah Al-Anfal and Surah At-Tawbah.\nEnd quote from Liqa’ Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, no. 18\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the absence of \"Bismillah\" (In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) at the beginning of Surah At-Tawbah (Chapter 9 of the Qur'an) has been a topic of discussion among scholars. The primary reasons for this absence are as follows:\n\n1. **Context of the Surah**: Surah At-Tawbah is a Makkan surah, but it primarily addresses the topic of warfare and deals with the issues related to the hypocrites and treaties. The tone and content are different from other surahs, which often emphasize mercy and compassion.\n\n2. **Nature of the Message**: This surah discusses themes of judgment and disobedience. The tone is more serious and stern, focusing on the consequences of actions rather than Allah's mercy, which is why it does not begin with \"Bismillah\".\n\n3. **Tradition of Separation**: According to some scholars, the relationship between Surah At-Tawbah and the preceding Surah Al-Anfal (Surah 8) is significant. They argue that both surahs are related in theme, and thus, Surah At-Tawbah was intentionally separated from Surah Al-Anfal, which does begin with \"Bismillah\".\n\n4. **Consensus Among Scholars**: The majority of Islamic scholars maintain that the omission of \"Bismillah\" from this surah is a deliberate choice by the Prophet Muhammad and a part of the revelation itself.\n\nOverall, the lack of \"Bismillah\" at the beginning of Surah At-Tawbah is viewed as a reflection of the surah's distinctive themes and the context within which it was revealed."

        "question": "Revelation of the Quran: All at Once or Gradually?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Did the Quran come down all at once?\nThe issue mentioned has two aspects: on one there is consensus and the other is a matter in which there are differences of opinion. \nWith regard to the aspect on which there is consensus, it is that the Quran did not come down from Heaven to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) all at once; rather the Revelation came down to him from Allah piecemeal, according to events and circumstances. \nThere are verses which confirm this quite clearly with no confusion, and they affirm the wisdom behind its being revealed in this manner: \n1- Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And those who disbelieve say: Why is not the Quran revealed to him all at once? Thus (it is sent down in parts), that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages.” [25:32] \nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-S’adi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“That is because every time something of the Quran was revealed to him, it increased his certainty and steadfastness, especially when there was cause for anxiety. The fact that the Quran was revealed when new developments occurred meant that it had greater impact and was more reassuring to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). And that was more effective than if it had been revealed before that, then was remembered when the new developments occurred.  \n“And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages,” means We revealed it slowly and sent it gradually. All of this indicates that Allah was taking care of His Book, the Quran, and His Messenger, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as He sent down His Book in accordance with the situations faced by the Messenger and as needed to address unfolding issues.” (Tafsir as-S’adi)\n2- Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning) says:\n“And (it is) a Quran which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages.” [17:106] \nShaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahman as-S’adi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“At intervals” means at an easy pace, so that they might ponder it and think about its meanings, and derive knowledge from it. \n“And We have revealed it by stages,” means: bit by bit, piecemeal over twenty-three years.” (Tafsir as- S’adi)\nThe Quran was revealed piecemeal \nWhat confirms the fact that the Quran was revealed piecemeal is the suspension of the Revelation concerning the slander incident (al-ifk), in which ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was accused of adultery. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was waiting for Quranic verses to be revealed, because of the enormity of the calamity and the accusation that was made against his wife, until the words of Allah were revealed (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily! Those who brought forth the slander (against ‘Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) are a group among you. Consider it not a bad thing for you. Nay, it is good for you. Unto every man among them will be paid that which he had earned of the sin, and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be a great torment.” [24:11] \nAnother confirmation that the Quran was revealed piecemeal is the first few verses of Surah ‘Abasa which were revealed when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned away from teaching the blind man Ibn Umm Maktum  (may Allah be pleased with him) in the hope that the leaders of Quraysh would become Muslim (as he was already talking to the leaders of Quraysh and the blind mind man came to him in the middle of the conversation). \nHow was the start of the revelation of the Quran?\nWith regard to that concerning which there is a difference of opinion, it has to do with the start of the revelation of the Quran . Was it sent down all at once to the first heaven, then brought down to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) piecemeal, or was it all brought down in the same manner, piecemeal according to events, as stated above? \nThe reason for this difference of opinion is differences in understanding some verses which indicate that the Quran came down at a particular time, such as the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong).” [2:185]\n“Verily! We have sent it (this Quran) down on the night of Al-Qadr (Decree).” [97:1]\nAnd Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) clearly stated this understanding. \nThe scholars differed concerning this sending down; there are several opinions, the most well-known of which are two: \n1- The view of the majority is that the Quran was sent down from al-Lawh al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet) to the first heaven on Laylat al-Qadr (the night of Decree) all at once, then after that it was sent down in stages over twenty-three years. \nIt was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas  (may Allah be pleased with him) said, concerning the verse “Verily! We have sent it (this Quran) down on the night of Al-Qadr (Decree).” The Quran was sent down all at once on Laylat al-Qadr, then Allah sent it down to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bit by bit. “And those who disbelieve say: Why is not the Quran revealed to him all at once? Thus (it is sent down in parts), that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages.” [25:32]. [an-Nasai]\n2- The second opinion is that the revelation of the Quran began on Laylat al-Qadr, then after that it was revealed in stages at various times, according to the unfolding of events and what the people needed. This is the view of the great Tabi‘i (Successor) ash-Sh’abi. \nThis difference of opinion – as you can see – does not have any real impact on the reality of the revelation of the Quran in stages to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It has been said that the reason for this revelation (being sent down all at once to the first heaven) was to highlight the nobility and great status of the Quran in the upper realm (the heavens). \nBadr ad-Din az-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“If it is asked: what is the reason for the Quran being sent down to the first heaven all at once? The answer is to highlight its high status and the high status of the one to whom it was revealed. That was so as to announce to the inhabitants of the seven heavens that this was the last of the Books that was being sent down to the last of the Messengers and to the noblest of the nations.” (Al-Burhan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran)\nHow was the Quran conveyed to Prophet Muhammad?\nThe Angel of Revelation who brought it down to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Jibril (peace be upon him), only heard it from the Lord of Glory, may He be exalted, then he passed it on to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so he heard it with his ears and his heart understood it. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And verily, you (O Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) are receiving the Quran from the One, All-Wise, All-Knowing.” [27:6]\n“And if you do not bring them a miracle (according to their (i.e. Quraysh-pagans) proposal), they say: Why have you not brought it? Say: I but follow what is revealed to me from my Lord.” [7: 203] \n‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah speaks via revelation, the people of heaven hear from heaven a clanging like a chain dragged across a rock and they swoon, then they remain like that until Jibril (peace be upon him) comes to them. When he comes to them, they recover and say: O Jibril, what did your Lord say? He says: The truth, and they say: The truth, the truth.” [Abu Dawud]\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“The fact that it – the Quran – is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz and in pure pages in the hands of the angels does not contradict the idea that Jibril (peace be upon him) brought it down from Allah, whether Allah wrote it down before sending Jibril (peace be upon him) with it or after that. And if He sent it down written to Bayt al-‘Izzah (in the first heaven) in one go on Laylat al-Qadr, then He had written it all before sending it down. … If anyone says that Jibril (peace be upon him) took the Quran from the Book and did not hear it from Allah, this is false for a number of reasons – which the author then listed.” (Majmu‘ al-Fatawa) \nWe hope that this is sufficiently clear and we hope that you will remain in contact with us if you have any further questions about this matter or if you need to ask more questions about any matter of our religion. We ask Allah to help you and guide you to that which is in your best interests in this world and in the Hereafter. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, the Quran was revealed gradually over a period of approximately 23 years to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Angel Gabriel (Jibril). This gradual revelation is acknowledged in the Quran itself and is reflected in various Hadith (sayings of the Prophet).\n\nThe process of gradual revelation allowed the teachings and guidance of the Quran to be contextualized to the circumstances, events, and challenges faced by the Muslim community at that time. This method also facilitated the deeper understanding and implementation of its teachings by the companions of the Prophet and later generations.\n\nWhile the entire Quran is considered to be the complete word of God, its segmented revelation served a practical purpose in the early formation of the Islamic faith and community. This is a well-established belief among scholars of Islam. \n\nIn summary, the Quran was revealed gradually, and this is an essential aspect of its historical and theological understanding within Islam."

        "question": "The difference of scholarly opinion as to whether the Basmalah counts as a verse of al-Faatihah does not come under the heading of distortions of the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Muslims did not disagree that Allah, may He be exalted, has preserved His Book from additions and subtractions, in fulfilment of His words (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily We: It is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]. \nThe Muslims are unanimously agreed that anyone who disagrees with this and claims that there is something in the Book of Allah that is not part of it, or that something that Allah revealed has been taken away from it, is a disbeliever. \nAl-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe Muslims are unanimously agreed that the Quran which is recited in all parts of the world and is written in the Mushaf that the Muslims have, that is contained between the two covers, from the first soorah “All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists)” to the last soorah, “Say: \"I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of mankind”, is the Book of Allah and His Revelation that He sent down to His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and that everything in it is true, and that anyone who deliberately takes away a single letter from it or changes one letter for another or adds a letter to it, that is not included in the Mushaf on which there is consensus, and there is consensus that it is not part of the Quran – the one who does any of these things deliberately is a disbeliever. End quote. \nash-Shifa bi Ta‘reef Huqooq al-Mustafa, 2/304, 305 \nWith regard to the difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether the Basmalah is counted as a verse of the Quran or not, this does not come under this heading, because the scholars of Quran recitation did not differ with regard to reciting it at the beginning of the soorahs. And the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were unanimously agreed that it must be written at the beginning of all soorahs apart from Soorat at-Tawbah, and that is in the Mushaf that was written by ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allah be pleased with him) and sent to all regions. \nAsh-Shawkaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said, when discussing the Basmalah: \nIt should be noted that the ummah is unanimously agreed that neither the one who affirms it nor the one who denies it is to be described as a disbeliever, because of the difference of scholarly opinion concerning it. This is different from the case of a person who denies a letter on which there is consensus or who affirms something that no one said; he is to be regarded as a disbeliever according to scholarly consensus. \nThere is no difference of opinion concerning the fact that it is a verse in Soorat an-Naml, or that it is a line to be written at the beginning of the soorahs in the Mushaf, apart from the beginning of Soorat at-Tawbah. \nNayl al-Awtar, 2/215 \nSome of the scholars regard the difference of opinion as to whether the Basmalah is a verse of the Quran as being like the difference of opinion among the leading scholars of recitation about some words and letters that may be proven in some recitations and not in others. \nShaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shanqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nThe scholars differed concerning the Basmalah: is it a verse at the beginning of each soorah, or only at the beginning of al-Faatihah, or is it not a verse at all? As for the words of Allah in Soorat an-Naml, “Verily! It is from Sulaiman (Solomon), and verily! It (reads): In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful” [an-Naml 27:30], this is a verse of the Quran according to scholarly consensus. \nWith regard to Soorah Baraa’ah (at-Tawbah), the Basmalah is not a verse thereof, according to scholarly consensus. But there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning other cases. Some of these scholars of Usool stated that the Basmalah is not part of the Quran, and some said that it is part of it in al-Faatihah only. And it was said that it is a verse at the beginning of every soorah. This is the view of ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him). \nOne of the best things that have been said concerning this matter, to reconcile between all the opinions, is that in some recitations, such as the recitation of Ibn Katheer, the Basmalah is a verse of the Quran, and in some other recitations it is not a verse, and there is nothing strange about that. \nIn the verse in Soorat al-Hadeed, “Fa inna Allaha huwa al-Ghaniy ul-Hameed (then Allah is Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all praise)” [al-Hadeed 57:24],  the word “huwa” is part of the Quran according to the recitations of Ibn Katheer, Abu ‘Amr, ‘Aasim, Hamzah, and al-Kasaa’i, and it is not part of the Quran according to the recitations of Naafi‘ and Ibn ‘Aamir, because they recited it “Fa inna Allaha al-Ghaniy al-Hameed”. And in some Mushafs the word “huwa” is present and in others it is not present. \nIn the passage “so wherever you turn yourselves or your faces there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne). Surely! Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures needs, All-Knowing. And they (Jews, Christians and pagans) say: Allah has begotten a son (children or offspring)” [al-Baqarah 2:115-116], the waw (in the phrase wa qaalu attakhadha Allahu waladan/and they say: Allah has begotten a son) is present in the recitation of the seven, except for Ibn ‘Aamir; according to the recitation of Ibn ‘Aamir it is not part of the Quran, because he recited it as “Qaalu attakhadha Allahu waladan (They say Allah has begotten a son)”, without the waw. So it is omitted in the Mushaf of the people of ash-Shaam (greater Syria), and there are other exaples. \nThus it is known that it does not matter whether the Basmalah is regarded as a verse in some recitations and not others. The scholars are agreed on this point.\nEnd quote from al-Madhkarah fi Usool al-Fiqh, p. 66, 67. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Basmalah (بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ) is the phrase \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\" In the context of Surah Al-Faatihah (the Opening chapter of the Quran), there is a scholarly disagreement among Islamic jurists and scholars regarding whether the Basmalah is considered a part of the Surah.\n\nSome scholars, particularly from the Hanafi school, view the Basmalah as a separate verse that precedes the Surah, while others, like those from the Shafi'i school, consider it to be an integral part of the Surah itself. Despite this difference in opinion, it is important to note that such scholarly disagreements do not constitute distortions of the Quran (tahreef). \n\nDistortions imply a change in the text, meaning, or misrepresentation of the Quran, which is not the case here. The differing opinions about whether the Basmalah counts as a verse pertain to interpretation and methodology rather than alterations in the actual wording or meaning of the Quran itself. Thus, this scholarly difference can be seen as a matter of jurisprudential interpretation rather than an issue of distortions of the Quran."

        "predicted_answer": "Hanging Soorat al-Ikhlaas or any other Qur’anic verses in the car or in any place as a reminder is a matter that has differing opinions among scholars. Generally, the act of displaying Qur’anic texts in a respectful manner is acceptable. However, there are some important considerations:\n\n1. **Respect for the Qur'an**: It is essential to ensure that the Qur'an is treated with the utmost respect. This includes not allowing it to be exposed to disrespectful environments or situations, such as being placed in a location where it may be stepped on or soiled.\n\n2. **Intent and Purpose**: The intention behind hanging the verse should be to remind oneself of Allah and to reflect on its meanings, rather than treating it as an amulet or a talisman for protection or blessings.\n\n3. **Practical Considerations**: If the Qur'anic verse is at risk of being damaged, soiled, or disrespected, it would be better not to hang it.\n\n4. **Scholarly Opinions**: Some scholars might consider it permissible if done respectfully, while others may question it due to concerns about its possible disrespectful treatment over time.\n\nIn conclusion, it is advisable to consult specific scholars or local authorities in your community for the best practice in line with your beliefs and the respect due to the Qur'anic text. For personal reminders, engaging with the text through reading, memorization, or recitation may be a more fruitful approach."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Soorat al-Isra’ is called Soorat Bani Israa’eel in two saheeh mawqoof hadeeths, in which it is the words of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them): \nThe first hadeeth was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him), who said concerning (the soorahs) Bani Israa’eel, al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta-Ha and al-Anbiya’: They are among the best and earliest and they are among the first I received.\nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 4994 \nAl-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘Itaaq (translated above as “best”) is the plural of ‘ateeq, which means ancient, or it may mean everything that reaches the utmost of excellence; the second meaning was preferred by a number of scholars in this hadeeth. \n“and they are among the first I received (tilaadi)” i.e., among that which I memorized a long time ago. Tilaad means long-standing possession; it is the opposite of taarif (recent acquisition). What Ibn Mas‘ood meant was that they were among the first soorahs he learned of the Qur’aan, and that they possess virtue because of what they contain of stories of the earlier Prophets and nations.\nEnd quote from Fath al-Baari, 8/388 \nThe second hadeeth was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used not to sleep until he had recited Bani Israa’eel and al-Zumar. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3402, who said: It is a hasan hadeeth. It was also classed as hasan by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Nataa’ij al-Afkaar, 3/65; and it was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. \nThe scholars said that this soorah was better known by the name Soorat Bani Isra’eel at the time of the Sahaabah and Taabi’een, because the first verse of Soorat al-Isra’ speaks of the Isra’ (Night Journey) to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, then in the second verse it starts to speak of an important stage in the story of Bani Isra’eel (the Children of Israel) and their mischief in the land, which is not mentioned in any of the stories of Bani Isra’eel anywhere else in the Qur’aan. That is in the passage where Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Glorified (and Exalted) is He (Allâh) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him]. Who took His slave (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid-al-Harâm (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid-al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in order that We might show him (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) of Our Ayât (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.).

But at the time of the Sahaabah it was called Soorat Bani Israa’eel, the reason for that being that it mentions things about Bani Isra’eel that are not mentioned in other soorahs, namely their subjugation by those who were given to terrible warfare (cf. 17:4) -- the Assyrians; then their subjugation by another people -- namely the Romans.

Acting\n      in accordance with the Qur’aan is the greatest aim behind\n      reading it and memorising it. \n    \n\n      It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah\n      ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When one of\n      us learned ten verses, he would not move on from them until\n      he understood the meaning and acted upon them. \n    \n\n      Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sulami --\n      one of the Taabi‘een -- said: Those who used to teach us the\n      Qur’aan, such as ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan, ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas‘ood\n      and others, told us that when they learned ten verses from\n      the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) they\n      would not move on from them until they learned what was in\n      them of knowledge and action. And they said: So we learned\n      the Qur’aan and knowledge and action all together.\n       \n    \n\n      And Allah knows\n      best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the practice of memorizing the Qur'an is highly encouraged and is considered a virtuous act. The one who memorizes the Qur'an is known as a \"Hafiz.\" While there are numerous hadiths that highlight the greatness and rewards for memorizing the Qur'an in general, specific references to the memorization of the numbers of verses or the details of its structure are not commonly cited in traditional texts.\n\nThe emphasis in Islamic teachings is more focused on the love of the Qur'an, understanding its meanings, and acting upon its teachings rather than just the memorization of its text or its numerical details. The reward for a Hafiz is greatly emphasized, and many narrations mention that those who memorize the Qur'an will be honored in the hereafter, given status in this life, and will intercede for their family members.\n\nIn summary, while there may not be specific texts indicating that one who memorizes the Qur'an along with its verses' numbers receives a greater reward compared to a Hafiz who does not memorize the numbers, all efforts toward memorizing and understanding the Qur'an are beneficial and rewarded by Allah. The best approach is to seek knowledge and engage with the Qur'an as a whole, valuing its recitation, memorization, and application in one’s life."

        "question": "One of the characteristics of Makkan verses is that they are addressed to all of mankind",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      Firstly: \n\n    The call in the Holy Qur'aan, “O mankind” is mentioned in \n    twenty places in the Book: two in Soorat al-Baqarah, four in al-Nisa’, one \n    in al-A’raaf, four in Yoonus, four in al-Hajj, one in Luqmaan, three in \n    Faatir and one in al-Hujuraat. \n\n    The one who ponders all of these verses will find that they \n    are addressed to all of mankind, believers and disbelievers, righteous and \n    evildoers, calling them to think about that which will benefit them in the \n    Hereafter and reminding them of the Lordship of Allah over them and their \n    need for Him, so that this will motivate them to worship Him alone with no \n    partner or associate, and to devote their religious commitment sincerely to \n    Him alone. Because this is addressed to all of mankind, and is not limited \n    to any specific group, it is appropriate that it should say “O mankind” \n    rather than “O you who believe.” \n\n    That has nothing to do with mention of the Ka’bah, Makkah or \n    Hajj in particular; rather most of the soorahs mentioned above in which the \n    call, “O mankind” appears, do not mention anything about the Ka’bah, Makkah \n    or Hajj at all. We do not think that this call comes only when there is \n    mention of the Ka’bah or Makkah, to the exclusion of other Islamic duties. \n\n    Some scholars have mentioned, when discussing the difference \n    between Makkan and Madinan soorahs, that the words “O mankind” appear in the \n    Makkan soorahs and “O you who believe” appear in the Madinan soorahs. This \n    is what is usually the case. In Madinan soorahs such as al-Baqarah and al-Nisa’, \n    it says “O mankind” and in some of the Makkan soorahs such as al-Hajj, it \n    says “O you who believe.” \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    With regard to places in the Holy Qur'aan in which words \n    addressed in general to “mankind” appear in the context of Hajj and its \n    rituals, perhaps the reason for that is that Hajj was first enjoined with \n    the call of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) to all the people of Earth, \n    calling them to visit the sacred House of Allah and to perform the Hajj \n    rituals there. That appears in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation \n    of the meaning):\n\n    “And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will \n    come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep \n    and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform Hajj)”\n\n    [al-Hajj 22:27]. \n\n    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    Meaning: give the call to mankind, calling them to come on \n    the pilgrimage to this House which We have commanded you to build. \n\n    It was narrated that he said: O Lord, how can I call mankind \n    when my voice will not reach them? It was said: Call, and it is for Us to \n    convey. So he stood on his Maqaam (station), or it was said on the Hijr, or \n    on al-Safa, or on Abu Qubays [a mountain beside the Ka’bah], and said: O \n    mankind, your Lord has established a House, so come on pilgrimage to it. It \n    was said that the mountains lowered themselves so that his voice could reach \n    all the corners of the earth, and those who were still in their mothers’ \n    wombs and fathers’ loins heard it, and everything that heard him of rocks, \n    plains and trees responded, as did those who Allah decreed would perform \n    Hajj until the Day of Resurrection, saying: Labbayk Allahumma labbayk. This \n    is a summary of what is narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid, ‘Ikrimah, \n    Sa’eed ibn Jubayr and others of the salaf. And Allaah knows best. \n\n    It was narrated by Ibn Jareer and Ibn Abi Haatim at length. \n    End quote. \n\n    Tafseer al-Qur’aan al-‘Azeem, \n    5/414 \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, one of the characteristics of Makkan verses (verses revealed in Makkah during the early years of Prophet Muhammad's mission) is that they are often addressed to all of mankind. These verses focus on fundamental beliefs such as the oneness of God (Tawheed), prophecy, the Day of Judgment, morality, and social justice. They emphasize universal themes aimed at both believers and non-believers alike, inviting contemplation and reflection on the message of Islam. Unlike Madinan verses, which are often directed more specifically at the Muslim community and relate to social, legal, and community matters, Makkan verses tend to have a broader, more universal appeal."

        "question": "Playing Qur'aan in the car from speakers next to the feet",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Listening to Qur'aan in the car is a righteous deed and a \n    beneficial act of worship. But having the speakers directly next to one's \n    feet in such a way that the sound of the Qur'aan is heard from below is \n    something that is not appropriate and you should limit it to the rear \n    speakers if you have any, or do something to change the position of the \n    speakers. \n\n    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was \n    asked: In some cars the speakers are level with the feet, and feet or shoes \n    may be placed on the speaker. My question is: when playing Qur'aan, is there \n    any disrespect to the Book of Allah in doing this? Is this comparable to \n    your fatwa against those who stretched out their feet in front of the Book \n    of Allah? We hope that you can advise us, may Allah preserve you. \n\n    He replied: If the speakers are beneath the feet as described \n    or are level with the feet, then you should not play Qur'aan, because the \n    fact that the Qur'aan is being heard from beneath a person’s feet is \n    undoubtedly a kind of disrespect towards the Qur'aan. If a person must \n    listen to Qur'aan, then he should lift the speakers above the level of his \n    feet. \n\n    End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, 57/13.",
        "predicted_answer": "Playing the Qur'an in the car through speakers is a common practice among many Muslims, as it allows them to listen to the recitation while traveling. However, regarding the placement of the speakers near the feet, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Respect for the Qur'an**: The Qur'an is considered the literal word of God in Islam, and great respect should be shown to it. While it's permissible to listen to it while driving, ensuring that it is played in a dignified manner is important. \n\n2. **Volume and Environment**: The volume should be at a level where it is audible and clear but not unnecessarily loud or distracting. It is also good practice to ensure that the environment inside the car is conducive to listening to something as sacred as the Qur'an, which may mean avoiding discussions or distractions while it is playing.\n\n3. **Placement**: As for placing the speakers next to the feet, there are no explicit prohibitions against it, but it is generally better to avoid positions that may be perceived as disrespectful. Ideally, the sound should be directed in a way that honors the recitation.\n\n4. **Intention**: Listening to the Qur'an should be done with the intention of reflection and understanding rather than simply as background noise.\n\nIn summary, while it is permissible to play the Qur'an in the car, it's important to approach its recitation with respect and dignity, regardless of the position of the speakers. If there's any discomfort with the setup in relation to respect, it might be preferable to adjust how and where the Qur'an is played."

        "question": "Which is better -- reading Quran or listening to it on tapes?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Reading Quran and listening to it are both righteous deeds for which the Muslim will be rewarded. \nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sometimes liked to listen to Quran from other people. \nAl-Bukhaari (4582 and 5049) and Muslim (800) narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah upon him) said to me: “Recite the Quran to me.” I said: O Messenger of Allah, should I recite to you when it was revealed to you? He said: “I like to hear it from someone else.” So I recited al-Nisa’, and when I reached the verse, “How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad ) as a witness against these people?” [al-Nisa’ 4:41], I raised my head, or a man who was beside me nudged me and I raised my head, and I saw his tears flowing.. \nSo what is best is to do that which is in his best interests and will have the best effect on him, whether it is reading or listening, because the purpose of reading is to ponder and understand the meanings and act upon what is indicated by the Book of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember” [Saad 38:29]\n“Verily, this Quran guides to that which is most just and right” [al-Isra’ 17:9]\n“Say: It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing” [Fussilat 41:44]. \nEnd quote from Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/364 \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, both reading the Quran and listening to it have their own virtues and benefits. Generally, scholars emphasize the importance of both practices, and one may choose to engage in either or both based on their circumstances.\n\n1. **Reading the Quran**: It is highly encouraged to read the Quran, as doing so allows for deeper contemplation and understanding. When you read it, you can engage more actively with the text, reflecting on its meanings, and applying it in your daily life.\n\n2. **Listening to the Quran**: Listening to the Quran, especially recitations by skilled Qaris (reciters), can be very beneficial. It allows one to absorb the beautiful sounds and rhythms of the Quran, fostering a spiritual atmosphere. This method can be particularly helpful for those who may struggle with reading or find it easier to engage with audio.\n\nUltimately, the best approach may vary among individuals. If you find that reading helps you connect more with the Quran, then that might be better for you. Conversely, if you find that listening enhances your connection and comprehension, then that might be the better option.\n\nIn conclusion, both methods are commendable, and you may want to incorporate both into your routine to maximize your connection to the Quran. The intention behind engaging with the Quran is what holds significant merit in Islam."

        "question": "If the imam forgets some verses, how can he recite them so that he will have completed the Qur'aan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      The reader will not attain the reward for \n      completing the Holy Qur'aan unless he has recited all of it and not \n      omitted any part of it. If he omits a verse and does not recite it, then \n      he has not completed the Holy Qur'aan. \n\n    The scholars even said that he should recite \n    the Basmalah at the beginning of every soorah except Soorat Baraa’ah (al-Tawbah), \n    and he should pay attention to that so that he will have completed the \n    Qur'aan. \n\n    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) \n    said: \n\n    He should always recite Bismillaah al-Rahmaan \n    al-Raheem at the beginning of every soorah except Baraa’ah, as most of the \n    scholars said that it is a verse, as it is written in the Mushaf and it is \n    written at the beginning of all soorahs except Bara’aah. If he recites it \n    then he has definitely completed the recitation, and if he omits the \n    Basmalah he has omitted part of the Qur'aan according to the majority. End \n    quote. \n\n    Al-Tibyaan, \n    p. 61, 62 \n\n    Based on that, it is essential for the \n    reader to recite what he forgot of the verses, so that he may attain the \n    reward for completing the Qur'aan. \n\n    The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) \n    mentioned two ways narrated from the Salaf (early generation) of reciting \n    the verse or verses that the imam forgot during Taraweeh prayers: \n\n    1.He should put all \n    these verses together and recite them all on the last night of Ramadan. This \n    is what the imams used to do in Makkah in the past.\n\n    2.When he remembers \n    the verse that he forgot, he should recite it [this applies if he is still \n    reciting in the prayer] and then resume his recitation until he has \n    finished. This was narrated from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him).\n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have \n    mercy on him) said, noting that the order in which it is prescribed to \n    recite is waived in the case of forgetting: \n\n    … if he forgets some of the verses of the \n    soorah when praying qiyaam in Ramadan (i.e., Taraaweeh), he should not \n    repeat it [the entire soorah] or repeat what comes after it, but if he \n    deliberately changes the order of the verses in the soorah and recites the \n    later ones before the earlier ones, that is not permissible according to \n    scholarly consensus. \n\n    Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) was \n    asked about the imam during the month of Ramadan omitting some verses from \n    the soorah: did he think that the one who was praying behind him should \n    recite them? \n\n    He said: Yes, he should do that. In Makkah \n    they used to appoint a man to write down what the imam forgot of verses and \n    so on, then on night of completion he would recite what he had omitted. \n\n    His companions -- such as Abu Muhammad (Ibn \n    Qudaamah) -- said: Rather that is mustahabb in order to complete the Qur'aan \n    and so as to attain a complete reward. The people of Makkah and Ahmad and \n    his companions thought that if the one who had omitted some verses recited \n    them later on when he remembered them, that was sufficient to be regarded as \n    having completed the Qur’aan and to attain the reward, even if that meant \n    the order of verses was not followed in this instance, because without \n    reciting these verses, his recitation of the soorah could not be regarded as \n    complete. This was narrated from ‘Ali: he forgot a verse from a soorah, then \n    whilst he was still reciting he recited it, then resumed his recitation from \n    where he had got to, and no one noticed that he had forgotten anything \n    except those who were Haafiz (i.e., had memorised the entire Qur'aan). \n\n    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, \n    21/410, 411. \n\n    And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the event that an imam forgets some verses of the Qur'an while leading the prayer, there are a few steps he can take to rectify the situation:\n\n1. **Completing the Recitation**: If the imam realizes his mistake before moving on to the next action in the prayer (such as bowing), he should try to recite the verses he skipped right away. This helps ensure that the recitation of the Qur'an is complete.\n\n2. **Sujood as-Sahw (Prostration of Forgetfulness)**: If the imam is unable to recite the missed verses before proceeding, he should still perform Sujood as-Sahw at the end of the prayer. This prostration is a way to compensate for mistakes made during the prayer.\n\n3. **Continuing the Prayer**: If the imam forgets and completes the prayer, he should end with Sujood as-Sahw as is customary for mistakes in the prayer.\n\n4. **Teaching and Learning**: It is encouraged for the imam to continuously study and review the Qur'an to reduce the likelihood of forgetting verses in the first place.\n\n5. **Respect and Responsibility**: The imam should approach this with a humble mindset, acknowledging that remembering every verse perfectly can be challenging, and that Allah is Most Merciful.\n\nOverall, the key point is that the imam aims to maintain the integrity of the prayer and the recitation to the best of his ability, and taking the right steps helps fulfill the requirement of completing the recitation of the Qur'an."

What is \n    meant is that he should ponder the meanings, because Allah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “(This is) a Book (the Qur’aan) which We have sent down to \n    you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men \n    of understanding may remember”\n\n    [Saad 38:29]. \n\n    The believer should ponder the meanings, i.e., he should pay \n    attention to reading and think about what it means; he should understand the \n    meanings and thus he will benefit from it. If he does not understand the \n    meaning perfectly, he will still understand many meanings. So let him read \n    carefully and ponder and understand. This also applies to women. The reader \n    should benefit from the words of his or her Lord and understand the meaning \n    so that he may act upon it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “Do they not then think deeply in the Qur’aan, or are \n    their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?”\n\n    [Muhammad 47:24]. \n\n    Our Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, urges and \n    encourages us to think and ponder His words. When the believer -- man or \n    woman -- reads the Book of Allah, it is prescribed for them to ponder and \n    think and pay attention to what is read, so that they may benefit from the \n    words of Allah and so that they may understand the words of Allah and so \n    that they may act upon what they learn from the words of Allah.

The common phrase for Isti’aadhah is \"A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim,\" which translates to \"I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed devil.\"\n\n2. **Basmalah**: This refers to the phrase \"Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim,\" meaning \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\" This phrase is generally recited at the beginning of actions, including reading from the Qur'an.\n\nWhen quoting from the middle of a Surah and then moving to another Surah, the correct practice is as follows:\n\n- When you begin reciting from the middle of one Surah, you should first recite the Isti’aadhah (i.e., \"A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim\") before you start reciting.\n  \n- After you finish that part of the Surah and before you move to the next Surah, it is recommended to recite the Basmalah (i.e., \"Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim\").\n\nIf you are reciting from a different Surah after finishing the first one, you would again say the Basmalah before beginning the new Surah. \n\nTo summarize:\n- Start with: A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim (for Isti’aadhah)\n- Recite the relevant Ayah(s)\n- Say: Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (before starting the next Surah)\n\nThis practice ensures respect and adherence to the etiquette of reciting the Qur'an."

        "question": "Is the Quran the Word of Allah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Praise be to Allah Who has made good dear to you; we ask Him to increase you in guidance and faith, and to guide your parents to practice Islam and adhere to its rulings. \nQuran is the word of Allah\nWith regard to the Quran and the proof that it is the word of Allah, these are specious arguments which were put forward out of stubbornness and arrogance by the first disbelievers to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent. Allah refuted what they said in many ways, proving their words to be false and pointing out what was wrong with it. For example: \n\nIn this Quran is a challenge from Allah to mankind and the jinn to produce anything like it, but they were unable to. Then He challenged them to produce only ten surahs like it, and they were unable to. Then He challenged them to produce something like the shortest surah in the Quran , and they could not do it, even though those who were being challenged were the most eloquent and well-spoken of mankind, and the Quran was revealed in their language. Yet despite that they stated that they were completely incapable of doing that. This challenge has remained down throughout history, but not one person has been able to produce anything like it. If this were the word of a human being, some people would have been able to produce something like it or close to it. There is a great deal of evidence for this challenge in the Quran, for example, the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n“Say: If mankind and the jinn were together to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.” [al-Isra 17:88]\nAllah says, challenging them to produce just ten surahs: \n“Or they say, He (Prophet Muhammad) forged it (the Quran). Say: Bring you then ten forged Surahs (chapters) like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the truth!” [Hud 11:13 interpretation of the meaning]\nAllah says, challenging them to produce just one surah: \n“And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Quran) to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.” [al-Baqarah 2:23 interpretation of the meaning]\n\nNo matter how much knowledge and understanding mankind attains, they will still inevitably make mistakes, forget things or fall short. If the Quran were not the word of Allah, there would be some contradictions and shortcomings in it, as Allah says: \n\n“Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein many a contradiction.” [al-Nisa 4:82 interpretation of the meaning]\nBut it is free from any shortcoming, error or contradiction; indeed, all of it is wisdom, mercy and justice. Whoever thinks that there is any contradiction in it, that is because of his diseased thinking and mistaken understanding; if he refers to the scholars they will explain to him what is correct and clear up the confusion for him, as Allah says: \n“Verily, those who disbelieved in the Reminder (i.e. the Quran) when it came to them (shall receive the punishment). And verily, it is an honourable well fortified respected Book (because it is Allah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption). Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah)” [Fussilat 41:41-42 interpretation of the meaning]\n\nAllah has guaranteed to preserve this Quran, and He says: \n\n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9 interpretation of the meaning]\nEvery letter of it was transmitted by thousands from thousands down throughout history, and not one letter of it was altered. If any person tried to alter anything in it, or add something or take something away, then he would be exposed straight away, because Allah is the One Who has guaranteed to preserve the Quran, unlike the case with other divinely-revealed Books which Allah revealed to the people of a particular Prophet only, and not to all of mankind, so He did not guarantee to preserve them, rather He delegated their preservation to the followers of the prophets. But they did not preserve them, rather they introduced alterations and changes which distorted most of the meanings. The Quran, on the other hand, was revealed by Allah to all of mankind until the end of time, because the Message of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the final message, so the Quran is preserved in men’s hearts and in written form, as is proven by the events of history. How many people have tried to change the verses of the Quran and deceive the Muslims, but they were quickly exposed and their falsehood was discovered, even by Muslim children. \nAnother of the definitive signs that this Quran was not produced by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) but that it came revealed by Allah to him is the following: \n\nThe great miracles which the Quran contains of legislation, rulings, stories and beliefs, which could not be produced by any created being no matter how great his intelligence and level of understanding. No matter how hard people try to promulgate laws to regulate their lives, they can never succeed so long as they are far away from the teachings of the Quran; the further away they are, the greater their rate of failure. This is something that has been proven by the disbelievers themselves.  \nReports of matters of the unseen, both past and future, which no human being could speak of independently, no matter how great his knowledge, especially at that time which is regarded as primitive in terms of technology and modern tools. There are many things which had not been discovered yet, and which have only been discovered after lengthy and difficult exploration with the most modern equipment, but Allah told us about them in the Quran, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned them, fifteen centuries ago, such as the stages of embryonic development, the nature of the oceans, etc. These things have made some kafirs state that this could only have come from God, as in the case of the development of the embryo: \n\nOnly 60 years ago, researchers confirmed that man does not come into existence all at once, but rather he passes through stages of development one after another. Only 60 years ago, science discovered this one Quranic fact. \nShaykh al-Zindani said, we met an American professor, one of the greatest American scientists, whose name was Professor Marshall Johnson, and we told him that it says in the Quran that man is created in stages. When he heard this, he was sitting down, but he stood up and said, Stages? We said, That was in the seventh century CE! This Book came and said, man was created in stages. He said, That is impossible, impossible We told him, Why do you say that? This Book says (interpretation of the meaning):  \n“He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation in three veils of darkness.” [al-Zumar 39:6] \nWhat is the matter with you, that [you fear not Allah (His punishment), and] you hope not for reward (from Allah or you believe not in His Oneness).\n“While He has created you in (different) stages.” [Nuh 71:14]\nThen he sat back down on his chair and after a few moments he said, There are only three possibilities. The first is that Muhammad had a huge microscope through which he managed to study these things and he knew things that the people did not know, and he said these things. The second is that this happened by accident, it was a coincidence. The third is that he was a Messenger from God. We said, With regard to the first idea, that he had a microscope and other equipment, you know that a microscope needs lenses, and lenses need glass and technical expertise and other equipment. Some of this information can only be discovered with an electron microscope which needs electricity, and electricity needs knowledge which should have been acquired by an earlier generation. It is not possible for this knowledge to have been acquired all at once in a single generation; the previous generation would have had to strive hard in developing science and transmitting it to the next generation, and so on. But for this to be the work of one man, with no one coming before him or after him, either in his own land or the neighbouring lands for the Romans, Persians and Arabs were ignorant and had no such equipment for one man to have all these instruments and tools which he did not pass on to anyone else this is not possible. He said, Thats right, it would be very difficult. We said, And for it to have been an accident or coincidence, what would you think if we said that the Quran did not mention this fact only in one verse but in several verses, and that it did not refer to it in general terms but that it gave details of every stage, saying that in the first stage such and such happens, in the second stage such and such happens, in the third stage and so on. Could that be a coincidence? When we explained to him all the details of those stages, he said, It is wrong to say that this is an accident! This is well-founded knowledge. We said, Then how do you explain it? He said, There is no explanation except that this is revelation from above!\nWith regard to the many statements in the Quran concerning the sea, some of these facts were not discovered until very recently, and many of them are still unknown. For example, these facts were discovered after hundreds of marine stations had been set up, and after images had been taken by satellites. The one who said this was Professor Schroeder, one of the greatest oceanographers in West Germany. He used to say that if science advanced, religion would have to retreat. But when he heard the translation of the verses of the Quran, he was stunned and said, These could not be the words of a human being.   And Professor Dorjaro, a professor of oceanography, told us of the latest developments on science, when he heard the verse: \n“Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed with waves topped by waves, topped by dark clouds, (layers of) darkness upon darkness: if a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And he for whom Allah has not appointed light, for him there is no light.” [al-Nur 24:40 interpretation of the meaning]\nHe said:\n“In the past, man could not dive to a depth of more than twenty meters because he had no special equipment. But now we can dive to the bottom of the ocean, using modern equipment, and we find intense darkness at a depth of two hundred meters. The ayah says a vast deep sea . The discoveries in the depths of the sea give us an understanding of the verse, (layers of) darkness upon darkness. It is known that there are seven colours in the spectrum, including red, yellow, blue, green, orange, etc. When we dive down into the depths of the ocean, these colours disappear one after another, and the disappearance of each colour results in more darkness. Red disappears first, then orange, then yellow and the last colour to disappear is blue, at a depth of two hundred meters. Each colour that disappears adds to the darkness until it reaches total darkness.  With regard to the phrase waves topped by waves, it has been proven scientifically that there is a separation between the upper and lower parts of the ocean, and that this separation is filled with waves, as if there are waves on the edge of the dark, lower portion of the sea, which we do not see, and there are waves on the shores of the sea, which we do see. So it is as if there are waves above waves. This is a confirmed scientific fact, hence Professor Dorjaro said concerning these Quranic verses, that this cannot be human knowledge.” (Al-Adillah al-Maddiyyah ‘ala Wujud-Allah by Muhammad Mutwalli al-Sha’rawi) \nAnd there are very many such examples \n\nIn the Quran there are some verses which rebuke the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and mention some things to which Allah drew his attention. Some of them may have been embarrassing for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). But if this Quran had come from the Messenger of Allah, there would have been no need for this; if he were to conceal any part of the Quran, he would have concealed some of these verses which contained rebukes or drew his attention to certain matters which he should not have done, such as the verse in which Allah says to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \n\n“But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., their saying that Muhammad married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him.” [al-Ahzab 33:37 interpretation of the meaning]\nAfter this, can there be any doubt left in the mind of any intelligent person that this Quran is the word of Allah, and that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) conveyed that which was revealed to him in full? \nMoreover, we tell this person, try it for yourself, read a sound translation of the Quran and use your mind to ponder these rules and regulations. There is no doubt that any intelligent person who has the power of discernment will see a great difference between these words (of Allah) and the words of any person on the face of the earth. \nMan-woman relationship in Islam\nWith regard to your relationship with this young man, this noble religion forbids women to mix with men for a great and wise reason. So you have to stop meeting him and break off your relationship with him until he becomes Muslim, in which case you can marry him in a proper Islamic marriage. In the answer to Question no. 1200 you will find an explanation of the rulings on a Muslim woman mixing with non-mahram men. \nWith regard to your love for him, this is a test from Allah: will you put your love of Allah before your love for one of His creation, or will you put your love for this person before the love of your Almighty Lord Who has forbidden such things. Note that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than that, the first of which is that you will find, in sha Allah, that Allah will compensate you with comfort and tranquility in loving Him and striving to draw closer to Allah by means of that which He loves; so your love for your Lord and your attachment to Him will increase, and  your attachment to all of His creation will become weaker. In the answer to Question no. 10254 you will find some solutions to this problem. \nCan Muslim women marry non-Muslim men?\nWith regard to the ruling on a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man , this is haram according to scholarly consensus, indeed it is one of the major immoral actions which Allah has forbidden in the Quran. In the answers to Questions no. 8396 and 1825 you will find a detailed response to this question. \nWe advise you to be patient and to put up with difficulties, and to keep far away from everything that may cause you to do things that would anger your Lord. Note that Allah has made this world a place of trial and testing for His believing slaves; whoever is patient and refrains from following his desries, seeking the pleasure of Allah, Allah will compensate him with Paradise where He will bestow upon him all kinds of delight which cannot be compared with the fleeting worldly pleasures that he sacrificed. This is in addition to the happiness and tranquility that he will find in his heart when he obeys his Lord. \nPerhaps if he sees how you adhere to your religion and avoid meeting him and sitting with him despite your love for him, he will come to realize the greatness of this religion which makes its followers prepared to sacrifice all that they love in order to please their Lord, and that they hope for a great reward from their Lord for their patience in obeying Him and keeping away from that which He has forbidden and perhaps that will be the cause of his becoming Muslim. \nWe ask Allah to guide him to Islam, and to make goodness easy for you, and to keep all evil away from you, Ameen.\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, in Islamic belief, the Quran is considered the Word of Allah (God). Muslims believe that the Quran is a divine revelation given to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Angel Gabriel (Jibril) over a period of approximately 23 years. It is regarded as the final and complete revelation in a series of messages from Allah to humanity, guiding all aspects of life. The Quran is revered as the primary source of Islamic theology, law, and morality."

        "question": "Commentary on the verse in which Allaah says: “Verily, Allaah will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allaah)” [al-Ra’d 13:11]",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    This is an important verse which indicates that Allaah, may \n    He be blessed and exalted, in His perfect justice and wisdom does not change \n    the condition of the people from good to bad or from bad to good, from ease \n    to hardship or from hardship to ease, unless they change their condition \n    themselves. So if they are in a state of righteousness and goodness and they \n    change, Allaah will change things for them with punishment, calamities, \n    hardship, drought, famine, disunity and other kinds of punishments as \n    appropriate requital. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And \n    your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves” [Fussilat 41:46]. \n\n    Or He may give them respite and give them time so that they \n    might truen to the right path, but if they do not then they will be seized \n    unexpectedly, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n    “So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been \n    reminded, We opened for them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in \n    the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, \n    We took them (in punishment), and lo! They were plunged into destruction \n    with deep regrets and sorrows” [al-An’aam 6:44]., \n    meaning despairing of all goodness -- we seek refuge in Allaah from the \n    punishment and wrath of Allaah. Or they may be given respite until the Day \n    of Resurrection, when their punishment will be more severe, as Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n    “Consider not that Allaah is unaware of that which the \n    Zâlimûn (polytheists, wrongdoers) do, but He gives them respite up to a Day \n    when the eyes will stare in horror”[Ibraaheem 14:42], \n    meaning that they are given respite until after death, and that will be a \n    greater and more severe punishment. \n\n    Or they may be in a state of evil and sin, then they repent \n    to Allaah and turn back to Him, and they regret their sins and adhere to \n    obedience, so Allaah changes their state of wretchedness, hardship and \n    poverty to ease, unity and righteousness because of their good deeds and \n    their repentance to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. It says in \n    another verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n    “That is so because Allaah will never change a grace which He has bestowed \n    on a people until they change what is in their ownselves” [al-Anfaal 8:53]. \n    This verse tells us that if they are in a state of ease, comfort and \n    goodness, then they change and turn to sin, their situation will be changed \n    -- there is no power and no strength except with Allaah -- or they may be \n    given respite, as stated above. The opposite is also true: if they were in a state of evil and sin, or disbelief and misguidance, then they repent, regret their sin and adhere to obedience to Allaah, Allaah will change their situation from bad to good; He will change their disunity into unity and harmony; He will change their hardship to ease, well being and plenty; He will change their situation from draught, famine, , lack of water and so on to rainfall, fertile land and other kinds of goodness.

        "predicted_answer": "The verse you have referenced, Surah Al-Ra'd (13:11), highlights an important principle in Islamic teaching regarding the dynamics of divine mercy and human responsibility. The verse states: \n\n“Verily, Allaah will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allaah).”\n\n**Commentary:**\n\n1. **Condition of a People**: The verse emphasizes that Allah takes into account the condition and state of a people—this encompasses their moral, spiritual, and ethical standing.\n\n2. **Divine Mercy and Human Responsibility**: The principle laid out here illustrates that Allah's mercy and blessings are contingent upon human actions. Allah does not arbitrarily change the circumstances of a people; rather, those changes are often a direct response to their own actions and choices. \n\n3. **Change From Goodness**: The phrase \"as long as they do not change their state\" suggests that if a people stray from the path of righteousness—through sinful actions or ingratitude—then they may lose the positive condition they previously enjoyed. This underscores the concept that an individual's or a community's behavior directly affects their fate and condition.\n\n4. **Sin and Disobedience**: The commentary points to the idea that engaging in sin and showing ingratitude can lead to a decline in the overall state of a community. This calls for self-reflection among individuals and communities regarding their actions and attitudes toward faith and obedience to Allah.\n\n5. **Call to Action**: The verse serves as a reminder and a call to maintain righteousness, gratitude, and obedience as essential for preserving a good condition and receiving divine blessings. It implies that change for the better starts with oneself, and communities must constantly strive to uphold ethical and moral values.\n\n6. **Hope for Redemption**: Although the verse mentions the consequences of ungratefulness and disobedience, it also inherently offers hope. If a people recognize their shortcomings and sincerely strive to return to the path of goodness and gratitude, Allah, in His infinite mercy, can restore their condition.\n\nIn summary, this verse serves as a critical reminder of the reciprocal relationship between human actions and divine response. It encourages believers to remain steadfast in righteousness and gratitude to maintain favorable conditions in their lives and communities."

The calamities and famines that Allaah decrees do not \n    harm anyone but those whose lives have ended and whose provision has ceased. \n    As for those who still have something left of their lives or provision, \n    Allaah brings their provision to them by many ways, which they may know or \n    may not know, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his \n    duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).\n\n    3. And He will provide him from (sources) \n    he never could imagine”\n\n    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]\n\n    “And so many a moving (living) creature \n    carries not its own provision!

        "predicted_answer": "The verse you mentioned, \"And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah\" (Surah Hud 11:6), conveys a profound and reassuring message regarding Allah's providence and sustenance for all of His creatures.\n\n### Commentary on the Verse:\n\n1. **Divine Sustenance**: The verse emphasizes that every living being, whether human, animal, or any other form of life, has its sustenance provided by Allah. This means that each creature, regardless of its size or status, is cared for and has its needs met by the Creator.\n\n2. **Reliance on Allah**: The verse serves as a reminder to rely on Allah for our needs. Just as He provides for all creatures, humans should place their trust in Him, understanding that their sustenance is already ordained. This encourages believers to have faith and assurance that Allah will provide for them and to seek their sustenance through lawful means.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Provision**: The term \"provision\" encompasses not only physical sustenance like food and water but also emotional and spiritual needs. Allah's provision is holistic, ensuring every aspect of a creature's existence is taken care of.\n\n4. **Reduces Anxiety**: Recognizing that Allah is the sustainer of all can help alleviate anxiety about one's livelihood. Believers are encouraged to work hard and seek means of earning provision, but they should also maintain faith in Allah's comprehensive knowledge and control over all affairs.\n\n5. **Encouragement for Compassion**: This verse also highlights the importance of being compassionate and kind to all living beings. Since Allah provides for all, we are reminded of our responsibility to treat all creatures with care and respect.\n\n6. **Tawhid (Monotheism)**: This verse reinforces the concept of Tawhid (the oneness of Allah), indicating that only Allah is responsible for the provisioning of all living beings. It fosters a sense of unity and dependence on the One who alone has the power to provide.\n\nIn summary, Surah Hud 11:6 reassures believers of Allah's all-encompassing care and provides a deep understanding of the nature of reliance on Him for sustenance. It encourages faith, responsibility, kindness, and a recognition of the unwavering provision from the Creator for every living being on earth."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    It was proven that the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and \n    peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “This Qur’aan has been revealed in seven \n    styles, so recite whichever is easiest.” And the scholars said: they are \n    close in meaning but different in wording. \n\n    When ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) heard of the \n    differences among the people and Hudhayfah (may Allaah be pleased with him) \n    came to him and said “Save the people,” he consulted the Companions who were \n    still alive at this time, such as ‘Ali, Talhah, al-Zubayr and others, and \n    they suggested compiling the Qur’aan in one style, so that the people would \n    not differ. So he compiled it (may Allaah be pleased with him), and he \n    formed a four-man committee for that task, headed by Zayd ibn Thaabit (may \n    Allaah be pleased with him).

During his caliphate, there was a growing concern about the variations in recitation and the different dialects in which the Qur'an was being read. To address this issue and to ensure a uniform and authentic text, ‘Uthman commissioned the compilation of the Qur'an into a single, standardized script.\n\nThis process involved collecting all the known revelations in their various forms, comparing them with the memories of the Companions who had preserved these verses, and deciding on a single version that represented the consensus of the Apostolic community. The famous companion Zayd ibn Thabit was put in charge of this task, along with other scribes.\n\nThe finalized text was then written in a script that was easy to read and understand, and it was produced in one style (known as \"harf\"), which means a particular script or dialect. ‘Uthman subsequently ordered that all other copies and versions of the Qur'an, which were in circulation, be burned or destroyed to prevent confusion and discord among the Muslim community.\n\nThis action effectively standardized the Qur'an and made it accessible to all Muslims, laying the foundation for how the Qur'an has been preserved and transmitted throughout generations. The copies of the Mushaf that were produced during ‘Uthman’s time became the reference point for all future copies and recitations of the Qur'an. \n\nThus, ‘Uthman’s compilation of the Mushaf addressed discrepancies and helped to unify the Muslim community around a single, authoritative text of the Qur'an."

        "question": "Prohibition on receiving payment for reading the Holy Qur’aan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Reading Qur’aan is an act of worship, pure and simple, an act \n    by means of which a person seeks to draw close to his Lord. The basic \n    principle concerning this and similar acts that are only worship is that the \n    Muslim does them seeking thereby the pleasure of Allaah and seeking the \n    reward that is with Him, and not to seek reward or appreciation from any \n    other person. Hence it was unknown among the righteous salaf to hire people \n    to read the Qur’aan for the dead or on weddings or at parties. There is no \n    report from any of the imams of Islam that they enjoined such a thing or \n    allowed it. Neither it is known that any of them accepted payment for \n    reading Qur’aan. Rather they would read it in the hope of attaining that \n    which is with Allaah, may He be glorified. The Prophet (blessings and peace \n    of Allaah be upon him) commanded the one who reads the Qur’aan to ask of \n    Allaah thereby, and he warned against seeking anything from people. \n    Al-Tirmidhi narrated in his Sunan from ‘Imraan ibn Husayn that he \n    passed by a reader who was reading the Qur'aan, then he asked (for \n    something). He said Inna Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon (verily to \n    Allaah we belong and to Him is our return -- said when faced with calamity), \n    and then he said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of \n    Allaah be upon him) say: “Whoever reads the Qur'aan, let him ask of Allaah \n    thereby, for there will come people who will read the Qur'aan and ask of \n    people thereby.” \n\n    As for accepting payment for teaching it, or performing \n    ruqyah in which the Qur’aan is recited, and other things in which the \n    benefit goes to someone other than the reader, the saheeh hadeeths indicate \n    that it is permissible, because of the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed who accepted a \n    flock of sheep as payment for performing ruqyah for the man who had been \n    stung by a scorpion, and he recited Soorat al-Faatihah for him as a ruqyah; \n    and the hadeeth of Sahl about when the Prophet (blessings and peace of \n    Allaah be upon him) gave a woman in marriage to a man in return for his \n    teaching her what he had memorised of the Qur'aan. So the one who accepts \n    payment just for reading or hires a group of people to read the Qur'aan is \n    going against the Sunnah and against what the righteous salaf (may Allaah be \n    pleased with them all) were agreed upon. \n\n    And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah sent \n    blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions. End \n    quote \n\n    Standing Committee For Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the general consensus among scholars is that receiving payment for reading the Holy Qur'an is a contested issue with varying opinions. Here are some key points regarding the topic:\n\n1. **Honoring the Qur'an**: The Qur'an is viewed as the literal word of Allah (God) and is highly revered in Islam. Therefore, it is generally encouraged to recite it for the sake of Allah and with the intention of gaining spiritual reward rather than for material gain.\n\n2. **Different Views**: Some scholars argue that it is permissible to receive payment for teaching the Qur'an, as long as the intention remains sincere and the teaching is done respectfully. This includes paying a teacher for their time or for developing teaching materials.\n\n3. **Prohibition on Commercializing**: However, many scholars discourage taking payment specifically for the act of reading or reciting the Qur'an, as it may lead to a commercialized view of something sacred. The idea is that the Qur'an should not be treated as a commodity.\n\n4. **Intentions Matter**: The intentions behind receiving payment can significantly influence the ruling. If someone receives payment while having no intention of directly profiting from the act of reciting, it may be viewed differently.\n\n5. **Local Practices**: Practices can vary widely depending on cultural and local contexts, and there may be differing opinions among different Islamic schools of thought.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are varying opinions among scholars regarding receiving payments for reading the Qur'an, it is generally advised to prioritize sincerity and the primary purpose of recitation, which is worship and seeking Allah's pleasure. Always consulting knowledgeable scholars or local religious authorities can provide guidance aligned with one's specific context."

        "question": "Ruling on going back to Soorat al-Faatihah and the first few verses of Soorat al-Baqarah after completing the Qur'aan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed \n    concerning the ruling on what many Qur'aan reciters do when completing the \n    Qur'aan, which is starting a new recitation, by going back to Soorat \n    al-Faatihah and reading it along with the first five verses of Soorat \n    al-Baqarah only. The difference of opinion is reflected in the two following \n    views: \nThe first view is: that \n    this is prescribed and is mustahabb. This is the view favoured by the \n    reciters and was stated by some of the scholars. They quoted a number of \n    things as evidence for this view, among which is the following: \n(i)\nthe hadeeth narrated from \n    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas, from Ubayy ibn Ka’b, from the Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him), which says that when he recited “Qul \n    A’oodhu bi Rabbi l-Naas”, he would start again with al-Faatihah, then he \n    would recite al-Baqarah up to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n    “and they are the successful” [al-Baqarah 2:5]. Then he would recite \n    du’aa’ al-khatmah (du’aa’ for completing the Qur’aan), then he would get \n    up. \nThis was narrated by \n    al-Daarimi, as attributed to him by al-Suyooti in al-Itqaan (1/295), \n    and he said it was narrated with a hasan isnaad. It was also narrated by \n    al-Haafiz Abu ‘Amr al-Daani and al-Haafiz Abu’l-A’la’ al-Hamadhaani, as \n    narrated from them by Ibn al-Jazari in al-Nashr (688-694), and by \n    al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali al-Jawhari in Fawaa’id Muntaqaah (2/29). They all \n    narrated it via one isnaad:\nAl-‘Abbaas ibn Ahmad \n    al-Barti, ‘Abd al-Wahhaab ibn Faleeh al-Makki narrated to us, ‘Abd al-Malik \n    ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Sha’wah narrated to us, from his maternal uncle Wahb ibn \n    Zam’ah ibn Saalih, from Zam’ah ibn Saalih, from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Katheer, \n    from Darbaas the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas, and from Mujaahid, from \n    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas, from Ubayy ibn Ka’b, from the Prophet (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him). \nShaykh al-Albaani (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nThis is a da’eef (weak) \n    isnaad, for two reasons: \nThe first is that it hinges \n    on Zam’ah ibn Saalih. Al-Dhahabi said in al-Kaashif: He was classed \n    as da’eef by Ahmad. Al-Haafiz said in al-Taqreeb: (he is) da’eef and \n    his hadeeth is maqroon according to Muslim.\nThe other reason is that \n    there is confusion concerning its isnaad for two reasons. The first is this \n    hadeeth quoted above from Darbaas and from Mujaahid, who are mentioned \n    together in the isnaad. \nThe second is from Darbaas \n    alone, and Mujaahid is not mentioned with him. Ibn al-Jazari quoted the \n    isnaads like this in al-Nashr (2/420-425). \nAccording to a version \n    narrated from Wahb ibn Zam’ah ibn Saalih, from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Katheer, from \n    Darbaas, from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas… in a marfoo’ report. No mention is \n    made in this isnaad of Zam’ah. \nHe said following that: a \n    ghareeb hadeeth, which we know only through this isnaad. Its isnaad is hasan \n    but al-Haafiz Abu’l-Shaykh al-Asbahaani and Abu Bakr al-Zaynabi narrated it \n    from Wahb from his father Zam’ah,… and this is the correct isnaad. \nI say: This suggestion is \n    correct, because it is what appears in most reports. On that basis there is \n    no way to class its isnaad as hasan, because it hinges on Zam’ah ibn Saalih \n    who is da’eef, as stated above. \nHow can it be hasan when it \n    includes Darbaas the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas, who is majhool – as Abu \n    Haatim said and was followed in that by al-Dhahabi and al-‘Asqallaani? Yes, \n    he was mentioned with Mujaahid in some reports, as in the version narrated \n    by al-Jawhari and others, but even if that is correct, the fault in it is \n    still the same, namely Zam’ah. And Allaah knows best. end quote. \nAl-Silsilah al-Da’eefah \n    (no. 6134). \n(ii)\nA marfoo’ hadeeth in which \n    it says: \nA man said: O Messenger of \n    Allaah, which deed is most beloved to Allaah? He said: The one who reaches \n    (the end) then keeps going. He said: Who is the one who reaches (the end) \n    then keep going? He said: The one who reads the Qur’aan from the beginning \n    to the end, then when he reaches the end he starts again from the beginning. \n     \nThis hadeeth was narrated \n    via two isnaads: \nThe first is muttasil: via \n    Saalih al-Murri, from Qataadah, from Zaraarah ibn Awfa, from Ibn ‘Abbaas. It \n    was narrated with this isnaad from Saalih al-Murri by al-Haytham ibn \n    al-Rabee’ – as quoted by al-Tirmidhi (no. 2948) – and by ‘Amr ibn ‘Aasim – \n    as quoted by al-Bazzaar (2/213) – and by ‘Aasim al-Kilaabi, ‘Amr ibn Marzooq \n    and Zayd ibn al-Habbaab in al-Mustadrak (1/757), and by Ibraaheem ibn \n    Abi Suwayd al-Dhaari’ – as quoted in Mu’jam al-Tabaraani (12/168). \nThe second is mursal, via \n    Saalih al-Murri, from Qataadah, from Zaraarah ibn Awfa, from the Prophet \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), without any mention of Ibn \n    ‘Abbaas. It was narrated from Saalih al-Murri with this isnaad by Muslim ibn \n    Ibraaheem, as quoted by al-Tirmidhi (no. 2948); Ishaaq ibn ‘Eesa, as quoted \n    by al-Daarimi (2/560); ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mu’aawiyah al-Jumahi – as quoted in\n    al-Nashr by Ibn al-Jazari (p. 699). Al-Tirmidhi regarded as more \n    correct the report of the one who narrated it as mursal, and said: This is a \n    ghareeb hadeeth; we do not know of it from the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas except \n    through this isnaad, and it is not qawiy (strong). This – meaning the mursal \n    report – in my view is more saheeh than the hadeeth of Nasr ibn ‘Ali from \n    al-Haytham ibn al-Rabee’. End quote. \nThere is a corroborating, \n    marfoo’ report in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah which was narrated by \n    al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak (1/758), in the isnaad of which there is \n    Miqdaam ibn Dawood who is da’eef al-hadeeth. See: Lisaan al-Mizaan \n    (6/84). There is another corroborating report from Zayd ibn Aslam from the \n    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which is mursal. Abu \n    ‘Amr al-Daani gives its isnaad in al-Nashr (p. 700). \nThis hadeeth was classed as \n    da’eef by a number of scholars, including its narrator Imam al-Tirmidhi, \n    al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar, as it says in al-Futoohaat al-Rabaaniyyah \n    (3/248) and Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (no. 1834). \n(iii)\nThe action of the righteous \n    salaf; this Sunnah was part of their traditions. \nIbn al-Jazari (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \nAl-Haafiz Abu ‘Amr also \n    narrated with a saheeh isnaad from al-A’mash, from Ibraaheem who said: When \n    they completed the Qur’aan, they regarded it as mustahabb to read a few \n    verses from the beginning. This is a clear statement of the validity of the \n    view favoured by the reciters and held by the salaf. End quote. \nAl-Nashr \n    (2/449, p. 703). \nAl-Haafiz Abu ‘Amr al-Daani \n    said: \nThe fact that Ibn Katheer – \n    meaning the famous reciter – did that is indicated in the narrated texts and \n    the reports are mawqoof and do not go back to the Messenger of Allaah (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him). There are many other reports narrated \n    from the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and those who come after them. End quote from\n    al-Nashr fi’l-Qiraa’at al-‘Ashar by Ibn al-Jazari (p. 688). \n(iv)\nThe fact that the Muslims \n    followed this Sunnah in all regions. \nIbn al-Jazari (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \nThis action was done in all \n    Muslim regions according to the recitation of Ibn Katheer and others, to \n    such an extent that there was hardly anyone who completed a reading of the \n    Qur’aan but he would immediately start another, whether he completed what he \n    started or not, and whether he intended to complete it or not. That became \n    part of the Sunnah of completing a reading of the Qur’aan among them, and \n    they describe the one who did that as “the one who reaches (the end) then \n    keeps going”, i.e., the one who reaches the end of the Qur’aan and then \n    starts again from the beginning. End quote. \nAl-Nashr \n    (p. 694). \nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said: \nIt is mustahabb when \n    finishing a complete reading, to start another one immediately after \n    completing it. This was regarded as mustahabb by the earlier and later \n    generations, and they quoted as evidence for it the hadeeth of Anas (may \n    Allaah be pleased with him). End quote. \nAl-Tibyaan fi Adaab \n    Hamalat al-Qur’aan (p. 110). \nAl-Suyooti (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) said: \nIt is Sunnah when \n    comp’leuting a reading of the Qur'aan to start another immediately after \n    completing it, because of the hadeeth of al-Tirmidhi and others... End \n    quote.  \nAl-Itqaan (1/295). See \n    also: Sunan al-Qurra’ wa Manaahij al-Mujawwideen (p. 227). \nThe second view is that it \n    is not allowed and is not mustahabb. This was stated by Imam Ahmad (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him). \nThe basis for this opinion \n    is that this action was not narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace \n    of Allaah be upon him). He would review the Qur'aan with Jibril once every \n    year, and he reviewed it with him twice in the year in which he died, and no \n    one has transmitted anything to us about this practice which is followed \n    today. \nIbn Qudaamah (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \nAbu Taalib said: I asked \n    Ahmad when he recited “Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi l-naas”, whether he recited \n    anything of al-Baqarah? He said no, and he did not regard it is mustahabb to \n    follow his completion of the Qur'aan with the recitation of anything. \n    Perhaps he had no verification of any saheeh report to indicate that. End \n    quote. \nAl-Mughni \n    (1/838). \nIt says in al-Furoo’ \n    (1/554): \nHe should not read \n    al-Faatihah and the first five verses of al-Baqarah. al-Aamidi said: meaning \n    before the supplication. And it was said that it is mustahabb. End quote. \nIbn Muflih said in \n    al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah (2/319): \nIf one finishes reciting \n    Soorat al-Naas, he should not add al-Faatihah and five verses of al-Baqarah. \n    He said in the commentary: Perhaps he did not have any proven saheeh report. \n    And it was said: it is permissible after the du’aa’, or it is mustahabb. \nAl-Qaadi said, after \n    mentioning the meaning of this report from the hadeeth of Anas which was \n    narrated by Ibn Abi Dawood – meaning the hadeeth which mentions “The one who \n    reaches (the end) then keeps going” –: The apparent meaning of this is that \n    this is mustahabb. The answer is that what is meant is to encourage repeated \n    reading of the entire Qur’aan, time after time. There is nothing in this to \n    indicate that the du’aa’ should not come immediately after completing the \n    Qur’aan. End quote. \nImam Ibn al-Qayyim (may \n    Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nSome of them understood \n    from this that every time one finishes reading the entire Qur’aan, he should \n    read the Opening of the Book (al-Faatihah) and three verses of Soorat \n    al-Baqarah, because he has reached the end then kept going by starting again \n    from the beginning. \nNone of the Sahaabah did \n    this, nor did the Taabi’een, and none of the imams regarded it as \n    mustahabb. \nThe hadeeth “The one who \n    reaches (the end) then keeps going” may mean either of two things. One is \n    that every time he reaches the end of a soorah or juz’, he keeps going and \n    moves on to the next; the second is that every time he completes the Qur’aan \n    he starts it again from the beginning. End quote. \nI’laam al-Muwaqqi’een \n    (4/306). \nThe second view is more \n    likely, based on the evidence, in sha Allaah, because there is no proven \n    evidence that such a thing is mustahabb, rather the apparent meaning of the \n    Sunnah indicates the opposite, as explained above. This view is favoured in \n    the answer to question no. 12032. \nBut we should note that \n    this issue, even though we have pointed out what we believe is more correct, \n    is a matter of ijtihaad, and it is not a definitive matter. If someone has \n    sound evidence that the salaf used to do that, or he believes that the \n    hadeeth narrated concerning it is saheeh, then he is not innovating or going \n    astray, rather he should not be denounced. \nSimilarly, those who follow \n    the view that we regard as more correct should not be denounced. Rather Imam \n    al-Jazari (may Allaah have mercy on him), who is one of those who say that \n    this is prescribed, says: \nWhatever the case, we do \n    not say that this is binding upon every reader, rather we say what our imam \n    Faaris ibn Ahmad and others said: Whoever does that has done well, and \n    whoever does not do it, there is no blame on him. End quote. \nAl-Nashr \n    (p. 704). \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, after completing the recitation of the entire Qur'an, it is permissible and even commendable to return to Soorat al-Faatihah and the early verses of Soorat al-Baqarah, or any part of the Qur'an, for additional recitation, reflection, and contemplation. \n\nThe Qur'an is the word of Allah and a source of guidance for Muslims, and reciting it repeatedly is encouraged, as it helps strengthen one's faith, understanding, and connection with Allah. There is no specific ruling that prohibits returning to any section of the Qur'an after completing it, and many scholars encourage continued recitation and memorization of the Qur'an throughout one's life. \n\nUltimately, the goal is to connect with the teachings of the Qur'an, and repeating Soorat al-Faatihah and the beginning of Soorat al-Baqarah after completing the Qur'an aligns well with that goal."

        "question": "The Quran and medicine",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nAllah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with a religion that covers all aspects of life, as Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left us and no bird flapped its wings in the sky except that he had taught us some knowledge about it. \n(Narrated by Ahmad, 20399. See Majma’ al-Zawaa’id, 8/263. al-Haythami said: it was narrated by al-Tabaraani and its men are the men of saheeh apart from Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Yazeed al-Muqri’ who is thiqah (trustworthy)). \nIslam came to meet the needs of people in all aspects of their lives.  \nSecondly: \nWhat is narrated in the Sunnah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) complements what is in the Quran. These two sources are the principal sources for Muslims. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that Allah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down a cure for it. \nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down a cure for it.” \nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 5678. \nThirdly: \nWhat the questioner has mentioned, that some Muslims say that many remedies were discovered through the Holy Quran, we say that this is somewhat exaggerated. \nThe Quran is not a book of medicine or geography or geology as some Muslims like to say to westerners. Rather it is a book of guidance for mankind and one of the greatest of its miracles is its eloquence and the ideas and concepts that it contains. This is the main aspect of its miraculous nature. Allah revealed it to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at a time when eloquence had reached great heights, so this book came to amaze those people and challenge them in their area of expertise, to prove to them that it was from Allah. \nThis is not strange, and it is nothing new in religion. The signs of Moosa (peace be upon him) – his stick and his hand – were of the kind that was prevalent during his time, which was magic (sihr). The signs of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) – raising the dead and healing the blind and lepers – were of the kind that his people were skilled in and that was widespread among them, which was medicine. \nHence we say that the greatest feature of the Quran is its eloquence. Scholars nowadays are still discovering new aspects of its eloquence through their study of its verses.  \nThis does not mean that there is no other miraculous aspects to the Quran. Rather in some verses Allah mentions things about the design of the human body, the stages of its creation and development, some natural phenomena, etc. \nBut with regard to cures for various diseases, as the questioner mentions, the Quran is a healing for the believers. This includes healing the heart (mental or spiritual disease) and physical healing. Allah mentions honey in the Quran and says that it is a healing for mankind. And He mentions the principle of preserving good health and guarding against sickness. So whoever says that the Quran says a lot about medicine in this regard is right, but whoever goes beyond that is exaggerating. Rather this is a kind of exaggeration coined by some Muslims. The Quran is not a book of medicine. There are some diseases that did not exist previously, so how could their cure come – according to what the questioner says – before they appeared? \nFourthly: \n(a)The following are some of the verses which indicate that the Quran is healing:\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe”\n[al-Isra’ 17:82]\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nAllah says “And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe”. The correct view is that the word min (translated here as “of”) serves to explain the nature of the Quran as a whole, not to refer to parts of it and not other parts.  \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Quran, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your hearts”\n[Yoonus 10:57]\nThe Quran is the complete healing for all mental, spiritual and physical diseases, all diseases of this world and the Hereafter. But not everyone is guided to use it for the purpose of healing. If the sick person uses the Quran for healing in the proper way, and applies it to his disease with sincerity, faith, complete acceptance and firm conviction, fulfilling all its conditions, then no disease can resist it. \nHow can disease resist the words of the Lord of heaven and earth which, if He had revealed it to the mountains they would have crumbled and if He had revealed it to the earth it would have broken it apart? There is no sickness, spiritual or physical, but in the Quran there is that which indicates its remedy, its cause and how to protect against it for those who are blessed with understanding of His Book. \nZaad al-Ma’aad, 4/352 \n(b)The Quran contains the treatment for hearts and souls, and as such it is a means of expelling all sicknesses from the body. In this regard the Quran is a healing and a remedy for many diseases.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWe and others have tried this on many occasions and we have seen that it works in ways that physical remedies do not. Indeed we now regard physical medicine as the doctors regard folk medicine. This is in accordance with the law of divine wisdom, not contrary to it, but the causes of healing are many and varied. When the heart is in contact with the Lord of the Worlds, the Creator of the disease and the remedy, the Controller of nature Who directs it as He wills, he has other remedies apart from the remedies that are sought by the heart that is far away from Him and that turns away from Him. It is known that when a person’s spirits are high and his body is in good shape, they cooperate in warding off disease and suppressing it, so if a person is in high spirits and physical good shape, finds comfort in being close to his Creator, loving Him, enjoying remembrance of Him (dhikr), devoting all his strength and power for His sake and focusing on Him, seeking His help, putting his trust in Him, how can anyone deny that this is the greatest medicine or that this spiritual power gives him the means to ward off pain and defeat it completely? No one would deny this but the most ignorant of people, those who are furthest away from Allah and the most hard-hearted and unaware of human nature. \nZaad al-Ma’aad 4/12 \n(c)In the Quran there is Soorat al-Faatihah which is a ruqyah to be recited as a prayer for healing.\nIt was narrated that Abu Sa’eed (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “A group of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out on a journey and traveled until they stopped in (the land of) one of the Arab tribes. They asked them for hospitality but they refused to welcome them. The chief of that tribe was stung by a scorpion and they tried everything but nothing helped them. Some of them said, ‘Why don’t you go to those people who are camped (near us), maybe you will find something with them.’ So they went to them and said, ‘O people, our chief has been stung by a scorpion and we have tried everything but nothing helped him. Can any of you do anything?’ One of them said, ‘Yes, by Allah, I will recite ruqyah for him, but by Allah we asked you for hospitality and you did not welcome us, so I will not recite ruqyah for you until you give us something in return.’ Then they agreed upon a flock of sheep.’ Then he went and spat drily and recited over him Al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen [Soorat al-Faatihah]. (The chief) got up as if he was released from a chain and started walking, and there were no signs of sickness on him. They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e. the companions) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who performed the ruqyah said, ‘Do not divide them until we go to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him what happened, then wait and see what he tells us to do.’ So they went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, ‘How did you know that it (al-Faatihah) is a ruqyah?’ Then he added, ‘You have done the right thing. Share out (the flock of sheep) and give me a share too.’ And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled.”   \nNarrated by al-Bukhaari, 2156; Muslim, 2201 \nIbn al-Qayyim said concerning Soorat al-Faatihah:  \nWhoever is guided by Allah and is given good insight to understand the deep meaning of this soorah and what it contains of Tawheed, understanding of the Divine nature, the names, attributes and actions of Allah, the Divine decree, the Resurrection, rejecting any misconception that undermines the concept of the Oneness of the Divine Lordship and Divine nature, complete trust in Allah and referring all one’s affairs to the One Who has full control of all things – to Him be all praise, for all goodness is in His hand and to Him all things return – and feeling in need of Him in seeking guidance that is the root of happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, will realize the connection between the contents of this soorah and bringing good and warding off evil. He will understand that ultimate goodness and blessing is connected to this soorah and is dependent upon understanding it and acting upon it. Then this soorah will make him independent of many other kinds of medicine and ruqyah, and it will open the door to a great deal of goodness and ward off a great deal of evil. \nZaad al-Ma’aad, 4/347 \n(d)The Quran mentions the principle of maintaining good health.\nIbn al-Qayyim said: \nThe basic principles of medicine are three: prevention, maintaining good health, and removing harmful substances from the body. \nAllah has mentioned them all together, to His Prophet and his ummah in three places in His Book. \nHe prevented the sick person from using water lest it harm him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum)”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:43]\nAllah allowed the sick person to do tayammum to protect him, just as He permitted it to the one who has no water. \nAllah says concerning the maintenance of good health: \n“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days”\n[al-Baqarah 2:185]\nThe traveller is allowed to break his fast during Ramadaan, to protect his health lest the combination of fasting and the difficulties of travel weakens him and affects his health. \nAnd Allah said concerning the removal of harmful things by shaving the head of the person in ihraam (for Hajj or ‘Umrah): \n“And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Sawm (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity — feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)”\n[al-Baqarah 2:196]\nSo if a person has an ailment in his scalp when he is in ihraam, he is permitted to shave his head and remove the harmful thing or the bad substance that is causing lice to develop – as happened to Ka’b ibn ‘Ajrah – or if it is causing sickness to develop. \nThese three matters are the basic principles of medicine. We have mentioned an example of each one in order to point out the blessing of Allah to His slaves in preventing sickness, protecting their health and removing harmful substances from them, as a mercy and kindness towards His slaves, for He is the Most Kind, Most Merciful. \nZaad al-Ma’aad, 1/164, 165 \nIbn al-Qayyim said: On one occasion I discussed this with one of the chief doctors of Egypt, and he said: By Allah if I had to travel to the west to obtain these benefits that would not be too much – or words to that effect. \nIghaathat al-Lahfaan, 1/25 \n(e)Mention of honey in the Quran, and that it is a healing for mankind.\n Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“There comes forth from their [bees’] bellies, a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men”\n[al-Nahl 16:69]\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \nWith regard to the Prophet’s guidance concerning drinking, it is the most perfect guidance that maintains good health. He used to drink honey mixed with cold water. This is very healthy and no one can understand how healthy it is except the most prominent doctors. For drinking honey on an empty stomach dissolves phlegm, cleanses the stomach, reduces its viscosity, washes away waste matter, warms it up a little and opens its inlet and exit. It has a similar effect on the liver, kidneys and urethra. It is more beneficial to the stomach than any other kind of sweet that enters it. However it may cause side effects in people who are suffering from jaundice because it is hot and jaundice is hot, so it may aggravate it; in order to avoid this effect vinegar may be added, then honey will become beneficial and drinking it will be more useful than many or most of the drinks that are made from sugar, especially for those who are not used to these drinks, for if they drink them they will not suit them as well as honey does, or even come close.  \nWith regard to drinking it when it is collected and well-prepared, this is one of the most beneficial things for the body, and one of the greatest means of preserving health; it is very refreshing and energizing, and it is good for the liver and heart. If it is well-prepared it provides nutrition and makes food reach all parts of the body in the most effective manner. \nZaad al-Ma’aad, 4/224, 225 \nAnd he said (may Allah have mercy on him): \nHoney contains great benefits, for it cleanses impurities from the veins and stomach etc, whether it is eaten or applied to the skin. It is good for the elderly, the phlegmatic and those whose humours are cold and wet. It is nourishing, aids digestion, energizes, makes unpleasant medicine palatable, is good for the liver and chest, is a diuretic and helps to ease coughs caused by phlegm. If it is drunk warm mixed with rosewater it is beneficial for one who has been bitten by a scorpion or who has consumed opium. If it is drunk on its own mixed with water, it is good for the one who has been bitten by a rabid dog or eaten poisonous mushrooms. If fresh meat is placed in honey, it will stay fresh for three months, as will cucumbers, pumpkins and eggplants. Many fruits can be kept in it for six months. It will also preserve a dead body, and it is known as the trustworthy preserver. If the body of one who is afflicted with lice is painted with honey, it will kill the lice and their eggs. It makes the hair long, beautiful and smooth. If used on the eyes like kohl it clears the vision. If the teeth are brushed with it, it whitens the teeth and makes them bright, and keeps the gums healthy. It opens the veins and induces menstruation. If taken on an empty stomach it takes away phlegm and cleanses the stomach, clearing away waste matter and restoring the correct temperature. It does likewise to the liver, kidneys and urethra.\n As well as all this, it has no side effects and causes little harm. It may cause side effects in one who is suffering from jaundice, but that may be counteracted by vinegar and the like, in which case it becomes very beneficial for him.\n It is a kind of nourishment, a kind of medicine, a kind of drink, a kind of sweet, a kind of cream. There is nothing that has been created for us for a similar purpose that is better than it, or even comes close. The ancient peoples relied on it, and in most of the books of the ancients there is no mention of sugar at all and it was unknown to them, for it is something that is very new. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to drink honey mixed with water on an empty stomach, and this is the secret of maintaining good health that no one can understand except one who is intelligent and blessed.\nZaad al-Ma’aad, 4/33, 34.",
        "predicted_answer": "The relationship between the Quran and medicine is multifaceted and profound. Here are some key points that illustrate this connection:\n\n1. **Holistic Approach**: The Quran emphasizes the importance of both physical and spiritual health. It encourages a balanced lifestyle that includes proper diet, hygiene, and moral conduct, which are essential for overall well-being.\n\n2. **Seeking Knowledge**: The Quran advocates for the pursuit of knowledge, including medical knowledge. Verses such as \"And say, 'My Lord, increase me in knowledge.'\" (Quran 20:114) highlight the importance of learning and education, which includes the field of medicine.\n\n3. **Health Guidelines**: Although the Quran does not provide specific medical prescriptions, it offers guidelines that can lead to better health, such as dietary laws (e.g., halal and haram) and the importance of cleanliness and personal hygiene (e.g., the practice of Wudu).\n\n4. **Spiritual Healing**: Many Muslims believe in the power of prayer (Dua) and recitation of Quranic verses for spiritual healing and support during illness. The Quran includes verses that are often recited for protection and healing.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: Throughout Islamic history, scholars have integrated Islamic teachings with medical knowledge. Prominent figures, such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), were influenced by Islamic principles in their work and contributed significantly to both Islamic and Western medicine.\n\n6. **Ethics in Medicine**: The Quran lays the foundation for ethical practices in medicine. Principles of beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), and justice in healthcare can be derived from Islamic teachings.\n\n7. **Modern Interpretations**: In contemporary discussions, Islamic scholars and medical professionals continue to explore the ethical implications of modern medicine through the lens of Islamic teachings, addressing issues such as bioethics, reproductive health, and end-of-life care.\n\nIn summary, the Quran informs various aspects of health and medicine through its teachings, promoting a holistic approach to health that encompasses physical, mental, and spiritual well-being."

        "question": "Can We Read Quran While Lying Down?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with reading the Quran from the Mus-haf whilst lying down.  \nAl-Bukhari (7549) and Muslim (301) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to lie in ‘Aishah’s lap and recite Quran. \nAl-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Sahهh Muslim: \n“This indicates that it is permissible to read Quran when reclining and lying down.” \nShaykh Salih al-Fawzan said: \n“There is nothing wrong with reading the Quran when lying down, whether one is lying on a bed or on the ground. There is nothing wrong with that. A person may recite Quran whatever position he is in, standing or sitting or reclining, and whether he has wudu or is in a state of minor impurity, if he is reciting from memory. But if he is reading from the Mus-haf, then it is not permissible for the one who does not have wudu to touch the Mus-haf unless he has done wudu.” (Al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan)\nFor more information about the issues related to lying down and sitting, please see these answers: 294088 , and 13822 . \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is generally permissible to read the Quran while lying down; however, there are some considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Respect and Reverence**: The Quran is the holy book of Islam and should be approached with respect. Reading while in a reclining position may not convey the appropriate level of reverence. It is preferable to read while sitting upright or in a position that reflects your respect for the words of Allah.\n\n2. **Focus and Attention**: When lying down, it might be harder to maintain focus and attention on the text. It is encouraged to read the Quran in a manner that allows for complete concentration and contemplation.\n\n3. **Physical Cleanliness**: Make sure that you are in a state of physical cleanliness (performing wudu before reading) unless actively reciting from memory.\n\nIn summary, while it is not strictly prohibited to read the Quran while lying down, it is advisable to do so in a way that promotes respect, focus, and an appropriate attitude toward the sacred text."

        "question": "Quoting a verse of Qur’aan as a proverb",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    There is nothing wrong with quoting Qur’aanic verses as \n    proverbs, if that is for a valid purpose, such as saying This is something \n    that “will neither nourish nor avail against hunger” or saying \n    “Thereof (the earth) We created you, and into it We shall return you, and \n    from it We shall bring you out once again”, if one wants to remind \n    people of their relationship with the earth, from which they were created \n    and to which they will return. If quoting Qur’aan as a proverb is not \n    intended by way of mockery and making fun, there is nothing wrong with it. \n    But if it is done by way of mockery and making fun, as the questioner \n    mentions, then this is regarded as apostasy from Islam, because the one who \n    makes fun of the Qur’aan or of any mention of Allaah, may He be glorified \n    and exalted, has apostatized from Islam, as Allaah says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \n\n    “Say: “Was it at Allaah ( \n    عز و جل \n    ), and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, \n    etc.) and His Messenger (صلى \n    الله عليه وسلم) that you were mocking?”\n\n    66. Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had \n    believed”\n\n    [al-Tawbah 9:65-66]\n\n    It is essential to venerate and respect the Qur’aan, but that does not mean that one cannot quote it as a proverb in a proper and respectful manner. There is nothing wrong with that, but using it by way of mockery and making fun is apostasy from Islam. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, it is common to quote verses from the Qur'an to convey moral lessons, wisdom, or guidance. However, using a verse from the Qur'an as a proverb should be done with caution and respect for the text, ensuring that the meaning is understood correctly in context. \n\nFor example, one might quote the verse:\n\n**\"Indeed, with hardship [comes] ease.\"** (Qur'an 94:6)\n\nThis verse can be referenced as a proverb to illustrate the idea that after difficult times, relief and ease will follow, conveying a message of hope and resilience.\n\nIt is important to ensure that any citation is not taken out of context and that it aligns with the overall teachings of Islam. Always consider the message and intent behind the quotation to ensure it is appropriate."

        "question": "The revelation of the Quran in seven styles (ahruf, sing. harf)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly :\nyou should note, may Allah bless you, that the Quran was revealed in one style at the beginning, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kept asking Jibreel until he taught him seven styles, all of which were complete. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas who narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibreel taught me one style and I reviewed it until he taught me more, and I kept asking him for more and he gave me more until finally there were seven styles.”\n(narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3047; Muslim, 819) \nSecondly, what is meant by styles (ahruf, sing. harf)? \nThe best of the scholarly opinions concerning what is meant is that there are seven ways of reciting the Quran, where the wording may differ but the meaning is the same; if there is a different meaning then it is by way of variations on a theme, not opposing and contradiction. \nThirdly: \nSome of the scholars said that what was meant by ahruf was the dialects of the Arabs, but this is far-fetched, because of the hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab who said: “I heard Hishaam ibn Hakeem reciting Soorat al-Furqaan in a manner different from that in which I used to recite it and the way in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me to recite it.  I was about to argue with him whilst he was praying, but I waited until he finished his prayer, and then I tied his garment around his neck and seized him by it and brought him to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I heard this man reciting Soorat-al-Furqaan in a way different to the way you taught it to me.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, ‘Recite it,’ and he recited it as I had heard him recite it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘It was revealed like this.’ Then he said to me, ‘Recite it,’ so I recited it and he said, ‘It was revealed like this.’ This Qur'aan has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way that is easiest for you.’”\n(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2287; Muslim, 818) \nIt is known that Hishaam was Asadi Qurashi (i.e., from the clan of Bani Asad in Quraysh) and ‘Umar was ‘Adawi Qurashi (i.e., from the clan of Bani ‘Adiyy in Quraysh). Both of them were from Quraysh and Quraysh had only one dialect. If the difference in ahruf (styles) had been a difference in dialects, why would two men of Quraysh have been different? \nThe scholars mentioned nearly forty different opinions concerning this matter! Perhaps the most correct is that which we have mentioned above. And Allah knows best. \nFourthly: \nIt seems that the seven styles were revealed with different wordings, as indicated by the hadeeth of ‘Umar, because ‘Umar’s objection was to the style, not the meaning. The differences between these styles are not the matter of contradiction and opposition, rather they are synonymous, as Ibn Mas’ood said: “It is like one of you saying halumma, aqbil or ta’aal (all different ways of saying ‘Come here’).” \nFifthly: \nWith regard to the seven recitations (al-qiraa’aat al-saba’), this number is not based on the Quran and Sunnah, rather it is the ijtihaad of Ibn Mujaahid (may Allah have mercy on him). People thought that al-ahruf al-saba’ (the seven styles) were al-qiraa’aat al-saba’ (the seven recitations) because they happened to be the same number. But this number may have come about coincidentally, or it may have been done deliberately by Ibn Mujaahid to match what was narrated about the number of styles (ahruf) being seven. Some people thought that the styles (ahruf) were the recitations, but this is a mistake. No such comment is known among the scholars. The seven recitations are one of the seven styles, and this is the style that ‘Uthmaan chose for all the Muslims.  \nSixthly: \nWhen ‘Uthmaan made copies of the Quran, he did so according to one style (harf), but he omitted the dots and vowel points so that some other styles could also be accommodated.  So the Mus-haf that was copied in his time could be read according to other styles, and whatever styles were accommodated by the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan remained in use, and the styles that could not be accommodated fell into disuse. The people had started to criticize one another for reciting differently, so ‘Uthmaan united them by giving them one style of the Quran. \nSeventhly: \nYour saying that Mujaahid’s different recitations meant the seven styles (ahruf) is not correct, as was said by Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah. (Majmoo’ah al-Fatawa, vol. 13, p. 210) \nEighthly: \nThe seven readers or reciters were: \n1-Naafi’ al-Madani\n2-Ibn Katheer al-Makki\n3-‘Aasim al-Kufi\n4-Hamzah al-Zayaat al-Kufi\n5-Al-Kisaa’i al-Kufi\n6-Abu ‘Amr ibn al-‘Ala’ al-Basri\n7-‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Aamir al-Shaami\nThe ones who have the strongest isnaad in recitation are Naafi’ and ‘Aasim. \nThe most eloquent are Abu ‘Amr and al-Kisaa’i. \nWarsh and Qaaloon narrated from Naafi’.\nHafs and Shu’bah narrated from ‘Aasim. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, the Quran is considered to have been revealed in seven styles (ahruf, sing. harf). This concept is mentioned in hadith literature, where it is understood that the Quran was revealed in various modes or dialects to accommodate the linguistic diversity of the Arab tribes at the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nThese seven styles can refer to differences in pronunciation, vowelization, and even variations in word choice. The purpose behind this revelation in multiple styles was to make the Quran accessible and understandable to the various tribes and people, each with their unique dialects and linguistic nuances.\n\nHowever, the exact nature and specifics of these seven styles have been the subject of scholarly discussion and interpretation throughout Islamic history. Not all scholars agree on the details of how these styles differ. Some understand them as differences in recitation (qira'at), while others see them more in terms of meanings or lexical variations.\n\nIn practical terms, Muslims are encouraged to recite the Quran in a manner that is consistent with the accepted recitations, which preserves the original message and meaning of the text. The idea of the seven ahruf emphasizes the flexibility and accessibility of the Quran to a wide audience, highlighting its divine nature and relevance across different cultures and languages.\n\nIf you have further inquiries or specific aspects you want to delve into, feel free to ask!"

        "predicted_answer": "Musaajalah, in the context you mentioned, refers to a game where participants take turns reciting Quranic verses that start with the last letter or last word of the previous verse. Generally, scholars have differing views on engaging in such activities.\n\n1. **Scholarly Opinion**: Many scholars advise caution regarding such games. The primary concern is that the Quran should be treated with utmost respect and reverence. The concern is that turning the recitation of the Quran into a game may lead to an informal attitude toward its recitation and meaning.\n\n2. **Permissibility**: Some scholars argue that if the activity is done with sincere intent, without mockery, and with a clear emphasis on learning and remembering the verses, it can be considered permissible.

        "question": "What is the secret of the number 7 and its multiples in the Holy Qur’aan and Sunnah?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly the Qur’aan is \n    miraculous, and there are many facets to its miraculous nature, such as \n    linguistic, legislative, and so on. Its challenge to mankind and the jinn to \n    produce something similar to it still stands. Allaah says (interpretation of \n    the meaning): \n“Say: If the mankind and \n    the jinn were together to produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not \n    produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another”\n[al-Isra’ 17:88]. \nIbn al-Qayyim discussed the \n    number 7 in his book Zaad al-Ma’aad fi Huda Khayr al-‘Ibaad (4/90) \n    when he discussed the hadeeth in al-Saheehayn: “The one who eats seven dates \n    of al-‘Aaliyah in the morning will not be harmed that day by poison or \n    witchcraft.” He said: As for specifying the number seven, it has to do with \n    the creation and sahr’i commands of Allaah. Allaah created seven heavens, \n    seven earths and seven days, and man’s creation is completed in seven \n    stages; Allaah has prescribed that His slaves should walk around the Ka’bah \n    seven times (tawaaf) and go back and forth between Safa and Marwah seven \n    times (saa’i), and stone the jamaraat with seven pebbles each, and the \n    takbeeraat of Eid are seven in the first rak’ah. The Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Instruct your children to pray when \n    they are seven.” When the boy reaches the age of seven he should be given \n    the choice between his parents according to one report, and according to \n    another report, his father has more right to him than his mother; according \n    to a third report his mother has more right to him. When he was sick, the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered that water \n    from seven skins be poured on him. Allaah sent the wind against the people \n    of ‘Aad for seven days. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) asked Allaah to help him by sending upon his people seven (years) \n    like the seven years of Yoosuf – i.e., seven years of famine. Allaah likened \n    the reward of one who gives charity to a grain that produces seven ears, in \n    each of which are one hundred grains. The number of ears of grain seen by \n    the companion of Yoosuf (in the dream) was seven, the number of years for \n    which they were cultivated was seven, and (the reward for charity) is \n    multiplied seven hundred fold or more. Seventy thousand of this ummah will \n    be admitted to Paradise without being brought to account. \nThen Ibn al-Qayyim \n    commented: Undoubtedly this number has some special qualities that are not \n    shared by other numbers. … Allaah knows best about His wisdom, laws and \n    decree in singling out this number. End quote.  \nBased on this, the correct \n    view is to refrain from indulging in discussion of the reason why this \n    number is singled out for mention, except on the basis of clear, sound \n    evidence. \nFor more information please \n    see the answer to question no. 69741. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic tradition, the number seven and its multiples hold significant spiritual and symbolic importance. While the Qur'an and Sunnah do not explicitly outline a comprehensive \"secret\" of the number seven, several references highlight its significance in various contexts:\n\n1. **Creation**: The Qur'an mentions that Allah created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself on the Throne, which is sometimes interpreted to imply a completion with the seventh day.\n\n2. **The Seven Heavens**: The Qur'an refers to the creation of seven heavens. This is mentioned in Surah Al-Mulk (67:3), emphasizing the grandeur and complexity of Allah's creation.\n\n3. **The Seven Earths**: Similarly, there are references in various hadiths indicating the existence of seven earths, which underscores a cosmic balance.\n\n4. **The Seven Verses**: Surah Al-Fatiha, the opening chapter of the Qur'an, is referred to as \"the seven oft-repeated verses\" (Qur'an 15:87). This underscores the significance of this chapter, which is recited in every unit of prayer.\n\n5. **Tawaf**: During Hajj, pilgrims perform Tawaf around the Kaaba, circling it seven times, symbolizing both completeness and the unity of Muslims in worship.\n\n6. **Stoning the Devil**: During the rituals of Hajj, the act of stoning the Jamra involves throwing seven pebbles, which symbolizes the rejection of evil.\n\n7. **Seven Types of People**: In a hadith narrated by Abu Huraira, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) mentions seven categories of people who will be shaded under Allah's throne on the Day of Judgment.\n\n8. **Multiples of Seven**: The use of multiples of seven also appears in Islamic teachings, such as in the narrations and prayers that may be recited in groups of seven or multiples thereof.\n\nIn Islamic thought, the recurrence of the number seven can be interpreted as an indication of divine order and balance, and it often signifies completeness and perfection in various aspects of religious practice.\n\nWhile the number seven holds this importance, it is essential to approach these interpretations with the understanding that they are part of a broader theological and spiritual framework within Islam."

        "question": "Meaning of ‘Qul Huwallahu Ahad’ Being Equivalent to One-Third of the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Hadiths about Qul Huwallahu Ahad being one-third of the Quran\nThere follow some of the ahadith narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which state that Surat al-Ikhlas (Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad) is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.\n Al-Bukhari (6643) narrated from Abu Sa’id that a man heard another man reciting Qul Huwallahu Ahad and repeating it. The next morning he came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him about that. The man thought that it was too little, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.”\nMuslim (811) narrated from Abu’l-Darda that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Is any one of you unable to recite one-third of the Quran in one night?” They said, “How could anyone read one-third of the Quran?” He said, “Qul Huwallahu Ahad is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.”\n Muslim (812) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Gather together, for I will recite to you one-third of the Quran.” So those who could gather together gathered there, then the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out and recited Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad, then he went in. They said to one another, perhaps there has been some news from heaven on account of which he has gone inside (the house). Then the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out and said, “I told you that I was going to recite to you one-third of the Quran. Verily it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.” \nThe bounty of Allah is immense \nThe bounty of Allah is immense, and Allah has bestowed His bounty upon this ummah and has made up for its short life span by giving it more reward for simple deeds. It is strange that with some people, instead of this motivating them to do more good, this makes them apathetic and lazy in doing acts of worship, or they feel that this bounty and reward is strange and farfetched.\nHow Qul Huwallahu Ahad  is equivalent to one-third of the Quran\nThere is a difference between jaza (reward) and ijza (what is sufficient). What is making the brother confused is that he does not see the difference between them.\n Jaza means the reward which Allah gives for obeying Him.\n Ijza means what is sufficient and takes the place of something else.\nReciting Qul Huwallahu Ahad brings a reward equivalent to reciting one-third of the Quran, but it does not take the place of reading one-third of the Quran.\n If a person vows – for example – to read one-third of the Quran, it is not sufficient for him to read Qul Huwallahu Ahad, because it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran in reward, but not in terms of being sufficient or taking the place of reading one-third of the Quran.\n The same may be said of reciting it three times. If a person recites it three times in his prayer,  that does not mean that he does not have to recite al-Fatihah, even though he will be given the reward of reciting the whole Quran.\n A similar example is the reward given by the Lawgiver to one who offers a single prayer in the Sanctuary of Makkah, and that he will have the reward of one hundred thousand prayers. Does anyone take this divine bounty to mean that he does not have to pray for decades because he offered a single prayer in the Haram that is equivalent to one hundred thousand prayers?\n Rather this has to do with reward; as for what is sufficient, that is another matter altogether.\n Moreover, none of the scholars has ever said that there is no need for us to read the Quran or that Qul Huwallah Ahad is sufficient and takes the place of that. \nWhy Qul Huwallahu Ahad  is equivalent to one-third of the Quran \nThe correct scholarly view is that this surah has this great virtue because the Quran deals with three topics: one-third for rulings, one-third for promises and warnings, and one-third for the Divine names and attributes.\n This surah combines names and attributes.\n This is the view of Abu’l-‘Abbas ibn Surayj, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah stated that it was good in Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 17/103.\n The Muslim cannot do without the two other issues, which are the rulings and the promises and warnings. His knowledge cannot be complete unless he looks at the Book of Allah as a whole. The one who stops at Surat al-Ikhlas cannot know the other two matters.\n Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah – may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n\"Rewards are of different types, just as wealth is of different types, such as food, drink, clothing, houses, money and so on. If a man possesses one type of wealth, to the value of one thousand dinars, that does not mean that he can do without the other types. Rather if he has wealth in the form of food, he also needs clothing and a place to live, etc. Similarly if it is a type other than money, he still needs other things. If he has nothing but money, he will need all kinds of wealth that are usually needed. In al-Fatihah there are the benefits of praise and du’a which people need, and Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad cannot replace it in that sense. Although its reward is very great, he cannot benefit from it unless he also recites the Opening of the Book (al-Fatihah) in his prayer. Hence if a person recites only Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad in his prayer, without al-Fatihah, his prayer is not valid. Even if he recited the whole of the Quran without al-Fatihah, his prayer would not be valid, because al-Faatihah refers to the basic needs that people cannot do without.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 17/131)\n And he said:\n“The people need the commands, prohibitions and stories that are in the Quran, even though Tawhid is greater than that. Man needs to know what he is enjoined to do and what he is forbidden to do; he needs to know what is enjoined upon him and the stories and promises and rewards. These cannot be replaced by anything else, and Tawhid cannot be replaced by these. The stories cannot take the place of the commands and prohibitions, and the commands and prohibitions cannot take the place of the stories. Rather everything that was sent down by Allah is beneficial and people need it.\n If a person recites Qul Huwallahu Ahad, he earns a reward equivalent to the reward of one-third of the Quran, but that does not mean that the reward is of the same kind as that earned by reading the rest of the Quran. Rather he may need the kind of reward that comes from reading the commands and prohibitions and stories, so Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad cannot take the place of all that.”  \nAnd he said:\n“The knowledge that is to be gained by reading the rest of the Quran cannot be gained by reciting this surah only. So whoever reads the whole Quran is better than one who simply recites this surah three times in the sense that he earns different kinds of reward, even though the one who recites Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad earns a reward equivalent to that reward, but it is of one type and does not include all the types that a person needs. This is like a man who has three thousand dinars and another who has food, clothing, accommodation and money equivalent to three thousand dinars.  The latter has that which will benefit him in all his affairs, whereas the former needs what the latter has, even though what he has is equivalent in value. Similarly, if he has the finest food, equivalent to three thousand dinars in value, he still needs clothing and accommodation, and weapons and tools that will ward off harm from him, and the like, which cannot be done with food alone.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 17/137-139)\n And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The phrase \"Qul Huwallahu Ahad\" is the opening verse of Surah Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112) of the Quran and translates to \"Say, He is Allah, the One.\" This Surah emphasizes the concept of monotheism (Tawheed) in Islam, affirming the oneness and uniqueness of Allah.\n\nThe statement that \"Qul Huwallahu Ahad\" is equivalent to one-third of the Quran is derived from a Hadith (saying of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) which highlights the significance of this short Surah. In one narration, the Prophet (pbuh) mentioned that reciting Al-Ikhlas is akin to reciting one-third of the Quran. This is understood to emphasize the importance of understanding and belief in the Oneness of Allah, which is a central tenet of Islamic faith.\n\nThe three divisions of the Quran can be seen in that the Quran can be understood to convey three major concepts: Tawheed (the Oneness of Allah), Prophethood, and the Finality of the Day of Judgment. Surah Al-Ikhlas encapsulates the essence of Tawheed, hence its designation as a representative portion of the Quran.\n\nIn summary, \"Qul Huwallahu Ahad\" underscores the central belief in the oneness of Allah, and its significance is highlighted by the hadith indicating its equivalence to one-third of the Quran, underscoring its vital role in the understanding of Islamic doctrine."

        "question": "Imam repeating some verses that speak of mercy or punishment",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    I do not know of anything wrong with that, because it \n    encourages the people to ponder and focus and benefit. It was narrated that \n    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) repeated the \n    verse (interpretation of the meaning): “If You punish them, they are Your \n    slaves, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You, are the All‑Mighty, \n    the All‑Wise” [al-Maa'idah 5:118] several times.  \n\n    To sum up: if it is done for a good reason and not for the \n    purpose of showing off, then there is nothing wrong with it, but if he \n    thinks that repeating it may annoy them or result in disturbing sounds such \n    as weeping, then it is better not to do that, so that there will not be any \n    distraction. But if repeating it will only lead to pondering and proper \n    focus on the prayer, then it is all good. End quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the practice of an imam repeating certain verses from the Quran during prayer (Salat) or in sermons (khutbah) is generally accepted and can serve various purposes. \n\n1. **Emphasis on Mercy or Punishment**: The repetition of verses that speak about Allah’s mercy, compassion, and forgiveness can serve to remind the congregation of the importance of these attributes, encouraging them to seek forgiveness and embody mercy in their lives. Similarly, repeating verses that discuss punishment or accountability can serve as a reminder of the seriousness of one's actions and the consequences of sin, prompting believers to strive for righteousness.\n\n2. **Devotional Practice**: Repeating verses can also be part of personal or communal devotion, enhancing the impact of the message. This practice may be seen during dhikr (remembrance of Allah), where certain phrases or verses are repeated to deepen one's spiritual connection.\n\n3. **Teaching Tool**: For imams, repeating certain verses can help in educating the congregation about Islamic teachings. By reiterating important concepts related to mercy and punishment, they can help the audience internalize these lessons.\n\nOverall, while there is no specific restriction against repeating verses, the intention behind the repetition is key. It should aim to foster a deeper understanding of the Quran and encourage personal reflection on the themes of mercy and accountability central to Islam."

        "question": "What is meant by reciting Qur’aan in a melodious voice",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In the saheeh Sunnah it is encouraged to recite the Qur’aan in a melodious voice, i.e., making the voice beautiful when reciting it. It does not mean that one should recite it as if singing, rather what is meant is that one should make the voice beautiful when reciting. For example the saheeh hadeeth says: “Allaah never listens to anything as He listens to a Prophet with a beautiful voice reciting the Qur’aan out loud” and “He is not one of us who does not recite Qur’aan in a melodious voice when reciting it out loud.” What this means is making the voice beautiful, as stated above. \nThe meaning of the hadeeth quoted above refers to listening in a manner that is befitting to Allaah and it is not like the attributes of His creation, as is the case with all His other attributes. It may be said of His listening that it is like His other attributes, that it is in a manner that is befitting to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and there is nothing like unto Him, may He be glorified and exalted. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “There is nothing like Him, and He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Seer” [al-Shoora 42:11]. Reciting in a melodious tone means reciting out loud and making the voice beautiful and with proper focus, so that the heart is moved, because the aim is to stir the heart with this Qur’aan, so that people will fear Allaah and so that they will find peace and benefit from it. An example of this is the story of Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be pleased with him), when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by him as he was reciting Qur’aan, and he started listening to him and said: “You have been given a beautiful voice like the beautiful voices of the family of Dawood.” When Abu Moosa came, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him about that and Abu Moosa said: If I had known, O Messenger of Allaah, that you were listening, I would have made it very beautiful indeed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not denounce him for that, which indicates that making the voice beautiful and being careful in reciting is something that is required, so that both the reader and the listener will focus properly and will both benefit. End quote.",
        "predicted_answer": "Reciting the Qur'an in a melodious voice is often referred to as \"Tajweed,\" which is the art of reciting the Qur'an in a manner that adheres to specific rules of pronunciation and intonation. The term \"melodious\" suggests not just clarity and correctness in pronunciation but also an aesthetic quality that enhances the beauty of the recitation. \n\nIn Islam, reciting the Qur'an melodiously is encouraged as it can help convey the meaning and emotions of the verses more effectively, making it more impactful for both the reciter and the listeners. It also reflects the reverence and respect Muslims have for the Qur'an as the holy word of Allah. \n\nThe practices of making the recitation melodious include employing various vocal techniques, such as varying pitch, tone, and rhythm, while maintaining the rules of Tajweed. It is important to note that while a melodious voice can enhance the recitation, the fundamental focus should always remain on accuracy, understanding, and reflection upon the meanings of the Qur'an."

        "question": "Writing Qur’aan on mobile phones in something other than the ‘Uthmaani script",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to write the Mus-haf in anything other than the ‘Uthmaani script that was agreed upon at the time of the Sahaabah. \nAshhab said: Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Can the Mus-haf be written in the scripts that the people are used to. He said: No, it should be written as it was written initially.  \nThis was narrated by Abu ‘Amr al-Daani in al-Muqni’, then he said: None of the scholars of the ummah disagreed with that. \nImam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is haraam to differ from the script of the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan in ya’, waw, alif or any other letter. \nAl-Bayhaqi said in Shu’ab al-Eeeman: Whoever writes a Mus-haf should adhere to the letters as they are written in these Mus-hafs and not write them differently or change anything that they wrote, for they had more knowledge and were more sincere in heart and in speech, and were more trustworthy than us, so we should not think that we know better than them.   \nAnd he narrated that Zayd said: Recitation should be done in accordance with the Sunnah. Sulaymaan ibn Dawood al-Haashimi said: This means, do not differ from the people, rather follow the Sunnah. \nHe said: I heard something similar in meaning from Abu ‘Ubayd concerning that, and you see that the reciters never paid any attention to the way the Arabic language is written if that differs from the script of the Mus-haf and adhering to the script of the Mus-haf is one of the established ways that no one has the right to differ from. End quote. \nSee: al-Burhaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan by al-Zarkashi (1/379); al-Itqaan by al-Suyooti (4/146). \nAl-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Itqaan: They are unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to follow the script of the ‘Uthmaani Mus-hafs in [rules of tajweed]. End quote from al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan (1/250). \nAll of this applies if what is meant is writing the Mus-haf in full. \nBut when it comes to writing a verse or a few verses, and quoting them in books or magazines, and the like, there is nothing wrong with it, and this is what people do in their books, although it is better to use the script of the Mus-haf whenever possible, and to quote it directly from the Mus-haf. \nThe ruling on that has been explained in the answer to question no. 97741. \nBased on that: \nThere is nothing wrong with what you have mentioned about showing some verses on the screens of mobile phones in something other than the ‘Uthmaani script, if it is not possible to show them in the ‘Uthmaani script, but one should take care to make sure than the verses that are written in this manner are those that are usually easy to read, and not subject to mistakes. And one should take care to make sure that they are written correctly so that there will be no errors in reading and publishing them.  \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an is traditionally written in the 'Uthmani script, which is the standardized style of Arabic script used in the printing of the Qur'an. When it comes to writing or displaying the Qur'an on mobile phones or any other digital platform, there is a consensus among scholars that the content must remain unchanged, regardless of the script used for display.\n\nHere are some important points regarding this matter:\n\n1. **Respect and Reverence**: Regardless of the script used, the Qur'an should always be treated with respect. Any form of display (including on mobile devices) must ensure that the text is presented clearly and accurately.\n\n2. **Usage of Different Scripts**: Using a different script (such as modernized Arabic fonts or transliteration) can be permissible for the purpose of study or to help non-Arabic speakers understand the meanings, provided that it is clear that it is not the Qur'an itself but rather a representation or a translation.\n\n3. **Translations**: It is crucial to note that translations of the Qur'an are not considered the Qur'an in the same way the Arabic text is. While it is acceptable to read translations, they should be accompanied by a disclaimer that they are interpretations of the meanings of the Qur'an.\n\n4. **Digital Formats**: Many applications and websites aim to provide access to the Qur'an in ways that are user-friendly. When using these resources, it’s important to ensure they uphold the proper formatting of the text and maintain its integrity.\n\nIn summary, it is preferable to present and use the Qur'an in its correct 'Uthmani script, especially for solemn recitation or scholarly use. For educational purposes or convenience, other scripts may be utilized, but care should be taken to respect the sanctity of the Qur'an."

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, the respectful treatment of the Qur'an (Mus-haf) is of utmost importance. It is generally understood that the pages of the Qur'an should be treated with the utmost respect, as the Qur'an is considered the literal word of God. \n\nWhen pages of the Mus-haf become worn out or damaged, there are several opinions among scholars regarding their disposal:\n\n1. **Respectful Disposal**: Many scholars advise that worn or damaged copies of the Qur'an should be disposed of in a respectful manner. This can include burying them in a clean place or placing them in flowing water, rather than burning them. This approach reflects the honor due to the words of Allah.\n\n2. **Burning**: Some scholars do allow for burning the worn pages as a method of disposal, but they emphasize that this should only be done with the intention of respectful disposal. It is crucial to ensure that the act is carried out with a sense of reverence.\n\n3. **Replacement**: When pages of the Qur'an become torn or damaged, it is often recommended to replace the Mus-haf altogether, as it maintains the integrity of the sacred text.\n\nIn all cases, the intention behind the action is important. Muslims are encouraged to handle the Qur'an with care and to ensure that any worn copies are treated respectfully. If in doubt, it is always a good idea to consult local scholars or authorities for guidance within your specific community."

        "question": "Saying takbeer from Soorat al-Duha to Soorat al-Naas",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n    Firstly: \n\n    The scholars differed concerning the ruling on saying takbeer \n    after every soorah from Soorat al-Duha to al-Naas. Imam Ahmad regarded it as \n    mustahabb but the other imams differed with him. There is another report \n    from Imam Ahmad which is in accordance with the view of the majority. The \n    correct view is that it is not prescribed to say takbeer, and this is not \n    proven in any marfoo’ hadeeth from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him). There is also no saheeh report about this takbeer from \n    any of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), rather it was proven \n    from some of the qurraa’ (reciters) of the people of Makkah. \n\n    It was narrated that ‘Ikrimah ibn Sulaymaan said: I recited \n    to Ismaa’eel ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Constantine, and when I reached Wa’l-duha \n    (i.e., Soorat al-Duha), he said to me: Say takbeer, say takbeer at the end \n    of every soorah until you complete (the Qur’aan). ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Katheer \n    told him that he recited to Mujaahid and he told him to do that, and \n    Mujaahid told him that Ibn ‘Abbaas had told him to do that, and Ibn ‘Abbaas \n    told him that Ubayy ibn Ka’b told him to do that, and Ubayy ibn Ka’b told \n    him that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told \n    him to do that.  \n\n    Narrated by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak (3/304). \n\n    This hadeeth is da’eef (weak). Its isnaad includes Ahmad ibn \n    Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Bazzah al-Muqri’. Abu Haatim said: His \n    hadeeth is da’eef (weak) and I will not narrate from him. Al-‘Aqeeli said: \n    His hadeeth is munkar (odd). Al-Dhahabi said: This is a ghareeb (strange) \n    hadeeth, and it is one of the hadeeth of al-Bazzi that were regarded as \n    munkar. Abu Haatim said: This is munkar. And he said: Al-Haakim regarded his \n    hadeeth about takbeer as saheeh, but it is munkar. \n\n    See: al-Du’afa’ by al-‘Aqeeli (1/127); and Mizaan \n    al-I’tidaal (1/144, 145) and Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’ (12/51), \n    both by Imam al-Dhahabi. \n\n    Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    Ahmad regarded it is mustahabb to say takbeer from the \n    beginning of Soorat al-Duha until the end of the Qur’aan. This was mentioned \n    by Ibn Tameem and others, and this is the recitation of the people of \n    Makkah, which al-Bazzi took from Ibn Katheer, and Ibn Katheer took it from \n    Mujaahid, and Mujaahid took it from Ibn ‘Abbaas, and Ibn ‘Abbaas took it \n    from Ubayy ibn Ka’b, and Ubayy ibn Ka’b took it from the Prophet  (peace \n    and blessings of Allaah be upon him). A number of them narrated that, \n    including al-Baghawi in his Tafseer, and the reason for that is that \n    the Wahy (revelation) ceased.  \n\n    This is a ghareeb hadeeth, reported by Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn \n    ‘Abd-Allaah al-Bazzi, who is sound with regard to recitation but da’eef \n    (weak) with regard to hadeeth. \n\n    Ibn Haatim al-Raazi said: This is a munkar hadeeth. \n\n    It was also narrated from him – i.e., Imam Ahmad – that there \n    should be no takbeer, as is the view of all reciters. End quote. \n\n    Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah (2/295, \n    296). \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was asked about a group who gathered to read the entire Qur’aan (khatmah) \n    and they were reading to ‘Aasim and Abu ‘Amr. When they reached Soorat \n    al-Duha, they did not say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah or Allaahu akbar, until they \n    reached the end of the Qur’aan. Is what they did better or not? Is the \n    hadeeth which is narrated about saying tahleel and takbeer saheeh and \n    mutawaatir, or not? \n\n    He replied: \nYes, if they recited in accordance with \n    a recitation other than that of Ibn Katheer, their not doing that is better, \n    and is in fact what is prescribed and is Sunnah. These imams of recitation \n    did not say takbeer either at the beginning of the soorahs or at the ends. \n    If it is acceptable to say that Ibn Katheer narrated the takbeer from the \n    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it is \n    acceptable for others to say that these people narrated the omission of that \n    from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him) too. It is not possible that the recitation of the majority that was \n    narrated by more people than the recitation of Ibn Katheer omitted something \n    enjoined by the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him), because those who narrated mutawaatir reports could not have \n    concealed something for which there was good reason to narrate it. The one \n    who accepts that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) told the majority of reciters to add an extra takbeer then they \n    disobeyed the command of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) and failed to do what he had commanded them to do, \n    deserves to be punished severely as a deterrent to him and others like him. \n    \n    With regard to the takbeer, the one who says that it is part \n    of the Qur’aan has gone astray according to scholarly consensus and must be \n    asked to repent; if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he should be \n    executed. How could the one who does not recite it be denounced for not \n    reciting it? The one who regard a person who does not say this takbeer as an \n    innovator or one who goes against the Sunnah or a sinner, is closer to kufr \n    than Islam and should be punished; indeed if he insists on that after having \n    the proof explained to him, then he should be executed. \n\n    If we assume [?] that the Prophet  (peace and blessings \n    of Allaah be upon him) told some of those who recited it to say takbeer, \n    then at most this indicates that it is permissible or mustahabb. If it were \n    obligatory, the majority of reciters would not have neglected it and the \n    imams of the Muslims would not have agreed that it is not obligatory. But \n    none of the imams narrated that the takbeer is obligatory, rather the most \n    that anyone who reads according to the recitation of Ibn Katheer can say is \n    that it is mustahabb. This is unlike the Basmalah, recitation of which is \n    obligatory according to those who regard it as part of the Qur’aan, but \n    despite that the reciters allow not reciting it if one does not want to use \n    it as a break between one soorah and another. So how could it not be allowed \n    to omit the takbeer, which is not part of the Qur’aan?   End quote. \n\n    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (13/417-419) \n\n    And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \n\n    The takbeer that is narrated from Ibn Katheer is not narrated \n    with an isnad from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him), and no one attributed it to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) except al-Bazzi, who thus went against all those who \n    narrated it, as they only narrated it as something optional that was done by \n    some of those who came after the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him), and he was the only one who attributed it to the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). His transmission was regarded \n    as da’eef (weak) by the specialists in hadeeth and biography among the \n    scholars of recitation and hadeeth, as was mentioned by more than one of the \n    scholars. End quote. \n\n    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (17/130). \n\n    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have \n    mercy on him) was asked:  \n\n    Some of the reciters of Qur’aan separate one soorah from \n    another by saying Allaahu akbar instead of the basmalah. Is that \n    permissible, and is there any evidence for it? \n\n    He replied: \n\n    This is contrary to what the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased \n    with them) did, who separated one soorah from another by saying Bismillaah \n    il-Rahmaan il-Raheem, and it is contrary to the scholarly view that the \n    soorahs of the Qur’aan should not be separated by takbeer throughout the \n    Qur’aan. \n\n    At the very most, there are some reciters who regard it as \n    mustahabb for a person to say takbeer when he finishes every soorah from \n    al-Duha to the end of the Qur’aan, along with the Basmalah between every two \n    soorahs. But the correct view is that this is not Sunnah, because that was \n    not narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon \n    him). Based on this, what is prescribed is to separate one soorah from \n    another by saying the Basmalah,  Bismillaah il-Rahmaan il-Raheem, \n    except in the case of Soorat Baraa’ah (al-Tawbah), as there is no Basmalah \n    between al-Anfaal and it. End quote. \n\n    Fataawa Islamiyyah (4/48). \n\n    Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (may Allaah preserve him) mentions in \n    his Book Bida’ al-Qurraa’ (p. 27) seven things that have to do \n    reading the entire Qur’aan, of which we may mention: \n\n    Saying takbeer at the end of Soorat al-Duha until the end of \n    Soorat al-Naas, both when praying and otherwise. \n\n    Then he said: \n\n    There are no saheeh reports about these seven things from the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from his \n    companions (may Allaah be pleased with them). Most of that which is narrated \n    about some of them cannot be taken as evidence. The correct view is that \n    none of these things are prescribed in sharee’ah. End quote. \n\n    The Shaykh of the reciters in al-Madeenah al-Munawwarah, \n    Shaykh Ibraaheem al-Akhdar, has written an essay entitled Takbeer \n    al-Khatam bayna al-Qurraa’ wa’l-Muhadditheen, at the end of which he \n    says: \n\n    From the above discussion of the reports, examination of \n    their isnaads and biographies of their narrators, we could not find anything \n    but the report of al-Bazzi – as the scholars said – and it is a report whose \n    isnaad is filled with weak and majrooh narrators, and there is no other \n    report apart from the report of al-Bazzi. This was stated clearly by many \n    scholars of reports, although some of the most famous reciters, such as Ibn \n    Mujaahid in his book al-Sab’ah, did not narrate the takbeer, and \n    neither did Abu’l-Qaasim al-Hudhali in his book al-Kaamil. This \n    indicates that the report was not proven in their view. And Allaah knows \n    best. \n\n    A Sunnah cannot be established by means of such a report, \n    rather it is better not to do that, whether it is mentioned in the report of \n    al-Bazzi or the report of anyone else. That is so as to protect the Book of \n    Allaah and to keep out of it anything that is not part of it, whether it is \n    thought to be Sunnah or not. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds. \n    End quote. \n\n    Secondly: \n\n    Many reasons for this takbeer have been mentioned, the most \n    well known of which is that the Revelation to the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) ceased for a while, and when it resumed \n    after that, the first thing that was revealed was Soorat al-Duha, in which \n    it says (interpretation of the meaning): “Your Lord (O Muhammad\n    صلى الله عليه وسلم) has neither forsaken \n    you nor hates you” [al-Duha 93:3], and he said takbeer in joy at that. \n    Even if this is saheeh, it does not indicate that it is mustahabb to say \n    takbeer as suggested by some scholars of recitation, for several reasons: \n\n    1.It does not indicate that \n    takbeer is to be said after every recitation of the soorah.\n\n    2.It does not indicate that \n    takbeer is to be said until Soorat al-Naas.\n\n    3.The takbeer was said only once, \n    because of the Revelation resuming after it had ceased for a while.\n\n    4.The other soorahs do not have \n    the same content as Soorat al-Duha.\n\n    Moreover, this report does not have any saheeh isnaad, or \n    even any da’eef (weak) one.   \n\n    Imam Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  \n\n    With regard to saying takbeer after Soorat al-Duha, the \n    reciters said that when the revelation was late in coming to the Messenger \n    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and that went on \n    for a while, then the angel came to him and brought the words \n    (interpretation of the meaning): “By the forenoon (after sunrise). By the \n    night when it darkens (and stands still)” [al-Duha 93:1-2], he said \n    takbeer out of joy and happiness. \n\n    But this was not narrated with any isnaad that can be judged \n    to be saheeh or da’eef. And Allaah knows best. \n\n    Tafseer Ibn Katheer (8/423). \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, making takbeer (saying \"Allahu Akbar\") is a form of glorifying and praising Allah. However, there is no specific practice or requirement to say takbeer from Surah Al-Duha to Surah An-Nas as a customary act.\n\nThe recitation of the Quran, including the two mentioned Surahs, is an act of worship and can be done with reverence and reflection. Muslims often recite these Surahs in their prayers and during other times for spiritual benefit. \n\nIf there are particular traditions or cultural practices regarding this, they may vary, but from an Islamic jurisprudence perspective, it is not mandated to say takbeer between specific Surahs. Always consult knowledgeable scholars for guidance on specific practices if you have further questions or concerns."

        "question": "Repetition in the Qur’aan – types and benefits",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There follows a brief discussion on the repetitions in the Qur’aan, which suits the nature of our site. You can examine the subject further by looking at the references we refer to, or by studying the books of ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan in general. \n1 – Definition of repetition \nIbn al-Manzoor said: \nThe word takraar (translated here as repetition) is derived from the word al-karr, which means going back to a thing.  \nLisaan al-‘Arab (5/135). \nIn sharee’ah terminology, takraar means repeating a word or phrase more than once for various reasons, such as emphasis, exaggeration, reinforcement and so on. \n2 – Repetition is a kind of eloquence \nSome of those who do not have any understanding of the Arabic language criticized the repetition that appears in the Qur’aan, and thought that this is not eloquent. This stems from their ignorance. The repetition that appears in the Qur’aan is not the kind of worthless repetition that is of no value – as we shall see in detail below – and which appears in the speech of one who does not speak the language well or express himself well. \nAl-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nRepetition is more eloquent than merely emphasizing and it is reflective of good style, contrary to what some people think. \nAl-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan (3/280), Mu’sasat al-Nada’ edition. \n3 – Kinds of repetition \nThe scholars have divided the repetition in the Qur’aan into two kinds: \n(i) Repetition of words and meanings \nThis is where words are repeated with no difference in the meaning. There are two types, connected and disconnected. \nThe connected type appears in various ways, either by repeating the words in the same verse, as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Far, very far is that which you are promised!”\n[al-Mu’minoon 23:36]\nor at the end of a verse and at the beginning of the following verse, such as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And amongst them will be passed round vessels of silver and cups of crystal —\n16. Crystal‑clear, made of silver. They will determine the measure thereof (according to their wishes)”\n[al-Insaan 76:15,16]\nor at the end of a verse, such as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Nay! When the earth is ground to powder [kallaa idha dukkat il-ardu dakkan dakka]”\n[al-Fajr 89:21]\nor when a verse is repeated straight after another verse, such as when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“5. Verily, along with every hardship is relief,\n6. Verily, along with every hardship is relief”\n[al-Sharh 94:5,6]\nAs for that which is disconnected, it appears in two forms, either repeated in the same soorah, or repeated throughout the Qur’aan. \nExamples of repetition in the same soorah include the phrase “And verily, your Lord, He is truly, the All‑Mighty, the Most Merciful” which is repeated 8 times in Soorat al-Shu’ara’ and “Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!” which is repeated 10 times in Soorat al-Mursalaat, and “Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?” which is repeated 31 times in Soorat al-Rahmaan.   \nExamples of phrases which are repeated throughout the Qur’aan include the phrase “They say: ‘When will this promise (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) come to pass if you are telling the truth?’” which appears six times, in Yoonus 10:48, al-Anbiya’ 21:38, al-Naml 27:71, Saba’ 34:29, Yaa-Seen 36:48 and al-Mulk 67:25. And the phrase “O Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe against them; their abode will be Hell, and worst indeed is that destination” appears twice, in al-Tawbah 9:73 and al-Tahreem 66:9.  \n(ii) Repetition of meaning but not words \nSuch as the stories of the Prophets with their peoples, and mention of Paradise and its people and Hell and its horrors. \n4 – Benefits of repetition \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nThere is no pointless repetition in the Qur’aan, rather there are benefits in every repetition. \nMajmoo’ al-Fataawa (14/408) \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the repetition of the story of Moosa and his people:\n Allaah mentions this story in several places in the Qur'aan, and in every place He highlights a different idea and conclusion, just as Allaah, His Messenger and His Book are called by different names, each name indicating a meaning that is not indicated by another name. There is no repetition in that, rather it is a kind of diversity, like the names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as he is called Muhammad, Ahmad, al-Haashir, al-‘Aaqib, al-Muqaffa, the Prophet of Mercy, the Prophet of Repentance, and each name points to a meaning that is not indicated by any other name; the person is the same but the attributes are numerous. \nThe same applies to the Qur’aan, which is also called Furqaan (criterion), Bayaan (a plain statement), Huda (guidance), Basaa’ir (clear evidence), Shifa’ (healing), Noor (light) and Rahmah (mercy). Each name points to a meaning that is not indicated by other names. \nThe same applies to the names of the Lord, as He is called: al-Malik (the Sovereign), al-Quddoos (the Holy), al-Salaam (the One Free from all defects), al-Mu’min (the Guardian of faith), al-Muhaymin (the Watcher over His creatures), al-‘Azeez (the Almighty), al-Jabbaar (the compeller), al-Mutakabbir (the Majestic), al-Khaaliq (the Creator), al-Baari’ (the Inventor of all things), and al-Musawwir (the Bestower of forms). Each name points to a meaning that is not indicated by another name. The Essence is One but the attributes are numerous.  \nThe same applies to sentences that are complete in meaning. The story is told in one way that highlights one point, then it is told in another way which highlights a different point. The story is the same story, but its details are numerous, and every sentence conveys a meaning that is not indicated by other sentences. \nMajmoo’ al-Fataawa 919/167, 168). \nAl-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  \nThere are a number of reasons for repetition: \nThis includes confirmation. It is said that if words are repeated the meaning is confirmed. Allaah has indicated the reason why He repeats stories and reminders in the Qur’aan, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“and have explained therein in detail the warnings, in order that they may fear Allaah, or that it may cause them to have a lesson from it”\n[Ta-Ha 20:113]\nIt also includes emphasis. \nIt also includes highlighting a point so that the words will be accepted, such as the verse:  \n“And the man who believed said: ‘O my people! Follow me, I will guide you to the way of right conduct [i.e. guide you to Allaah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism with which Moosa (Moses) has been sent].\n39. ‘O my people! Truly, this life of the world is nothing but a (quick passing) enjoyment’”\n[Ghaafir 40:38].\nIn the passage the call is repeated for this reason. \nAnother example is if the speech is lengthy and there is the fear that what was said at the beginning may be forgotten, so it is repeated a second time to keep the idea fresh. For example, in the verses: \n“Then, verily, your Lord __ for those who do evil (commit sins and are disobedient to Allaah) in ignorance and afterward repent and do righteous deeds, verily, your Lord thereafter, (to such) is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”\n[al-Nahl 16:119] \n“Then, verily, your Lord _for those who emigrated after they had been put to trials and thereafter strove hard and fought (for the Cause of Allaah) and were patient, verily, your Lord afterward”\n[al-Nahl 16:110] \n“And when there came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur’aan) from Allaah confirming what is with them [the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], although aforetime they had invoked Allaah (for coming of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved, then when there came to them that which they had recognised, they disbelieved in it”\n[al-Baqarah 2:89]\n“Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,— think not you that they are rescued from the torment”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:188] \n“Verily, I saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon — I saw them”\n[Yoosuf 12:4]\nIt may also be done for emphasis, as in the verses: \n“The Inevitable (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)!\n2. What is the Inevitable?”\n[al-Haaqqah 69:1] \n“Al‑Qaari‘ah (the striking Hour, i.e. the Day of Resurrection).\n2. What is the striking (Hour)?”\n[al-Qaari’ah 101:1] \n“And those on the Right Hand —how (fortunate) will be those on the Right Hand?”\n[al-Waaqi’ah 56:27]\nal-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan (3/281, 282). \n5 – Benefits of repeating some stories and verses \n1 – Abu’l-Faraj Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nIf it is said: What is the point of repeating the verse “Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?” [in Soorat al-Rahmaan]? \nThe answer is: This repetition is in order to confirm the blessing and emphasize the remembrance thereof. Ibn Qutaybah said: It is the habit of the Arabs to repeat things for emphasis and to ensure that they are understood, although they may also speak briefly so as not to tire the listener, because if a speaker addresses a point from different angles, that is better than him approaching it from just one angle, such as if someone said:  By Allaah, I will not do it, and by Allaah, I will not do it – because he wanted to emphasize his point and put an end to any hope that he could do it. And if he wanted to be brief he may say:  By Allaah I shall do it, but omitting the word ‘not’ for the sake of brevity. Similarly, one who is in a hurry may say, Hurry up, hurry up! And it may be said to the archer: Shoot, shoot! \nIbn Qutaybah said: When Allaah listed His blessings in this soorah, and reminded His slaves of His signs, and drew attention to His power, He repeated this phrase between each two blessings, so that they would appreciate the blessings and recognize them, such as when you say to a man: Didn’t I give you accommodation when you were homeless – can you deny that? Didn’t I take you for Hajj when you had never been – can you deny that?  \nZaad al-Maseer (5/461). \n2 – al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nAs for the way in which the repetition is done – i.e., “Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to these Mushrikoon and Kaafiroon): “O Al‑Kaafiroon (disbelievers)” – it is said that it is for emphasis to cut off their hopes, as one might say: By Allaah, I will not do it, and by Allaah I will not do it. \nMost of the scholars of semantics said: The Qur’aan was revealed in the language of the Arabs, and it is their way to repeat things for emphasis and to ensure that they are understood, and also to speak briefly so as not to tire the listener, because when the speaker uses different phrases in his speech, it is better than limiting himself to one phrase. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?” and “Nay, they will come to know! Nay, again, they will come to know!” [al-Naba’ 78:4, 5] and “5. Verily, along with every hardship is relief,6. Verily, along with every hardship is relief” [al-Sharh 94:5,6]. In all cases, the aim is emphasis. \nTafseer al-Qurtubi (20/226). \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the Qur'an, repetition serves various purposes and can be understood in several ways. Here are the main types of repetition found in the Qur'an, along with their benefits:\n\n### Types of Repetition in the Qur’an:\n\n1. **Literal Repetition:**\n   - This is when certain words, phrases, or verses are repeated verbatim. For example, the phrase \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\" (Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Rahim) appears at the beginning of most Surahs (chapters).\n\n2. **Semantic Repetition:**\n   - This involves the repetition of concepts or themes but with different words or in different contexts. For instance, narratives about Prophets and their trials appear in various Surahs but often present new lessons or perspectives.\n\n3. **Surah and Ayah Structure:**\n   - Certain Surahs consist of repetitive structures, where similar themes are revisited throughout the chapter. An example of this is Surah Al-Rahman, where specific blessings are enumerated repeatedly, often culminating in the refrain, \"So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?\"\n\n4. **Repetition of Stories:**\n   - The same story may be recounted in different Surahs with variations that highlight specific lessons or aspects of the story. The stories of Prophet Musa (Moses) and Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) are notable examples.\n\n### Benefits of Repetition in the Qur’an:\n\n1. **Emphasis on Key Teachings:**\n   - Repetition reinforces important messages and concepts. When a particular idea is repeated, it signifies its importance and encourages reflection and internalization.\n\n2. **Facilitating Memorization:**\n   - The rhythmic and repetitive nature of certain verses aids in the memorization of the Qur'an. Repetition makes it easier for learners and reciters to recall and understand the text.\n\n3. **Deepening Understanding:**\n   - When the same themes are revisited, it allows for deeper contemplation and greater insight. Readers may discover new dimensions of understanding upon repeated readings.\n\n4. **Enhancing Spiritual Experience:**\n   - The act of hearing or reciting repeated phrases can evoke emotions and enhance one’s spiritual connection to the text. It serves to remind the believer of crucial aspects of faith and practice.\n\n5. **Contextual Reflection:**\n   - The repetition not only highlights the core messages but also provides context that might offer new perspectives each time it is revisited, encouraging ongoing reflection and learning.\n\n6. **Encouraging Engagement:**\n   - The repetitive elements draw the reader or listener back to the divine message actively, encouraging continual engagement with the text.\n\nIn summary, repetition in the Qur'an is a multifaceted tool that enhances understanding, facilitates memorization, emphasizes key teachings, and deepens spiritual connections. Through its various forms, it serves to invite reflection and engagement with the divine message, allowing for continual growth in faith and knowledge."

        "question": "Mus-haf al-Tajweed with coloured letters",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.After examining the Mus-haf al-Tajweed with coloured letters, it is clear that there is nothing wrong with using these colours, rather it makes it easier to learn tajweed, for those who are not able to learn directly from experts. \nThe Dar al-Ma’rifah (publisher’s) website has published a copy of the approval of the Islamic Research Council in al-Azhar of this Mus-haf in which different colours are used; it also cites the approval of the senior scholar of Qur’aan in Syria, Shaykh Muhammad Kareem Raajih, and the approval of Shaykh Dr. Wahbah al-Zuhayli. This is the text of what it says on the site:         \nWith regard to this work of ours, the senior scholar of Qur’aan in Syria, Shaykh Muhammad Kareem Raajih stated on 21 Safar 1412 AH that this work “is acceptable and even it is of no benefit then it does not cause any harm, moreover it serves as a reminder and indication of the rules of tajweed, but it does not do away with the importance of learning tajweed directly from the mouths of the shaykhs.” At the same time, Shaykh al-Qaari’ Muhiy al-Deen al-Kurdi stated on 18 Safar 1415 AH that “those who away from educational circles and elderly people may benefit from this work, because they cannot learn directly.” Professor Wahbat al-Zuhayli, a member of the Islamic Fiqh Council in Jeddah and the President of the Faculty of Islamic Fiqh and Madhhabs at the University of Damascus stated on 18 Muharram 1415AH: “Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And We have indeed made the Qur’aan easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?’ [al-Qamar 54:17]. This clearly indicates that everything that makes it easy to recite Qur’aan, which we are required in Islam to study it, understand its meanings and act in accordance with what it says, is a must according to sharee’ah for those who study knowledge, fiqh and the tafseer of the Book of Allaah. As reciting the Qur’aan in the manner that is known in the science of tajweed is obligatory, then every means that makes it easy for the reader to learn the rulings on tajweed and follow them when reciting is something that is permissible according to sharee’ah, whether it is letters printed in one colour or several colours. The good reading is that which imprints the letters in the mind, and this printing of the Holy Qur’aan in different colours makes it easy to read the Qur’aan, and establishes the rulings in the mind, so it is a contemporary means that is to be encouraged and it does not contradict the way in which Qur’aan was traditionally transmitted to us and the traditional way of writing it.  May Allaah help Dar al-Ma’rifah with this blessed work. End quote. \nThere is no way that these colours can be ruled to be an innovation, because the scholars of Qur’aan at the time of the Taabi’een introduced dots and vowels in the Mus-haf and wrote the dots and vowels in red.  \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \nThe Sahaabah did not write dots and vowels in the Mus-hafs because they were Arabs who did not make mistakes in pronouncing the words, so they did not need the dots. A single word could be read in two ways, with a ya’ or a ta’, such as ya’maloon (يعملون) and ta’maloon (تعملون), which they would read in only one way because they knew that the other was not correct.  \nBut at the time of the Taabi’een, when it become common for people to mispronounce words, some of the Taabi’een added vowels and dots to the Mus-haf, and they wrote them in red. They wrote the fathah as a red dot above the letter, and the kasrah as a red dot below the letter, and the dammah as a red dot before the letter. Then they expanded the red dots and they denoted the shaddah by writing “shadd” and the maddah by writing “madd”. They made the sign for the hamzah look like the letter ‘ayn, because the hamzah is the sister of the ‘ayn. Then they abbreviated them and made the sign for the shaddah look like the main part of the letter seen, and the sign for the maddah an abbreviated sign, as those who keep records may abbreviate numbers etc, and as the scholars of hadeeth abbreviated words such as akhbarana (he informed us) and haddathana (he narrated to us) by writing the first and last part of the word in the forms ana (أنا)  and thana(ثنا) .  \nThe scholars disputed as to whether it was makrooh or not to add vowels and dots to the Mus-haf and there are two well known views, both of which were narrated from Ahmad, but there was no dispute concerning the fact that if there are vowels and dots in a Mus-haf, they must be respected just as the letters are respected. End quote from Majmoo’ Fataawa Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (12/101). \nShaykh Dr. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Muhammad al-Mutlaq (may Allaah preserve him) said: The following things were not originally part of the ‘Uthmaani text: \n1 – The dots by means of which letters are distinguished, for they were added to the Arabic letters at the time of the Taabi’een. Before that the letters were written without dots. Abu ‘Amr ‘Uthmaan ibn Sa’eed al-Daani (d. 444 AH) said: Chapter on the first ones among the Taabi’een to add dots to the Mus-hafs, and those who regarded it as makrooh and those among the scholars who granted concessions allowing that: the reports we have vary as to who was the first to add dots to the Mus-haf among the Taabi’een, but we think that the first one who did that was Abu’l-Aswad al-Du’ali. \nWe narrated that Ibn Sireen had a Mus-haf to which dots had been added by Yahya ibn Ya’mar, and that Yahya was the first one to add dots to it. [Kitaab al-Naqd, printed alongside al-Maqna’ fi Ma’rifat Arsoom Masaahif Ahl al-Amsaar, p. 129].  \n2 – Vowels and tanween – the first one to add them was Abu’l-Aswad al-Du’ali, and they were dots. That was because he wanted to write Arabic in such a way that the people would correct the mistakes that they had started to make in their speech, as that had become common among the elite and the common folk. So he brought someone to hold the Mus-haf, and he brought ink of a different colour, and he said to the one who was holding the Mus-haf for him: If I open my mouth then put the dot above the letter, and if I stretch my mouth then put the dot beneath the letter, if I purse my lips then put the dot before the letter, and if I follow these letters with ghunnah (i.e., tanween), then put two dots, until I reach the end of the Mus-haf. And it was said that the first one who did that was Nasr ibn ‘Aasim al-Laythi. [Kitaab al-Naqd, printed alongside al-Maqna’ fi Ma’rifat Arsoom Masaahif Ahl al-Amsaar, p. 129].  \nThen al-Khaleel ibn Ahmad developed that when he invented vowel signs derived from the letters. [al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan, p. 219]. \n3 – Hamzah, shaddah, rawm and ishmaam. The first one who introduced these was al-Khaleel ibn Ahmad al-Faraaheedi. \n4 – Signs of tajweed and signs of al-wasl (joining) and al-waqf (pausing). These did not exist in the ‘Uthmaani text, rather they were developed later on in ‘ilm al-tajweed.

        "predicted_answer": "Mus-haf al-Tajweed is a special version of the Quran that includes the rules of Tajweed, which is the art of reciting the Quran correctly. The Mus-haf is designed to help readers, especially non-Arabic speakers or those learning to read the Quran, to understand and apply the rules of pronunciation.\n\nIn the Mus-haf al-Tajweed, different letters and symbols are often colored to indicate specific Tajweed rules. For instance, certain letters may be highlighted in various colors to show where an elongation (madd) occurs, where a nasal sound (ghunnah) is required, or to indicate instances of the qalqalah (a type of sound change). This visual aid helps readers to better grasp the intricate rules of recitation by making the correct pronunciations easily identifiable.\n\nOverall, the Mus-haf al-Tajweed serves as a valuable tool for those seeking to improve their Quran recitation and ensure they are adhering to the rules laid out in Tajweed. It's important to approach this with sincerity, patience, and dedication, as learning to recite the Quran accurately is an important aspect of worship in Islam."

        "question": "When it is obligatory to listen attentively to recitation of the Quran?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on listening attentively to recitation of Quran outside of prayer. There are two opinions: \n1 – The first view is that is it obligatory. This is the view of the Hanafis, and some of them regarded it as an individual obligation, whilst others said that it is a communal obligation. They quoted as evidence the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy” [al-A’raaf 7:204]\nIt says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (4/86): \nListening to recitation of Quran when it is recited outside of prayer is obligatory if there is no legitimate shar’i excuse for not listening. \nThe Hanafis differed with regard to this obligation: is it an individual obligation or a communal obligation? \nIbn ‘Aabideen said: The basic principle is that listening to Quran is a communal obligation, because it is establishing its right to be listened to and not ignored, which is achieved by some listening attentively, as is the case with returning salaams (i.e., it is sufficient for some members of a group to return the greeting). \nAl-Hamawi narrated that his teacher, the prominent judge Yahya who is better known as Minqaarizaadah, said that listening to the Quran is an individual obligation. \nYes, the verse in Soorat al-A’raaf, “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy” was revealed to abrogate the permission to speak during prayer, but what counts is the general meaning of the words, not the specific reason for its revelation, and the general meaning includes recitation of Quran both during prayer and otherwise. End quote. \n2 – The second view is that it is mustahabb and recommended. They interpreted the verse in Soorat al-A’raaf as referring to recitation in prayer only. Outside of prayer it is recommended and mustahabb. This is the view of the majority of scholars.  \nIbn Katheer says in Tafseer al-Quran il-‘Azeem (2/372): \n‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n“So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy”\n[al-A’raaf 7:204]: \ni.e., in the obligatory prayer. Something similar was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Mughaffal. Ibn Jareer said: Humayd ibn Mas’adah told us, Bishr ibn al-Mufaddal told us, al-Jareeri told us, that Talhah ibn ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn Kurayz said: I saw ‘Ubayd ibn ‘Umayr and ‘Ata’ ibn Abi Rabaah talking whilst the storyteller was speaking, and I said: Why don’t you listen to the reminder, lest you be subject to the warning? They looked at me, then they went back to their conversation. I repeated it, and they looked at me, then they went back to their conversation. I said it a third time and they looked at me and said: That is only in prayer: “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy”\n[al-A’raaf 7:204].  \nThis is how it was narrated by more than one person from Mujaahid. ‘Abd al-Razzaaq narrated from al-Thawri from Layth that Mujaahid said: There is nothing wrong with speaking if a man recites Quran other than in prayer. \nSomething similar was stated by Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, al-Dahhaak, Ibraheem al-Nakha’i, Qataadah, al-Sha’bi, al-Saddi and ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam, that what is meant (in the verse) is in prayer. \nThis was the view favoured by Ibn Jareer, that what is meant is listening attentively in prayer and during the khutbah, as it says in the ahaadeeth which enjoin listening attentively behind the imam and during the khutbah. End quote. \nIt seems that this view is the correct one, because in order for a thing to be obligatory, clear evidence is required, otherwise obliging the people to adhere to that will clause undue hardship without any evidence for it. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked, as it says in Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (no. 197/ question no. 26): \nThere was a group of people travelling by car, and one of them put on a tape of Quran; should they all listen to this tape, and is anyone who speaks whilst the tape is playing sinning thereby? \nThe answer was: \nImam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning this verse: This applies to prayer. He said: They were unanimously agreed that this applies to prayer. Based on this, if I am next to a person who is reciting Quran out loud, but I am reciting tasbeeh and saying laa ilaaha ill-Allah, then I do not have to listen to him, rather that applies to prayer only. \nBut I say to the brother who put the tape on: Do not put it on when people are not paying attention, because the least that may said about that is that it is like those of whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who disbelieve say: ‘Listen not to this Quran, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome’” [Fussilat 41:26]. If you see that your brothers do not want to listen, and they are busy talking to one another, then do not put the tape on. If you want to listen to it, then there are small headphones that you can put in your ears, and you can listen to it by yourself. End quote. \nIt says in al-Muntaqa fi Fataawa al-Fawzaan (3/question no. 437): \nSometimes I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, to prepare food for my husband, and I want to make good use of my time, so I listen to the Holy Quran either on the radio or on tapes. Is this action of mine correct or should I not do that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy”[al-A’raaf 7:204]? \nThe answer is: There is nothing wrong with listening to the Holy Quran on the radio or on tapes when one is working, and that does not go against the words “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent”, because listening attentively is required as much as one is able to do, and the one who puts on the tape should listen attentively to the Quran as much as he can. End quote. \nFavouring the view that it is mustahabb does not mean that one may be careless and deliberately fail to listen attentively to the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, when they are recited. Keenness to listen attentively should be the basic principle that is established in the life of the Muslim, and he should not do otherwise except in the case of work or need. \nAl-Nawawi said in al-Tabyaan fi Adaab Hamalat al-Quran (92): \nSomething that attention must be paid to and which should be affirmed is respecting the Quran in cases where some of the negligent may be heedless about it in gatherings where Quran is recited, such as not laughing, chatting or talking during the recitation, except in cases of necessity; obeying the words of Allah, “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy”; and following the example that was narrated from Ibn Abi Dawood from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), that when the Quran was recited he would not talk until the recitation ended. End quote. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (no. 146, question no. 9): It is not good manners to ignore the Book of Allah when it is being recited, even if it is on a tape.” End quote. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is obligatory to listen attentively to the recitation of the Quran in specific situations. One of the primary instances is when the Quran is being recited in a communal setting, such as during prayers (Salah), particularly in the Fard (obligatory) prayers where the Imam recites aloud. \n\nAdditionally, when the Quran is being recited in general, whether in a gathering or during a personal session, it is recommended to listen attentively and with respect. This is based on the Quranic verse:\n\n**\"And when the Quran is recited, then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy.\"** (Surah Al-A'raf, 7:204)\n\nFurthermore, during recitation in institutions of learning or whenever one is studying the Quran, it is also important to listen attentively to ensure understanding and reflection. \n\nIn summary, it is obligatory to listen attentively to the Quran during communal prayers, and it is recommended to do so during personal recitation and study."

        "question": "Ruling on seeking refuge with Allaah before reciting al-Faatihah in the prayer",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIt is proven \n    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to \n    seek refuge with Allaah before reciting al-Faatihah in the prayer. Narrated \n    by Abu Dawood (775) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. \nSecondly: \nThe scholars \n    differed as to the ruling on seeking refuge with Allaah before reciting \n    al-Faatihah in the prayer. Some of them were of the view that it is \n    obligatory. This is the view of ‘Ata’, al-Thawri, al-Awzaa’i and Dawood, as \n    was narrated by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla (3/247-248), and it was the \n    view favoured by him. It was also narrated from Ahmad and was favoured by \n    Ibn Battah, as it says in al-Insaaf (2/119). Among later scholars \n    this view was favoured by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on them \n    all).  \nOthers were \n    of the view that it is only mustahabb and is not obligatory. This is the \n    view of the majority of scholars among the Sahaabah and Taabi’een and of the \n    Imams Abu Haneefah and al-Shaafa’i, and Ahmad according to the well known \n    view of his madhhab. \nSee: \n    Tabyeen al-Haqaa’iq (1/107); al-Majmoo’ (3/280-282), al-Mughni \n    (1/283); al-Fataawa al-Kubra by Ibn Taymiyah (5/332). \nThose who \n    say that it is obligatory quoted as evidence the verse in which Allaah says \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n“So when \n    you want to recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge with Allaah from Shaytaan \n    (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one)”\n[al-Nahl \n    16:98]\nThey said: \n    In this verse there is the command to seek refuge with Allaah, and the basic \n    principle is that a command means that something is obligatory, so long as \n    there is no other evidence to indicate that what is meant in the command is \n    mustahabb. \nIbn Hazm \n    said in al-Muhalla (2/279): \nWith regard \n    to the view of Abu Haneefah and al-Shaafa’i, that seeking refuge with Allaah \n    is not obligatory, this is wrong, because Allaah, may He be exalted, says:\n    “So when you want to recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge with Allaah from \n    Shaytaan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one)”. When Allaah commands \n    something, it is wrong for anyone to say without any evidence from the \n    Qur’aan or Sunnah that this is not obligatory, especially His command to \n    pray for Him to protect us from the tricks of the shaytaan.  So this command \n    is definitely obligatory, because avoiding the shaytaan and fleeing from him \n    and asking for protection against him are things that no one can dispute are \n    obligatory. Moreover, Allaah has enjoined that upon us when reading Qur’aan. \n    End quote. \nThe majority \n    of scholars responded by noting that there is other evidence which indicates \n    that it is mustahabb rather than obligatory. This other evidence is: \n1 – The \n    hadeeth about the man who did not pray properly. The Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught him how to pray and said: “When you \n    go to pray, say takbeer, then recite whatever you can of the Qur’aan. Then \n    bow …” Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim (397). And he did not tell him to \n    seek refuge with Allaah. \nImam \n    al-Shaafa’i said in al-Umm (1/208): \nIf he omits \n    it by mistake or out of ignorance or deliberately, he does not have to \n    repeat it or do the prostration of forgetfulness, but I regard it as makrooh \n    to omit it deliberately. If he omits it in the first rak’ah, I prefer for \n    him to say it in some other rak’ah. The only thing that keeps me from \n    telling him to repeat the prayer is the fact that when the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught a man what is sufficient \n    in prayer he said: “say takbeer, then recite…”, and it is not narrated that \n    he told him to seek refuge with Allaah or recite the opening du’aa’. This \n    indicates that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) regarded the opening du’aa’ as something optional, and that \n    seeking refuge with Allaah is something that does not invalidate the prayer \n    if it is omitted. End quote. \n2 –It says \n    in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (4/6): \nThe majority \n    quoted as evidence that the command means that it is recommended and not \n    obligatory the fact that the salaf were unanimously agreed that it is \n    Sunnah. End quote.  \nThe scholars \n    of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas also favoured the view that it \n    is mustahabb and not obligatory, as did Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen. \nIt says in\n    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (6/383): \nWhat is the \n    ruling on one who forgets to seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed \n    shaytaan and remembers after finishing the prayer, if he remembers that he \n    did not say A’oodhu Billaahi min al-shaytaan il-rajeem (I seek refuge \n    with Allaah from the accursed shaytaan) whilst he was praying? \nThey \n    replied: \nSeeing \n    refuge with Allaah is Sunnah, and it does not matter if it is omitted from \n    the prayer whether deliberately or by mistake. End quote. \nShaykh Ibn \n    ‘Uthaymeen was asked: Should one seek refuge with Allaah in every rak’ah or \n    only in the first rak’ah? \nHe replied: \nSeeking \n    refuge with Allaah from the accursed shaytaan in prayer is Sunnah. \nThe scholars \n    (may Allaah have mercy on them) differed as to whether one should seek \n    refuge with Allaah in every rak’ah or only in the first rak’ah, based on the \n    recitation in prayer – is it regarded as one recitation or is the recitation \n    in each rak’ah separate? \nIt seems to \n    me that the recitation in prayer is one recitation, so one should seek \n    refuge with Allaah in the first rak’ah, unless there happens something that \n    requires seeking refuge with Allaah, such as if there come whispers from the \n    shaytaan (waswaas), because if whispers come from the shaytaan, the \n    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined spitting \n    drily to the left three times and seeking refuge with Allaah from the \n    accursed shaytaan. End quote. \nMajmoo’ \n    Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (13/110) \nThis view is \n    also favoured in the answer to question no. \n    65847. \nAnd Allaah \n    knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic prayer (Salah), it is recommended to seek refuge with Allah before reciting Surah Al-Faatihah. This practice is based on the hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), in which he would say \"A’udhu billahi min ash-shaytaan ir-rajim\" (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed devil) before beginning his recitation.\n\nThe scholars of Islam agree that seeking refuge is a Sunnah (a practice recommended by the Prophet). It is a means of seeking protection from any distractions or misguidance that may come from Shaytaan (the devil) during the prayer. \n\nTherefore, while it is not obligatory to say it, it is highly recommended and encouraged as part of the prayer. It is typically said quietly to oneself just before reciting Al-Faatihah. \n\nIn conclusion, seeking refuge with Allah before reciting Al-Faatihah is a recommended Sunnah practice in Salah."

        "question": "Is it essential to recite the Quran in sequence for one who wants to complete it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is mustahabb to read Quran a great deal during Ramadaan, because it is the month of the Quran. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong)” [al-Baqarah 2:185].\nJibreel used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) every night in Ramadaan and review the Quran with him. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5) and Muslim (4268). \nAl-Bukhaari (4614) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that Jibreel used to review the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) once every year, and he reviewed it with him twice in the year when he died. This indicates that it is mustahabb to complete the Quran and study it in Ramadaan.\n Hence the salaf used to read Quran a great deal during Ramadaan, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Qataadah (may Allah have mercy on him) used to complete the Quran every seven nights all the time, and every three nights in Ramadaan, and every two nights during the last ten days of Ramadaan.  \nIbraaheem al-Nakha’i used to complete the Quran in Ramadaan every three nights, and in the last ten days every two nights. \nAl-Aswad (may Allah have mercy on him) used to read the entire Quran every two nights throughout the month. End quote from Majaalis Shahr Ramadaan by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) p. 65. \nSecondly: \nThe best is to read the Quran in the order of soorahs as given in the Mus-haf, which is the sequence in which Jibreel reviewed the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at the end of his life.  \nSee: al-Tahbeer fi ‘Ilm al-Tafseer by al-Suyooti, p. 637 \nAl-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Tibyaan: \nThe scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said: The best is to read it in the order in which it appears in the Mus-haf, so he should read al-Faatihah, then al-Baqarah, then Aal ‘Imraan, then al-Nisa’, until he ends with Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi l-naas (Sooratal-Naas), whether he is reciting it in prayer or otherwise. It is also mustahabb, if he recites one soorah, to recite after it the soorah that comes after it. So if he recites Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi l-naas (Sooratal-Naas) in the first rak’ah, he should recite from al-Baqarah in the second. \nThe evidence for that is that the order of soorahs given in the Mus-haf is for a reason, so that order should be followed, except in cases where it is narrated that there is an exception, such as in Fajr prayer on Friday, when Alif-Laam-Meem Tanzeel (Soorat al-Sajdah) is recited in the first rak’ah and Hal ata (Soorat al-Insaan) in the second, and the Eid prayers when Soorat Qaaf and Soorat al-Qamar may be recited. \nIf he recites them in a different order and recites one soorah then recites a soorah that comes before it, or he recites a soorah that does not come straight after it, that is permissible, even if he is not doing what is best. As for reciting a soorah from the end to the beginning, there is no dispute that this is not allowed and is blameworthy, because it is a distortion that detracts from the linguistic miracle of the Quran and goes against the wisdom behind the order in which the verses appear. \nEnd quote from al-Nawawi. \nThere is a report from ‘Aa’ishah which indicates that it is not obligatory to read Quran in sequence. \nAl-Bukhaari (4993) narrated that Yoosuf ibn Maahak said: I was with ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers when an Iraqi came to her and said: “O Mother of the Believers, show me your Mus-haf.” She said: “Why?” He said: “So that I may compile and arrange the Quran according to it, for people recite it with its soorahs not in proper order.” She said: “It does not matter which part you read first. The first part of it to be revealed was a soorah from al-Mufassal which mentioned Paradise and Hell, then when the people became steadfast in Islam, (rulings on) halaal and haraam were revealed. If the first thing to have been revealed was ‘Do not drink wine,’ they would have said: ‘We will never give up wine.’ If it had been revealed, ‘Do not commit zina,’ they would have said, ‘We will never give up zina.’ It was revealed in Makkah to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when I was a young girl playing, ‘Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter’ [al-Qamar 54:46]. And Soorat al-Baqarah and al-Nisa’ were not revealed except I was with him.” \nAl-Haafiz said: \nIt seems to me that this Iraqi was one of those who followed the recitation of Ibn Mas’ood. When the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan was brought to Kufa, Ibn Mas’ood did not agree to recant his recitation or destroy his Mus-haf, and his compilation was different from that of ‘Uthmaan’s Mus-haf. (Compilation means the collection of the Mus-haf in order). Undoubtedly the compilation of ‘Uthmaan’s Mus-haf was more appropriate than any other, hence this Iraqi said that its soorahs were not in proper order. \nIbn Battaal said: We do not know of anyone who regarded it as obligatory to recite the soorahs in order, whether during prayer or otherwise, rather it is permissible to recite al-Kahf before al-Baqarah, or al-Hajj before al-Kahf, for example. As for what is narrated from the salaf about it being forbidden to recite the Quran out of order, what is meant by that is reciting a soorah from its end to its beginning. There was a group which did that in poetry, to demonstrate their precise memorization thereof. So the salaf ruled that this is not allowed with regard to the Quran and it is haraam. Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said: The order of soorahs is not obligatory when reading or praying, or studying or teaching, hence Mus-hafs varied, but when the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan was written they wrote it in the order in which it appears now. Hence the order of the Mus-hafs of the Sahaabah varied… then he mentioned something similar to Ibn Battaal. End quote from Fath al-Baari. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is not strictly essential to recite the Quran in sequence to complete it. While the recommended and traditional method of recitation is to read the Quran in its chronological order, it is permissible to recite it out of sequence. Many people may start with certain Surahs (chapters) that they find more meaningful or easier to recite. \n\nThe important aspect is to maintain sincerity and dedication in the recitation and understanding of the Quran. Ultimately, the goal is to engage with the Quran, whether in sequence or not, and to reflect upon its meanings and teachings. \n\nHowever, for anyone who aims to complete the Quran in its entirety, following the sequential order is likely to enhance the overall understanding and context of the revelations."

        "question": "Is there any du`a in the Sunnah for after one has completed the Quran?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is no specific u`a narrated in the Sunnah for after one has completed the Quran, or even from the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or the well-known imams. One of the most well-known u`as regarding this matter is the u`a which is written at the end of many Mus-hafs and it attributed to Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), but there is no basis for attributing it to him. See Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 14/226. \nThe u`a after completing the Quran is recited either after completing it whilst praying, or when not praying. There is no basis for reciting any u`a after completing it whilst praying. As for reciting a u`a after completing it when not praying, it is narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) did that. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on making u`a after completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan?  \nHe replied: \nI do not know of any u`a for completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan, either from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from his companions. The most that has been narrated concerning that is that when Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) had completed a reading of the Quran, he would gather his family and make u`a. This had to do with reading it outside of prayer. End quote. \nFataawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 354 \nShaykh Bakr Abu Zayd wrote a useful essay on this issue, at the end of which he said: \nFrom the quotations in the two previous sections we may draw the following conclusion: \n1 – u`a upon completion of the Quran in general: \nThe conclusion concerning this is as follows: \nFirstly: \nWhat we have stated above has to do with u`a upon completion of the Quran in general. \nThere is no proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that, rather the reports are either mawdoo’ (fabricated) or are da’eef (weak) with no other reports to strengthen them. It is almost certain that there are no marfoo’ reports concerning this matter that can be relied upon, because the scholars who wrote comprehensively about the sciences of the Quran and the dhikrs to be recited in connection with the Quran, such as al-Nawawi, Ibn Katheer, al-Qurtubi and al-Suyooti, did not narrate anything other than what we have referred to above. If they had known of any reports with stronger isnaads, they would have quoted them.\nSecondly: \nThere is a saheeh report that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said u`a when he completed the Quran, and he would gather his family and children for that, and that a number of the Taabi’een followed him in that, as mentioned in the report of Mujaahid ibn Jabr (may Allah have mercy on them all). \nThirdly: \nThere is no suggestion in the texts of Imam Abu Haneefah and Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on them) that this is Islamically prescribed. \nWhat is narrated from Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) is that this is not something that the people did, and that completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan is not Sunnah. \nFourthly: \nThe view that it is mustahabb to make u`a after completing the Quran is what is narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), as our Hanbali scholars narrated from him, and as was affirmed by some later scholars of the other three madhhabs. \n2 – u`a following completion of the Quran in prayer \nThis may be summed up as follows:  \nFirstly: \nFrom what is quoted above, there is no one letter from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from one of his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) to indicate that it is Islamically prescribed to recite this u`a in prayer after completing the Quran, before or after bowing, whether that is done by an imam or by one who is praying alone. \nSecondly: \nThe closest we can find on this matter is what was quoted by the scholars of our madhhab from the report from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), according to the report of Hanbal, al-Fadl and al-Harbi, the isnaad of which we cannot find, about saying the u`a for completing the Quran in Taraweeh prayer before bowing. \nAccording to another report narrated from him – the source of which is not known – he allowed it in the u`a of Witr. \nSee Marwiyaat u`a Khatm al-Quran. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, there is a dua (supplication) that is often recited after completing the Quran. While there isn't a specific dua recorded in hadith that is universally prescribed for this occasion, many scholars and practicing Muslims recommend a general supplication thanking Allah for the opportunity to complete the Quran and asking for its intercession and guidance.\n\nOne commonly cited dua for after completing the Quran is as follows:\n\n**\"Allahumma inni as'aluka bi haqqi al-Qur'an al-`Azheem, wa bi haqqi al-ladhi alayka qad qara'tahu, an taj'alahu li wa li awladi wa li man alsaq bi al-Qur'an wa li jamia' al-muslimin.\"**\n\nThis translates roughly to: \"O Allah, I ask You by the right of the Mighty Quran, and by the right of the one who has recited it, to make it (the Quran) a means of guidance for me, my children, and for all Muslims.\"\n\nAdditionally, it is encouraged to make any personal supplications (duas) after completing the Quran, asking Allah for understanding, guidance, and the ability to act upon its teachings.\n\nCompleting the Quran is a significant achievement, and it is a good practice to engage in reflection and supplication at this time."

        "question": "They read Qur’aan before Taraaweeh prayer then complete it in the prayer",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\n      There is nothing wrong with you having this gathering. For \n      one person to read Qur’aan whilst the others listen is something that is \n      prescribed in sharee’ah; the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n      be upon him) and his companions did that. \n\n    It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said \n    to me: “Recite Qur’aan for me.” I said: “O Messenger of Allaah, should I \n    recite it to you when it was revealed to you?” He said: “I like to hear it \n    from someone else.” So I recited Soorat al-Nisa’ to him, until I reached \n    this verse (interpretation of the meaning): \n\n    “How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a \n    witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people?”\n\n    [al-Nisa’ 4:41]\nHe said, “That’s enough \n    for now.” And he turned to me with his eyes flowing with tears. \n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4763; Muslim, 800. \n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz said: \n\n    It is prescribed for the Muslims during this blessed month to \n    study the Qur’aan together, day and night, following the example of the \n    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with whom Jibreel \n    used to study the Qur’aan every year in Ramadaan, and he studied it with him \n    twice in the last year of his life, and with the aim of drawing closer to \n    Allaah, and pondering the meanings of the Book of Allaah in order to benefit \n    from it and act upon it. This is the way of the righteous salaf and the \n    believers, male and female, should occupy themselves with the Qur’aan, \n    reciting it, pondering its meanings and referring to the books of tafseer in \n    order to benefit from it and learn more. \n\n    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, \n    11/319, 320. \nIt is better when reading \n    Qur’aan to also learn the rulings of the Qur’aan, and understand it \n    meanings. So if you add to reading some tafseer (commentary) on what you \n    read or on part of it, then you will combine many good things, such as \n    following the Sunnah, studying the Qur’aan together, teaching the Muslims \n    and helping them to ponder the Qur’aan. \n\n    If this completion of the Qur’aan is done in Taraaweeh prayer \n    that is better than it being done outside the prayer. \n\n    Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra \n    (2/297): \nThe command and \n    encouragement to recite Qur’aan applies more to the one who is praying than \n    to anyone else, for reciting the Qur’aan in prayer is better than reciting \n    it outside of prayer. The reports which speak of the virtue of the one who \n    recites Qur’aan refer to the one who is praying more than anyone else. End \n    quote. \n\n    If it is difficult for the people to complete the Qur’aan in \n    the prayer, they can combine two good things: studying the Qur’aan before \n    the prayer, and reciting the rest during the prayer, as you are doing. \n\n    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with \n    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be \n    upon him) was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous \n    during Ramadaan when Jibreel would meet with him. He would meet him on every \n    night of Ramadaan and study the Qur’aan with him. And the Messenger of \n    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was as generous as \n    the wind in doing good. \n\n    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3048; Muslim, 2308. \n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was asked: \n\n    Can it be understood from the fact that Jibreel (peace be \n    upon him) studied Qur’aan with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of \n    Allaah be upon him) every night in Ramadaan, that it is good to complete the \n    Qur’aan (in this month)? \n\n    He replied: \n\n    It may be understood that it is mustahabb to study the \n    Qur’aan and that the believer should study it with those who will benefit \n    him and help him, because the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) studied with Jibreel (peace be upon him) for a reason, because \n    Jibreel was the one who had brought it from Allaah, so he was the emissary \n    between Allaah and the Messengers. \n\n    Undoubtedly the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah \n    be upon him) would benefit from his study with Jibreel, such as learning the \n    variant recitations (huroof) of the Qur’aan and the meanings intended by \n    Allaah. If a person studies with someone who will help him to understand the \n    Qur’aan and help him to pronounce it properly, this is what is desirable, \n    just as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) studied \n    it with Jibreel. The point is not that Jibreel was better than the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but Jibreel was the \n    messenger who brought it from Allaah and conveyed to the Messenger  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that which Allaah had commanded \n    him, namely the Qur’aan and its pronunciation and meanings. So the Prophet \n     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) benefited from Jibreel in \n    these ways. This does not mean that Jibreel was better than the Prophet  \n    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for he is the best of mankind \n    and is better than the angels. But there was a great deal of goodness in \n    their studying the Qur’aan together, for the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and for the ummah, because it was studying \n    what had come from Allaah in order to benefit from what had come from \n    Allaah. \n\n    There is another benefit in that, which is that studying \n    together at night is better than doing so during the day, because this study \n    used to take place at night, and it is known that the night is better for \n    studying than the day because one is better able to focus and concentrate \n    then. \n\n    Another benefit is that studying together is prescribed in \n    sharee’ah, and it is a righteous deed even if it is done at times other than \n    Ramadaan, because it benefits both parties. Even if there are more than two, \n    it doesn’t matter, because each of them can benefit from his brothers and \n    they can encourage one another to read. It may be that a person would not be \n    motivated to read if he sits on his own, but if he has a companion or \n    companions to study with him, that will encourage him to read, as well as \n    the benefits they will all share of studying and learning together. \n\n    It may be understood from that that the imam’s reading the \n    whole Qur’aan to the congregation during Ramadaan is a kind of this studying \n    together, because it enables them to listen to the whole Qur’aan. Hence Imam \n    Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) liked the one who was leading them in \n    prayer to complete the Qur’aan with them. This is akin to the practice of \n    the salaf who used to like to hear the whole of the Qur’aan, but this does \n    not mean that he should hasten and rush and not be deliberate in his reading \n    and humble, focused and at ease in his prayer. Rather paying attention to \n    these matters is more important than reciting the entire Qur’aan. \n\n    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, \n    11/331-333 \n\n    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    was also asked: \n\n    Many imams are keen to complete the Qur’aan in Taraaweeh and \n    they strive to let the congregation hear the entire Qur’aan. Is there \n    anything wrong with that? \n\n    He replied: \n\n    This is a good deed, so the imam may recite a juz’ or less \n    each night, then read more during the last ten nights so as to complete the \n    Qur’aan. This applies if it is easy for him to do so and will not cause any \n    hardship… The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) \n    wrote a chapter in his book Jala’ al-Afhaam fi’l-Salaati wa’l-Salaam ‘ala \n    Khayr al-Anaam, in which he described how the salaf were keen to \n    complete the Qur’aan; we advise you to read this chapter in order to learn \n    more. \n\n    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, \n    11/333, 334. \n\n    See also the answers to questions no. \n    46088, \n    1505, \n    4039. \n\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the context of Taraweeh prayers during the month of Ramadan, it is common for Muslims to recite portions of the Qur'an before the prayer. The purpose of this practice is to prepare spiritually for the prayer and to increase the amount of Qur'anic recitation during this blessed month.\n\nWhen leading or participating in Taraweeh prayers, the recitation of the Qur'an is a central element. It is encouraged to complete the Qur'an through Taraweeh prayers during Ramadan, and that can be achieved by reciting it over the course of the month. \n\nThere is no specific requirement to read the Qur'an before Taraweeh prayers; however, if the congregation or individuals choose to do so, it can be seen as a beneficial practice. This pre-prayer recitation can help set the tone and enhance focus, but it is not an obligatory part of the prayer itself.\n\nIn summary, it is acceptable and often encouraged to read the Qur'an before Taraweeh prayers as a form of preparation, and the completion of the Qur'an during Taraweeh prayers is a commendable goal for many worshippers during Ramadan."

        "question": "Can You Listen to the Quran while Sleeping?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can you listen to Quran while sleeping?\nThere is nothing wrong with a Muslim listening to Quran before he sleeps , or listening to a lecture or anything permissible. Indeed it is narrated in the sahih Sunnah that among the adhkar to be recited before going to sleep are some du`as and verses and Surahs from the Quran . \nAl-Bukhari said: \nChapter: Seeking refuge with Allah and reciting Quran when going to sleep \n`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would blow into his hands and recite the Mu’awwadhat, and wipe his body with them. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5960)\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed me to guard the zakah of Ramadan, and someone came and started to rummage in the food. I took hold of him and said: “I am going to take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)”… And he said: “When you go to your bed, recite Ayat al-Kursi, and you will have ongoing protection from Allah and no devil will come near you until morning comes.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He spoke the truth even though he is a liar; that was a devil.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3101) \nBenefits of listening to Quran while sleeping\nListening to Quran before going to sleep and after, during Ramadan and at other times, instills tranquility in the heart and helps one relax. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  \n“Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.” [Al-Ra’d 13:28]\nFor more, please see these answers: 14590 , 78370 , 124657 , and 228366 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, it is permissible to listen to the Quran while sleeping in Islam. Many scholars agree that listening to the Quran can be beneficial, as it may help one reflect upon its meanings and strengthen their connection to Allah even in a state of rest.

        "question": "Which is better, reading Qur’aan together or individually?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah \n    have mercy on him) said: \nFirstly: \nWith regard to how he reviewed it with him, I \n    do not know how that was done. \nSecondly: \nWith regard to whether it is mustahabb for \n    people to gather to read Qur’aan together or for each person to read it individually, that depends on the person himself. If gathering with his \n    brothers to study Qur’aan together will make him more focused and help him to learn better, then gathering with others is preferable, i.e., if \n    gathering with others will make him have proper presence of mind and be more focused on pondering the meanings of the Qur’aan, and allow the \n    opportunity to discuss the meanings, then that is better. But if it is the opposite then reading it on his own is better. \nThirdly: \nWith regard to Jibreel reviewing the Qur’aan \n    with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that was for the purpose of making sure that the Prophet  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) memorized it.  \nWith regard to the third part of your \n    question – which is whether it is better to do that at night rather than during the day – the answer is yes, but a person may need to do other \n    things which means that he cannot study Qur’aan at night, in which case he should study it more during the day. \nSo each person should look at what is best for him, because of the general meaning of the \n    words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Strive to do that which will benefit you.” So whatever is more beneficial \n    for you, so long as it is not forbidden according to sharee’ah, is best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, both individual and collective recitation of the Qur’an have their own merits and benefits.\n\n**Reading Qur’an Individually:**\n1. **Personal Connection:** Reading alone allows for personal reflection, contemplation, and a deeper connection to the text.\n2. **Pacing:** Individuals can read at their own pace, allowing them to focus on understanding and pondering the meanings.\n3. **Flexibility:** Personal reading can be done at any time and anywhere, fitting into one's schedule.\n\n**Reading Qur’an Together:**\n1. **Community Bonding:** Reciting the Qur’an in a group fosters a sense of community and strengthens bonds among participants.\n2. **Collective Blessings:** The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) highlighted the virtue of gathering to recite and reflect on the Qur’an together.\n3. **Support and Encouragement:** Reciting together can motivate individuals to maintain consistency in their recitation and understanding.\n\nUltimately, both practices are commendable and beneficial. It is recommended to engage in both individual and communal recitation when possible, as they complement each other and fulfill different spiritual and communal needs."

        "question": "He claims that the Qur’aan is lacking in eloquence and contains grammatical errors",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nThe one who is not able to engage in debate \n    with others should fear Allaah and not get involved in debates and arguments with others; rather he should try to protect his religious commitment \n    by refraining from arguing with the ignorant or those who promote specious arguments.  \nSecondly: \nWith regard to the specious arguments \n    mentioned – which are more flimsy than a spider’s web – these may be answered in two ways. \nThe first way is in general terms, which is \n    to say that the Qur’aan is the Book of Allaah which was revealed to the pure Arabs, who were the most advanced nation in the field of eloquence; \n    they paid a great deal of attention to that and had reached a high level of eloquent self-expression. They had established festivals of poetry and \n    speech-giving, they hung their mu’allaqaat poems on the Ka’bah as a sign of the high esteem in which they held eloquence and literature; they \n    competed in poetry and beautiful speech. Poetry flowed through their veins and they recited poems on all occasions, for joy and sorrow, birth and \n    death, happiness and misery, victory and defeat. This was something that was unknown in any other nation. \nHence by His wisdom Allaah revealed to them \n    this Qur’aan in this language of which they were so proud and because of which they thought themselves superior to other nations. The Qur’aan \n    dazzled them with its beautiful words and meanings, its great purpose and structure. So they submitted to it out of respect for its language and \n    dare not speak any word of criticism against its wording, grammar or expression.  \nAllaah challenged them in His Book to produce \n    anything like the Qur’aan, but they could not match it, let alone find fault with its grammar. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Say: ‘If the mankind and the jinn were \n    together to produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another’”\n    [al-Isra’ 17:88]\nThen Allaah challenged them to produced ten \n    soorahs like it, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Or they say, ‘He (Prophet Muhammad) \n    forged it (the Qur’aan).’ Say: ‘Bring you then ten forged Soorah (chapters) like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allaah (to your \n    help), if you speak the truth!’”\n[Hood 11:13]\nWhen they were unable to do that, then Allaah \n    challenged them to produce just one soorah like it. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and \n    Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur’aan) to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a Soorah (chapter) of \n    the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allaah, if you are truthful”\n[al-Baqarah 2:23]\nNo one who comes afterwards, when the \n    language has become corrupted and mixed with foreign languages, has any right to support such nonsensical ideas that do no more than point to the \n    depth of his ignorance and the shallowness of his thinking, and his lack of knowledge of the Arabic language. As it was said,  \n“How often do you see someone criticizing \n    something that is sound, and his problem is that he cannot understand it properly.” \nThe second way is in specific, detailed \n    terms, discussing the aspects of eloquence in the words that he criticized. This is as follows: \nWith regard to the words of Allaah \n    (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Some you disbelieved and some you killed \n    (fafareeqan kadhdhabtum wa fareeqan taqtuloon)”\n[al-Baqarah 2:87]\nThe scholar al-Taahir ibn ‘Ashoor said in his \n    commentary (al-Tahreer wa’l-Tanweer, 1/598): \nThe word taqtuloon (translated as “you \n    killed”) appears in the present tense form to emphasize more vividly the terrible action that they did, namely killing the Prophets. This is like \n    the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And it is Allaah Who sends [arsala – part \n    tense form] the winds, so that they raise up [fa tutheeru – present tense form] the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land, and revive therewith \n    the earth after its death”\n[Faatir 35:9]\nMoreover, the form taqtuloon fits with \n    the rhyme of the soorah and makes it more vivid; this provides eloquence of meaning and beauty of form. End of quote. \nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen quoted in his \n    Tasfeer (1/283) from some of the scholars another reason for using the present tense form taqtuloon, which is to provide a sense of \n    continuity, i.e., the Jews kept on killing the Prophets, even the last of them, Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They \n    killed the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the poison that they gave him at Khaybar, and he  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) continued to suffer the effects of that until, in his final illness, he said, “I still feel pain from the food I \n    ate at Khaybar. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.” \nAbu Dawood; also narrated by al-Bukhaari in a \n    mu’allaq report. Al-Albaani said in Saheeh Abi Dawood (3784), it is hasan saheeh. \nWith regard to the verse in which Allaah says \n     \n(interpretation of the meaning):\n“When \n    He has decreed something, He says to it only: ‘Be!’ __and \n    it is [kun fa yakoon]”\n[Aal ‘Imraan 3:47]\nThis is more indicative of the ignorance of \n    this objector, because this verse is speaking of when Allaah wills to create something in the future, not in the past; this is to be understood \n    from the use of the word idha (meaning when, if), which refers to something in the future. Hence the verb yaqool (says) appears in \n    the present tense, to indicate that it is referring to something in the future, and it is followed by the verb yakoon (it is), also in the \n    present tense, which also refers to something in the future. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, the Qur’an is considered the literal word of God (Allah) revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Angel Gabriel. One of the key attributes of the Qur’an is its unparalleled eloquence and linguistic perfection, which is regarded as a miracle in itself. Muslims believe that the Qur’an is free from errors, whether grammatical or otherwise, due to its divine origin.\n\nTo claim that the Qur’an lacks eloquence or contains grammatical errors is considered an incorrect assertion in Islamic teachings. Many scholars and linguists have studied the Qur’an and acknowledged its eloquence, intricate structure, and rhetorical devices, which convey profound meanings.\n\nIn response to such claims, it is often encouraged to approach the Qur’an with an open mind and to seek understanding through study and reflection. Engaging with knowledgeable scholars, reading interpretations (Tafsir), and considering the historical and linguistic context can help clarify any misunderstandings regarding the language and style of the Qur’an.\n\nAdditionally, the Qur’an itself challenges those who doubt its eloquence and authenticity to produce a similarly perfect text (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:23) as a way to demonstrate its uniqueness and unmatched literary quality."

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In prayer, it is better to recite from memory. See question no. 3465. \nOutside of prayer, it is better for a person to do that which will increase his khushoo’ (humility, focus). If his khushoo’ will be increased by reciting from memory, then that is better; if his khushoo’ will be increased by reading from the Mus-haf, then that is better. If it is the same in either case, then reading from the Mus-haf is better, because it combines reading and looking, and his eyes will be protected from looking at things that may distract him from reciting and pondering the meaning. \nAl-Nawawi said in al-Adhkaar (p. 90-91): \nReading Quran from the Mus-haf is better than reciting from memory; this is the view of our companions and it is well known from the salaf (may Allah be pleased with them). This does not apply in all cases however; if the reader can focus and ponder the meanings more when reciting from memory than when reading from the Mus-haf, then reciting from memory is better. If it is the same in both cases, then reading from the Mus-haf is better. This is what the salaf meant. \nThere are weak (da’eef) ahaadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which cannot be used as proof that it is better to look at the Mus-haf. We mention them only to draw attention to the fact that they are weak. These include: \n“Looking at the Mus-haf is an act of worship; for a child to look at his parents is an act of worship; looking at ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib is an act of worship.” This is a fabricated (mawdoo’) hadith, as al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 1/531. \n“Give your eyes their share of worship: looking at the Mus-haf, thinking about it and pondering its wonders.” This is also fabricated (mawdoo’). Al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 4/88. \n“Five things are acts of worship: eating little, sitting in the mosque, looking at the Ka’bah, looking at the Mus-haf and looking at the face of a scholar.” This is a very weak (da’eef jiddan) hadith.

Each has its own virtues and benefits.\n\n1. **Reciting from Memory (Hifz)**: \n   - Memorizing the Quran is highly regarded in Islam, and those who commit the Quran to memory are given elevated status. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"The best of you are those who learn the Quran and teach it\" (Sahih al-Bukhari).\n   - Reciting from memory allows a person to engage more deeply with the text and focus on the meanings without looking at the words.\n\n2. **Reading from the Mus-haf**: \n   - Reading from the Mus-haf is also significant, especially for those who may not have memorized the Quran completely. It ensures correctness in recitation and helps maintain the integrity of the text.\n   - It is often recommended for people who are still learning or for those who wish to follow the proper rules of Tajweed.\n\nIn conclusion, both methods are encouraged, and the choice may depend on one's personal circumstances and ability. Ideally, a combination of both—memorization and reading—can be beneficial. The key is to engage sincerely with the Quran, seeking to understand and apply its teachings."

        "question": "Are precious stones mentioned in the Qur’aan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The primary purpose of the Qur’aan is to \n    guide mankind to Allaah, so that they will affirm His Oneness and worship Him alone, and attain His Paradise and His pleasure. The Qur’aan is not \n    a book of science, medicine or astronomy, even though its verses may contain a little of such things. \nHence the Muslim should not let himself be \n    distracted from the greater purpose of reciting the Qur’aan and look for the number of stones or rivers or kinds of animals mentioned therein. \nSome precious stones such as rubies, pearls \n    and coral are mentioned in the Qur’aan. \nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“(In beauty) they are like rubies and \n    coral”\n[al-Rahmaan 55:58] \n“Out of them both come out pearl and \n    coral”\n[al-Rahmaan 55:22] \n“Like unto preserved pearls”\n[al-Waaqi’ah 56:23] \n“And round about them will (serve) boys of \n    everlasting youth. If you see them, you would think them scattered pearls”\n[al-Insaan 76:19]\nThese stones do not have any spiritual significance, rather they are mentioned in the Qur’aan \n    to explain the blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon His slaves, of the seas and the things that are brought forth from them, or as a metaphor – \n    so al-hoor al-‘iyn are likened to rubies, coral and preserved pearls, combining the purity of rubies and the whiteness of pearls and \n    coral. \nThe boys are likened to scattered pearls, to \n    indicate their beauty and good looks. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, precious stones are mentioned in the Qur'an. In several verses, Allah describes the treasures of Paradise, which include various precious stones and materials. For example, in Surah Al-Insan (76:15-16), it mentions that inhabitants of Paradise will be served with vessels of silver and cups made of crystal, which can be interpreted as reflecting the beauty of precious materials. Additionally, the Qur'an indirectly references precious stones as part of Allah's creation, showcasing the beauty of the world around us. While specific stones are not named, the beauty and value associated with them are implied in the descriptions of divine blessings and the rewards of Paradise."

        "question": "Who Wrote the Quran?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allah promised to preserve the Quran\nAllah has guaranteed to preserve this Quran Himself . Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]\nIbn Jareer al-Tabari said in his Tafseer, 14/8: \n“Allah is saying, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (Reminder), i.e. the Quran, and We will guard the Quran against anything false being added to it that is not part of it, or anything that is part of it being taken away, whether that has to do with rulings, hudood punishments or matters having to do with inheritance.” \nAl-Sa’di said in his Tafseer (p. 696): \n“It is We Who have sent down the Quran in which there is mention of all issues and clear evidence, and in which We remind those who want to be reminded.  \n“and surely, We will guard it” means, when it is being revealed and after it has been revealed. When it is revealed, We protect it from the tampering of every accursed devil, and after it has been revealed Allah instilled it in the heart of His Messenger. Allah protected the words from being changed and from anything being added or taken away, or from its meanings being distorted. So no one can attempt to distort its meanings but Allah will guide someone to explain the truth of the Quran. This is one of the greatest signs of Allah and His blessing to His believing slaves. Another aspect of this protection is that Allah protects the people of the Quran against their enemies, and no enemy can overpower them and eliminate them.”  \nThe Quran was revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in stages over a period of twenty-three years. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And (it is) a Quran which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages'' [al-Isra’ 17:106]\nal-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \n“This means, We have revealed this Quran in stages, to differentiate between guidance and misguidance, between truth and falsehood.\n “in order that you might recite it to men at intervals” means, slowly, so that they may ponder and think about its meanings, and understand the different branches of knowledge contained therein. \n“And We have revealed it by stages” means, gradually, over a period of twenty-three years.” Tafseer al-Sa’di, p. 760. \nLiteracy was not widespread among the Arabs \nLiteracy was not widespread among the Arabs. Allah described them in such terms when He said (interpretation of the meaning): \n“He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad) from among themselves” [al-Jumu’ah 63:2]\nThey used to memorize the Quran by heart, and a few of them used to write down some verses or surahs on animal skins, thin white stones and the like. \nThe prohibition to write anything other than the Quran\nAt first the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the writing of anything other than the Quran, and he forbade them to write down his words for a while, so that the Sahabah would focus on memorizing the Quran and writing it down, and so that the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would not be confused with the words of Allah, and so the Quran was protected from anything being added or taken away. \nThe Prophetic order to write down the revelation\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed a group of his Companions who were trustworthy and knowledgeable to write down the revelation . They are known in their biographies as those who wrote down the Revelation, such as the four Caliphs, ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, Mu’awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, Zayd ibn Thabit and others – may Allah be pleased with them all. \nThe Quran was revealed in seven dialects\nThe Quran was revealed in seven dialects as was narrated in the saheeh hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This was narrated by al-Bukhari (2287) and Muslim (818); these were the dialects of the Arabs which were known for their eloquence. \nHow was the Quran compiled?\nThe Quran continued to be preserved in the hearts of the Sahabah who had memorized it, and on the skins and other materials until the time of the caliph Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him). \nDuring the Riddah wars many of the Sahabah who had memorized the Quran were killed, and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) was afraid that the Quran would be lost. So he consulted the senior Sahabah about compiling the Quran in a single book so that it would remain preserved and would not be lost. He entrusted this mission to the chief of memorizers Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him). Al-Bukhari narrated in his Saheeh (4986) that Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said:  \nAbu Bakr al-Siddeeq sent for me when the people of al-Yamamah had been killed [i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against the false prophet Musaylimah]. (I went to him) and found ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), “ ‘Umar has come to me and said: ‘Casualties were heavy among the Qurra of the Quran (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the battle of al-Yamamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Quran may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you (Abu Bakr) order that the Quran be collected.” I said to 'Umar, \"How can you do something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do?\" 'Umar said, \"By Allah, this is something good.\" 'Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my heart to it and I began to realize the good in the idea which 'Umar had realized.\" Then Abu Bakr said (to me). “You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). So search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Quran and compile it in one book.\" By Allah If they had ordered me to move one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to compile the Quran. Then I said (to Abu Bakr), \"How can you do something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"By Allah, it is a good thing.\" Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my heart to that to which He had opened the hearts of Abu Bakr and 'Umar. So I started looking for the Quran and collecting it from (what it was written on) palm stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, until I found the last Verse of Surah al-Taubah with Abu Khuzaymah al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The verse is (interpretation of the meaning):  \n\"Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty...” [al-Taubah 9:128] until the end of Surat Bara'ah (i.e., al-Taubah).  \nThen the complete manuscript (copy) of the Quran remained with Abu Bakr until he died, then with 'Umar until the end of his life, and then with Hafsah, the daughter of 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). \nThe Sahabi Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) knew the Quran by heart but he was methodical in his confirmation; he would not agree to write down any verse until two of the Sahabah testified that they had heard it from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  \nWhat was the Quran copy of ‘Uthman?\nThis Mus-haf (written copy of the Quran) remained in the hands of the caliphs until the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliph ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him). The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) had dispersed to different lands, and they used to recite the Quran according to what they had heard of the seven recitations from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and each of their students used to recite according to what he had heard from his shaykh.\nIf a student heard someone reciting in a manner different from what he knew, he would denounce him and accuse him of making a mistake, and this went on until the Sahabah feared that there would be fitnah (trouble) between the Tabi'een and successive generations. So they thought that they should unite the people in following one recitation, which was in the dialect of Quraysh in which the Quran had first been revealed, so as to dispel any disputes and resolve the matter. ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) was consulted, and he agreed with this opinion. \nAl-Bukhari narrated in his Saheeh (4988) from Anas ibn Malik that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman came to ‘Uthman at the time when the people of Sham (Syria) and the people of Iraq were waging war to conquer Armenia and Azerbaijan. Hudhayfah was alarmed by their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Quran, so he said to 'Uthman, \"O Ameer al-Mu’mineen! Save this nation before they dispute about the Book (Quran) as the Jews and the Christians did before.\" So 'Uthman sent a message to Hafsah saying, \"Send us the manuscript of the Quran so that we may make copies of the Mus-haf and we will return the manuscript to you.\"  \nHafsah sent it to 'Uthman. Then 'Uthman ordered Zayd ibn Thabit, 'Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr, Sa’eed ibn al-‘As and ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Harith ibn Hisham to copy out the manuscripts. 'Uthman said to the three men who were from Quraysh (the tribe of which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a member), “In case you disagree with Zayd ibn Thabit on any point in the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraysh, for the Quran was revealed in their tongue.\" They did so, and when they had written many copies, 'Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsah.  \n'Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Quranic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt.  \nIbn Shihab said: Kharijah ibn Zayd ibn Thabit told me that he heard Zayd ibn Thabit say: “When we made copies of the Mus-haf I missed a verse of al-Ahzab that I used to hear the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recite. So we searched for it and we found it with Khuzaymah ibn Taabit al-Ansari. (The verse was) ‘Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah’ [al-Ahzab 33:23 – interpretation of the meaning]. So we put it in its place in its surah in the Mus-haf.”\nThus an end was put to dispute and the Muslims were united. The Quran has remained and will remain narrated from generation to generation and preserved in men's hearts until the Day of Resurrection. This is how Allah has preserved His Book, in confirmation of the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]\n And Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, the Quran is considered to be the literal word of God (Allah) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning in 610 CE and ending in 632 CE, the year of his passing. Muslims believe that the Quran was not authored by Muhammad but was conveyed to him through the Angel Gabriel (Jibril). After the revelations were received, they were memorized by Muhammad and his companions, and eventually compiled into the book form we have today. \n\nTherefore, in Islamic theology, it is incorrect to say that any human \"wrote\" the Quran; it is viewed as the divine revelation from God."

        "question": "The Quran is a healing and a mercy to the believers",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Quran is the word of Allah that was revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and is recited as an act of worship.  \nThis definition of the Quran is comprehensive.  \nOur saying “the word of Allah” excludes the words of human beings or others. \nOur saying “revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)” excludes anything that was revealed to anyone else, such as the Injeel (Gospel), Tawraat (Torah) and Zaboor (Psalms). \nOur saying “it is recited as an act of worship” excludes the hadeeth qudsi (ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) narrated words from Allah which are not part of the Quran). \nIt brings light and gives certainty, it is the strong rope, it is the path of the righteous. It tells us of those who came before us, Prophets and righteous people, and how those who disobeyed them tasted the punishment of Allah and were humiliated. It contains verses which speak of the miracles of Allah and His power in this great universe. It tells us of the origins of human beings who are created from “despised water” (semen). It contains the basic principles of faith which must be embraced by every humble heart. It contains the rules of sharee’ah which tells us what is permissible and what is forbidden; what is true and what is false. It tells us of the Resurrection and the fate of human beings, either in the Fire in which they will burn and be among those who are humiliated, or in Paradise with its gardens, springs, plants and places of security. \nIn it there is healing for men’s hearts, light and illumination for the blind. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism and act on it), and it increases the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) nothing but loss” [al-Isra’ 17:82]\nAl-Haafiz Ibn Katheer said in his commentary on this verse: \nHere Allah tells us about His Book, which He revealed to His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and which is the Quran which “Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise” [Fussilat 42:41- interpretation of the meaning], that it is “a healing and a mercy to those who believe” – i.e., it takes away the diseases in the heart such as doubt, hypocrisy, shirk, deviation and misguidance; the Quran heals all of that. And it is also a mercy which brings about faith, wisdom and the pursuit of and desire for goodness. This is only for those who believe in it and follow it; for such it will be a healing and a mercy. But as for the kaafir and those who wrong themselves thereby, their hearing the Quran only makes them further away (from truth) and increases them in kufr. The problem comes from the kaafir, not from the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Say: It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Quran) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand)” [Fussilat 41:44]\n“And whenever there comes down a Soorah, some of them (hypocrites) say: ‘Which of you has had his Faith increased by it?’ As for those who believe, it has increased their Faith, and they rejoice.\nBut as for those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubt, disbelief and hypocrisy), it will add suspicion and doubt to their suspicion, disbelief and doubt; and they die while they are disbelievers”\n[al-Tawbah 9:124-125]\nQutaadah said, concerning the phrase “And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe”: when the believer hears it he benefits from it, memorizes it and understands it. “and it increases the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) nothing but loss” means, they do not benefit from it, memorize it or understand it. Allah has made this Quran a healing and a mercy for the believers.\"(Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/60). \nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Quran, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your breasts, — a guidance and a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers” [Yoonus 10:57] \n“And if We had sent this as a Quran in a foreign language (other than Arabic), they would have said: ‘Why are not its verses explained in detail (in our language)? What! (A Book) not in Arabic and (the Messenger) an Arab?’ Say: ‘It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Quran) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand)’” [Fussilat 41:44]\nIn it is guidance for mankind, away from misguidance and to the truth. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“This is the Book (the Quran), whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqoon [the pious” [al-Baqarah 2:2] \n“And thus We have revealed to you (O Muhammad) a Quran in Arabic that you may warn the Mother of the Towns (Makkah) and all around it, and warn (them) of the Day of Assembling of which there is no doubt, when a party will be in Paradise (those who believed in Allah and followed what Allah’s Messenger brought them) and a party in the blazing Fire (Hell) (those who disbelieved in Allah and followed not what Allah’s Messenger brought them)” [al-Shoora 42:9] \n“And thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad) Rooh (a revelation, and a mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made it (this Quran) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will. And verily, you (O Muhammad) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e. Allah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism).\nThe path of Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Verily, all matters at the end go to Allah (for decision)” [al-Shoora 42:52-53]\nIt contains innumerable benefits, so everyone who seeks happiness in this world and in the Hereafter must refer to it for judgement and follow its commands.  \nImam Ibn Hazm said:\nBecause the proof and the miracles indicate that the Quran is the covenant of Allah with us, we must believe in it and act in accordance with it. It has come down to us through generations of Muslims narrating it to those who came after them, which leaves no room for doubt that the Quran is the one which is written in the Mus-hafs which we find everywhere. We have to follow its teachings, for it is our reference-point, because we read in it the words (interpretation of the meaning): \n“There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered” [al-An’aam 6:38]\nWhatever commands and prohibitions are in the Quran, we must adhere to them.\"(Al-Ihkaam, 1/92)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, in Islam, the Quran is indeed considered a healing and a mercy to the believers. This concept is highlighted in several verses of the Quran. For example, in Surah Al-Isra (17:82), it is stated: \n\n**\"And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to the believers...\"**\n\nThis verse indicates that the Quran serves as a source of spiritual and emotional healing, offering guidance, comfort, and support to those who believe in its message. Additionally, the Quran addresses various aspects of human life and encourages believers to seek solace in its teachings, fostering a sense of peace and reassurance. Therefore, many Muslims regard the Quran not only as a religious text but also as a means of personal and communal healing."

        "question": "Distortion of the Quran by the Raafidis",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.With regard to Soorat al-Wilaayah, some of the Shi’ah scholars and imams have stated that it exists. Any of them who denies that does so by way of taqiyah (dissimulation). One of those who clearly stated that it exists is Mirza Hussein Muhammad Taqiy al-Noori al-Tubrusi (d. 1320 AH). He wrote a book in which he claimed that the Quran had been distorted and that the Sahaabah has concealed some parts of it, including Soorat al-Wilaayah. The Raafidis honoured him after his death by burying him in al-Najaf. This book by al-Tubrusi was published in Iran in 1298 AH, and when it was published there was a great deal of controversy because they wanted the doubts about the validity of the Quran, which were known only to their leaders, to remain scattered throughout hundreds of their major books, and they did not want that to be compiled in one book. At the beginning of his book he said:  \n“This is a good and noble book entitled Fasl al-khitaab fi ithbaat tahreef Kitaab Rabb il-Arbaab (Decisive comment on the distortion of the Book of the Lord of Lords)… He mentioned aayahs and soorahs which he claims that the Sahaabah concealed, including ‘Soorat al-Wilaayah,’” the text of which, according to them, and as quoted in this book, is: \n“O you who believe, believe in the Prophet and the Wali [i.e., ‘Ali] whom We have sent to guide you to the straight path, a Prophet and a Wali who are part of one another, and I am the All-Knowing, All-Aware…”  \nAnd they have another soorah which they call Soorat al-Noorayn: “O you who believe, believe in the two lights (al-noorayn) which We have sent down to you to recite to you My Verses and to warn you of the punishment of a great Day. They are part of one another and I am the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. Those who fulfil the covenant with Allah and His Messenger mentioned in the verses (of the Quran), the Gardens of delight will be theirs, but those who disbelieve after they believed by breaking their covenant and disobeying the command of the Prophet, they will be thrown into Hell. They have wronged themselves and gone against the wasiyyah of the Prophet (i.e., the appointment of ‘Ali as khaleefah), and they will be given to drink of boiling water…” and other such nonsense. \nProf. Muhammad ‘Ali Sa’oodi – who was one of the greatest experts of the Ministry of Justice in Egypt – examined an Iranian mus-haf kept by the Orientalist Bryan and he obtained a copy of this soorah; above the lines of Arabic script there is written the translation in the Iranian language. \nAs it was mentioned by al-Tubrusi in his book, Fasl al-khitaab fi ithbaat tahreef Kitaab Rabb il-Arbaab, it is also mentioned in their book Dabastan Madhaahib, which is in Farsi, written by Muhsin Faani al-Kashmiri. This book has been printed numerous times in Iran, and this false soorah was quoted from it by the Orientalist Noeldeke in his book The History of Qur’anic Manuscripts, 2/120, and was published by the French Asian newspaper in 1842 (p. 431-439). \nIt was also mentioned by Mirza Habibullaah al-Haashimi al-Kho’i in his book Manhaaj al-Baraa’ah fi Sharh Nahj al-Balaaghah (2/217); and by Muhammad Baaqir al-Majlisi in his book Tadhkirat al-A’immah (p. 19, 20) in Farsi, (published by) Manshoorat Mawlana, Iran. \nSee also al-Khutoot al-‘Areedah li’l-Asas allati qaama ‘alayha deen al-Shi’ah by Muhibb al-Deen al-Khateeb. \nThis claim of theirs is a denial of the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”\n[al-Hijr 15:9]\nHence the Muslims are unanimously agreed that anyone who claims that anything in the Quran has been altered or changed is a kaafir. \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: \nThe same applies to those among them who claim that some verses of the Quran have been taken away or concealed, or who claim to have some esoteric interpretations that exempt him from having to do the actions prescribed in sharee’ah etc., who are called al-Qaraamitah and al-Baatiniyyah, and who include al-Tanaasukhiyyah [names of esoteric sects]. There is no dispute that they are kaafirs. \nAl-Saarim al-Maslool, 3/1108-1110. \nIbn Hazm said: \nThe view that the Quran has been altered is blatant kufr and is a rejection of what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said. \nAl-Fasl fi’l-Ahwa’ wa’-Milal wa’l-Nihal, 4/139. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic discourse, the term \"Raafidis\" (or Rafidis) is often used to refer to certain groups within Shia Islam, particularly those who may reject or distance themselves from the first three caliphs and hold specific views about leadership in the Muslim community. As with any group, it's important to approach discussions about beliefs and practices with respect and a nuanced understanding.\n\nRegarding the accusation of the distortion of the Quran, it is a significant claim made by some Sunni scholars against certain Shia beliefs. The mainstream Shia belief holds that the Quran is the unchanged word of God and has not been altered in any form. However, detractors sometimes allege that certain interpretations or beliefs held by some individuals within the Shia community suggest a difference in the understanding of the Quran's text or its compilation.\n\nFrom a scholarly perspective, it's crucial to rely on historical texts and established theological discussions. The belief in the preservation and integrity of the Quran is a fundamental aspect of both Sunni and Shia Islam, and any claims of distortion must be addressed with careful reference to sources and scholarly commentary.\n\nInterfaith dialogue and understanding are also important, as divisions can lead to misunderstandings. For Muslims of all backgrounds, the Quran remains a revered text, and discussions should promote understanding rather than division. \n\nIf you are seeking more detailed theological insight or specific references, I would recommend consulting with qualified scholars or reading sourced literature that elaborates on the views held within different Islamic schools of thought."

When such care has been given to this Book, how could sinful \n    hands find a way to distort even one letter of it, or add a word, or take \n    away a verse? \n\n    4 – The Qur’aan speaks of matters of the unseen, in the \n    future, which Allaah revealed to His Messenger Muhammad  (peace and \n    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to show him that they came from Allaah. If \n    a human being wants to write a book, he can describe an event or express a \n    point of view, but if any human being were to speak about matters of the \n    unseen, in this field he can only base that on speculation and lies. But the \n    Qur’aan told of the defeat of the Romans by the Persians, at the time when \n    there was no means of communication to inform the Arabs of this event. The \n    same verses also foretold that they (the Persians) would be defeated after a \n    certain number of years. If what the Qur’aan said was not accurate, then the \n    kaafirs would have had a great opportunity to criticize the Qur’aan. \n\n    5 – If you read any verse of the Qur’aan, then you go to \n    America or Asia or the jungles of Africa, or to the deserts of Arabia or any \n    place where there are Muslims, you will find that all of them have the exact \n    same verse, memorized by heart or in their books; not a single letter of it \n    will have been altered.  \n\n    So what is the importance of this unknown manuscript in Yemen \n    which we have not seen, and in which some ignorant may have altered, in \n    recent times, one verse or one word? \n\n    Does this argument carry any weight when properly researched \n    and discussed? Especially when the people claim to be fair-minded and \n    objective in their research.  \n\n    What would be their response if we went to one of their most \n    trusted books by a well-known author, a book of which there are many copies \n    in the world, all of them exactly the same, and we claimed that there was a \n    copy of this book in some country or other in which there was extra material \n    and alterations, and it was different from what is in their copies? Would \n    they pay any attention? \n\n    Their answer would be the same as ours. \n\n    6 – The manuscript copies which are in the Muslims’ \n    possession cannot be proven to be authentic in this simplistic manner, for \n    we have experts who know the history of calligraphy and we have principles \n    and guidelines through which we may determine whether a manuscript is \n    genuine, such as the names and signatures of the people who heard it and \n    read it.  \n\n    We do not think that these features are present in this \n    so-called copy of the Qur’aan in Yemen or in others. \n\n    7 – We are happy to conclude our answer with this true story \n    that happened in Baghdad during the ‘Abbasid era, when a Jew wanted to find \n    out how true are the books attributed by their followers to God, namely the \n    Torah among the Jews, the Gospel among the Christians and the Qur’aan among \n    the Muslims. \n\n    He went to the Torah and added and took away a few minor \n    things that were not very obvious, then he gave it to a scribe from among \n    the Jews and asked him to make copies of it. It did not take long before \n    these copies were placed in the synagogues of the Jews and were in \n    circulation among their major scholars. \n\n    Then he went to the Gospel and added and took away a few \n    things as he had done with the Torah, and he gave it to their scribes and \n    asked them to make copies of it. It was not long before it was being read in \n    their churches and was in circulation among their scholars. \n\n    Then he went to the Qur’aan and added and took away a few \n    things as he had done with the Torah and the Gospel. Then he gave it to a \n    Muslim scribe to make copies of it. \n\n    When he went back to get his copy, the scribe threw it in his \n    face and told him that this was not the Qur’aan of the Muslims! \n\n    From this experiment the man came to know that the Qur’aan is \n    the true Book of Allaah and that all other books were the works of human \n    beings. \n\n    If the scribes of the Muslims could tell that this copy had \n    been tampered with, then how could it go into circulation among the Muslim \n    scholars undetected? \n\n    If the questioner wants to repeat this ancient experiment \n    nowadays, all she has to do is to do the same as that Jewish man did, who \n    later became Muslim; she can add and take away things from these three books \n    and see what happens as a result. \n\n    But we do not tell her to show her copy of the Qur’aan to a \n    scribe, rather we tell her to show it to Muslim children, and they will tell \n    her where the mistakes are in her copy! \n\n    Some Muslim states have printed Mus-hafs in which there were \n    mistakes, and young children found them before the grown-ups did!\n\n     And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path.",
        "predicted_answer": "In addressing the claims made by those who attempt to undermine the authenticity of the Qur'aan, it is important to approach the discussion with clarity, respect, and an understanding of the fundamental beliefs in Islam. Here are several points that can be articulated in a refutation:\n\n1. **Inimitability (I'jaz al-Qur'aan)**: One of the strongest arguments for the Qur'aan's authenticity is its linguistic and literary style. The Qur'aan challenges humanity to produce a verse or chapter like it (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:23). Despite numerous attempts over the centuries, no one has been able to replicate its eloquence, depth, or meaning. This challenge not only underscores its uniqueness but also the belief that it is of divine origin.\n\n2. **Preservation of the Text**: The Qur'aan has been preserved in its original language since the time of its revelation. Unlike many religious texts, which have undergone numerous alterations and translations, the Qur'aan remains unchanged. The memorization of the Qur'aan by millions of Muslims around the world serves as a testament to its preservation. \n\n3. **Historical Context and Consistency**: The Qur'aan addresses a multitude of historical events, scientific phenomena, and moral principles that are consistent with historical facts and contemporary understanding. Scholars have often pointed out that many scientific facts mentioned in the Qur’aan were only discovered centuries later. This alignment with knowledge and truth supports the view that it is a divine guide.\n\n4. **Impact on Civilization**: The Qur'aan has had a profound impact on civilization, culture, law, and ethics throughout history. Its teachings have inspired a wealth of scholarship, art, architecture, and philosophy. The transformative effect it has had on individuals and communities further emphasizes its significance and truth.\n\n5. **Testimony of Early Converts**: The early companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who lived with him and experienced the Qur'aan’s revelation, attested to its truth. Their dedication, sacrifice, and the rapid spread of Islam underlines their conviction in the Qur’aan.\n\n6. **Philosophical and Theological Arguments**: Islamic scholars often address the philosophical foundations of belief, arguing that a rational understanding of existence, morality, and the universe points towards an intelligent creator who has communicated with humanity. The Qur'aan is viewed as this communication.\n\n7. **Personal Experience**: Many people who engage with the Qur’aan often cite transformative personal experiences that lead them to a belief in its truth. The spiritual and emotional impact of the Qur'aan on its followers reinforces its significance in their lives.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing skepticism towards the Qur'aan requires a combination of intellectual engagement, historical evidence, and personal testimony. Encouraging open dialogue, respectful discussion, and mutual understanding is essential when dealing with such sensitive matters."

        "question": "Claims that the Qur’aan has been distorted",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: \nIt is not possible for a Muslim to entertain doubts concerning the immutability of the Qur’aan, because Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur’aan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \n“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”\n[al-Hijr 15:9]\nThe Qur’aan was preserved in the hearts of the Sahaabah who had memorized it, and on the trunks of trees and thin white stones until the time of the caliph Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him). During the Riddah wars many of the Sahaabah who had memorized the Qur’aan were killed, so Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) was afraid that the Qur’aan may be lost. He consulted the senior Sahaabah concerning the idea of compiling the entire Qur’aan in one book so that it would be preserved and would not be lost, and this task was entrusted to the great hafiz Zayd ibn Thaabit and others who had written down the Revelation. Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh that Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:  \n“Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq sent for me when the people of Yamamah had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against Musaylimah). (I went to him) and found 'Umar bin al-Khattaab sitting with him. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said (to me), ‘ ‘Umar has come to me and said: “Casualties were heavy among the Qurra' of the Qur'aan (i.e. those who knew the Qur’aan by heart) at the Battle of Yamaamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra' on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur'an may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you [Abu Bakr] should issue orders that the Qur’aan be collected.” I said to 'Umar, “How can you do something that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do?\" 'Umar said, “By Allah, this is something good.” ‘Umar kept on urging me (to accept his proposal) until Allah opened my heart to it and I began to realize the good in the idea which 'Umar had realized.’ Then Abu Bakr said (to me): ‘You are a wise young man and we have a great deal of confidence in you. You used to write down the Revelation for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). So you should seek out the Qur’aan [i.e., the fragments on which it is written] and collect it (in one book).’ By Allaah, if they had ordered me to move one of the mountains, it would not have been harder for me than this command to collect the Qur’aan. I said (to Abu Bakr), ‘How can you do something which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘By Allaah, it is a good thing.’ Abu Bakr kept on urging me (to accept his proposal) until Allah opened my heart to it as He had opened the hearts of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. So I started to look for the Qur’aan and collected it from (the fragments on which it was written of) palm-stalks, thin white stones and the hearts of men (i.e., from men who knew it by heart), until I found the last verse of Soorat al-Tawbah with Abu Khuzaymah al-Ansaari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The verse is :  \n‘Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty…’\n[al-Tawbah 9:128 – interpretation of the meaning]\n… until the end of Soorat Baraa’ah (Soorat al-Tawbah). \nThese fragments remained with Abu Bakr until he died, then with ‘Umar for the rest of his life, then with Hafsah bint ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both).” \nSecondly: \nWith regard to al-Hajjaaj, it was not his idea to write out the Mus-haf, rather he was commanded by an intelligent man to do that. There follows the complete story: \nAl-Zarqaani said: \nIt is known that the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan was unpointed (i.e., it had no diacritical marks). Whatever the case the addition of diacritical marks to the Mus-haf did not happen, according to the well-established view, until the era of ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan, when he realized that Islam had spread widely and the Arabs were mixing with the non-Arabs, which was having an effect on the Arabic language, so that there was much confusion about the correct reading of the Mus-hafs and it was becoming very difficult for people to tell the letters apart. By his deep insight, he realized that he should do something to solve the problem. So he commanded al-Hajjaaj to take care of this important matter. In obedience to the caliph, Al-Hajjaaj appointed two men to deal with this matter, namely Nasr ibn ‘Aasim al-Laythi and Yahya ibn Ya’mar al-‘Adwaani, both of whom were qualified and able to do the task required of them, because they were knowledgeable, righteous, pious and experts in Arabic language and the various readings of the Qur’aan. They had also both studied under Abu’l-Aswad al-Du’li. May Allaah have mercy on these two shaykhs, for they succeeded in their work and gave the Mus-haf diacritical points for the first time. They added dots to all the letters that look similar, not adding more than three dots to any one letter. That became widespread among the people and was very effective in dispelling confusion concerning reading of the Mus-haf.  \nIt was said that the first person to add diacritical marks to the Mus-haf was Abu’l-Aswad al-Du’li, and that Ibn Seereen had a Mus-haf to which diacritical marks had been added by Yahya ibn Ya’mar. These opinions may be reconciled by noting that Abu’l-Aswad was the first one who added diacritical marks to the Mus-haf, but he did that for his own individual use, then Ibn Seereen followed him in that, and that ‘Abd al-Malik was the first one to add diacritical marks to the Mus-haf  in an official and public manner that was spread widely among the people in order to dispel any confusion with regard to reading Qur’aan.” \nManaahil al-‘Irfaan, 1/280, 281 \nThirdly: \nWith regard to what is mentioned in the question, quoting from al-Masaahif by Ibn Abi Dawood, there follows the report concerning that and the ruling thereon: \nIt was narrated from ‘Abbaad ibn Suhayb from ‘Awf ibn Abi Jameelah that al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf changed eleven letters in the Mus-haf. He said that in Soorat al-Baqarah 2:259 it said lam yatasanna wa’nzur, with no ha’, and he changed it to lam yatasannah wa’nzur (they show no change, and look…) \nIn al-Maa'idah 5:48 it said sharee’atan wa minhaajan, and he changed it to shir’atan wa minhaajan (a law and a clear way) \nIn Yoonus 10:22 it said, Huwa alladhi yunshirukum and he changed it to Huwa alladhi yusayyirukum (He it is Who enables you to travel…) \nIn Yoosuf 12:45 it said Ana aateekum bi ta’weelihi and he changed it to Ana unabbi’ukum bi ta’weelihi (I will tell you its interpretation) \nIn al-Zukhruf 43:32 it said, Nahnu qasamnaa baynahum ma’aayishahum and he changed it to Nahnu qasamnaa baynahum ma’eeshatahum (It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood) \nIn al-Takweer 81:24 it said Wa ma huwa ‘ala’l-ghaybi bi zaneen and he changed it to Wa ma huwa ‘ala’l-ghaybi bi daneen (and he withholds not a knowledge of the unseen) \nKitaab al-Masaahif by al-Sajistaani, p. 49. \nThis report is da’eef jiddan (very weak) or mawdoo’ (fabricated), because its isnaad includes ‘Abbaad ibn Suhayb, whose hadeeth is to be rejected. \n‘Ali ibn al-Madeeni said: his hadeeth is no good. Al-Bukhaari, al-Nasaa’i and others said: he is matrook (to be rejected). Ibn Hibbaan said: he was a Qadari who promoted his innovated ideas, and he narrated things which a beginner in this field would realize were fabricated if he heard them. Al-Dhahabi said: he is one of those who are to be rejected. \nSee Meezaan al-I’tidaal, by al-Dhahabi, 4/28. \nThe text of the report is also false, because it dos not make sense that these changes could be made in the Qur’aan and then spread throughout the world. Even some of the non-Muslims, such as the Raafidis (Shi’ah) who think that the Qur’aan is incomplete, rejected this and criticized its text. \nAl-Kho’i, who is one of the Raafidis, said: “This claim is like the hallucination of one who is suffering a fever, or like the fairy tales of the insane or of children. Al-Hajjaaj was one of the governors of the Umayyads, and he is too incapable to do anything to the Qur’aan. He is even incapable of changing any of the minor issues of Islam, so how could he change the thing which is the foundation of the religion and the basis of sharee’ah? Where would he get the power to introduce this change throughout the realm of Islam and beyond at the time when the Qur’aan was well known throughout the Muslim world? How come no historian has ever mentioned this disastrous event even though it is so serious and they would have a lot of motives to mention it? How come no one among the Muslims of his time narrated it? How could the Muslims have turned a blind eye to such an action after the reign of al-Hajjaaj came to an end? Even if we assume that he could have gathered all the copies of the Qur’aan and that not one single copy escaped his grasp anywhere in the far-flung regions of the Islamic world, how could he have removed it from the hearts of the Muslims and those who had memorized it, the number of whom at that time is known only to Allaah.” \n(al-Bayaan fi Tafseer al-Qur’aan, p. 219) \nWhat the questioner mentions about Imam al-Sajistaani, and that he wrote a book called Ma Ghayyarahu al-Hajjaaj fi Mus-haf ‘Uthmaan (What al-Hajjaaj altered in the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan) is not true, rather it is a blatant lie. All there is, is the commentary that al-Sajistaani wrote concerning the words quoted above from al-Hajjaaj, entitled Baab Ma Kataba al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf fi’l-Mus-haf (Chapter on what al-Hajjaaj wrote in the Mus-haf). \nOn this basis, we cannot rely upon this report under any circumstances whatsoever. The fact that until now it has not been proven that anyone has succeeded in his attempt to change even one letter (of the Qur’aan) is sufficient to prove that it is a lie. If what has been narrated is true, then it would be possible to repeat it, especially at the times when the Muslims were weak and their enemies plotted against them.  It is such specious arguments that prove that these claims are false, and that our enemies are incapable of refuting the evidence of the Qur’aan or its clarity, so they resorted to attacking it. \nAnd Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic belief, the Qur'an is considered the literal word of God (Allah) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The belief in the preservation of the Qur'an is fundamental to Islamic theology. According to mainstream Islamic doctrine, the Qur'an has remained unchanged and intact since it was revealed over 1,400 years ago.\n\nClaims that the Qur'an has been distorted, or altered, are generally viewed as unfounded within the Islamic tradition. Muslims believe that God has taken special measures to ensure the preservation of the Qur'an, as stated in the verse:\n\n**\"Indeed, We have sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian.\"** (Qur'an 15:9)\n\nThis verse is often cited to support the belief that the Qur'an has not been altered or corrupted in any way. In addition, the Qur'an has been memorized and transmitted by millions of people throughout history, which adds to the argument of its preservation.\n\nHowever, historical studies of other texts and traditions may raise questions and criticisms, particularly from non-Muslim scholars or critics. These discussions often revolve around the interpretation, various readings, and translations of the texts rather than the Arabic text of the Qur'an itself, which remains consistent among all Muslim communities.\n\nFor Muslims, these claims often serve as a reminder of their faith's tenets regarding divine protection and the importance of engaging in respectful dialogue about religious texts. Addressing concerns or doubts in a constructive and knowledge-based manner is often encouraged within the Islamic tradition."

        "question": "The times when it is permissible to recite Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for you to recite Quran, or any soorah from it, at any time and in any situation, except when you are in a state of janaabah (impurity following sexual activity), in which case it is haraam to recite Quran, because of the hadith of ‘Ali who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite Quran to us in all situations so long as he was not in a state of janaabah.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Tahaarah, 136. al-Tirmidhi said: this hadith of ‘Ali is hasan saheeh). This was also the view of the scholars among the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Taabi’een. They said a man may recite Quran without wudoo’ but he should not read from the Mus-haf unless he is taahir (pure, i.e., has wudoo’). This was the view of Sufyaan al-Thawri, al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and Ishaaq. \nSee Da’eef Sunan al-Tirmidhi by al-Albaani, hadith no. 22 \nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: The imams are agreed that it is haraam to recite Quran when in a state of janaabah. \nIt is not proper etiquette to recite Quran when one is in a state of janaabah because it is the words of Allah which must be respected and venerated, and kept away from all unclean places and places where haraam things take place, which could dishonour it and show disrespect towards its sanctity. Moreover the person who is in a state of janaabah can remove the impurity whenever he wants, so he is not allowed to recite Quran. But if you are impure in the sense of minor impurity then it is permissible for you to recite only, without touching the Mus-haf. See question no. 10672. With regard to women when they are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth, see question no. 2564. And Allah knows best. \nSee Tawdeeh Ahkaam al-Nisa’, 1/309.",

        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, it is generally considered permissible to accept payment for teaching the Qur'an, as this can be seen as a form of earning a livelihood while also fulfilling a religious duty. The teaching of the Qur'an is a noble act, and many scholars agree that it is acceptable to receive compensation for one's time and effort in imparting this knowledge. \n\nHowever, several conditions should be kept in mind:\n\n1. **Intentions**: The primary intention should be to teach the Qur'an for the sake of Allah and to benefit others. Money should not be the sole motivator.\n\n2. **Fair Compensation**: The payment should be fair and correspond to the effort and time spent teaching.\n\n3. **No Exploitation**: The fee should not be prohibitive or exploitative. It should be within reach for those who wish to learn.\n\n4. **Community Benefit**: Ideally, the teaching should also aim to serve the community and promote the understanding and practice of Islam.\n\nIn summary, it is allowed to accept payment for teaching the Qur'an, as long as it is done with the right intentions and within the ethical guidelines outlined above.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.You \n          might as well ask, why does the Qur’aan not explain the number of prayers \n          during the day and night, and the number [of rak’ahs in] each prayer, \n          and what should be recited in the prayer, and how the prayer should \n          be done… And why does it not speak in detail about zakaah, and Hajj, \n          and fasting, and so on? \nAllaah \n          has made the Sunnah of the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the detailed explanation \n          of that which is mentioned in general terms in the Qur’aan. Allaah says \n          (interpretation of the meaning): \n“And \n          We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Dhikr [reminder and \n          the advice (i.e. the Qur’aan)], that you may explain clearly to men \n          what is sent down to them” \n[al-Nahl \n          16:44] \nThe \n          matters which you mention are explained in the Sunnah, and both of them \n          – the Sunnah and the Qur’aan – are wahy \n          (revelation) from Allaah. \nShaykh \n          Sa’d al-Humayd \nThere \n          follows the story of Haajar and Zamzam from the Sunnah, so that you \n          will have no need of the Bible, of which we cannot be sure that the \n          content is correct. \nIbn \n          ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated the story of Haajar, \n          the wife of Ibraaheem and the mother of his son Ismaa’eel. He said: \nIbraaheem brought her and her son Ismaa’eel while \n          she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka'bah under a tree on the \n          spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days \n          there was nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them \n          sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, \n          and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. \n          Ismaa’eel's mother followed him saying, \"O Ibraaheem! Where are \n          you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose \n          company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated \n          that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked \n          him, \"Has Allah ordered you to do this?\" He said, \"Yes.\" \n          She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while \n          Ibraaheem went on his way. When he reached al-Thaniyyah, where they \n          could not see him, he faced the Ka'bah, and raising both hands, prayed \n          to Allaah in the following words:\n“O \n          our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable \n          valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, \n          that they may perform As‑Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑Salaah). \n          So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allaah) \n          provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks”[Ibraaheem 14:37 \n          – interpretation of the meaning] \nIsmaa’eel's mother went on suckling Ismaa’eel and \n          drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin \n          had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. \n          She started looking at him (i.e. Ismaa’eel) tossing in agony (or he \n          said: kicking with his heels). She left him, for she could not endure \n          looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safa was the nearest \n          mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at \n          the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not \n          see anybody. Then she descended from al-Safa and when she reached the \n          valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in \n          distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached al-Marwa \n          where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but \n          she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between al-Safa \n          and al-Marwa) seven times.\nIbn ‘Abbaas said: the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \"This is the \n          source of the tradition of the walking between them (i.e. al-Safa and \n          al-Marwa). When she reached al-Marwa (for the last time) she heard a \n          voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She \n          heard the voice again and said, “O (whoever you may be)! You have made \n          me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And she \n          saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel \n          (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make \n          something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started \n          filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water started \n          flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\"\nIbn \n          ‘Abbaas said: The Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, \"May Allah bestow Mercy on Ismaa’eel's \n          mother! Had she left the Zamzam alone (flowing without trying to control \n          it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), \n          Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" \n          The Prophet further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled \n          her child. The angel said to her, 'Don't be afraid of being neglected, \n          for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his \n          father, and Allah never neglects His people.' The House (i.e. Ka’bah) \n          at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents \n          came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till \n          some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed \n          by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through \n          the way of Kada'. They landed in the lower part of Makkah where they \n          saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving \n          it. They said, ‘This bird must be flying around water, though we know \n          that there is no water in this valley.’ They sent one or two messengers \n          who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the \n          water. So, they all came (towards the water).\"\nThe \n          Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, \n          \"Ismaa’eel's mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, \n          'Do you allow us to stay with you?' She replied, 'Yes, but you will \n          have no right to possess the water.' They agreed to that.\" Ibn \n          ‘Abbaas said: the Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further said, \"Ismaa’eel's mother was pleased with \n          the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the \n          people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families \n          who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent \n          residents there. The child (i.e. Ismaa’eel) grew up and learnt Arabic \n          from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he \n          grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry \n          a woman from amongst them.  \nAfter Ismaa’eel's mother had died, Ibraaheem \n          came after Ismaa’eel's marriage in order to see his family that he had \n          left before…\nThen \n          Ibraaheem came back later on. He saw Ismaa’eel under a tree near Zam-zam, \n          sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibraaheem, he stood up to welcome \n          him, and they greeted each other as a father does with his son and a \n          son does with his father. Ibraaheem said, 'O Ismaa’eel! Allah has given \n          me an order.' Ismaa’eel said, 'Do what your Lord has ordered you to \n          do.' Ibraaheem asked, 'Will you help me?' Ismaa’eel said, 'I will help \n          you.' Ibraaheem said, ‘Allah has ordered me to build a house here,' \n          pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The \n          Prophet added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. \n          the Ka'bah). Ismaa’eel brought the stones and Ibraaheem was building, \n          and when the walls became high, Ismaa’eel brought this stone and put \n          it for Ibraaheem who stood on it and carried on building, while Ismaa’eel \n          was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, ‘Our \n          Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, \n          the All-Knower' [al-Baqarah 2:127 – interpretation of the meaning]. \n          The Prophet  (peace and blessings \n          of Allaah be upon him) added, \"Then both of them went on building \n          and going round the Ka'ba saying: ‘Our \n          Lord!

        "predicted_answer": "The story of Hagar (Haajar) and the well of Zamzam is indeed an important narrative in Islamic tradition, particularly in relation to the pilgrimage (Hajj) and the significance of the Kaaba. However, it is not explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an.\n\nThe absence of this story in the Qur'an can be understood in several ways:\n\n1. **Focus on Key Messages**: The Qur'an emphasizes specific themes and messages, such as the oneness of God, guidance for humanity, and ethical teachings. While the story of Hagar and Zamzam contains valuable lessons, the text prioritizes those messages deemed essential to the fulfillment of its primary purpose.\n\n2. **Complementary Narratives**: The Qur'an does not provide a comprehensive account of all historical events or figures, but rather focuses on key prophets and lessons. The stories of Hagar and Zamzam are preserved in Hadith literature and other Islamic texts, which complement Qur'anic teachings.\n\n3. **Cultural and Historical Context**: The narrative surrounding Hagar and Zamzam is well-known among the early Muslim community and was likely understood without needing to be detailed in the Qur'an. The context in which the Qur'an was revealed included oral traditions that were already familiar to the audience.\n\n4. **Lessons in Faith and Patience**: While the specific story of Hagar is not mentioned, the themes of faith, reliance on God, and the trials of prophets are central throughout the Qur'an. The narrative itself serves as an example of perseverance and trust in God's plan.\n\nIn summary, the lack of mention of Hagar and Zamzam in the Qur'an does not diminish their importance in Islamic thought. Instead, it highlights the way the Qur'an prioritizes messages and themes while leaving ample space for other sources of knowledge and tradition within Islam."

The Prophet \n           (peace and blessings of Allaah \n          be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog, unless it is a dog for hunting, \n          herding or farming, his reward will decrease by two qiraats (i.e., a \n          large amount) every day.” (Agreed upon). \nAnd Allaah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, there are varying opinions among scholars regarding the presence of dogs in a household and the reading of the Qur'an in such an environment. The general view, based on certain hadiths, is that angels do not enter a house where there is a dog. Consequently, it is often advised to avoid keeping dogs indoors unless there is a specific need, such as for protection, service, or hunting.\n\nHowever, when it comes to reading the Qur'an specifically in a house where there is a dog, there is no explicit ruling in the Qur'an that prohibits it. Many scholars agree that it is permissible to recite the Qur'an in such a household. The integrity of the recitation of the Qur'an is not compromised by the presence of a dog.\n\nNonetheless, it is always best to maintain a clean and respectful environment for reciting the sacred text. If possible, you might consider keeping the dog in another part of the house while you read.\n\nAs always, referring to a knowledgeable scholar or local imam for personalized guidance based on your specific situation is recommended."

        "question": "If a person looks at the Mus-haf without moving his lips, will he be rewarded for that?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing to prevent a person looking at the Qur’aan \n          without reciting it, in order to ponder its meanings and understand \n          it. But he is not considered to be “reading” Qur’aan when he does that, \n          and he does not earn the reward for reading it unless he pronounces \n          (the words of) the Qur’aan, even if those around him do not hear him. \n          The Prophet  (peace and blessings \n          of Allaah be upon him) said: \n“Read the Qur’aan, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection to \n          intercede for its companions.” (Narrated by Muslim). \nWhat he  (peace and blessings \n          of Allaah be upon him) meant by its companions is those who act upon \n          it, as stated in other ahaadeeth. The Prophet  \n          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads one \n          letter of the Qur’aan will have one hasanah, and the hasanah will be \n          rewarded tenfold.”  (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and al-Daarimi with \n          a saheeh isnaad). And one cannot be counted as reading Qur’aan unless \n          once actually pronounces it. \nAnd Allaah is the source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, reciting the Quran is highly encouraged, and there is a distinction between merely looking at the Mus-haf (the physical copy of the Quran) and reciting it aloud or silently. While looking at the Mus-haf without moving one's lips may not be considered actual recitation (tilawah) in the traditional sense, there is still a merit in looking at the Quran due to the intention behind it.\n\nAccording to Islamic scholars, if a person looks at the Mus-haf with the intention of remembering Allah, understanding His words, or seeking knowledge, there is a reward for this intention. However, for the full reward associated with recitation, it is preferable to engage in the act of reciting, whether aloud or silently with moving one’s lips, as this is what the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) encouraged.\n\nIn summary, while looking at the Mus-haf without moving one’s lips may have some benefit, it is more rewarding to recite the Quran with lip movement and reflection."

        "question": "Celebrating completing the Qur’aan (khatm al-Qur’aan)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah., and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allaah.\n Celebrating the completion of memorizing the Qur’aan is not Sunnah, because nothing of that nature was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from any of his Sahaabah. Doing this on the grounds that it is part of religion is bid’ah. But people do it as a customary expression of joy for the blessing of having memorized Qur’aan, like celebrations for the return of one who has been away, or for finding work, or for moving to a new home. If the celebration for completing the Qur’aan is of this nature, then there is nothing wrong with it. If a passage from the Qur’aan is recited, from the beginning or the end, without having to recite a specific soorah or recite in a particular way such as joining the end to the beginning, then this is fine, because reciting from Qur’aan is the best thing that can be done in a gathering and it is a reminder for those who are present. With regard to making du’aa’ when completing the recitation of the Qur’aan, it was reported with a saheeh isnaad from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that when he completed the Qur’aan, he would gather his family together and make du’aa’ with them. If the reader makes du’aa’ when he completes the Qur’aan, and those who are present say “Ameen” to his du’aa’, this is fine.\n With regard to calling the teacher “shaykhah” , there is nothing wrong with this. Now you know, may Allaah bless you, that there is no reason not to have the celebration you have described. There is no need to read from the end of the Mus-haf and then join it to the beginning. Doing something in this manner requires evidence (daleel), because reading Qur’aan is an act of worship, and acts of worship must be done only in the manner in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did them, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day, and remembers Allaah much” [al-Ahzaab 33:21]\n Written by Shaykh ‘Abd-Al-Rahmaan al-Barraak\n There is a hadeeth about the person who stops for a rest immediately carrying on, which was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) from Ibn ‘Abbaas. According to this hadeeth, a man said, “O Messenger of Allaah, which deed is most beloved to Allaah? He said, “Al-haal al-murtahil.” The man said, ‘What is al-haal al-murtahil?” He said, “The one who starts from the beginning of the Qur’aan until he reaches the end, and when he stops for a rest, he immediately carries on.”\n But this hadeeth is da’eef (weak), as al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) says after he quotes it: this is a ghareeb (strange) hadeeth which we only know from Ibn ‘Abbaas with this isnaad, and this isnaad is not strong.\n Hence Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-I’laam (p.289, part2), after he mentioned this hadeeth: Some of them understood from this that when a person has finished reading the whole Qur’aan, he should then read al-Faatihah and three verses of Soorat al-Baqarah, because he stopped when he completed it, and he continued when he started again. But none of the Sahaabah or Taabi’een did this, and none of the imaams regarded it as mustahabb (encouraged). What is referred to in the hadeeth is when a person returns from one military campaign and immediately joins another, or every time he completes one good deed, he starts another which he  completes as he did the first one. But what some readers do is not what was meant in the hadeeth at all. And Allaah is the source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, completing the recitation of the Qur'aan, known as **khatm al-Qur'aan**, is viewed as a significant achievement and is often celebrated in various ways within the Muslim community. Here are some key points related to this practice:\n\n1. **Significance**: Completing the Qur'aan is a commendable act that demonstrates a person's dedication to understanding and engaging with the holy text of Islam. It is an opportunity for spiritual growth and a means to connect more deeply with the teachings of the Qur'aan.\n\n2. **Celebration**: While there is no specific Sunnah (practice of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) that mandates a formal celebration after completing the Qur'aan, many Muslims do hold gatherings to commemorate this milestone. These gatherings may include reading, reflection, prayer, and making dua (supplication).\n\n3. **Gifts, Duas, and Feasting**: During these gatherings, it is common to offer small gifts or sweets, share meals, and engage in collective prayers and praises of Allah. The focus is often on expressing gratitude and seeking Allah’s acceptance of the recitation.\n\n4. **Reward**: The act of reciting the Qur'aan is highly rewarded in Islam. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) mentioned in a Hadith that for each letter recited, a person earns ten rewards (Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim). Therefore, completing the Qur'aan is regarded as a source of immense blessings.\n\n5. **Expressions of Gratitude**: It is recommended for the individual who has completed the Qur'aan to thank Allah and make dua, not only for themselves but also for the community and the Ummah at large. \n\n6. **Continuous Engagement**: It is important to remember that completing the Qur'aan is not an end goal but a step towards continuous learning and practice of the teachings within it. Regular recitation and reflection on its meanings are encouraged.\n\nIn summary, while celebrating the completion of the Qur'aan is not required but culturally significant, it reflects the joy of engaging with the divine text and encourages community involvement and spiritual growth."

        "question": "Is it true that there is no evidence of a Qur’aan being written\r\n      in the 7th century?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is a false and incorrectstatement made by those who try to find faults with\n      Islam so as to put people off this religion. It is sufficient to know that\n      Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur’aan, as He says\n      (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily,\n      We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely,\n      We will guard it (from corruption).” [al-Hijr 15:9]\n Moreover, the fact that the transmission\n      of the Qur’aan by memory and in writing was mutawaatir – narrated by\n      groups to groups [to such anextent\n      that so many people could not conceivably have agreed upon a lie] – is\n      well known to anyone who has the slightest acquaintance with Islamic\n      knowledge, especially knowledge of recitations and reciters. \n There are still many people nowadays who\n      have learned the Qur’aan orally, with isnaads directly going back to the\n      Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\n One of the miracles of Allaah’s\n      protection of the Qur’aan is the fact that those who try to tamper with\n      it are always found out.\n The point is, everything that was\n      revealed to the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)\n      was written down in front of him straight away, and some of the Sahaabah\n      had masaahif (written copies\n      of the Qur’aan). After the death of the Prophet \n (peace and\n      blessings of Allaah be upon him), thefirst khaleefah, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with\n      him) gathered the Qur’aan inwritten\n      and kept it. Then the third khaleefah, ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may\n      Allaah be pleased with him) compiled it in mus-hafs that were based on the\n      mus-haf compiled by Abu Bakr, in addition to what had been memorized.\nWhen\n      we realize that the Qur’aan was written down and compiled by the\n      Sahaabah, and ‘Uthmaan sent copies of the Mus-haf during his reign to\n      all the main centres of Islam, so that it would be a reference for them,\n      and there were no disputes concerning them, then how can we say that there\n      is no written trace of the Qur’aan in the seventh century? Moreover,\n      there are several ancient manuscripts of the Qur’aan in libraries and\n      museums which bear visible testimony to the fact that nothing has been\n      changed in the Book of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the\n      meaning):\n“And\n      verily, it is an honourable well‑fortified respected Book (because\n      it is Allaah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption).\n      Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down\n      by the All‑Wise, Worthy of all\n      praise (Allaah).” [Fussilat 41:41-42]\n      \n      \n      \n      And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The assertion that there is no evidence of the Qur'an being written in the 7th century is not accurate. Historical and archaeological evidence supports the existence of written forms of the Qur'an during that time.\n\nIslamic tradition holds that the Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad over a period of approximately 23 years, concluding in 632 CE. Following his death, the Qur'an was preserved primarily through oral transmission, but there were also written records. \n\nSeveral early manuscripts or fragments of the Qur'an, which date back to the 7th century, have been discovered. One notable example is the Sana'a manuscript, discovered in Yemen, which has been dated to the late 7th century and contains portions of the Qur'an that are consistent with the traditional text.\n\nFurthermore, historical accounts indicate that Caliph Uthman (ruled 644-656 CE) ordered the compilation of the Qur'an into a single text around 650 CE, standardizing the written form and preventing discrepancies due to the oral transmission. \n\nThus, there is evidence and scholarly consensus that the Qur'an was indeed being written and compiled in the 7th century, supporting its existence as a tangible text during this period."

        "question": "Do You Have to Recite Surahs in Order in Prayer?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Types of Tankis\nReading later parts of the Quran before earlier parts is called Tankis (inversion). There are different types of Tankis:\n·        Tankis al-Huruf (inversion of letters)\n·        Tankis al-Kalimat (inversion of words)\n·        Tankis al-Ayat (inversion of verses)\n·        Tankis al-Suwar (inversion of Surahs)\nWhat is Tankis al-Huruf (inversion of letters)?\nTankis al-Huruf (inversion of letters) means putting a later letter before a previous letter in one word, for example, instead of Rabb one reads Barr\nUndoubtedly this is haram, and invalidates a person's prayer, because it changes the Quran from the way in which it was spoken by Allah, and usually alters the meaning in a drastic manner. ((Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 3/110)\nWhat is Tankis al-Kalimat (inversion of words)?\nTankis al-Kalimat (inversion of words) means putting a later word before a previous word, for example, instead of Qul huwa Allahu ahad, one reads Ahad Allah huwa qul!\nThis also is undoubtedly haram, because it changes the Quran from the way in which it was spoken by Allah. (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/110)\nWhat is Tankis al-Ayat (inversion of verses)?\nTankis al-Aayat (inversion of verses) means reciting a later ayah before a previous ayah, for example, reciting min sharr il-waswas il-khannas before ilah il-nas!\nConcerning this, al-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“There is no dispute concerning the order of the verses in each Surah. This is something which is tawqifi, i.e., based on revelation [and is not open to ijtihad], and the order is that which now appears in the Mus-haf, and this is how the ummah transmitted it from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (Sharh al-Nawawi, 6/62. This was also the view of Ibn al-’Arabi, as stated in al-Fath, 2/257)\nShaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:\nTankis al-ayat (inverting verses) is also haram according to the most correct view, because the order of the verses is tawqifi (something which is based on revelation [and not open to ijtihad]). The meaning of tawqifi is that it was dictated by the order of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/110)\nWhat is Tankis al-Suwar (inversion of Surahs)?\nTankis al-Suwar (inversion of Surahs) means, reciting later Surahs before earlier ones, for example, reciting Al ‘Imran before al-Baqarah.\nRuling on Tankis al-Suwar\nThose scholars who say that the order of Surahs is not tawqifi do not see anything wrong with this.\nThose who think that it is tawqifi or that the consensus of the Companions on the order of Surahs is evidence, do not think that it is permissible.\nThe correct view is that the order of Surahs is not tawqifi; it is the result of ijtihad on the part of some of the Companions.\nThere was no ijma` (consensus) among the Companions on the order of Surahs; the order in the Mus-haf of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud for example is different from that in the Mus-hafs of others.\nIn the Sunnah there is evidence that supports the view that it is permissible:\nHudhayfah said: I prayed with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one night, and he started to recite al-Baqarah. I thought he would do ruku’ when he reached one hundred ayas, but he kept going. I thought he would complete it in one rak`ah, but he kept going. I thought, he would do ruku’ now, but he started to recite al-Nisa, and he recited all of it, then he started to recite Al Imran and recited all of it. (Narrated by Muslim, 772).\nThe evidence in this hadith is that he recited al-Nisa then Al Imran.\nAl-Nawawi said:\n“Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: this contains evidence for those who say that the order of Surahs is the result of ijtihad on the part of the Muslims when they wrote down the Mus-haf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not dictate the order of Surahs; he entrusted this task to his ummah after his death. This is the view of Malik and the majority of the scholars, and was the view favoured by al-Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqillani. Ibn al-Baqillani said: it is the more correct of the two views, although both are possible.\nHe said: what we say is that the order of Surahs is not binding when writing, praying, studying, teaching or learning. There is no report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning that which would make it forbidden to differ from it. Hence the order of Surahs in the various Mus-hafs differed, before the Mus-haf of ‘Uthman.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the ummah after him in all ages regarded it as permissible to differ from the order of Surahs in prayer , and when studying and teaching.\nHe said: with regard to the view of those scholars who say that (the order of Surahs) was set by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and that he put them in the same order as appears in the Mus-haf of ‘Uthman and that the different orders came about before they heard of his ruling and his final review of the Quran with Jibril they interpret the fact that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited al-Nisa first and then Al Imran as meaning that this happened before the final ruling was dictated, and these two Surahs appear in this order in the Mus-haf of Ubayy.\nHe said: there is no dispute concerning the fact that a person who is praying may recite in the second rak`ah a Surah which comes before the Surah which he recited in the first rak`ah; but it is makruh to do this in one rak`ah, or when reciting Quran outside of prayer.\nHe said: but some of them permitted this.\nThe prohibition of the Salaf against reading the Quran backwards is interpreted as referring to those who read from the end of a Surah to the beginning.\nHe said: there is no dispute concerning the fact that the order of verses in each Surah is based on revelation from Allah and is as it now appears in the Mus-haf and as it was transmitted by the ummah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (End of the comments of al-Qadi ‘Iyad). And Allah knows best.” (Sharh Muslim, 6/61, 62)\nAl-Sindi said:\nThe phrase [in the hadith of Hudhayfah] then he started to recite Al ‘Imran means that it is not obligatory to follow the order of Surahs when reciting. (Sharh al-Nasai, 3/226)\n·        It was reported from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man from among the Ansar used to lead them in prayer in the mosque of Quba. Every time he led them in prayer, he would start his recitation with Qul huwa Allahu ahad, then when he finished it, he would recite another Surah. He did that in every rak`ah. His companions spoke with him and said, You always start with this Surah, then you do not think it is enough and you recite another. Either you should recite this Surah alone, or you should leave it and recite another. He said, I am not going to stop reciting it. If you like, I will lead you in prayer as I have been doing, and if you do not like it, I will leave you. They felt that he was one of the best of them, and they did not want anyone else to lead them in prayer. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to them, they told him about this. He said, O So and So, what is stopping you from doing what your companions tell you? What makes you keep on reciting this Surah in every rak`ah? He said, I love it. He said, Your love for it will grant you admittance to Paradise. (Narrated by al-Bukhari mu’allaqan, and by al-Tirmidhi with an isnad similar to that of al-Bukhari, 2901).\nThe evidence in this report is the fact that the man recited Surat al-Ikhlas in his prayer before any other Surah that comes before it (in the Mus-haf), and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of that.\n·        This is the action of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).\nAl-Imam al-Bukhari said:\n“Al-Ahnaf recited al-Kahf in the first rak`ah and Yusuf or Yunus in the second, and he said that he had prayed Fajr with ‘Umar and he had done the same.” (Bab al-Jam’ bayna Suratayn fil-Rak`ah, in Kitab al-Adhan)\nWith regard to the latter part of your question, we say:\nIt is permissible to recite verses 50-60 of al-Baqarah in the first rak`ah, then to recite verses 1-20 of al-Baqarah in the second rak`ah, because then the meaning of the passage will be complete.\nBut reciting verses 10-20 means that one is cutting off the meaning, so it is better not to do this. Perhaps you mentioned the numbers only by way of example and you did not mean these particular verses.\nFor more, please see these answers: 20043 , 69915 , 171060 , and 7198 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the Islamic prayer (Salah), it is not obligatory to recite Surahs in a specific order. During the standing position of prayer (Qiyam), after reciting Surah Al-Fatiha, a person has the flexibility to choose another Surah from the Quran to recite. This means you can select any Surah you wish, regardless of its order or arrangement in the Quran. \n\nHowever, it's common practice to recite shorter Surahs after Al-Fatiha, especially in the obligatory prayers, but this is based on personal or communal habits rather than a requirement. \n\nTo summarize, while there’s no requirement to recite Surahs in a particular order during Salah, one should aim to recite valid Surahs from the Quran after Al-Fatiha."

        "question": "They get together    and each person reads one juz’; will this be considered as a khutmah (complete reading of the Quran) for all of them?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In my opinion the action mentioned is not permissible, and I do not recall anything of this kind being reported from the Salaf. A person will only be rewarded for what he himself reads or listens to in order to benefit from it. But if another person reads and he does not listen, the reward for that will go to the person who read it. These people are not considered to have completed the whole Quran; but if each person has read a juz’ he will be rewarded for that. But they should not do this; either one person should read and the others listen, or each person should read by himself without making a connection between his reading and that of the others.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, if a group comes together and each person reads one Juz' of the Quran, collectively completing the entire Quran, this is considered a completed reading (Khatm) of the Quran for all participants involved. The act of reading the Quran together in this manner is a commendable practice in Islam, and they will share in the merit of completing the Quran. It is also encouraged to make dua (supplication) after completing the Quran, as it is a blessed time for asking Allah for needs and forgiveness."

        "question": "Hanging Quranic Verses on Walls",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Hanging plaques and cloths containing verses of the Quran in homes , schools, social clubs and places of business, involves a number of reservations and prohibitions according to Islam, such as the following:\n\nIn most cases, hanging such things on the wall is done for purposes of decoration and adornment, as the verses etc. are written in calligraphy and colorful brocade. This is an inappropriate use of the Quran, as it was revealed to guide people and to be read regularly. The Quran was not revealed to decorate walls, but to guide mankind.\nSome people hang up such things for blessing - which is a form of worship. The blessing as described in Islam comes from reading or reciting the Quran, not from hanging it up or placing it on shelves or turning it into artwork and three-dimensional images.\nThis is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Khalifas (al-Khulafa al-Rashidun), may Allah be pleased with them, who never did such a thing. The best way is to follow them, not to introduce innovations in religion. History tells us that in places such as Andalusia, Turkey, etc., the adornment of houses and mosques with ornate carvings of verses only happened at times when the Muslims were weak and humiliated.\nHanging up such pictures or plaques could lead to shirk, because some people think that these things are amulets that will protect the house and its people from evil and disease. This is shirk and is haram, because the One Who really offers protection is Allah, may He be glorified, and one of the means of gaining His protection is sincere recitation of the Quran and du’as taught in the Quran and Sunnah.\nThere is the risk that the Quran may be used, in such cases, as a means of promoting one's business or increasing one's earnings. The Quran should be protected from being used for such purposes. It is well-known that the production and sale of these pictures and plaques involves a great deal of extravagance and wasting money.\nMany of these plaques are painted with real gold, which makes using them and hanging them up even more haram.\nMany of these plaques involve a kind of carelessness, because the letters are twisted into complex designs that are of no benefit to anyone because they are barely legible. Sometimes words are fashioned into the shape of a bird or a man prostrating, and similarly forbidden pictures of animate beings.\nVerses and surahs of the Quran are exposed to misuse and abuse by this practice. For example, when moving house, they are piled up with the rest of the furniture and belongings, and other objects may be placed on top of them. This also happens when they are taken down so that the wall may be painted or cleaned.\nSome Muslims whose observance of Islam is lacking put these plaques and pictures up so that they can feel that they are doing something religious, in order to reduce their feelings of guilt in spite of the fact that this practice does not help them in any way.\n\nAll in all, we must close the doors of evil and follow the leaders of guidance of the early centuries of Islam, whose people the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) testified were the best of the Muslims in faith and practice. If someone were to say, We are not going to abuse it or make it a decoration or exaggerate about it, we only want to remind people (about their religion) in our gatherings, our response would be: if we look at real life, will we find that this is what actually happens? Do people really remember Allah? Do they even read these verses when they raise their heads?\nWhat really happens is the opposite: people go against the words hanging over their heads, they still tell lies, engage in gossip, make fun of others and do and say evil things. Even if we assume that there are some who do benefit from these plaques etc., the fact is that they are very few, and this does not change the Islamic ruling on the matter.\nThe Muslims must turn to the Book of Allah, read it and recite it, and act in accordance with it. We ask Allah to make the Quran a light of guidance for us, and a means of removing our grief and anxiety. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\nFor more, please see these answers: 39185 , 13648 and 170060 .\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Hanging Quranic verses on walls is a practice that some Muslims engage in as a way of showing respect and reverence for the Quran. However, opinions on this practice can vary within the Islamic scholarly community.\n\n1. **Purpose and Intention**: Many scholars emphasize that the intention behind hanging Quranic verses should be to promote remembrance of Allah and to beautify the home with spiritual reminders.\n\n2. **Respect and Cleanliness**: The Quran is considered the holy book of Islam, and it is important to ensure that any form of display is done with respect. This means keeping the verses clean and ensuring they are not placed in inappropriate locations (such as bathrooms).\n\n3. **Avoiding Disrespect**: Scholars also warn against any form of disrespect to the Quran. If the display might lead to the verses being disrespected (e.g., being placed in a location where they might be neglected), it would not be advisable.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices**: In many cultures, hanging Quranic verses is common and is seen as a way to bring blessings and protection to the home. This practice can vary greatly, and it is often influenced by cultural norms.\n\n5. **Consultation with Local Scholars**: If there are concerns or doubts about the permissibility of this practice, it is always best to consult with a knowledgeable local scholar who can provide advice based on the specific context and community practices.\n\nIn conclusion, hanging Quranic verses may be permissible if done respectfully and with the right intentions, but it is essential to be mindful of the broader guidelines surrounding the treatment of the Quran."

        "question": "Which is better,    to recite Quran from the Mushaf or from memory?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If one is reciting Quran in situations other than in prayer, then reading from the Mushaf is better, because it is more accurate and helps one to remember better. But if reciting from memory is easier and helps one to concentrate more and have better presence of mind (khushoo’), then one should recite from memory.\nIn prayer, however, it is better to recite from memory, because if a person recites from the Mushaf, he will be doing repeated actions such as holding the Mushaf, putting it down, turning its pages and looking at the letters. By doing so he will miss out on putting his right hand over his left hand on his chest when standing during the prayer, or spreading out his arms during rukoo’ and sujood, if he puts the Mushaf under his arm. Hence we think that it is preferable for a person who is praying to recite from memory rather than from the Mushaf.\nWe see some people when they pray behind the imaam, carrying the Mushaf and following the imaam’s recitation. This is something which should not be done, for the reasons we have referred to above, and because they do not need to do anything except follow the imaam.\nHowever, if the imaam does not have such a good memory, and he says to one of the members of the congregation, “Pray behind me, and follow me (my recitation) in the Mushaf, and if I make a mistake, correct me,” then there is nothing wrong with this.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, both reciting the Quran from the Mushaf (the physical copy of the Quran) and reciting it from memory have their own merits, and either practice can be considered good.\n\n1. **Reciting from Memory (Hifz)**: Memorizing the Quran is highly commendable and carries great rewards. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) praised those who memorize the Quran and referred to them as the \"people of the Quran.\" Memorizing the Quran allows one to recite it in prayer and throughout daily life without needing a physical copy.\n\n2. **Reciting from the Mushaf**: Reading from the Mushaf can also be beneficial, especially for those who may not have memorized large portions of the Quran. It allows for a focused reading experience, and one can also benefit from looking at the text and understanding the rules of Tajweed (the art of Quranic recitation). Furthermore, reading from the Mushaf can enhance concentration and understanding.\n\nIn general, it is encouraged to recite the Quran in whichever form one is able to, and many people strive to do both. If someone has memorized the Quran, reciting it from memory would be considered highly virtuous, while reading from the Mushaf is better for those who may not have memorized it or wish to improve their recitation. Ultimately, the sincerity of the intention and seeking the pleasure of Allah is what counts the most in either practice."

        "question": "Rulings of al-Madd\r\n    in Qur’aan recitation",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This symbol \"~\" is used to indicate places where a Madd\n    (elongation) that is longer than the regular elongation is required. It is used in places\n    where the Madd is compulsory (Madd laazim), as in the word \"At-Taammah \", where\n    the elongation is six harakaat or counts. One harakah is equal to the time taken to curl\n    or stretch one finger. This symbol is also used for al-Madd al-Muttasal (where a long\n    vowel is followed by a hamzah in one word), such as \"sawaa'un 'alaynaa \", where\n    the Madd is between four and six harakaat. And it is used for al-Madd al-Munfassal, (where\n    one word ends with a long vowel and is immediately followed by a word that starts with a\n    hamzah), as in the phrase \"fee aadhaaninaa waqar \", where the Madd is four or\n    five harakaat.\n    This symbol does not have any effect on the meanings of the words; it is only used to\n    indicate some kinds of Madds or elongations, as explained above. The Madd which is longer\n    than the regular elongation (two harakaat) does not change the meaning when you do it. But\n    we have to follow the Sunnah of recitation, and the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of\n    Allaah be upon him) used to elongate some vowels in his recitation. And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "In the context of Qur'an recitation, \"al-Madd\" refers to the elongation of certain Arabic letters that occur as a result of specific rules in Tajweed, the art of reciting the Qur'an. The elongation (or prolongation) can affect the flow and clarity of recitation and is an important aspect of preserving the meaning.\n\nThere are several types of Madd, each with its own rules:\n\n1. **Madd Lazim (Mandatory Elongation)**: This occurs when there is a prolonged vowel sound followed by a consonant that has a sukoon (no vowel). The elongation here is usually for six counts.\n\n2. **Madd Mutasil (Connected Elongation)**: This happens when a word ends with a Madd letter (ا, و, ي) and the next word begins with a Hamzah (ء). This type of Madd is elongated for 4 to 5 counts.\n\n3. **Madd Mursil (Disjointed Elongation)**: Similar to Madd Mutasil, but the Hamzah appears in the same word. It is usually elongated for 2 to 4 counts.\n\n4. **Madd 'Iwad (Compensatory Elongation)**: This type occurs when a shortening of a vowel occurs, and a Madd letter is used to compensate. The elongation is typically done for 2 counts.\n\n5. **Madd 'Azim (Major Elongation)**: This is observed in specific instances in the Qur'an, where the elongation can be performed for up to 6 counts and is often indicated by specific marks in the text.\n\nProper application of these rules is essential for accurate Qur'anic recitation, ensuring both the beauty of the recitation and the correct transmission of the meaning. For detailed practices, it is often advised to study under guidance from qualified teachers who specialize in Tajweed."

        "question": "How Was the Order of the Quran Determined?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Order of verses in one Surah\nThe fact there is scholarly consensus, and many texts stating the order of verses in one Surah, that is very well known. The consensus was reported by many scholars, including Al-Zarkashi in al-Burhan and Abu Ja’far, who said: “The order of the verses in their Surahs came about because this is how it was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and there is no dispute among the Muslims with regard to this matter.”\nThe texts regarding this matter include the following:\n\nThe report narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai, Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim from Ibn `Abbas, who said: “I said to ‘Uthman, ‘What made you put al-Anfal which is one of the Mathani, next to Bara-ah [al-Tawbah], which is one of the Mi’in? Why did you not put the line Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim in between them when you put it at the beginning of the rest of al-Sab’ al-Tiwal [the long seven Surahs]?” ‘Uthman said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to receive revelation of Surahs with many verses. When they were revealed, he would call his scribes and tell them, ‘Put these verses in the Surah where such-and-such is mentioned.’ Al-Anfal was one of the first Surahs to be revealed in Madinah, and Bara-ah (al-Tawbah) was one of the last parts of the Quran to be revealed. Its stories were similar to the stories mentioned in al-Anfal, so it was thought that it was part of it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken [i.e., died] without explaining whether it was indeed part of it, so they were put next to one another, and the line Bismillahir Rahman ir’Rahim was not written between them, and it [al-Tawbah] was put among the Sab’ al-Tiwal [seven long Surahs].” (Al-Hakim said: its isnad is sahih, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Al-Mustadrak, 2/330)\nAhmad narrated in al-Musnad (4/218) with a hasan isnad from ‘Uthman ibn Abi’l-‘As that he said: “I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he fixed his gaze on something, then lowered his gaze until he was almost looking at the ground, then he gazed at something. He said, ‘Jibril (peace be upon him) came to me and told me to put this verse in this place in this Surah: “Verily, Allâh enjoins Al-‘Adl (i.e. justice and worshipping none but Allâh Alone Islâmic Monotheism) and Al-Ihsân [i.e. to be patient in performing your duties to Allâh, totally for Allâh’s sake and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet in a perfect manner], and giving (help) to kith and kin (i.e. all that Allâh has ordered you to give them, e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of help), and forbids Al-Fahshâ (i.e. all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false witness, to kill a life without right), and Al-Munkar (i.e. all that is prohibited by Islâmic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every kind of evil deeds), and Al-Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression). He admonishes you, that you may take heed.” [al-Nahl 16:90 – interpretation of the meaning].’”\nAl-Bukhari narrated in al-Sahih (no. 4536) that Ibn Abi Malikah said: “Ibn al-Zubayr said: ‘I said to ‘Uthman, “This verse that is in al-Baqarah (interpretation of the meaning), ‘And those of you who die and leave wives behind them … And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year’s maintenance and residence without turning them out’ [al-Baqarah 2:234-240] has been abrogated by the other, so why are you writing it down?” He said, “Leave it as it is, my nephew, I will not change anything from its place.”’”\nMuslim narrated (no. 1617) that ‘Umar said: “I did not ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about anything more than I asked him about al-Kalalah [those who die leaving neither ascendants nor descendents as heirs], until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said, “Is not ayat al-sayf at the end of Surat al-Nisa enough for you?”\nThere are also the hadiths about the verses at the end of Surat al-Baqarah.\nMuslim narrated (no. 809) from Abu al-Darda that whoever memorizes the first ten verses of Surat al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjal; according to another version, whoever recites the last ten verses will be protected.\n\nThe Prophet’s recitation of various Surahs in the presence of his Companions indicates that the order of their verses is something that was instituted and commanded by him, and that the Companions did not put the verses in a different order from that in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite them. The reports to that effect reach the level of Mutawatir.\nAl-Qadi Abu Bakr said in al-Intisar: \n“The order of the verses is something that is obligatory and binding. Jibril used to say (to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)), ‘Put such and such an verse in such and such a place.’”\nHe also said:\n “What we think is that all of the Quran which Allah revealed and commanded that it should be written down, and which was not abrogated after being revealed, is that which is contained between the covers of the Mus-haf of ‘Uthman, and that there is nothing lacking or added to it. Its order is the same as that commanded by Allah, may He be exalted, and instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Nobody has moved any verse backwards or forwards. The Ummah learned from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the order of the verses of each Surah properly, just as they learned from him the correct pronunciation and recitation.”\nAl-Baghawi said in Sharh al-Sunnah: \n“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to instruct his Companions and teach them what was revealed to him of the Quran in the order in which it appears in our Mus-hafs now, the order which Jibril taught him. When each verse was revealed, Jibril would tell him, this verse is to be written after such and such a verse in Surah such and such. Thus it is clear that the efforts of the Companions were limited solely to gathering the Quran in one place, not to arranging its order. The Quran is written on al-Lawh al-Mahfuz in this order, then Allah sent it down in its entirety to the first heaven, whence it was revealed in stages as it was needed, and the order in which it was revealed is not the order in which it is recited.”\nOrder of Surahs in the Quran\nWith regard to the order of Surahs, was this also instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or was this the ijtihad of the Companions? With regard to this question, there were differences among the scholars. The majority of scholars, including Malik and al-Qadi Abu Bakr, according to one of his two opinions, favoured the second opinion.\nIbn Faris said: \n“There were two aspects to the compilation of the Quran. One was putting the Surahs in a certain order, such as putting al-Sab’ al-Tiwal (the seven long Surahs) first, and following them with the Mi’in, which is what the Companions did. The second aspect is the compilation of the verses within the Surahs. This was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who recited them as he was told to by Jibreel, on the command of his Lord. On this basis, the Salaf differed as to the order in which the Surahs should appear. Some of them put them in order of revelation, which was the mus-haf of ‘Ali, which started with Iqra (al-‘Alaq), then al-Muddaththir, then Nun (al-Qalam), then al-Muzzammil, and so on. The Mus-haf of Ibn Mas’ud started with al-Baqarah, then al-Nisa, then Al ‘Imran, with other major differences. The Mus-haf of Ubayy was similar.”\nAl-Karmani said in al-Burhan: the order of the Surahs as it is now is the same as that in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz which is with Allah. This is the order in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to review the Surahs of the Quran he had received so far with Jibril each year. In the year in which he died, he reviewed it with him twice, and the last verses to be revealed were (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah…’ [al-Baqarah 2:281]. Jibril commanded the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to put this between the verses dealing with riba and those dealing with loans.”\nAl-Zarkashi said in al-Burhan: “The difference between the two views is one of wording. Those who support the second view say that it was taught to them so that they could learn the reasons of Revelation and the sequence of the words. Hence Malik said that they compiled the Quran according to what they had heard from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as well as saying that the order of the Surahs was the product of their ijtihad. He said that the dispute boils down to one question which is: was this a verbal instruction of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or were they merely referring to what he used to do, which would give them room for ijtihad.”\nAl-Bayhaqi said in al-Madkhil: “At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Surahs and verses of the Quran were in this order, except for al-Anfal and Bara-ah (al-Tawbah), as we see from the hadith of ‘Uthman referred to above.”\nIbn ‘Atiyah said: “The order of many of the Surahs was known during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as the seven long Surahs, those that begin with Ha’-Mim, and al-Mufassal. With regard to the others, it may be the case that it was left for the Ummah to determine their order after he died.”\nAbu Ja’far said: “The reports support most of what Ibn ‘Atiyah said, and a little is left which is open to debate, such as the hadith, ‘Recite the two shining ones, al-Baqarah and Al ‘Imran.’” (Reported by Muslim, no. 804)\nAl-Bukhari narrated (no. 4739) that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Bani Israil (al-Isra), al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta-Ha and al-Anbiya, these are among the earliest and most beautiful Surahs and they are my treasures,” (meaning, these are among the earliest I recited).\nAbu Ja’far al-Nahhas al-Mukhtar said that the Surahs were compiled in this order from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) because of the hadith of Wathilah, “In place of the Tawrat I was given the seven long Surahs.” He said: “This hadith indicates that the order of the Quran was taken from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\nIbn Hajar said, “the fact that the Surahs, or most of them, are in a given order does not contradict the idea that this was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). What proves that this was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the report narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud from Aws ibn Hudhayfah, who said: ‘We asked the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the morning, “How did you write down the Quran in chapters?” They said, “We wrote it down in chapters of six Surahs, five Surahs, seven Surahs, nine Surahs, eleven Surahs and thirteen Surahs, and the chapter of al-Mufassal, from Qaf until the end. This indicates that the order of the Surahs – as it appears in the Mus-haf now – existed at the time of the Messenger of Allah, or it is possible that what was known in order at that time was Hizb al-Mufassal specifically, which is not the case with the rest.”\n(See al-Itqan fi ‘Ulum al-Quran by al-Suyuti, 1/62-65)\nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "The order of the Quran was determined through a combination of divine instruction, the practice of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the efforts of his companions after his passing.\n\n1. **Revelation**: The Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad over a period of approximately 23 years. During this time, the verses were revealed in response to specific events, questions, and situations that arose in the early Muslim community.\n\n2. **Preservation during the Prophet's Lifetime**: The Prophet Muhammad had companions, known as scribes, who recorded the verses as they were revealed. The Prophet would instruct them on where each verse should be placed within the text. This practice ensured that the order of the verses was recognized and known to his companions.\n\n3. **Compilation after the Prophet's Death**: After the death of the Prophet Muhammad, the Quran was compiled in its entirety during the caliphate of Abu Bakr, mainly to preserve it after the Battle of Yamama, where many memorizers of the Quran were killed. A committee led by Zayd ibn Thabit was assigned to gather the verses, checking their authenticity against those who had memorized them and against the written records.\n\n4. **Standardization under Uthman**: Around 650 CE, during the caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan, a standardized version of the Quran was produced to resolve variations in recitations among different regions. Uthman ordered that all other copies be burned, and the standard text was then disseminated throughout the Islamic empire.\n\n5. **Order of Surahs**: The order of the surahs (chapters) in the Quran does not follow a chronological sequence of revelation but was arranged more thematically and by length, with the longest surahs generally placed at the beginning and the shorter ones towards the end.\n\nIn summary, the order of the Quran was established through divine guidance to the Prophet, careful recording by his companions, and later compilation and standardization efforts by the early Muslim community. The structure was maintained with a focus on preserving the Quran accurately for future generations."

        "question": "Verses of Sujud al-Tilawah in the Quran",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Sujud in the Quran\nThere are fifteen places in the Quran where we should perform sajdat al-tilawah (prostration of recitation) when reciting them. \n‘Amr ibn al-’As narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited to him fifteen verses in the Quran where one should prostrate, three of which are in al-Mufassal and two in Surat al-Hajj. It was reported by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, al-Hakim and al-Daraqutni, and classed as hasan by al-Mundhiri and al-Nawawi. \nVerses of sujud al-tilawah\nThe fifteen verses of sujud al-tilawah are:\n\nSurely those who are with your Lord (angels) are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him, but they glorify His Praise and prostrate before Him. [al-A'raf 7:206]\nAnd unto Allah (Alone) falls in prostration whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the mornings and in the afternoons. [al-Ra’d 13:15]\nAnd to Allah prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the live moving creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e., they worship their Lord (Allah) with humility]. [al-Nahl 16:49]\nSay (O Muhammad): Believe in it (the Quran) or do not believe (in it). Verily! Those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in humble prostration. [al-Isra 17:107-109]\nWhen the Verses of the Most Beneficent (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping. [Maryam 19:58]\nSee you not that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and al-dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified. And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily! Allah does what He wills. [al-Hajj 22:18]\nO you who believe! Bow down, and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord and do good that you may be successful. [al-Hajj 22:77]\nAnd when it is said to them: Prostrate to the Most Beneficent (Allah)! They say, And what is the Most Beneficent? Shall we fall down in prostration to that which you (O Muhammad) command us? And it increases in them only aversion. [al-Furqan 25:60]\n[As Shaytan has barred them from Allah's Way] so that they do not worship (prostrate before) Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal. [al-Naml 27:25, 26]\nOnly those believe in Our ayat (verses, signs, etc.) who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate, and glorify the Praises of their Lord, and they are not proud. [al-Sajdah 32:15]\nAnd Dawud guessed that We had tried him and he sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allah) in repentance. [Sad 38:24]\nAnd from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate to Him Who created them, if you (really) worship Him. [Fussilat 41:37, 38]\nSo fall down in prostration to Allah, and worship Him (Alone). [al-Najm 53:62]\nAnd when the Quran is recited to them, they fall not prostrate. [al-Inshiqaq 84:21]\nFall prostrate and draw near to Allah! [al-’Alaq 96:19] (See Fiqh al-Sunnah by Sheikh Sayyid Sabiq, 186-188)\n\nScholarly views of the narration of ‘Amr ibn Al-’As about sujud al-tilawah\nAl-Albani said, in Tamam al-Minnah (296):\nOn the contrary, the hadith is not hasan, because it includes two majhul [unknown] narrators. Al-Hafiz said in al-Talkhis, after quoting the opinion of al-Mundhiri and al-Nawawi that it is hasan: ‘Abd al-Haqq and Ibn Qattan classed it as da’if [weak]. It includes ‘Abd-Allah ibn Munayn, who is majhul, and the one who narrated from him is al-Harith ibn Sa’id al-Atqi, who is also unknown. Ibn Makula said: He did not narrate any hadith apart from this one.”\nHence al-Tahawi was of the opinion that there is no second sajdah in Surat al-Hajj, towards the end of the surah. This is also the opinion of Ibn Hazm who said in al-Muhalla:\n“Because it is not narrated in any sahih report that this was the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there is no scholarly consensus to this effect. But it was reported with a sahih isnad that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, his son ‘Abd-Allah and Abu Darda performed sajdah in (the second verse quoted from Surat al-Hajj).”\nThen Ibn Hazm discussed whether the sajdahs for the other verses quoted are prescribed in Islam. He mentioned that the scholars are agreed upon the first ten, that performing sujud when reciting these verses is prescribed.\n Al-Tahawi also reported this consensus in Sharh al-Ma’ani (1/211), but he said that the sajdah in Surat Fussilat was prescribed, instead of the sajdah in Surat Sad. \nBoth scholars narrated ahadith with sahih isnads from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the sajdahs in Sad, al-Najm, al-Inshiqaq and al-’Alaq. These last three are from the Mufassal, which is referred to in the hadith of ‘Amr mentioned above.\nIn conclusion, even though the isnad of the hadith is weak, it is supported by the consensus of the ummah which supports most of it, and by sahih ahadith which support the rest of it, except for the second sajdah in Suat al-Hajj, for which there is no evidence in the Sunnah or in the consensus of the scholars. But some of the Sahabah used to prostrate when reciting it, which could be taken as evidence, especially since no one is known to have disputed with them in this regard.\nTo sum up, the prostration of recitation should be performed when reciting the fifteen verses quoted above. \nAnd Allah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Sujud al-Tilawah (the prostration of recitation) is a specific prostration that is performed when a person recites certain verses in the Quran that require it. There are a total of 14 locations in the Quran where these verses can be found. Here is the list of those verses:\n\n1. Surah Al-A'raf (7:206)\n2. Surah Ar-Ra'd (13:15)\n3. Surah Al-Nahl (16:26)\n4. Surah Al-Isra (17:109)\n5. Surah Al-Kahf (18:58)\n6. Surah Maryam (19:58)\n7. Surah Al-Hajj (22:18)\n8. Surah Al-Hajj (22:77)\n9. Surah Al-Furqan (25:60)\n10. Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:215)\n11. Surah An-Naml (27:26)\n12. Surah Al-Sajdah (32:15)\n13. Surah Sad (38:24)\n14. Surah Fussilat (41:38)\n15. Surah An-Najm (53:62)\n16. Surah Al-Inshiqaq (84:21)\n\nWhen reciting these verses, it is Sunnah to perform a prostration. The prostration is typically a brief act of worship, with the intention of humility and submission to Allah. Different schools of thought may have slight variations in practice, so it is always good to consult a knowledgeable person for guidance specific to one's tradition."

        "question": "What is the ruling    on hanging up aayaat for protection?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The ruling on placing the Mus-haf (copy of the Quran) in cars to ward off the evil eye and for protection from danger is a bidah. The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) never carried the Mus-haf to ward off danger or the evil eye. If it is bidah, then we should remember that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Every bidah is a going-astray and every going-astray will lead to Hell.\n(Telephone conversation with Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen) (al-Bida wal-Muhdathaat wa maa laa aslun lahu, p. 259).\nShaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked the following question: Some people hang up aayaat of the Quran and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the rooms of their homes or in restaurants or offices. In some hospitals and doctors offices they hang the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me [al-Shuara 26:80], and so on. Is this considered to be the use of amulets which is forbidden in shareeah, knowing that the intention behind it is to seek blessings and ward off the shayaateen, or to remind the forgetful and warn the negligent? Is it like using amulets to put the Mus-haf in one's car in order to seek blessings?\nHis Eminence replied as follows:\nIf the intention is as described, to remind people and teach them something beneficial, then there is no harm in that. But if they believe that it is a protection against the shayaateen or jinn, then I know of no basis for this. By the same token, there is no basis for putting the Mus-haf in one's car to protect it, and doing so is not allowed, but if a person puts it in his car so that he can read it sometimes or so that some of his passengers can read it, then this is good and there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah is the Source of strength.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic teachings, the practice of hanging up verses from the Qur'an (ayat) for protection, known as \"hanging verses\" or \"taweez,\" is generally viewed with caution. The permissibility of this practice can vary based on cultural interpretations and scholarly opinions.\n\nHere are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Intention**: The intention behind hanging verses is important. If it is meant as a form of seeking protection through the words of Allah, this may align with Islamic beliefs, as seeking protection through Allah is encouraged.\n\n2. **Authenticity of the Ayat**: It is essential that the verses hung are authentically transcribed and accurately represented.\n\n3. **Scholarly Opinions**: Different scholars have different views on this practice. Some scholars discourage it, suggesting that reliance should be on Allah and the verses should be recited rather than hung. Others permit it under certain conditions, citing cultural practices and the importance of keeping the Qur'an in a respectful manner.\n\n4. **Respect for the Qur'an**: The Qur'an is a holy text and should be treated with utmost respect. Any practice involving the Qur'an must ensure that the text is not desecrated or treated inappropriately.\n\n5. **Alternative Practices**: Many scholars encourage the recitation of Qur'anic verses, such as Ayat al-Kursi (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255) and the last two verses of Surah Al-Baqarah, as forms of protection. Reciting these verses regularly is highly encouraged.\n\nUltimately, it's always best to consult a knowledgeable scholar or a local imam for guidance based on individual circumstances and beliefs."

        "question": "Ruling on reciting\r\n    the Qur’aan collectively",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The question is somewhat vague. If what is meant is that\n    they recite it all together, in unison, pausing and stopping at the same time, then this\n    is not prescribed in Islam and at the very least it is makrooh (disliked), because it is\n    not reported that the Prophet \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his\n    Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) did any such thing. But if this is done for\n    the purpose of teaching, we hope that there is nothing wrong with it. If what is meant is\n    that the people gather to recite Qur’aan in order to memorize and learn it, and each\n    one recites whilst the others listen, or each one reads to himself – not in unison\n    with the others – then this is permissible because it was reported that the Messenger\n    of Allaah \n (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No group of people\n    gathers in one of the houses of Allaah to recite the Book of Allaah and study it together,\n    but tranquillity descends upon them, the angels surround them, mercy comes down upon them,\n    and Allaah mentions them to those who are with Him.” (Reported by Muslim).",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the ruling on reciting the Qur'an collectively (known as \"tartil\" or group recitation) can vary depending on the context and the situation.\n\n1. **Permissibility**: Generally, reciting the Qur'an in a group is permissible and can be a means of gaining reward and fostering unity among the participants. It can be done during gatherings, religious classes, or special occasions.\n\n2. **Types of Gatherings**: Common gatherings for collective recitation include during Ramadan, at funerals, or during specific religious events. However, it should be done with the aim of seeking knowledge and spiritual benefit.\n\n3. **Method of Recitation**: When reciting together, it's important to follow a method that maintains respect for the Qur'an and prevents any disruption. Ideally, one person should lead the recitation, and the others should listen attentively or follow quietly.\n\n4. **Avoiding Innovations**: While collective recitation is allowed, it's crucial to avoid innovations (bid'ah) in religious practices. The recitation should not be turned into a ritual that is believed to hold specific benefits without evidence from Islamic sources.\n\n5. **Non-Mandatory**: Collective recitation is not obligatory, and individuals can choose to recite the Qur'an privately as well. The focus should be on understanding and reflecting upon the meanings of the Qur'an.\n\nIn summary, collective recitation of the Qur'an is generally acceptable, especially when it serves a purpose of worship, education, or community bonding, as long as it adheres to Islamic principles and avoids innovations. Always consult knowledgeable scholars or local authorities for specific guidance in your community."

        "question": "Will a person be\r\n    rewarded for reading Qur’aan even if he does not know the meaning of what he reads?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Holy Qur’aan is blessed, as Allaah says\n    (interpretation of the meaning):\n“(This is) a Book (the Qur’aan) which We have sent down to\n    you, full of blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding\n    may remember.”[Saad 38:29]\nA man will be rewarded for reading it whether he understands its\n    meanings or not… But the believer should not read the Qur’aan without\n    understanding at the time when he is responsible for his actions. If a person wants to\n    learn medicine, for example, and studies medical books, he cannot learn anything from them\n    unless he understands what they mean and it is explained to him. Indeed, he would very\n    keen to understand what they say so that he can put it into practice. So how about the\n    Book of Allaah which is healing for what is in people’s hearts and exhortation for\n    all people? What about a person who reads it and does not understand or ponder its\n    meanings? The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) would not go beyond ten aayaat\n    until they had learnt them and understood the knowledge therein and how to act upon it. A\n    person will be rewarded for reading Qur’aan whether or not he understands it, but he\n    should try his best to find out what it means and to seek this knowledge from scholars who\n    can be trusted. If he cannot easily find a scholar from whom he can learn, he should refer\n    to reliable books of Tafseer such as Tafseer Ibn Jareer, Tafseer Ibn Katheer, and others.\n    And Allaah knows best.",
        "predicted_answer": "Yes, a person will be rewarded for reading the Qur'an even if they do not understand the meaning of what they are reading. In Islam, reciting the Qur'an is considered an act of worship, and Allah rewards the believer for their efforts to engage with His words. The act of recitation itself is valued, and it is believed that the spiritual and moral benefits of reciting the Qur'an will transcend the understanding of its meaning.\n\nThat said, striving to understand the meanings of the Qur'an is highly encouraged, as it deepens one's connection with the text and enhances the impact it has on one’s life.

If a person really must listen to Quran, let him lift the speakers up so that they are not at the same level as people’s feet.",
        "predicted_answer": "Listening to the Quran in a car, whether through stereo speakers located by the feet of the passengers or elsewhere, is generally considered permissible in Islam. The Quran is not only an audio experience but a means of reflection, guidance, and spirituality. It is encouraged that one listens attentively and with respect.\n\nHowever, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Respect and Reverence**: When listening to the Quran, it is important to maintain a level of respect. This means avoiding distractions, possibly lowering the volume if the environment is noisy, and ensuring that the experience is one of reflection.\n\n2. **Avoiding Distractions**: When listening to the Quran while driving, it is important to focus on the road and not let the listening distract from safe driving.\n\n3. **Context of Listening**: Ensure that the environment in which you are listening is appropriate. It is generally frowned upon to listen to the Quran in a way that might seem disrespectful—in situations that may involve frivolity or disrespectfulness, such as a loud party environment.\n\nUltimately, what matters is the intention behind listening and the manner in which one engages with the Quran. If you intend to gain guidance and reflect upon its meanings, it is a virtuous practice regardless of the speaker's location in the car."

        "question": "The TenCommandments",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Thank you for your question, which shows an interest in the Quran. We are happy to answer your question here.\nThere are in the Quran certain aayaat (verses) which some scholars call the verses of the Ten Commandments, because they include ten important commandments given by Allaah to mankind. These aayaat are to be found in two passages of the Quran.\nThe first is in Soorat al-Anaam, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\nSay: Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty We provide sustenance for you and for them; come not near to al-fawaahish (shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse, etc.), whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand.\nAnd come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he (or she) attains the age of full strength; and give full measure and full weight with justice. We burden not any person, but that which he can bear. And whenever you give your word (i.e., judge between men or give evidence, etc.), say the truth even if a near relative is concerned, and fulfil the Covenant of Allaah. This He commands you, that you may remember.\nAnd, verily, this (i.e., Allaah's commandments mentioned in the above two verses) is my Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become al-muttaqoon (the pious). [al-Anaam 6:151-153]\nThe second passage occurs in Soorat al-Israa, and may be considered as a commentary on the passage quoted above. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\nAnd your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them, but address them in terms of honour.\nAnd lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was small.\nYour Lord knows best what is in your inner-selves. If you are righteous, then, verily, He is ever Most-Forgiving to those who turn unto Him again and again in obedience, and in repentance.\nAnd give to the kindred his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift.\nVerily, spendthrifts are brothers of the shayaateen (devils), and the Shaytaan (Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord.\nAnd if you turn away from them (kindred, poor, wayfarers, etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but if you have no money at the time they ask you for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then, speak unto them a soft kind word (i.e., Allaah will give to me and I will give to you).\nAnd let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, not stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.\nTruly, your Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Verily, He is Ever All-Knower, All-Seer of His slaves.\nAnd kill not your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely the killing of them is a great sin.\nAnd come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).\nAnd do not kill anyone which Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause. And whoever is killed (intentionally with hostility and oppression and not by mistake), We have given his heir the authority [to demand qisaas Law of Equality in punishment or to forgive, or to take Diya (blood money)]. But let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life (i.e., he should not kill except the killer only). Verily, he is helped (by the Islamic law).\nAnd come not near to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength. And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily! The covenant will be questioned about.\nAnd give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good (advantageous) and better in the end.\nAnd follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not or witness not, etc.) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those you will be questioned by Allaah.\nAnd walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth, nor can you attain a stature like that of the mountains in height.\nAll the bad aspects of these (the above mentioned things) are hateful to your Lord.\nThis is part of al-hikmah (wisdom, good manners and high character, etc.) which your Lord has inspired to you (O Muhammad). And set not up with Allaah any other ilaah (god) lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected (from Allaahs mercy). [al-Israa 17:23-39]\nPerhaps after enjoying reading these verses, you will have a better idea of the Quraan than before, and this will be the beginning of a fundamental change in your life, the start of your way to Islam. May Allaah guide and help you always. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.\n.",
        "predicted_answer": "The Ten Commandments, known as the Decalogue, are a set of biblical principles relating to ethics and worship that play a fundamental role in the Abrahamic religions, including Judaism and Christianity. They are found in the Hebrew Bible, primarily in the books of Exodus (20:1-17) and Deuteronomy (5:4-21).\n\nIn Islam, while the specific Ten Commandments are not explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an, similar moral and ethical teachings can be found throughout the Islamic scripture and teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The core principles of ethical conduct and monotheism are emphasized in Islam.\n\nHere are some of the key similarities found in both the Ten Commandments and Islamic teachings:\n\n1. **Worship of One God**: Just like the commandment against having other gods, Islam stresses the importance of Tawhid, the oneness of Allah.\n   \n2. **Respect for Parents**: Both traditions emphasize the importance of treating parents with kindness and respect.\n\n3. **Prohibition of Murder**: The sanctity of life is upheld in both religions, with prohibitions against taking an innocent life.\n\n4. **Prohibition of Theft**: Both stress the importance of respecting the property of others.\n\n5. **Prohibition of Adultery**: Chastity and fidelity in marriage are highly valued.\n\n6. **Prohibition of False Witness**: Both emphasize honesty and truthfulness in dealings with others.\n\nWhile the expressions and details may differ, the underlying moral themes resonate in both the commandments and Islamic teachings.

This challenge was issued to the most brilliant and eloquent\n    Arab poets at the time when the Qur’aan was revealed, which was also the time when\n    Arabic eloquence was at its peak. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): “Let\n    them then produce a recital like unto it (the Qur’aan) if they are truthful.” [al-Tur\n    52:34]\nWhen they could not do this, Allaah challenged them to produce ten\n    soorahs like its soorahs: “Or they say: ‘He (Muhammad) forged it (the\n    Qur’aan).’ Say: ‘Bring you then ten forged soorahs (chapters) like unto it,\n    and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the\n    truth!’” [Hud 11:13 – interpretation of the meaning].\nWhen they could not do this, Allah challenged them to produce just\n    one soorah that contained the same eloquence and wisdom as the Qur’aan. He said\n    (interpretation of the meaning): “Or do they say: ‘He (Muhammad) has forged\n    it’? Say: ‘Bring then a soorah (chapter) like unto it, and call upon whomsoever\n    you like, besides Allah, if you are truthful!” [Yoonus 10:38]\nAllah called on them to seek help from whoever they wanted, and to\n    accept the challenge. He said (interpretation of the meaning): “And if you (Arab\n    pagans, Jews, Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our\n    slave (Muhammad), then produce a soorah of the like thereof and call your witnesses\n    (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.” [al-Baqarah 2:23]\nWhen they were unable to do this, Allah informed them that they\n    would never be able to do it, no matter who they called upon to help them. He said\n    (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: ‘If mankind and jinn were together to\n    produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if\n    they helped one another.’” [al-Isra’ 17:88]\nThere is no one except Allah who can produce the like of the\n    Qur’aan, because the Qur’aan, as He says, is “a Book, the Verses whereof\n    are perfected and then explained in detail from One Who is All-Wise and Well-Acquainted\n    (with all things).” [Hud 11:1 – interpretation of the meaning].\nWhen some liars did try to imitate the Qur’aan they came up\n    with ridicualous nonsense that would make children laugh, let alone mature and intelligent\n    adults. For example, the liar Musaylimah said: “O frog, daughter of two frogs, croak\n    as much as you want, your upper part is in the water and your lower part is in the\n    mud.” This is an example of the kind of thing said by him and other pretenders to\n    Prophethood. (See Sayd al-Khaatir by Ibn al-Jawzi, p. 404).\n    Some forms of falsehood may deceive some of the people\n    because of their ignorance and lack of understanding of the rules of grammar and accepted\n    styles of eloquence in Arabic. But anyone who has intelligence and common sense should at\n    least be able to see the difference and realize that these made-up words cannot possibly\n    be Qur’aan. If we look at the Website referred to in the question, we see that kufr\n    is quite clearly mentioned in these fabricated soorahs, such as the statement that the\n    Messiah is the son of God or is God, and the promotion of the evil madhhab of Raafidah (a\n    kind of Shi’ah), and other such nonsense. There are also some weird contradictions,\n    for example, these liars say in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called “soorah\n    al-tajassud”: “Exalted be He above taking any of His creation as a son,”\n    but then we find in the so-called ninth aayah of the so-called “soorah\n    al-eemaan” the words: “You are he, the son of God, truly; in you we\n    believe.” But verily Allah has spoken the truth when He said (interpretation of the\n    meaning): “Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from\n    other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions.” [al-Nisaa’\n    4:82]\nYou also find other silly comments in these made-up soorahs, such\n    as the claim that Allah permitted His Prophet to change whatever he wanted in the\n    Qur’aan, as in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called “soorah\n    al-wasaaya”: “Abrogate whatever you want to abrogate of the commands that We\n    have given you, for We permit you to make changes to Our decisions”!\nEvery Muslim will realize the extent of the lies contained in these\n    words that come from this mind that is driven by ulterior motives. Have you ever seen\n    anything more foolish than these words? Allah has told us to adhere to His Book and put it\n    into practice, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And this is a blessed\n    Book which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah, that you may receive\n    mercy.” [al-An’aam 6:155] \nHe commanded His Messenger to adhere to the Qur’aan, saying\n    (interpretation of the meaning): “So hold you (Muhammad) to that which is inspired\n    in you. Verily, you are on a Straight Path.” [al-Zukhruf 43:43]. \nAllah warned His Messenger not to fail in conveying the message\n    complete and unaltered, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, they\n    were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad), to\n    fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you\n    for a friend! And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a\n    little. In that case, We would have made you taste a double portion (of punishment) in\n    this life and a double portion (of punishment) after death. And then you would have found\n    none to help you against Us” [al-Isra’ 17:73-75] and “… if he\n    (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah), We surely should have seized\n    him by his right hand (or with power and might), and then certainly should have cut off\n    his life artery (aorta)” [al-Haaqqah 69:44-46]. Having said all this, how can\n    there be any so-called soorah that says the messenger has the right to abrogate whatever\n    he wants in the Qur’aan and that he has the authority to change or omit whatever\n    rules he wants??\nThe only One Who can abrogate whatever He wants of the Qur’aan is\n    the One Who revealed it, may He be glorified, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah\n    blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the\n    Book” [al-Ra’d 13:39]; \n“Whatever a Verse (revelation) We abrogate or cause to be\n    forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allah is able to do\n    all things?” [al-Baqarah 2:106]. \nWe, like our Messenger, are obliged to understand and implement the\n    Qur’aan without distorting, omitting or changing anything. Allah said (interpretation\n    of the meaning): “(This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of\n    blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may\n    remember.” [Saad 38:29].\nWe have seen in the false soorahs quoted on that Internet website a\n    real example of what is referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And\n    verily, among them is a party who distort the Book with their tongues (as they read), so\n    that you may think it is from the Book, but it is not from the Book, and they say:\n    ‘This is from Allah,’ but it is not from Allah; and they speak a lie against\n    Allah while they know it.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:78]. \nWe ask Allah to make His Religion and His Book prevail and to make His\n    friends victorious, as We ask Him to defeat and humiliate His enemies and cause them to\n    fail. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",

        "question": "Can one celebrate completing the\r\nQur’aan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nThis is a wonderful thing for such a young person (11 years old) living in a non-Muslim\ncountry and deviant society to accomplish. The fact that she has not given her name is a\nsign of sincerity, in sha Allaah. I think that this should only be announced for the\npurposes of encouraging others to do the same. The affair should be limited to a small\ngathering where some relatives or friends invite a few of the girl’s friends, tell\nthem of her achievement in completing the Qur’aan in order to encourage them - not to\nshow off or boast - and some of the mothers say a few words about the greatness of the\nQur’aan, the importance of reading it and how the Muslim should treat the\nQur’aan. Or this girl could invite her friends to a meal to mark the occasion and\ngive thanks for this blessing. There is nothing wrong with such activities, as long as one\nis careful not to let it turn into a celebration. \nIt is clear from the above that celebrating a person’s completion of reciting or\nmemorizing the Qur’aan, inviting people and offering food, is an action in which\nthere is a risk of two fitnahs (temptations): \n(1) that it might be an occasion for showing off and boasting, and \n(2) that it may constitute bid’ah, if people believe that such celebrations are part\nof the religion and must be held every time a person completes the reading of the\nQur’aan. The first danger may be avoided by striving within oneself to be sincere\ntowards Allaah, and the second by restricting the invitees to a small number of family and\nfriends. \nWe should not hold such gatherings regularly, lest people think it is a part of the Sunnah\nI ask Allaah to increase His blessings upon you and to give you the strength to memorize\nQur’aan and Sincerity in speech and deeds.",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islam, completing the recitation of the Qur'an is a commendable act and is often celebrated in various cultural contexts. However, the way this celebration is approached can differ among scholars and communities.\n\nFrom a religious standpoint, there is no specific hadith or directive from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that prescribes a formal celebration for completing the Qur'an. However, making du’a (supplication), giving thanks to Allah, and sharing the joy of completing the Qur'an with family or friends can be seen as positive acts.\n\nSome communities hold gatherings for recitation and celebration upon completing the Qur'an, which can serve as a way to encourage others to engage with the Qur'an. As long as the celebration does not include anything contrary to Islamic principles (such as inappropriate conduct or neglecting other religious obligations), it can be viewed positively.\n\nUltimately, the focus should be on the spiritual benefits of the Qur'an and its implementation in life, rather than merely the act of completion. A scholar or local imam may provide guidance tailored to individual or community practices in this regard."

        "question": "Abrogation of the verse ordering the confinement of an adulteress in a \r\nhouse",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.\nAllah says: \"If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four (reliable) \nwitnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until \ndeath do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way.\" [al-Nisa’ 4:15]\nIbn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer (explanation) of this aayah:\n\"At the beginning of Islam, the ruling concerning a woman who was proven guilty of adultery \nwas that she was to be detained in a house and not allowed to come out until she died. So the \nphrase ‘If any of your women are guilty of lewdness’ refers to adultery. ‘Take the evidence of \nfour (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to \nhouses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way’ - the ‘other way’ \nthat Allah made for them was the abrogation of this. Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with \nhim, said: ‘This was the ruling until Allah revealed Surat al-Nur, then this punishment was \nabrogated and replaced with whipping or stoning.’ Something similar was reported from \n‘Ikrimah, Sa‘id ibn Jubayr, al-Hasan, ‘Ataa’ al-Khurasani, Abu Saalih, Qutaadah, Zayd ibn \nAslam and al-Dahhak, stating that this is abrogated, and this is agreed upon. Imam Ahmad said: \n‘Muhammad ibn Ja‘far told us that Sa‘id told us from Qutaadah from al-Hasan from Hattaan \nibn ‘Abdullah al-Raqaashi from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit who said: Whenever the wahy \n(revelation) descended upon the Messenger of Allah \n (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), it affected him, the stress showed on \nhim and his face would change. Allah sent a revelation to him one day, and when it was over, he \nsaid: \" Listen to me, Allah has made another way for them. (When) a married man (commits \nadultery) with a married woman, and an unmarried man with an unmarried woman, then in the \ncase of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to \ndeath), and in the case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile \nfor one year.\"’ It was reported by Muslim and other narrators of Sunan via Qutaadah from \nal-Hasan from al-Hattan from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit from the Prophet \n (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) with the wording: \n‘Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those \n(women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should \nreceive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male \ncommitting adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be \nstoned to death.’ Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth.\" \nAl-Qurtubi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah:\n\"This [confinement] was the first punishment for adultery, at the beginning of Islam. Ibn \n‘Abbas and al-Hasan said: Ibn Zayd added: They would not be allowed to marry, until they \ndied, as a punishment for them when they asked to marry someone else. This ruling applied for \na while, then the Prophet \n (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said, according to the hadeeth narrated by ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit: \n\"Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those \n(women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should \nreceive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male \ncommitting adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be \nstoned to death.\" Some of the scholars said: the idea of punishment and shame was still there \nwith the lashing, because there is no contradiction, and they are applied to one person. As for \nconfinement, this is abrogated, by the consensus of the scholars. And Allah knows best. \nTo complete the benefit of what has been said, it is appropriate to learn the tafseer of the next \naayah in Surat al-Nisaa’:\n\"If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, \nleave them alone; for Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful.\" [al-Nisaa’ 4:16]\nIbn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer of this aayah:\n\"‘If two men among you are guilty of lewdness’ means two who commit an immoral act, so \nthey should be punished. Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Sa‘eed ibn Jubayr and \nothers said: i.e., by putting them to public shame and hitting them with shoes. This was the \nruling until Allah abrogated it and replaced it with lashing and stoning. ‘Ikrimah, ‘Ataa’, \nal-Hasan and ‘Abdullah ibn Katheer said: ‘This was revealed concerning a man and a woman \nwho commit adultery. The phrase ‘if they repent and amend’ means if they give up what they \nwere doing and mend their ways. ‘Leave them alone’ means not to keep rebuking them with \nugly words after that, because the one who has repented from his sin is like one who never \nsinned at all. ‘Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful’ - it was proven in the two Saheehs: ‘If the \nslave woman of one of you commits adultery, apply the punishment of lashing, and do not \nblame her (after that)’ - i.e., do not blame her for what she did after the punishment has been \ngiven, because the punishment is an expiation for her deed.’\"",
        "predicted_answer": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the concept of abrogation (naskh) refers to the invalidation of a previous ruling by a subsequent one. The verse related to confinement of an adulteress is often associated with Surah An-Nisa (4:15), which mentions that for women guilty of lewdness, the prescribed punishment is confinement to their houses until death or until Allah brings about for them a way (as in a new ruling or change in circumstance).\n\nOver time, the interpretations and application of this verse have evolved, particularly with the advent of established judicial practices and the development of the penalties for zina (fornication or adultery). The general view among scholars is that while this verse is historically significant, its application has been superseded by more structured legal discussions that address the nature of hudud (fixed punishments) and the requirements for evidence, such as witness testimony, in cases of adultery.\n\nIt's important to note that differing opinions exist among classical and contemporary scholars regarding the concept of abrogation and the precise understanding of these texts. Thus, interpretations can vary significantly based on scholarly method and the context of the discussion. For many Muslim communities, the punishment for adultery is typically addressed through established legal frameworks that combine both spiritual and community-based considerations.\n\nFor any specific scholarly or theological positions, it is always advisable to refer to recognized scholars or reliable sources in Islamic jurisprudence."

        "predicted_answer": "As an AI language model, I can provide information on perspectives related to this topic, but it’s important to clarify that interpretations and views on religious texts can vary widely.\n\nIn Islamic tradition, the Qur'an is considered the literal word of God (Allah) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Many Muslims believe that the Qur'an is timeless and its teachings remain relevant regardless of archaeological findings or historical interpretations.\n\nWhen engaging with archaeological findings in relation to the Qur'an, there are several approaches:\n\n1. **Complementary View**: Some scholars argue that archaeology can complement the Qur'anic narrative. They suggest that archaeological discoveries can provide context and enrich the understanding of the historical and cultural background of the periods discussed in the Qur'an.\n\n2. **Challenges and Critiques**: Others may use archaeology to present challenges to certain interpretations of the Qur'an, particularly concerning historical events or figures mentioned in the text. However, Muslim scholars often respond to these critiques by highlighting the necessity of understanding the Qur'an as a religious and moral guide rather than just a historical document.\n\n3. **Independence of Faith**: Many Muslims hold that faith in the Qur'an does not hinge on archaeological evidence. Believers may regard the Qur'an as divine revelation that transcends time and human understanding, and thus, archaeological findings may not necessarily dispute its teachings.\n\n4. **Interpretation of Text**: The interpretation of both archaeological evidence and religious texts can be subjective. Scholars within Islam engage in ijtihad (independent reasoning) to interpret texts and reconcile apparent discrepancies between the Qur'an and historical findings.\n\nIn discussions about any religious texts or beliefs, especially in matters as sensitive as one's faith, it's crucial to approach the subject with respect and open-mindedness. Dialogue between faith and archaeology can deepen understanding but should be conducted thoughtfully."
